F. Thurman made severalreferences to the fact that Atisha Dipamkara Shrijnana (982–1054), the LordMaster and one of the Three Most Gracious Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhistreligion and legend, actually lived for a number of years in Java beforereturning to Tibet to revitalize the teaching there and overcome a period ofspiritual stagnation at the hands of secular rulers and misinformed or maliciousteachers.There is some controversy over the allegation that Atisha spent time in Java,however, and this is an example of the type of historical ambiguity we willencounter from time to time in this study of Tantra in Asia. Until recently,most historians were of the opinion that Atisha never made it as far as Java,but studied in Sumatra at the feet of a Buddhist sage in the capital of thekingdom of Survarnadvipa, most likely today's city of Palembang. Sumatra isanother large island in what is now the Indonesian archipelago, but that isculturally and linguistically rather distinct from Java. Recent scholarship,however, tends to accept that the kingdom where Atisha lived during his sojournin Indonesia was in the region of Kalasa, an ancient capital of Survarnadvipa,which itself may have comprised all of Sumatra, parts of Java, and parts ofother islands in the archipelago. There is a temple called Candi Kalasa in theSultanate of Yogyakarta, and an inscription linking it to the worship of theGoddess Tara. This—along with other textual and archaeological evidence—tends tosupport a Javanese locus for Atisha's instruction and initiation.2This may seem like nit-picking, but since no Indonesian would mistake a Javanesefor a Sumatran, it is worthwhile to point this out. Thurman makes that statementconcerning Atisha's stay in Java several times in his excellent introduction toTibetan Buddhism.3 Moreover, while he rightfully mentions Atisha's crucial rolein the renaissance of Tibetan Buddhism in the 11th century CE, he does not gointo any detail about Atisha's Indonesian master nor, indeed, does Thurmanassign any serious importance to Atisha's twelve-year sojourn in that country.4It was Atisha's intensive period of meditation and study in Java that enabledhim to bring not only the genuine teachings of Tantric Buddhism back toTibet—including the seven-step meditation practice known as Tong Len—but alsothe worship of the Green Goddess, Tara.I point this out because of the importance of the Tibet-Indonesia nexus to ourstory. Indonesia is well-known as the fourth-largest country in the world, andthe world's most populous Muslim nation, with more than 200 million inhabitantsliving on perhaps 2000 of the country's more than 17,000 islands. It isnotorious due to the famous Bali bombings of October 12, 2002, and as theheadquarters of Jemaah Islamiyyah, a radical organization and known terroristoperation with ties to Al-Qaeda. It is also famous as the country where a futureAmerican president—Barack Obama—spent four years of his life as a child. Indeed,in 1982, the present Dalai Lama visited Indonesia to consecrate the Buddhistshrine of Borobudur, thereby firmly putting his stamp to the idea that thismagnificent ninth-century CE monument is representative of the influence ofVajrayana, or Tibetan Tantric, Buddhism.Yet, with all of this publicity in the world press, most foreigners are unawareof the role that Tantric Hinduism and Tantric Buddhism (and, perhaps, “Tantric”Sufism) have played in Indonesia, particularly in Java. And they continue toplay this role, albeit in an esoteric and very quiet manner when compared totheir Tantric counterparts in India and Tibet.Thus, what we will do in the pages that follow is uncover layers of Tantricritual and belief in this romantic and exotic land. We will gradually come tothe realization that a form of Tantra (perhaps several forms) has been practicedthere for centuries, and that its Tantric institutions are at least as robustas—if less well-known than—their Indian counterparts. Hopefully, in the process,we will discover a bit of the truth about Tantra itself and scrape away theaccumulated detritus of wellmeaning but badly-informed “neo-Tantra”practitioners in the West, continuing that journey with an examination of thisesoteric practice's most blatant and informative evidence: Indonesia's Tantrictemples.PETER LEVENDAYogyakarta 20102 Roy E. Jordaan, “Tara and Nyai Lara Kidul: images of the divine feminine inJava,” Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 56, No. 2, October 1997, pp. 285–312.3 Robert Thurman, Essential Tibetan Buddhism (New York: Castle Books, 1995), p.3, 11. For a more in-depth treatment of this critical subject, see John R.Newman, “A Brief History of the Kalachakra” in The Wheel of Time: the Kalachakrain Context, Geshe Lhundub Sopa, Roger Jackson, and John Newman, with a Forewordby HH The Dalai Lama (Madison, WI: Deer Park Books, 1985), pp. 51–90. HereNewman makes the case that Atisha's teacher was the same man as Naropa'steacher, Kalachakrapada the Elder, and that he lived in Java in the 11th centuryCE. The implication is that the Kalachakra initiations originated—at least inthe relatively modern era—in Java.4 Twelve years is assumed to be a symbolic period of time, as it is used torefer to the study of many other Buddhist sages and monks. It could as easilyhave been a few years or a few decades, but in this case twelve years may beclose to the mark."},{"pageContent":"A NOTE ON LANGUAGESThe sources consulted for this work utilize Sanskrit, Pali, Hindi, Arabic,Chinese, Japanese, Bahasa Indonesia, and Bahasa Malaysia (the former BahasaMelayu), as well as Javanese terms. In the case of Bahasa Indonesia and BahasaMalaysia, there are no diacritical marks to consider, since these languages usethe Roman alphabet (albeit with some pronunciation differences). With the otherlanguages, however, methods of transliterating foreign alphabets or charactersvary from text to text, and from scholar to scholar.In order not to overburden the reader, I have reduced as much as possible theuse of diacritical marks and printed each foreign term in a way as close aspossible to its pronunciation. In Chinese, for instance, the Pinyin system fortransliterating Mandarin has become quite familiar to Western readers over theyears (Beijing instead of Peking), so I will use that system when it comes toChinese. When it comes to Sanskrit, however, I had to make a decision—one thatmay not be comfortable for many scholars, but that will make the text morereadable. Śiva and Śakti, for instance, will be printed phonetically as Shivaand Shakti. A term like jñāna will appear simply as jnana.Similarly, for Arabic words I will use transliterations that most closelyapproximate general usage, understanding that some sounds do not travel wellfrom the Arabic alphabet to the Roman.Unless otherwise noted, all translations of foreign language texts are my own,so I am responsible for any errors that may appear."},{"pageContent":"SECTION ITHE TANTRIC CONTEXT"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1AN INTRODUCTION TO TANTRAAlmost every study of Tantrism begins by apologizing.Robert L. Brown5The reason for the apology is simple, and points us in the direction we want togo: there is no consensus among scholars as to what the term Tantra actuallyrefers. It is, in fact, a Western concept (as is Hinduism). Tantra is the resultof more than a century of colonial scholars visiting India and seeing adiscrepancy between normative Vedic Brahmanism and some shocking antinomianpractices that we, in the West, would probably term “magic,” or that equallyslippery concept, “shamanism.” Tantra became identified as a separate philosophyand was divided into Hindu Tantra and Buddhist Tantra—which is a misleadingdistinction that will get us nowhere in the end and which, logically, makes nosense if Tantra really is a separate philosophy.In fact, according to André Padoux, one of the leading scholars of Tantra in theworld today:Neither in traditional India nor in Sanskrit texts is there a term for Tantrism;no description or definition of such a category is to be found anywhere. We knowalso that, more often than not, Tantric texts are not called Tantra.6Part of the problem lies in the West's reliance on the written word—ontextuality and on textual analysis. Scholars have discovered books calledTantras that were written by Buddhists and still others that were written byHindus—i.e., non-Buddhist Indians. This seems to indicate that there is somefundamental difference between the two practices. In fact, on the level oftheory, there are differences, even important ones. On the level of practice,however, they are much the same. And Tantra is all about the practice.And this is the point I want to make, and the direction in which we want to go.There are two main religious currents that gave rise to the phenomenon known asTantra: Hinduism and Buddhism. Hinduism is a catch-all term for what may betterbe described as “Hindu religious traditions,” for there is no single religiousfaith that can be described as Hinduism. Rather Hinduism is a wide variety ofreligious and spiritual experiences encountered on the sub-continent of India.While we will continue to use the term Hinduism for the sake of convenience, itshould be noted that we do that primarily to distinguish the indigenousreligions of India from Buddhism, which came much later.There are scriptures that are considered Hindu; these include the Vedas, theUpanishads, and the Puranas, among others. There are also the famous epic poemsthe Ramayana and the Mahabharata that are just as important to the Indian peopleand that also were introduced into Indonesia at an early date. These epics wereembraced by the population there as well, finding one manifestation in thefamous wayang kulit, the shadow puppet theater that has tremendous cultural,social, and religious importance for the Javanese.It was Vedic Hinduism that provided the rigid social structure known as thecaste system. No one really knows how old the Vedas are, but they can bereliably dated to sometime in the second millennium BCE. Written in Sanskrit,they may be considered the core texts of Indian culture and faith. They containinstructions for the various rituals that should be performed, but they alsocontain medical knowledge, astronomical lore, and—in the case of the AtharvaVeda, the so-called “fourth Veda”—occult texts as well.One of the primary rituals of Vedic Hinduism is the Homa, or fire ritual,sometimes also called the Agnihotra (agni is the Sanskrit word for “fire”; hotrameans “healing”) when used to refer to the twice-daily fire offering, the mostbasic form of the ritual. This rite is reminiscent of the fire rituals of theZoroastrians and has many variations, depending on their purpose. It isconsidered quite ancient and probably pre-Vedic. Basically, a fire is created ina special device using consecrated material—often ghee (clarified butter), aswell as milk, honey, or other substances specific to the purpose. These form thebasis of offerings, which are accompanied by the relevant prayers andmeditations. The device or fire pit is often in the shape of an upside-downpyramid that allows the fire to burn quite hot. The cardinal directionpractitioners face during the Homa ritual is of great importance, as are thenumber of Brahmins who are performing it and the purpose for which it is beingperformed.7 Even in the relatively staid Vedic practice of the Homa ritual, thesymbolism is often interpreted quite deliberately in a sexual manner, with thefire representing the yoni, or sexual organs, of a goddess.8 The Homa ritualeventually found a place in Tibetan Buddhist practice, as well as in JapaneseShingon ritual. Its practice is amply represented in the Tantric temples ofJava.Buddhism, of course, owes its origins to its founder, Siddhartha Gautama, who itis said was a prince living in northeast India sometime in the sixth centuryBCE, or perhaps a little later. While not much is known definitively about hislife, most sources agree that he was born to a family of privilege and he isusually referred to as Prince Siddhartha. At the age of twenty-nine, he decidedto end his life of ease and isolation from the rest of the world and venturedoutside the palace walls to see real human existence as it is.According to canonical Buddhist sources, he was astonished and saddened by thesights of sickness, death, and misery that were everywhere in the world, and hedevoted himself to finding a solution to the human condition. After years offalse starts with a variety of gurus and ascetic disciplines, he chose silentmeditation. During the course of this practice, he realized that the root of allsuffering was attachment: to things, to people, to ideas, and particularly tothe concept of an individual self. The solution, he claimed, was non-attachment,even to the self, even to the gods. Because humans were attached to objects thatgave them no real joy or happiness, he came to the conclusion that these objectsdid not really exist in any kind of absolute sense, but were illusions andimpediments to spiritual liberation—here understood as freedom from the endlesscycle of birth and rebirth. By grasping after things, we remain unsettledspiritually. In fact, by assuming that we have a soul at all (or an ego, a self,a personality), we identify with the ephemeral, with a string of events that webelieve constitute individuality.9 By withdrawing from the world—or, at least,from lusting after the things of the world—we begin to find a well of innerpeace.While accepting that we are making a much longer and more detailed story tooshort, we can say that the Buddha attained an exalted state ofconsciousness—illumination, or enlightenment, the ultimate stage—and thenproceeded to teach others how to reach the same stage. The methods utilized byBuddhists involve intellectual study, meditation, and a kind of psycho-spiritualpractice of negation in order to reach a perfect state of non-attachment. Amongthe Eastern Orthodox monks of the Christian world, this is sometimes calledapophatism. It is a way of knowing God by saying what God is not, as opposed towhat God is, since God is essentially unknowable. To a Buddhist, however, thereis no God at all. God is perhaps the supreme illusion, the last obstacle on theway to perfect illumination. The end result of Buddhist apophatism is therealization that there is only a kind of absolute, albeit blissful, Void.Buddhism is non-dualist for obvious reasons.10 In Buddhism, there is no “this”and “that.” The multiplicity of things perceived is an illusion, a kind of magictheater that distracts the spirit from true understanding. The goal of Buddhistpractice is to achieve perfect Unity, a state where there is no “I” and “you”and “it,” but only pure essential Being. However, one cannot arrive at thatdestination overnight, or merely by thinking very hard about it. It requires aprogram of phased initiations involving strenuous forms of meditation and ritualpractice, and these vary from school to school, from sect to sect.The oldest form of Buddhism, known as Theravada, is found today primarily inSoutheast Asia, especially in Thailand and Sri Lanka. Mahayana Buddhism, a laterform, is discovered in northern Asia: in China, Japan, and Korea. In Tibet,however, there is a third form, known as Vajrayana Buddhism, that is virtuallyindistinguishable from Tantra, but that has roots in Mahayana Buddhism as wellas in the indigenous religion of Tibet.Theravadin Buddhist scriptures include the Pali Canon, the oldest known Buddhistwritings, which contain a variety of what are known as suttas (or, in non-Paliusage, the more familiar sutras). These include instructions for Buddhistdisciples and discipline, as well as deeper articulations of Buddhist thought.One of the most famous of these is the Dhammapada, which has undergone severaltranslations (including that by Max Muller in his Sacred Books of the Eastseries), and the Brahmajala Sutta.Mahayana scriptures are of later creation, but are based—to a certain extent—onsome of the earlier Theravadin suttas. The origins of Mahayana Buddhism are indispute, but the earliest Mahayana writings date from about the first century CEand are largely known from their Chinese- and Tibetan-language originals. WhileTheravada is thought to represent a pure form of Buddhism, Mahayana is sometimescharacterized as a “popular” form of the same belief system. Perhaps the mostfamous of the Mahayana scriptures are the Diamond Sutra, the Lotus Sutra, andthe Heart Sutra, the latter of which is only sixteen sentences long and containsthe famous phrase: “Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form.”In India, Buddhism reached an early crescendo, but had lost a great deal of itsinfluence by the beginning of the medieval period. The Hindu religioustradition, however, continued and became stronger. As India moved out of itsBuddhist period, Tantra grew quickly and may be said to have come into its own.As mentioned, there are actual texts known as Tantras. These are largely in theform of dialogues between the Indian God Shiva and his female consort. Thisconsort can be identified variously as Parvati, as Uma, as any one of dozens ofother goddesses, or simply as Shakti. In any case, the female consort representspower: spiritual power. The whole focus of Tantra is on this power, which isbelieved to pervade every aspect, every particle, of the universe. By aligningoneself with this power, one can also effect material ends. For that reason,Tantra has had a following among those who find the traditional methods ofworship, the caste system, and the Brahminical hierarchies stifling orinefficient, and among those who wish to have direct experience of the divine.The motivation for this may be purely spiritual—enlightenment or nirvana— or itmay be purely mundane—for instance, obtaining a lover, wealth, or health. Or itmay be both at the same time. In this, Tantra is virtually identical to Westernforms of ceremonial magic and, indeed, the two systems have a great deal incommon.Tantra cuts across denominational boundaries, as does Western magic. One can beJewish, Catholic, or Protestant—or anything else, for that matter—and still be amagician in the Western sense. Magic is a practice, as opposed to a coherent,carefully articulated philosophy, although it is predicated on a certain view ofthe interconnectedness of the universe, the doctrine of correspondences, and theidea that knowledge of the inner workings of the universe can give a person theability to effect change at a distance using methods that seem to defy normalconcepts of cause and effect. It is also based on a belief that you can become“as a god.” Indeed, some magicians are drawn to the practice because theybelieve it enables them to commune directly with the divine, without theencumbrance of a high priest or other middle-man. It is a practice that isavailable to anyone, from clergyman to commoner, as is Tantra. And it is athreat to the status quo—politically, religiously, and culturally.As is Tantra.Like magic, Tantra is a technology. It is a means to an end. It involves themanipulation of consciousness through ritual, the end result of which has beenpre-determined by the practitioner. And, as a technology, it makes use of allavailable materials. The tools of Tantra are the tools of consciousness—the fivesenses. Virtually anything can be employed in a Tantric ritual, from food andwine, to drugs, icons, incense, music, and sex, but always with a concentrationon the physical body itself. While many of the texts called Tantras are deeplyprofound in their explanations of how reality is structured—using either dualistor non-dualist approaches—the attraction of Tantra is found mainly in thepractices that permit devotees access to altered states of consciousness and theelevation of the mind to spiritual realms—i.e., to illumination.Without these practices, the texts themselves are virtually useless. The textsare methodologies that are meant to be applied, instruction manuals intended tobe used. They are recipe books, in a sense—and imagine how useless a recipe bookis in the hands of someone who does not cook. This is the distinction that canbe made between normative scripture-based religions like Christianity andTantra. In Christianity, the Bible is the ultimate spiritual authority and, formany fundamentalist Christians, the only authority. Reading the Bible andpreaching the Bible constitutes the core experience. (Conversely, a mystic mayobserve that those who can, do; while those who can't, preach.) A Tantrika (apractitioner of Tantra) may well ask: How can we use the Bible to attain alteredstates of consciousness? How can we use the Bible to come directly into thepresence of the divine? Is the Bible a manual of operation? Does the Bible teachhow to breathe, how to chant, how to visualize?That the Bible does none of these things is obvious. However, there were groupsof believers—both Jewish and Christian—who analyzed Biblical writings to derivephysical and spiritual practices from them. These were the Kabbalists, themystics, the magicians. Their role models were Ezekiel, Moses, and Solomon (and,for Christian Kabbalists, the Book of Revelation). They wrote their own texts,their own “Tantras”: the grimoires. In Asia, the Tantrikas based their ritualsyntax on their own spiritual culture—the Vedas, the Ramayana, theMahabharata—and eventually developed the wider and more specific field of textsknown as the Agamas, the Samhitas, and of course the Tantras themselves. Thus,there would be greater communication between a medieval European magician orsorcerer and a medieval Indian Tantrika than there would be between a Catholicpriest and a Brahmin. Indeed, there are respected scholars in this field whohave promoted the idea that there was actual contact between Kabbalists andTantrikas centuries ago, with a resulting cross-fertilization of ideas andpractices. We will come to that later.It is my intention to demonstrate that the practice of Tantra, in some sense,takes place outside the philosophical or theological structures that have beenimposed on it, either by adherents of the different religions through whichTantric texts have appeared over the centuries (most notably Indian religions,but also Chinese and Japanese faith systems) or by foreign observers such asEnglish colonial scholars and commentators. Indonesia is a useful laboratory forthis investigation, because many of the religions of the world have had animpact on its culture—especially in Java—from the Hindu religious traditions andBuddhism (in all its forms) to Islam and Christianity, and even including suchmodern-day spiritual movements as Theosophy. With all that, however, certainindigenous practices and beliefs have survived the imposition of foreign dogmasand faith systems ever since the beginning of Java's recorded history. From thisperspective, Javanese mysticism has as much to say to us about how Tantra notonly survives but thrives in a multireligious, multi-cultural environment asdoes any study of Tantra in its indigenous land, the Indian sub-continent.In order to accomplish this, we will look first at the history of Tantra andeven offer some ideas concerning its origins. Using this as a roadmap, we willthen approach Javanese mysticism—kejawen and kebatinan— and then Java's Tantrictemples themselves to understand why they were designed the way they were. Wewill look at present-day Javanese practices that bear striking similarity toTantra as traditionally understood. Then we will use what we have learned fromthis fusion of theory and practice, text and ritual, to take a look at modernWestern ideas of Tantra, as enshrined in the rituals and concepts of modernesoteric and hermetic societies, Western and Eastern.During this investigation, we will reveal some of the most closely guardedsecrets of these groups, secrets that are well-known to privileged spiritualelites and suspected by interested non-initiates. We will see how Europeanalchemy was influenced by concepts familiar to the Tantrikas, and even howChinese alchemy can help us understand both the European and Indian versions. Wewill even find ourselves startled to learn that Jewish mysticism also has agreat deal in common with Indian Tantra, and that some aspects of Tantra—likethe idea of Kundalini—may have had their origins in the ancient Near East.TANTRA AS ACTIONThe ideological aspect of the Tantric vision is the cosmos as permeated by power(or powers), a vision wherein energy (sakti) is both cosmic and human and wheremicrocosm and macrocosm correspond and interact.11In the West, a common distinction is made between two forms of esotericspirituality: magic and mysticism. While this distinction is purely arbitraryand not applicable in any kind of absolute sense, it provides a helpfulintroduction to the question of where Tantra should be located within thegeneral field of religion or the more specific area of esotericism.This distinction also asks us to think about two forms of religious experienceand expression: the exoteric and the esoteric. When most people profess areligious affiliation, they are referring to an exoteric form ofspirituality—for example, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or Buddhism. These areoften scriptural denominations with religious “specialists” or “professionals”like priests, rabbis, imams, or monks. The average person is conscious of theirfaith in rudimentary ways, in terms of what behavior is proper and acceptable,or what duties their religion prescribes. There is often a specific place usedfor the performance of religious obligations and rituals—a mosque, synagogue,church, or other physical location. In addition to all of this, there is also areligious calendar with days or periods that are more sacred or meaningful thanothers. Thus, there is sacred time, sacred space, and a text—whether written ororal—embodying the precepts of the faith as well as religious professionals whointerpret the scriptures, perform rituals, lead prayers, and whose opinion inmatters of law and practice is considered authoritative.12Esotericism, on the other hand, is intensely individualistic. Where exotericspirituality often relies on the society of like-minded individuals who aremembers of the same faith and thus can be expected to share identical beliefsand loyalties, esoteric spirituality is conscious of being apart from society atlarge and estranged in some essential ways from the base or root religion, theexoteric form. Thus, there are esoteric forms of most of the world's majorreligions. Kabbalah, for example, can be considered an esoteric form of itsexoteric root, Judaism. Sufism can be considered an esoteric form of Islam.Indeed, Islam recognizes two different manifestations of its faith: lahir, theexoteric form, and batin, the inner or esoteric form.Esotericism finds its expression in non-canonical texts, in beliefs that arerefinements of or extrapolations on the base or root belief of a faith, and mostespecially in acts that would be considered questionable by orthodox believers,if not actually forbidden or tabu. Esoteric practices may take place accordingto different structures of sacred space and time, and they may be under thecontrol of an alternate hierarchy of specialists. Tantra is, itself, an esotericpractice and may represent one of the oldest forms of esotericism in the world,if we are to accept a pre-Aryan origin for some of its most cherishedcharacteristics, like worship of a divine Mother and the concept of sacredsexuality.As mentioned above, scholars are divided as to the definition of Tantra, thedate of its first emergence as a coherent practice, and even whether Tantraarose out of Buddhism first and then became adapted to Hinduism, or the otherway around. While these are all compelling questions, and the answers would domuch to illuminate the history of the sub-continent, they need not concern usmuch at this point. We will come back to them again and again over the course ofthis work, and maybe we will obtain a clearer picture as we go along.Tantra is primarily a practice, and can be considered an esoteric, rather thanan exoteric, one. It is a means of attaining altered states of consciousness,spiritual illumination, and even occult powers and abilities known as siddhas.It involves the identification of the human practitioner with a god or goddessand the partner with a deity of the opposite gender—but that comes later. In thebeginning, a Tantrika—that is, a person who belongs to any one of a variety ofTantric sects or who has received initiation from a Tantric guru—spends a greatdeal of time in meditation, doing physical exercises that are familiar to usfrom yoga (pranayama, asana, etc.), and performing a range of puja, orceremonies and rituals. Most authorities agree that mantras (specific words ofpower, recited over and over), mudras (ritual gestures), and yantras (mysticaldiagrams) are main features of Tantric ritual. Because the practice of Tantratakes place within a specific context—usually Buddhist or Hindu—the prayers,meditations, mandalas, and rituals will all be developed within that context,and based on that particular philosophy. The end result, however, will be thesame.The two main philosophies found in any scholarly description of Tantra aredualism and non-dualism. Non-duality, or advaita, is the basic philosophyassociated with Buddhism. A Buddhist believes there is no real polarization ofmale/female, god/human, reality/unreality, but that these concepts and theirdivisions are all illusions and the source of sorrow and discontent. A dualistbelief, on the other hand, is one in which the “polarities” of creation areacknowledged and celebrated. To a Tantrika, both of these philosophies are, in asense, true.A Tantrika understands that the duality being employed in Tantric ritual is ameans to an end: union with the Divine. In other words, we might say that aTantrika uses dualist ritual to attain a non-dualist end.Buddhists can be accused of the same thing. A visit to any Buddhist temple willintroduce the seeker to a variety of statues of different aspects of the Buddhaand even, depending on the type of Buddhism and the location of the temple,various other deities specific to that location. For instance, a ChineseBuddhist temple will be filled with statues, not only of the Buddha, but ofother Chinese saints and even of the famous goddess Guan Yin, the Goddess ofMercy who is identified with the Indian god Avalokitesvara (of whom it is saidthe Dalai Lama is an incarnation). All of this certainly seems like a lot ofunnecessary duplication in a belief system that emphasizes non-duality, but itis understood that people in general require these images in order to approachthe esoteric, inner truth of Buddhism that all is illusion and that the onlyrefuge we can take is in the Buddha. From that point of view, a scholar mayinterpret these religious trappings as mnemonic devices or even as a kind ofmemory palace, enabling Buddhists to navigate the terrain of their own cultureand consciousness in a somewhat orderly way in order to become divested of theuseless accoutrements of conventional religion.Yet, as we shall see, the entire field of Tibetan Buddhism (as an example) isbasically Tantric Buddhism, the form known as Vajrayana Buddhism. The famousTibetan Tantric texts, like the Kalachakra Tantra, are veritable treasure trovesof Tantric information and instructions for practice. There is no way tounderstand this apparent dichotomy between the non-dualist, basicallyanti-theist approach of orthodox Buddhism on the one hand and these arcane andcomplex ritual procedures on the other, unless we accept that Tantra is atechnology, a tool for reaching the state of consciousness necessary fordirectly experiencing the bliss of advaita, and that the philosophies that seemembedded in Tantric texts refer more to the method itself than to an overarchingphilosophy of life or religion. Even this statement, however, can be hotlycontested by specialists in the field who place more emphasis on thephilosophy—what I choose to call the theory—of Buddhism than on the practice.With the type of Tantra we encounter in a non-Buddhist context, however, we areon familiar ground. The emphasis on the dualities of male/female, god/goddess,etc. are clear and unequivocal; but the union of these opposites is just asclear and important. To a Tantrika, everything in creation is basically sexual;everything we see, touch, feel is the result of a cosmic sexual reproductiveact. The human act of sexual intercourse is a reenactment of the original,divine intercourse. By becoming totally aware and spiritually prepared prior toconsummating a sex act with a similarly trained partner, one is able toexperience that moment when all existence came into being or, perhaps, themoment a split second before. This suggests that, in common with many forms ofmysticism, the transcendence of the divine may be experienced in its immanencein all things—that the route from the microcosm to the macrocosm is through theone act that is common to both, the sex act. This act is a tangential pointbetween the two forms of consciousness.The challenge, especially for a Westerner with a great deal of baggage when itcomes to sexuality, is in reducing the prurient aspect of Tantra as much aspossible. Tantra does indeed sacralize sexuality, but the reverse is also true.Sexuality itself becomes a sacred act that should not be abused for the sake ofimmediate gratification. Instead, sexuality sacralizes the universe. Tantra is away of understanding a sacred process. In this way, Tantra has been used tounderstand chemical as well as biological reactions and to formulatepsychological theories. It can even be applied to Western alchemy and Jewishmysticism.The tremendously colorful and complex images of gods and goddesses in ecstaticembrace that we encounter in Tantra are not meant to titillate, but to instruct.But how do we use blatantly sexual images—a kind of religious pornography—toinstruct us in spiritual matters?THE BODY AS TANTRIC LABORATORYI believe that precisely at the bottom of all our mystical states there are bodytechniques which we have not studied, but which were studied in China and India,even in very remote periods. I think that there are necessarily biological meansof entering into “communication with God.”13The core tension of Indian spiritual practice—and, indeed, of many religionsaround the world—is found in the ambiguous relationship between the spirit andthe body, or between the invisible and the visible. In many religious cultures,the body is conceived as a source of sorrow, of attachment to physical desires,of ignoble yearnings, of pollution. It is a locus of danger that needs to becontrolled by the mind of its owner. The desires of the body are virtually allexpressions of what are considered negative forces—lust, hunger, thirst, sleep,etc.—as if the body were a Sherman tank with a pacifist as its driver. The tankis all metal and armor and munitions, with a giant cannon, mindless but lethal;in the hands of a trained soldier, it will cause terrible damage to thecommunity. Thus, there is a need for a pacifist at the controls who will use thetank for other purposes, perhaps to plow the earth for crops. And one can onlybe sure that the people at the controls are pacifists if they are checked on aconstant basis to insure that their purity is intact and to prove that theirhands are where they are supposed to be at all times.The imposition of celibacy by the Roman Catholic Church (a relatively latedevelopment in Church history) is one example of this discomfort with the bodyand the assumption that bodily needs are an obstacle to union with God. Inaddition to celibacy, other controls of the body include fasting (particularlyduring Lent) and prolonged periods of prayer in sometimes uncomfortablepositions. In extreme cases, self-flagellation and other methods are used toemphasize the inherent sinfulness of the human body and the need to dominate itthrough brute force. The French postmodern philosopher Michel Foucault has had agreat deal to say concerning the control of the body by governments, churches,the medical profession, the penal system, and others. We do not need to revisitthose arguments here, except to point out that a Foucaldian interpretation ofour theme—sacred sexuality—would be a welcome addition to this field of study.14The Catholic approach to the body has been to suppress sexual desire as much aspossible, not only among its clergy, but also in its commands to the faithful toavoid all forms of birth control (save the rhythm method) and to engage in sexonly if procreation is possible, thus ruling out not only birth control, butalso forms of sexual expression that do not lead to conception. This is anattitude that has made its way into many other Christian denominations as well.There are strains of Gnosticism in this position: the idea that matter itself isevil, a creation of the Demi-Urge, and that only spirit is good and clean andpure.In the Tantric tradition, however, every effort is made to address this problemrather than simply suppress it. There are two general schools of thoughtconcerning the human body that may be discerned in a review of both Hindu andBuddhist Tantra. The body can be conceived as a vehicle to liberation andenlightenment in both schools, but the utilization of the body is problematic.One approach is to “spiritualize” the body and the sexual act to such an extentthat the body's natural urges are transcended through intensive physical andmental practices, sublimating the sexual urge and transforming it into an engineof spiritual force. This is a form of denial that would be consistent withCatholic ideas, were it not for the active involvement of the Tantrika in thecontemplation of detailed depictions of gods and goddesses in sexual embrace,the study of descriptions of the sexual act that could be construed aslascivious to Western sensibilities, and ritual enactments of sexual liaisonwith spiritual forces.In some forms of Tantra, one is expected to transcend normal physical sexualityby confronting it head-on, albeit symbolically. In other forms, however, wedetect a decidedly “hands-on” approach in which sexuality is considered avehicle for liberation (just as in the former example). There is an importantdifference, however. In these forms, the sex act is made part of an elaborateritual (the most famous—or infamous—of which is the Ritual of the Five Ms, orpancatattva). This practice involves meditation, mantras, yantras, mudras, andspiritual initiation, as well as—or as integral elements of—actual intercourse.While the symbolic aspect is very much part of the ritual and essential to itssuccess, the active participation of sexual partners provides another level ofengagement through full investment of the psycho-biological instruments of two,very human, partners.In fact, it may be a requirement that these acts are carried out, not onlysymbolically, but in actuality.According to authorities on the Vedic fire ritual (the Homa), for instance, weare told that one may perform the Homa symbolically (the Inner Homa, ameditative rite) if there are no “requisite offerings” at hand. However, if theofferings are available, it is not permitted to perform the Inner Homa only; theOuter Homa (i.e., the full ritual) must be performed.15Logically, then, if the offerings are available in the Tantric ritual known asthe pancatattva or pancamakara (the famous “five Ms”), which requires thebreaking of five Vedic tabus—drinking wine (madya), eating meat (mamsa), eatingfish (matsya), eating grain (mudra), and sexual intercourse with a partner whomay not be married to you (maithuna)—then it follows that they should be part ofthe rite, not only in a symbolic sense, but in an actual sense as well. Bear inmind, however, that the “inner” part of the ritual must also be performed andnot only the outer observance.HOW OLD IS TANTRA?Again, we enter the realm of apology. We simply don't know. Some importantTantric texts can be dated reliably to the seventh century ce, but Tantricpractices are certainly much older than that.16 One of the four Vedicscriptures, the Atharva Veda, is sometimes considered a Tantric text because ofits focus on magic and occult powers, which leads some to think that Tantra canbe dated to the Atharva Veda. Unfortunately, however, that is not the case,since scholars are divided as to whether the Atharva Veda represents a scripturethat was composed after the first three Vedas and is therefore relatively late,or if, in fact, the Atharva Veda represents a tradition that is older than allfour! Regardless, however, the Vedas as a group are quite ancient, with someestimates placing their origin sometime in the second millennium BCE. Thewritten Tantras, with their emphasis on the esoteric aspects of Vedic religion,must therefore be considerably newer.Generally speaking, the Vedas represent an entire body of knowledge, fromastronomy to architecture and medicine, and from history to public policy. Therituals associated with the Vedas are performed by a priestly caste, theBrahmins. Vedic society was divided into four basic castes, or varnas, with theBrahmins at the top of the pyramid, followed by the Kshatriyas (the warriors andrulers), the Vaishyas (merchants, traders; Gandhi was a member of this caste),and the Sudras (laborers). Outside the system is the class of Untouchables, theDalits, who number roughly 170 million people in India, or 13 percent of thetotal population—in contrast to the Brahmins, who represent only roughly 5percent. In actuality, there are many sub-castes as well, so we are talkingabout a massive stratification of society that includes 3000 actual castes andabout ten times that number of sub-castes. Since Independence, however, much ofthe caste system has been overhauled so that members of different castes maymarry, for instance, but the plight of many of the lowest castes—and especiallyof the Untouchables—remains a serious problem in India. This is pointed out sothat the reader may better appreciate the role of Tantra in this country ofstrongly divided social roles.The caste of Brahmins is purity-obsessed. Brahmins may not eat food unless ithas been prepared by other Brahmins, for example. They may only marry otherBrahmins. Indeed, no one may even look at a Brahmin (or a fire) while urinatingor defecating. For the Brahmins, the body itself is the vehicle for purity andfor divinity. The care of religion and ritual is their province, their sacredresponsibility. They cannot carry out their duties if they are in a state ofritual impurity. For Brahminical priests, purity of the body is analogous topurity of the soul; in a very real sense, “cleanliness is next to godliness.”Purity is a hallmark of many religious practices around the globe, of course.Ritual purity is important in Judaism, for instance, as well as in Islam. TheQumran sect that gave us the Dead Sea Scrolls was also fanatically interested inquestions of ritual purity. Thus this idea that bodily impurity is an obstacleto full participation in the rites of the community is very old, and relativelywidespread. Yet, the idea of willful transgression of the purity laws is alsoold and widespread, and that is where Tantra comes in.FROM TANTRA TO TANTROID—TRANSCENDENCE THROUGH TRANSGRESSIONFor our purposes, I suggest we occasionally make use of a term that has gainedsome ground in academic circles owing to the difficulty of accurately definingwhat is, and is not, Tantra. This word, “tantroid,” will enable us to discussthis subject in a provisional way without committing ourselves to a narrowinterpretation, especially when we come to discuss Javanese practices inparticular. According to Bruce M. Sullivan, we can characterize a practice astantroid if it has the following three characteristics: fierce goddesses,transgressive sacrality, and identification with a deity.17With some modification, we can apply this scheme to what we will see of Javanesepractices, especially those concerning the temples under review. Goddesses inJava tend to be rather fierce or, at the very least, powerful and unforgiving.(The case of the famous Goddess of the Southern Ocean is one firm example, andwe will discuss her shortly.) In Java, the idea of “transgressive sacrality”applies not only to the Indian perspective on examples of ritual marriage, sexin cemeteries, and sacred prostitution, but also to the Islamic perspective;both cultures consider them equally transgressive. It is the thirdcharacteristic—identification with a deity—that will give us the most problemsin present-day Java, however, since that “deity” should be the God of Islam andidentification with that God is normally understood as heresy or blasphemy. Yet,if we redefine “deity” in this instance as referring to other spiritualidentities—like that of the Sultan of Yogyakarta in his role as husband of theGoddess of the Southern Ocean—then we may be closer to the mark.We will not try to fit Javanese mystical or esoteric practices—those fallingunder our general rubric of “tantroid”—into a pre-formed template, or assumethat what we are calling Javanese Tantrism is perfectly consistent with otherforms of Tantra. The Javanese spiritual experience is unique, but it doesdemonstrate influences from other cultures, as we will see from their sacredarchitecture. In my own personal quest to understand what I call “the technologyof spirituality,” I focus more on the practice than the theory withoutattempting to extrapolate a philosophy or an ideology.By starting from the body and its functions, I realize that I am in danger ofdeveloping a universalist point of view concerning spirituality, but that is adanger I have to accept. We all share the same biology and experience the samebiological functions, at least at the basic level of the five senses and thenervous and reproductive systems. When the body is perceived as an instrument inthe spiritual toolbox, then we are constrained by its constraints. Alteredstates of consciousness may be induced through fasting, meditation, or breathcontrol, and we may interpret these states differently, depending on our cultureand environment. But the states will be altered and these states will be valuedas visions, as communications from spiritual sources, or as evidence of occultpowers. The individuals who voluntarily undergo these rigors are the religiousspecialists of their respective cultures. They may not be the priests orreligious hierarchs necessarily, but they will be revered for their directexperience of the Other. By transgressing the normal functions of the body, theyalso transgress the natural order of the community; they break tabus, they crossover the liminal divide that demarcates safety from danger. To breathenaturally, to eat when hungry, to sleep when tired—these are all naturalfunctions of the human animal and society is arranged around them. To violatethese functions—to control breathing through pranayama, for instance, or tofast, to remain awake for days without sleeping—is to break the body's own tabusystem and, by extension, the tabu system of the community. The idea oftransgression, then, seems to be at the heart of esoteric practice and, inparticular, the practice we call Tantra.There are statements in some Tantric literature that the practices consideredthe most transgressive and scandalous should not be performed, but rather shouldbe interiorized—i.e., meditated upon in symbolic form only and not “acted out.”The problem with this view is that it is not consistent with orthodox Vedicbelief regarding ritual performance, as we have seen. More important, it isvirtually impossible to read some of the more blatant Tantric texts—those with along and distinguished pedigree—and see them as anything other than preciseinstructions for carrying out these rituals in actual form with living partners.While one may make the argument that, on some plane of understanding, tovisualize transgression is the same as acting on that impulse—“committingadultery in the heart”—we may agree that actually committing the transgressionin the mundane world while simultaneously visualizing it is to ensure that thetransgressive act has been performed on all levels of awareness.As Tantric scholar Harunaga Isaacson points out, even in the Buddhist form ofTantra:Having been instructed by the guru what he must do and on what he mustconcentrate, the initiand, uniting with the consort, must mark that moment ofblissful experience that ... offers an at least apparent absence of all duality... This experience is said to occur in the brief interval between the moment inwhich the initiand's bodhicitta, that is his semen, is in the center of themani, that is the glans of the penis, and the moment of emission ...18There are several important points made in the above excerpt. First, actualsexual union occurs, not merely a symbolic version. Second, emission also occurs(rather than the retention or internalization of the ejaculate). Third, oneapproaches advaita—the Buddhist sense of non-duality—at the moment of orgasm.And perhaps a fourth point can be made as well: There is a peculiar power inconcentration. In fact, without concentration—the single-minded focus ofconsciousness—the ritual, or any ritual, cannot succeed. Thus mind and body mustbecome fused around a very specific goal, and in order to reach that state, agreat deal of preparation must be made that includes training the body as wellas the mind.TWILIGHT LANGUAGEAll things are concealed in all.Paracelsus, Coelum PhilosophorumOne of the essential characteristics of esotericism generally, and of thetraditions that come out of Tantra specifically, is the implementation of aspecial language that is used to conceal and reveal secrets simultaneously. Inthe Western esoteric tradition, this is called the Language of the Birds or,more commonly today, the Green Language.19 The enigmatic European alchemistFulcanelli referred to this language as the argotique, a play on the term arsgotique or “Gothic art”—a reference to Gothic architecture, which is widelybelieved to represent an esoteric tradition written in stone.20 To Fulcanelli,this argot was the means by which alchemists and adepts communicated with eachother and selected members of the mundane world who could interpret the symbols.Like a kind of sacred rebus, the messages of the Green Language can be read ondifferent levels of meaning simultaneously, thus concealing sacred mysteries inplain sight. A famous example of this is Chartres Cathedral, whose strangesculptures and carvings have stimulated the imaginations of thousands ofvisitors and contributed to a cottage industry based in their interpretation.In India, this sacred language is called sandhya-bhasa, or the “twilightlanguage.”21 The word sandhya is particularly relevant to our case, because itmeans quite literally the “time of union.” The time of union is considered to beboth dawn and dusk—thus the union of night and day. Noon is sometimes alsoconsidered a “time of union,” as it is the point where morning meets afternoon.An important Vedic ritual, the sandhya vandanam, is performed thrice daily—athigh noon, and when the sun is on the horizon, either at sunrise or sunset. Weshould note that the sandhya vandanam ritual is focused on the concept ofamrita, the nectar of immortality, which is a core element of Tantric ritual ingeneral and which is emphasized at Candi Sukuh and Candi Ceto in Java.The word bhasa means “language,” so we can interpret sandhya-bhasa as the“language of the time of union,” which has a perfectly Tantric ring. It isinteresting that the term sandhya is also taken to mean “perfection,” and is acommon girl's name in India. Sandhya is the daughter of Brahma, who created herand then fell in love with her, in the process creating Kama, the god of desire.Thus, as a deity, she is often also considered the wife of Brahma as well as hisdaughter and, in other texts (like the Siva Purana), the wife of Shiva (whichmakes her the equivalent of Parvati or Uma). Catherine Benton raises thepossibility that we can see this story as a way of understanding the nature ofhuman love and desire.22 It is, she claims, a projection of inner conflicts onan available object, just as Brahma fell in love with his own creation, Sandhya,even as he was aware that she was nothing more than his creation. Desire (Kama)born of this type of conflict is stronger than our conscious understanding,which sees it as ephemeral and perhaps even selfdestructive. Tantra, whichaddresses desire and love head-on, may be an ancient form of psychotherapy, onein which psychological conflicts are used as energy sources to promote spiritualprogress and illumination.The usual complicated Indian theological structures, therefore, give rise toseveral possible interpretations of the role of Sandhya in a Tantric context.Throughout the rest of this work, we will focus mainly on her manifestations asParvati and Uma, with further references to Kali and Durga.The twilight language is an allegorical word game, with double and triplemeanings for each term. For instance, in this language—which, after all, is thelanguage extensively used in the Tantras—the Sanskrit term vajra can mean“thunderbolt,” “power,” linga, “penis,” even shunya (“void”)—all terms cognatewith ideas of masculine energy and creative (and destructive) power.23 Whilethis example may seem obvious to a casual reader, the complexity increases withmore specific terminology and references. We encounter the same thing in Westernalchemical texts, which are replete with terms like “the white eagle,” “the redlion,” etc.—all in a seemingly metallurgical context. In his many works onalchemy, Jung made the claim that these terms had psychological significance,and I make the case that the terminology can be employed as well inmetallurgical, chemical, biological, neurological, psychological, and sexualcontexts, to name but a few.The twilight language is employed to convey information about the world. It is acosmological language and the processes it describes can be understood on avariety of levels, at times interchangeably. What this implies is that analchemical text can be interpreted as a manual of Tantra just as easily as aTantric text can be interpreted psychologically. The benefit to researchers isthat the Tantric texts are almost blatant in their description of actual sexualprocesses—processes that have spiritual change and transformation as theirpurpose. This enables us to apply that interpretation to a variety of othertexts in the “twilight” or “green” language. Using these texts to interpret eachother suddenly opens up a rich field of information. In actuality, this conceptwas enshrined in the Vedas from the beginning, since the Vedas are consideredthrayi— in other words, statements in the Vedas have three meanings: an exotericmeaning, an esoteric meaning, and a “philosophical” meaning. A parallel case canbe seen in alchemical literature, which can have a purely chemical meaning, aninner or psychological or psycho-biological meaning, and a purely spiritualmeaning.One of the ways in which “green” or twilight language is employed is in thefield of symbols. In the West, these symbols take the form of the images ontarot cards, the carvings on Gothic cathedrals, and the strange illustrations inbooks on alchemy, Kabbalah, and magic. Freud understood dream images torepresent psychological states, many with a sexual component; Jung codifiedthese symbols even further, finding a structure peopled with mythic ideas andconcepts.In Tantra, these symbols also can be found in architecture. Similar to the wayimages are used to convey esoteric information on Gothic cathedrals, like thewell-known example of Chartres, carvings on Tantric temples are used to suggestvarious psycho-spiritual states and are illustrative of the means to achievethem. These carvings may be statues of the various deities of the Indianreligions—each with specific qualities, aspects, and powers, just as Catholicsaints are interpreted in the Afro-Caribbean religions of Santeria and Voudon—orthey may be of scenes from the great Indian epics like the Ramayana and theMahabharata, which have as much resonance for an Indian devotee as Biblicalstories do for Westerners, with corresponding psychological relevance and depth.Some temples are explicit in sexual terms and depict actual sexual acts andpositions. To the non-initiate, these may be interpreted at face value; aninitiated view holds that the acts and positions have psycho-spiritualcomponents and refer to altered spiritual states, some of which may be achievedby the application of these very acts and positions.In Java, the temples of Candi Sukuh and Candi Ceto have the most blatant sexualimagery, as we will see. However, such massive and famous edifices as Borobudurand Prambanan can also be identified as Tantric temples. Borobudur itself hasbeen acknowledged as an example of the Vajrayana Buddhism of Tibet, a Tantricdenomination. Other temples and shrines may not boast as much iconography asCandi Sukuh, but they may be utilized as centers of Tantric practice just thesame—like the shrine and cemetery at Gunung Kemukus, not far from Candi Sukuh.In this case, the twilight language is employed, not in images or allegoricallanguage per se, but in the performance of ritual (what we may call “twilightaction”), where the ritual itself is an allegory—in this case, the peculiar typeof temporary marriage that is solemnized at Kemukus. Marriage has beenunderstood allegorically all over the world and in many eras. In 17th-centuryEurope, we have the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, which isconsidered to be an alchemical allegory. In the Gnostic texts discovered at NagHammadi, we read that the Holy of Holies of Solomon's Temple was interpreted asa bridal chamber. We will look at these examples in the last section of thiswork.THE SCHOOLS OF TANTRAThere are two main and distinct “schools” of Hindu Tantra, the Shiva and theShakti schools. The Shiva school obviously places Shiva in the position of theHigh God and the focus is on him, with a somewhat lesser emphasis on hisconsort, Shakti. In the Shakti sects, however, this polarity is reversed, withthe emphasis placed on the feminine aspect of the two. Both Shiva and Shaktirepresent forms of power, but Shakti is power by definition. Shiva is understoodas the principle that directs this power, but it is Shakti who personifies thetype of occult, esoteric force that is at the heart of the practices we callTantra. During the course of this study, we may have occasion to refer to thesedifferences from time to time, so it is wise to point them out now.It is entirely possible that the first form of Tantra was Shakti in nature. Anepigraphic reference to the Matrikas— the seven Mothers—that dates from 423 CEmay be the earliest known Tantric mention anywhere.24 According to theDevi-Mahatmya, a sixth-century CE Shakta text, the Matrikas are fierce goddesseswho were summoned by Durga to help her in a battle with demons. They are thefemale forms of male deities, and are sometimes confused with the tenMahavidyas, who are, themselves, rather frightening in appearance and who havesome odd preferences (sex with corpses, a goddess who cuts off her own head,etc.).25As mentioned, fierce goddesses are a staple of Tantric practice. The most famousof these is Kali, who is often depicted with a lolling red tongue, a necklace ofhuman skulls, various weapons, and a skull cup full of human blood. Kali is inher element in a charnel ground or cemetery. She can sometimes be seen standingon the prone body of Shiva. In this manifestation, she can be interpreted asenergy or power, without which Shiva is helpless.The cult of Kali represents a Shakti version of Tantra, with its emphasis on thefeminine as the dominant and supreme deity. Other forms of the fierce feminineinclude Durga—whom we will come across in Java—and Chinnamasta, the goddess whocuts off her own head. Even Tara, the gentle goddess of Tibetan Buddhism, is ablood-thirsty deity in the Hindu tradition.26 In India, Tara resides in thecremation ground and is often depicted standing on a corpse, virtually identicalin every respect to Kali. Blood sacrifices are made to her by her devotees.We may well ask why it is that a belief system that holds the feminine to be thesupreme deity would depict its goddess in this brutal, bloody, and altogetherhideous fashion. We should remember that these goddesses are also oftendescribed as lustful, even rapacious. Are these stereotypically male qualities,projected onto a female object of adoration, meant to legitimize male tendenciestoward the violent in death and sex? Is it a kind of Zen koan, requiringdevotees to make a leap of consciousness from the idea of a nurturing, wholesomefeminine to this outrageous caricature of death and destruction, putting twocontradictory images side by side and forcing a psychic resolution?Perhaps there is another way to understand the wrathful and bestial goddesses ofTantra. Kali and the Hindu Tara are both shown standing on motionless, pronecorpses of men. Often, these are understood to represent Shiva, and sometimesthe corpse is shown with an erect penis. We know that the principle ofShakti—psycho-spiritual power, or cosmic power, depending on how you interpretit—is feminine. A prone Shiva, a corpse-like Shiva, may imply a post-orgasmicShiva and the image of Kali or Tara standing over him may signify the release ofthat energy. Why, then, the accompanying images of death?27 Why the worship in acremation ground?How are sex and death related, particularly in the context of Tantric practice?This is a question to which we will return as we investigate some of thetantroid practices we will encounter in the mountains of Java.EXCURSUS: A BRIEF SUMMARY OF INDONESIAN HISTORYMany readers who are familiar with Asian religions and knowledgeable about thecultures and histories of India and China may remain relatively unsure aboutIndonesia and its history and religious traditions. Because this history is soimportant to any intelligent discussion of Tantra in Java, it is necessary tooffer a very brief summary of the subject before devoting ourselves to aninvestigation of Javanese mysticism itself.THE JAVANESE DYNASTIESIndonesia is the name given to a huge territory in Southeast Asia that stretchesacross three time zones along the equator. It has the fourth-largest populationin the world after China, India, and the United States. It is also the largestMuslim country in the world, with over 200 million citizens professing theIslamic faith. It consists of more than 17,000 separate islands, of which Javais the largest.Since the nation's independence from the Dutch after World War II, the Javanesehave dominated Indonesian government, culture, and politics. As the largestethnic group, their language and customs have influenced the development of allthat we think of as “typically Indonesian.” We must remember, however, that“Indonesia” as a concept did not exist until about the 1920s, when theindependence movement began. Until then, Indonesia had been colonized by asuccession of Asian and European powers.We will not attempt a comprehensive account of Indonesian history, as colorfulas it is with its tales of sultans and monks, colonialists and traders, Arabsailors and Chinese Buddhists. Much of what we know of early Indonesian history,however, comes to us (with some notable exceptions) from its foreign visitors.Manuscripts in Java and Sumatra were written on palm leaves and so were prone toearly destruction and decay. It is, however, safe to say that the firstIndonesian kingdoms of which we have any information are those that have theirorigins in India and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The earliest, the kingdom ofTarumanagara, lasted from 358 to 669 CE and was located in the northwestern partof Java, near present-day Jakarta, in the Sundanese region. This was a Hindukingdom, as epigraphic and other evidence—including some Chinese sources—attest.The earliest surviving written records in Java are stone inscriptions inSanskrit using the Pallawa script, which is a form of writing that originated inthe Tamil Nadu area of southern India. Thus, we can safely say that Hinduism waspresent in Java from at least the fourth century CE.The Srivijaya empire, based in Sumatra with its center in Palembang, began inthe late seventh century CE. It continued on through the 13th century and had asignificant influence not only in Java, but also in the Malay peninsula,Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Oddly, very little remains of thisonce-powerful kingdom, which was not even known to have existed until foreignscholars began to uncover evidence of it in the 1920s. It, too, was heavilyinfluenced by Indian religious traditions and was a veritable intellectualcenter of Vajrayana Buddhism by the seventh century.Chinese Buddhist scholars went to Sumatra to study and, as we mentioned at thebeginning of this book, the famous Buddhist teacher and saint Atisha lived inthe Srivijayan kingdom for some years before bringing Vajrayana (Tantra)teachings back to India and Tibet. There is some debate as to where Atishaactually wound up, however, for by that time—the 11th century CE—Srivijayaextended to Java as well as to what is present-day Borneo, and its capital movedto Java for a period of time during the eighth century, when the massiveBuddhist edifice at Borobudur was built. Another problem in locating importantgeographical sites lies in the ease with which foreign travelers and armchairtourists writing 1000 years ago used terminology and place names with only thebarest first-hand knowledge of what they were talking about. Thus, there is someconfusion as to the precise location of Srivijaya at certain critical periods inits history.Other kingdoms existed alongside the Srivijayan empire, including the Sailendraand Sunda kingdoms as well as the famous Mataram kingdom. The Sailendra dynastyis often associated with Srivijaya for a variety of reasons, including theintermarriage of its rulers. Thus some scholars attribute the building ofBorobudur to the Sailendras themselves. It is interesting that the earliestrecord of the Sailendras is a stone inscription that mentions the erection of ashrine to the goddess Tara that dates to 778 CE. The Sailendras, however, seemto have disappeared in the ninth century shortly after the completion ofBorobudur and their defeat by a ruler from the short-lived Sanjaya dynasty wholater moved back to Sumatra. In fact, there is still some debate as to whetherthe Sailendras were really Buddhists or Hindus—or both.The Sunda kingdom, as its name implies, was located in western Java in the areanow known by the same name. It represents one of the longest and most continuousof the Javanese regimes, lasting from 669 to 1579 CE. This also was a mixedBuddhist and Hindu kingdom, but with a strong element of indigenous (“animist”or “shamanistic”) practices as well. Unlike the still somewhat mysteriousSrivijaya and Sailendra cultures, the Sundanese have kept the memory of theirgreatness alive in a strong oral tradition that has passed down historicalinformation—as well as its indigenous, pre-Buddhist beliefs andpractices—through the centuries.The Mataram kingdom (not to be confused with the Islamic Mataram Sultanate ofthe 13th to 16th centuries) lasted from the eighth to the 11th century CE, andits power centers were in present-day Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo). Somescholars attribute the origins of this dynasty to the Sanjayas, while othersclaim that the building of Borobudur and the equally impressive Hindu complex atPrambanan occurred thanks to the Mataram kings. In the 10th century, or possiblyearlier, the kingdom moved its capital farther east to Central Java. This waspossibly due to an eruption of Mount Merapi at that time that covered Borobudurin volcanic ash from which it was only rescued in the 19th century.Perhaps the single most important dynasty—in terms of both our subject and ofIndonesia as a whole—was the Majapahit kingdom, which lasted from 1293 to 1500and disappeared with the ascension of Islam in the archipelago. Prior to theMajapahit, there were several other dynasties of greater or lesser importance,the most notable of which was the Singhasari kingdom (1222–1292) that gave riseto the Majapahit, and the Kediri kingdom (1045–1221) in Java, which was ruled bya series of kings who considered themselves incarnations of Hindu gods likeVishnu and Ganesha. The second king of Kediri was believed to be the incarnationof Kamajaya, the God of Love known in Sanskrit as Kamadeva; his queen wasbelieved to be Kamaratih, the Goddess of Lust and Passion known in Sanskrit asRati. Thus it can be seen that the Hindu religious tradition was quite strong inJava and remained that way until the advent of Islam.By this time, the stresses imposed by foreign visitors and alien cultures wasalready beginning to strain the Javanese worldview. Java is an island, and thetrade along its coasts was brisk, with ships arriving from India and all of Asiaregularly. The entire Malay and Indonesian archipelago was famous worldwide forgold and spices. Muslim traders from India and other countries brought, not onlytheir wares to sell, but also their religion. Slowly, Islam began making inroadsfrom the coastal communities to deeper within the interior where the greatJavanese palaces and temples were located. The riches and influence of theJavanese kingdoms were so well-known that the great Mongol emperor and warlordKublai Khan (a contemporary of Marco Polo) sent an army of more than 20,000troops to attack them, but was defeated in 1292 by forces under what wouldbecome the Majapahit dynasty.Oddly enough, it was Dutch perfidy that almost lost the world the historicaltexts that revealed the existence of this magnificent kingdom—and a Dutchofficial who saved the texts from the flames. The story is illustrative of thehow the people of Indonesia had lost virtually all memory of their greatnessbefore the arrival of the colonial powers, save for legends passed down fromgeneration to generation and, of course, the mute but insistent testimony of thestones—the temples, monuments, petroglyphs, and other artifacts found everywhereon the islands. The manuscript in question is the Deshawarnana, perhaps betterknown as the Nagarakrtagama, written in 1365 as a description of the court ofHayam Wuruk, Majapahit's most famous king, who reigned from 1350 to 1389. In theyear 1894, the Dutch sent a small army to raze the palace of a ruler on theisland of Lombok. Among the priceless treasures that were nearly consigned tothe flames were the only written records known of the Majapahit empire. Theywere saved by an official attached to the Dutch expedition.However, there was another text that was preserved as well. A set of six copperplates roughly the size of an A4 sheet of paper (or about 8” × 12”) werediscovered buried in the ground in East Java in the year 1780. Luckily, theinscribed plates were copied onto manuscript, because the originals were lostand never seen again. The copy itself disappeared, until it was rediscovered in1888 in Leiden. Thus it was not until 1888 that the world learned how Majapahitcame to be, for the copper plates told the story of its founder, King Wijaya.The manuscript from Lombok told the story of Hayam Wuruk. From these two coredocuments we have been able to piece together the history of this empire,assisted by an ever-growing body of other evidence, some of it from Chinese andother foreign sources who had been visiting Java and trading with it during thatperiod.All available evidence describes Majapahit as an empire that embraced thediverse religious and cultural interests of its people. Both Hindu—in this case,Shiva worshippers—and Buddhist leaders lived at the palace, and indigenousreligious leaders also enjoyed a great deal of autonomy. Vishnu worshippers werealso in attendance during this period, although their influence at the court wasnot as great as that of the Shiva cult. During this period, we can see thatHindu and Buddhist deities were identified with local Javanese gods andgoddesses, and the Javanese belief system was brought into line with Hindu andBuddhist practices—or vice versa. Also, Hayam Wuruk claimed the title ofchakravartin, a peculiarly Indian title that means “the one through whom thewheel of Dharma turns.” The implication, of course, is that the political rulerof the kingdom was also its spiritual leader, in the sense that he or sheembodied the soul of the country and was the channel for the Dharma. Dependingon the context, Dharma can mean the Law (as in religious law, analogous to theTorah for the Jews), or duty in the sense of spiritual responsibility. BothBuddhists and Hindus use the term, albeit with slightly different connotations.For those who live in accordance with the Dharma, life proceeds as it should; ifa king rules in accordance with the Dharma, the entire nation prospers. In thisway, it is also similar to the Chinese concept of the Dao.There was more to regal authority than adherence to the Way, however. Power wasalso a prerequisite and, in the Majapahit empire—as in the previous Indianstyleempires of Java and Sumatra—power was shakti. We must remember that these wereTantric kingdoms, whether nominally Buddhist or Hindu. The rituals, temples, andstatuary all attest to a Tantric view of the world. Indonesia was so importantto the preservation and transmission of Tantric doctrine and methods that one ofTibet's three most important teachers, the aforementioned Atisha, came to theSrivijayan kingdom to learn its teachings first-hand. Tantra fit in well withthe indigenous spiritual beliefs of a people who identified themselves with theland: its volcanoes, its rugged coastline, its rice and tea fields, itsbreathtaking interior. Sexual prowess was respected as a manifestation ofshakti, and a king was expected to have an abundance of it. The king wasexpected to be fertile, for that meant the land would be fertile.Sexual activity was also one way to obtain and direct power; mystic sexual unionenveloped partners in cosmic energy and increased their power.28In other words, this concept was not restricted to those who had a religiousvocation. It was not the sole province of monks or ascetics. Tantra waspracticed by monarchs in ancient Java and, to a certain extent, still is.In Javanese Tantric Buddhism there were three methods: mantra, the repetition ofa formula endless times; yantra, a magical symbol which had to be drawncorrectly; and Tara, energy possessing goddesses. Rituals, magic circles anddiagrams, drunkenness, sexual union with a “Tara” and sacrifices of animals andeven human beings were common to Javanese Tantric ritual ...29The question of human sacrifice in Java is a controversial one. Human remainshave been found at some temple sites, buried beneath the stones. The practice ofhuman sacrifice as a ritual during the construction of an especially importantbuilding is one of which both circumstantial as well as some textual evidenceexists, and in fact it is believed to have continued to this day in some partsof Asia.30That a king should be so intimately involved with these seemingly bizarrepractices may surprise those who have come to Tantra through the New Age, whichusually frames Tantra in a personal way, as an individual's approach to a kindof spiritual ecstasy through sex. On the contrary, Tantra is first and foremostabout power, shakti; those in society who are most concerned with getting powerand keeping it are its rulers. Ronald M. Davidson has emphasized this aspect ofTantra, what he calls its “imperial metaphor,” which revolves around theconsecration of a king and, by extension, the exercise of royal power.31 If weaccept this as true, then it should come as no surprise that an actual kingwould see in Tantric practice rituals of legitimacy and the assurance ofcontinued power.The mindset of a Tantric practitioner is such that he or she enters a realmwhere identification with a deity is required, at least during the course of theritual. In the mundane world, kings occupy that sort of position asintermediaries between heaven and earth, and the Tantrika aspires to a similarstate. That is one of the reasons why Tantra was considered such a threat to theestablished order. It wasn't due only to their antinomian practices and beliefs,but the idea that a Tantrika, of whatever caste—whatever position in society oreven a total outcaste, a Dalit—could, through brute force it would seem, aquiredirect contact with the divine forces that inform the monarchy and, byextension, the kingdom. Such a feat put the Tantrika on a par with the king.In Java, however, the rulers dominated this type of activity for at least 1000years—from the earliest beginnings of Indian religion in Java to the advent ofIslam, and beyond. The people themselves had their own avenues to spiritualpower, of course. Those who did not follow either the Buddhist or Hindu Tantricpath could avail themselves of their indigenous methods and beliefs. During theMajapahit era, Buddhism, Shaivism (Shiva worshippers), Vaisnavism (Vishnuworshippers), and the indigenous faith all had their place at the court assured.There were, however, other personalities and cults in Java that did notnecessarily enjoy the privileges of the court. Today, they would be considered“animists” or “shamans,” but neither of these antique designations reallycommunicates the genuine nature of these individuals and groups. Their rituals,their sacred spaces, their deities all changed with the territory. In Java, itseems that every mountain is sacred; every volcano is an axis mundi. There were(and are) spirits of the forests, of the rivers, of the mountains, of thefields, and of the sea. Sometimes, these take on human, or humanoid, form; atother times, they are perceived as snakes, monkeys, or other fauna. A seeminglyinnocent scene of a young woman walking alone down a road under a full moon cantake on a hideous aspect, for that woman may not be a woman at all, but a fiercegoddess, a Durga, or some other dangerous local spirit.In Java today, you will find all of these beliefs represented, along with Islamand elements of Christianity and even Theosophy. The development of a trulyunique form of mysticism is still taking place on the island, one that hasaccepted the best parts of all traditions—local and foreign—to create amethodology, a program of action, and what we may call “active spirituality”that is peculiar to Java. While African religions survived in somewhat differentform among the slave populations of the Caribbean (for instance) and becametoday's Voudon, Santeria, Candomble, and Palo Mayombe, these are stillessentially African religions that adopted a veneer of Catholicism. They werenever truly “syncretic,” as has been supposed. The Javanese, on the other hand,remained connected to their land even during long centuries of colonialinterference and rule. Their very lives depend on maintaining a harmoniousrelationship with their environment, troubled as it is with dangerous volcanoesand monsoons. They never lost that connection and, with each succeeding wave ofimmigrant and colonist, invader and trader, they seem to have incorporatedwhatever seemed consistent with their own needs and beliefs. Even today, theslogan of the New Order in Indonesia is “Unity in Diversity” and, although therehave been attempts by special interests to impose a unity upon the diversity,Indonesia has remained committed to maintaining its own unique culture whilesimultaneously embracing Islam, modernization, and democracy.THE COMING OF ISLAMThe Majapahit dynasty was the last “Indian” kingdom in Java, and the last purelyTantric one. Tantra survived beneath the Islamic surface of its sultanates andmanaged to become absorbed to some extent in cultural practices and beliefs, aswe shall see. As a formal recognized practice, it was never really suppressed ordenied. This may be due to the fact that Sufism, the strain of Islamic teachingand influence that first came to Java, was itself mystical in origin. It wasperhaps this confrontation of Tantra and Sufism that allowed the growth of whatis known today as kebatinan, a peculiarly Javanese form of mysticism.The origins of Sufism, like the origins of Tantra, are shrouded in mystery.Traditionally, Sufism is considered the secret or esoteric side of Islam thatwas taught by the Prophet to his disciples. Thus it may be considered a form ofIslamic Gnosticism. The outer form of Islam is called lahir; its inner, oresoteric form is known as batin. This Arabic word has given us the Javanese termkebatinan. One of the central practices of Sufism—the constant repetition of thename of God—is called dhikr in Arabic. Its parallel with the Indian practice ofmantra is obvious. It is believed that the constant repetition of the name ofGod will bring one into a state of spiritual ecstasy. Since the practice ofmantra was well-known to the Javanese for a millennium, it is assumed that, whenthe Sufi sheikhs arrived with their version, it was readily understood in anIndian and Javanese context.More important, just as Tantra was sometimes seen as an unorthodox form of VedicBrahmanism, so Sufism was regarded with suspicion or even disdain by manyorthodox Muslims. Vedic Hinduism is a community-centered, socially structuredreligion with a rigid sense of cosmic order and a requirement for adherence tothe rules and outer forms of the faith. Tantra represents an individualisticalternative. Moreover, it is an alternative that emphasizes personalenlightenment and the acquisition of mystical powers, neither of which isnormative to Vedic teaching. Sufism also emphasizes personal—one may sayprivate—spiritual experience in the greater context of Islam which, like VedicBrahmanism, requires adherence to the rules and the outer form of the religion.Islam first arrived in Java around the 13th century, and was largely confined tothe coastal communities where trading was done. The first Islamic sultanate inwhat is now Indonesia was located in North Maluku, an island far to thenortheast of Java that was a center of the spice trade, particularly in cloves.The Sultanate of Ternate (as it was known) was established in the year 1257 and,remarkably, is extant still as an important cultural influence, although withoutany political power. Closer to home, we find the Sultanate of Demak on the northcoast of Java (c. 1475–1548); the Sultanate of Banten on the northwest coast ofJava, where it was a center for the trade in pepper (1526–1813); the Sultanateof Aceh, established in 1496 at the far western end of Sumatra, which lasteduntil the early years of the 20th century; and, finally, the great MataramSultanate that was founded at about the same time and that prospered until thecoming of the European powers in the 18th century.It is easy to see that the arrival of Islam in Indonesia was assisted by thetrade in spices and gold. Ships arrived from India and the Middle East, throughthe Straits of Melaka and the Sunda Strait (between Java and Sumatra), seekinggoods at ports mostly along the western and northern coasts of Java, which werealso centers of first Hindu and Buddhist, and then Islamic learning. While thesultanates did not appear until the mid-13th century at the earliest, Islam wasalready in evidence in a casual way at least 100 years earlier. It was only thestrength of the Majapahit empire that kept Islam from dominating the entireregion until the early 16th century.THE COLONIALISTSIn the 16th century, the mighty naval forces of Spain and Portugal began toextend their reach into the New World and Asia. Spain established colonies inFlorida, the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America, while Portugal tookpossession of Brazil. At the same time, these two countries fought for dominancein Southeast Asia. When the dust had settled, Spain had control over thePhilippines, while Portugal held important ports in what is now Malaysia andIndonesia.The Sultanate of Melaka (Malacca) was first on the list. Melaka is a city inwhat is now Malaysia, on the west coast of the peninsula and across the Straitsof Melaka from the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Melaka was largely inhabited byMalays and Chinese (the so-called Straits Chinese). Around 1400 ce, it became asultanate that lasted until the Portuguese came and invaded the territory in1512. The Portuguese remained a force in the area until the mid-19th century,with an Asian empire that included Taiwan (Formosa) and the Chinese port city ofMacau (which only recently was returned to Chinese sovereignty).It was the Dutch who had the greatest impact on Java, however, starting with thearrival of the Dutch East India Company (the VOC) in 1602. It might be said thatthe presence of the Dutch in Indonesia had a similar influence on the nativepopulation as that of the British in India, but that is mistaken in some veryimportant ways. The Dutch attempted to rule through artifice and cunning,pitting one sultan against another, dividing and conquering where possible, andusing armed force when that failed. The interest of the Dutch in Indonesia wassimple: plunder. It was a colony that existed only for the purpose of trade,particularly in spices. Until the late 16th century, the Netherlands had beenunder Spanish control. When the Dutch got their independence from Spain, theybegan to send their own ships to the East Indies and mounted a series ofexpeditions, many of which ended in only partial success at first. Europeanconflicts between Spain, Portugal, England, and the Netherlands were beingplayed out in Asia, as these economic and naval superpowers vied for controlover the best trade routes and the most profitable commodities. At the sametime, Indonesia received some high-profile visitors like Sir Francis Drake, SirThomas Cavendish, and St. Francis Xavier, while Queen Elizabeth I of Englandestablished an East India Company in the year 1600.Except for very brief periods, the Dutch remained in control of Indonesia (andparticularly of Java) for more than 400 years, until the Japanese invasions ofthe 1940s and subsequent Indonesian independence after the World War II.Contrary to British practice in India, however, the Dutch did not impose theirlanguage on the Indonesians and largely kept to the coastal cities where theyplied their trade. While Indonesia was definitely a colony of the Dutch—with allthe inequality, racism, and arrogance that implies—the lasting impact of Dutchculture and values on the native population was not as great as it could havebeen under Spanish or English masters. The Dutch played one sultan againstanother, one territory against another, as long as the result was the same:increased trade and increased security for shipping. On their side, the sultansdid their best to follow the same practice of divide and conquer, working withthe British to drive out the Dutch, or asking the Dutch for assistance inconflicts with other sultans. This was the period of the great MataramSultanate, with its charismatic leader, Sultan Agung. At one point, the MataramSultanate ruled nearly all of Java.In terms of religious conflict, the Dutch were Protestant and the Spanish wereCatholic at a time when religious wars were still being fought in Europe. Theseconflicts were imported into Indonesia and the rest of the zone of influence aswell. However, the primary interest of the Dutch was trade and not religion.While the spread of Catholicism in Asia was resisted as much as possible by theDutch, it was not the main focus of their activities. The 17th century was aperiod of tremendous military conflict in Java and throughout Indonesia, withsultans battling each other and foreign powers interfering when and where itsuited them. Sultan Agung himself established relations with the Dutch EastIndies Company in a bid for survival, as he witnessed the military and politicalstrength of what originally was supposed to be a trading mission. In themid-17th century, in fact, the VOC captured the port of Melaka, thus endingPortuguese hegemony in the region. In addition, the VOC captured ports in Ceylon(today's Sri Lanka) as well as on Taiwan. Any shipping of goods in the entireregion under VOC control that was not authorized by the VOC was consideredsmuggling, and the perpetrators were imprisoned or worse.The situation between the Dutch and the Indonesians deteriorated considerablyduring the 18th century, with sultans being forced to sign treaties and giveaway huge amounts of territory to the VOC, or risk wholesale slaughter.Rebellions broke out all over Java, and resistance to both the Dutch and theirJavanese collaborators was fierce. In addition, the Dutch feared the presence ofa large Chinese population on the island and conspired to get rid of them.Called “superfluous Chinese,” they were assigned to ships to take them away fromIndonesia to other areas under their control, but the Chinese feared they wouldbe murdered at sea and began to stockpile weapons. In the resulting battle inthe city of Batavia (now Jakarta), roughly 10,000 Chinese were massacred at thehands of the Dutch troops.Wars and rumors of war dominated this period, but it also saw the establishmentof the Sultanate of Yogyakarta and the building of its famous palace, theKraton, in 1755. The first sultan of the present lineage, Hamengkubuwono I,moved into the Kraton the following year. However, the district of Yogyakartaborders on the Sultanate of Surakarta and, in 1790, the Sultan of Yogyakarta,along with VOC forces, attacked Surakarta because of intelligence received thatthe sultan there was planning to take over Yogyakarta and murder all the Dutchin Java. Eventually, the VOC took over Surakarta for a while and looted itstreasury. To make matters worse, war broke out with England in 1780. TheNetherlands formally surrendered to the British forces and the Prince of Orange(of the Netherlands) proclaimed that all Dutch colonies would revert to theBritish Crown. Many of the VOC outposts refused to surrender, so theEnglish-Dutch war continued in Java long after the end of hostilities in Europe.However, by 1800, the Dutch East India Company had ceased to exist. Plagued bycorruption, war, and the growing insecurity of maritime trade, the famous VOCwent bankrupt. The Dutch government took over the company's assets and plottedways to get the colonies back from British control. The Napoleonic wars hadbroken out in Europe, and the Netherlands was now under French control, whichonly confused matters even more. Not surprisingly, perhaps, an edict went outfrom the Napoleonic administration that the French Revolutionary ideals ofliberté, egalité, fraternité would not apply in Indonesia.By 1811, the British were, for a time, firmly in control of Java. The famous SirThomas Stamford Raffles (1781–1826), who is credited with the discovery of theenormous shrine at Borobudur, was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Java thatyear. Among his other accomplishments is the founding of the city of Singapore;the famous Raffles Hotel there bears his name, of course. While in Java, Raffleswrote a lengthy report of the area (The History of Java, 1817) that is still inprint today and consulted by historians and anthropologists as a curiosity and astarting point for research into the region. However, he was not well-liked atthe Javanese courts, where he was considered rude and impolite, an impressionprobably exacerbated by the fact that the British began an attack on Yogyakartawithin six months of Raffles' visit to the Kraton. During that attack, theylooted the Kraton and sent the sultan into exile, replacing him with a sultan oftheir own choice.By 1814, there was yet another sultan on the throne in Yogyakarta—HamengkubuwonoIV, a thirteen-year-old who replaced the British-selected Hamengkubuwono III.That same year, the British sent a report back to England on the discovery ofboth the Borobudur and Prambanan temples.The British viewed themselves as saviors rescuing the Javanese from theoppression of their Dutch masters. In the end, however, it is difficult to saywith any conviction which of the two European powers had the most benign affecton the people. Both countries burned villages, razed cities, massacredcivilians, looted antiquities and treasuries, acted in bad faith with thesultans, and conspired against them all in the name of profit and glory. Thenative peoples of Indonesia were objects—at best, things to be traded; at worst,obstacles in the way of (European) progress. Raffles believed himself to be inJava on a mission to rescue the Javanese from the Dutch; in the end, it wasdifficult to tell them apart. Anyway, it is a moot point, for by 1825, the Dutchwere again in control. They restored Sultan Hamengkubuwono II, who had been sentinto exile by the British, and the Java War began—a conflict that lasted forfive more years.As 1830 dawned, the Dutch were once again in nominal control of Java. By thistime, realization had set in that the Government of the Netherlands was largelybeing financed by Dutch holdings in the East Indies, to the tune of 30 percentor more of the annual budget. A more aggressive and militant program was createdto ensure that the Javanese remained docile and firmly under Dutch control. ADutch East Indies Army was created, and formal programs were announced to forceJavanese farmers to raise cash crops for export—like coffee, instead of rice.This eventually led to a famine in 1845. This, and other excesses and poorlydesigned programs, led to the Dutch East Indies costing more for the Netherlandsto maintain than they were taking in. By the early days of the 20th century,Indonesian nationalism had found its stride and resistance against the Dutch wasgrowing in intensity.Strangely, one of the forces that contributed to this sense of nationalism wasthe Theosophical Society.THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY IN JAVAAlthough much of the Theosophical Society's work in India is a matter of publicrecord, particularly the role Annie Besant played in the Indian Independencemovement, not much is known about the role of the Society in Indonesia. In itsheyday in the pre-revolutionary period, the Theosophical Society had dozens oflodges in Yogyakarta alone, not to mention the rest of Java. For instance, as ahigh school student, future Indonesian president Sukarno studied at aTheosophical Society library in Surabaya in the 1920s.32 Members of the Societyassisted in the restoration of the Buddhist shrine at Borobudur and it was thefirst organization to celebrate Wesak Day (the Buddhist holiday commemoratingthe birth, death, and attainment of enlightenment of the Buddha) at the shrinein 1932.33Some claim that Madame Blavatsky, the founder of the Society, personally visitedJava three times—in 1853, 1858, and 1883.34 Indeed, some say that the Societywas largely responsible for the rebirth of Buddhism in that country. Of course,many members of the Society were Dutch and other foreigners, including Chinese,lured by the Society's mysticism concerning the mysterious East and itsproselytizing of Hindu and Buddhist teachings. But there were a substantialnumber of Javanese intellectuals who were drawn to the movement as it seemed tooffer validation for Asian spirituality as opposed to faiths imported bygunboat. The emphasis on Buddhism was also a reminder of the glory days ofIndonesian history, when the great empires that dominated Southeast Asia wereHindu and Buddhist.The importance of Java to the Theosophical Society may be seen in a review ofthe contemporary literature on the subject. In 1917, an issue of TheTheosophical Path Magazine printed an article on Borobudur by C. J. Ryan, afrequent contributor to the publication and a staunch Theosophist all hislife.35 Ryan wrote on astronomy, archaeology, and related subjects, andeventually produced a book-length appreciation of the Society. His article onBorobudur contains some speculation as to the purpose of the shrine and itspossible association with Central American architectural styles. In the issue ofFebruary 1924, Ryan writes on “Scenes in Java,” with a photo of the DiengPlateau north of Yogyakarta and the observation that the temples in Javaresemble those of Central America:Relics of a great city, far greater than any now existing in Java, are found onthe plateau. Its walls are twelve feet high and six feet in thickness. Nothingwhatever is known of its history, its builders, or its date. The hundreds oftemples on the plateau are another enigma of archaeology; though manyconjectures have been made nothing has been finally established. The onlydefinite statement that can be made is that the Dieng temples closely resemblein general form and ornamentation the pyramid-temples of Yucatan and otherstates of Central America; and yet how can we suppose that there was anycommunication between these far distant places in comparatively recent times! Itis not improbable that the key to some revealing historical mystery lies in thisresemblance, and it is not impossible that Theosophy may find the way to turnit.36Ryan revisits this theory the following month, in an article entitled “GreatTemples in Java,” where he focuses on the Borobudur complex that includes CandiMendut and Candi Pawon. He then makes mention of Candi Sewu, near Prambanan, aswell as Candi Sukuh, of which he writes:... writers speak of them as being probably the shrines of a faith earlier andsimpler than any of which we have record. Nothing is really known about them.They are severe in form, and massive, and have caused much speculation onaccount of their resemblance to Central American or Egyptian monuments.37This is the type of fascination and wonder that accompanied early Europeaninterest in the ancient temples of Java. Whereas no one denied that the templesbetrayed their Indian influences, there was still speculation that there wassome kind of communication or contact between Java and the civilizations ofCentral America. This type of speculation only increased with the decades,fueled in part by the Chariots of the Gods type of literature of Erich vonDaenniken and his imitators.This was not the extent of Theosophical Society interest in Java, however. Asthe Dutch researcher Herman A. O. de Tollenaere has pointed out in a series ofpapers given in the Netherlands in the 1990s and in his book The Politics ofDivine Wisdom: Theosophy and labour, national, and women's movements inIndonesia and South Asia 1875–1947, the Theosophical Society was very involvedin the independence movement, although its views on such things as conscriptionin the Dutch forces during World War I were at odds with Indonesianrevolutionaries, as the Theosophists tended to come down on the side of anauthoritarian interpretation of government.38 Even though they seemed to favorself-rule—as, for instance, in India—the ideal of the Society seemed to favor aruling class, the nobility, over a purely democratic form of governance.Thus, “among the Dutch in the East Indies colony, the TS had the largestproportion of members anywhere in the world. It also had quite some supportamong the Javanese nobility (priyayi).” The author also points out that theinfluence of the Society was so strong in Java that there was a Blavatsky Parkin Jakarta, as well as an Olcott Park in Bandung and an Annie Besant Square inSemarang.39 This is a remarkable, if little-known, aspect of the TheosophicalSociety in Southeast Asian politics and philosophy.It did not end there, however.One of the Society's more colorful characters in a crowd of colorful characterswas Charles Leadbeater (1854–1934), who worked closely with Annie Besant and whodiscovered the spiritual teacher Krishnamurti. Leadbeater also wrote on Javafrom a Theosophical angle, even to the extent of collecting some of his essayson the subject in a slight volume entitled The Occult History of Java, whichcontains an essay on the type of fairies you may encounter there.40 When itseemed that Krishnamurti was no longer interested in being an occult leader ofthe Society, Leadbeater cast around for a substitute and came up with the ideaof the “Seven Virgins of Java.”These were seven young Dutch women, taken from Java and brought to India tobecome a kind of mystic society. Leadbeater dressed them in blue robes andtaught them the fundamentals of Co-Masonry, into which he had been initiated. Itwas all very bizarre.Suffice it to say that Java was on the radar of the Theosophical Society forquite some time. Their relationship with the Dutch authorities is interesting,considering the Society's avowed preference for home rule and a generalabhorrence of violence. It was perhaps this disinclination to support a violentrebellion that led the Society to tread carefully in Indonesia, as they had inIndia. Perhaps they were waiting for an Indonesian Gandhi, but in any event thatdid not take place and future revolutionaries like Sukarno drank at the well ofTheosophical thought as they developed their ideas of liberation. The full storyof the Society's influence in the Indonesian independence movement as well asthe Buddhist revival in Southeast Asia has yet to be written.With the Japanese invasion of 1942, the internal political situation inIndonesia grew even more grave. Various independence factions fought with eachother or with the Dutch, only to find themselves having to side with either theJapanese against the Dutch, or with their despised Dutch rulers. The Dutchpromised to hold discussions after the war on Indonesian independence, but thatwas seen as a pragmatic move to insure that the Indonesians remained on theirside in the war. Nazi Germany had already invaded the Netherlands, so the Dutchwho were left in Indonesia were fighting a war without any European support.Sukarno, who by this time had become an important nationalist leader, foundhimself imprisoned by the Dutch and then escaped, only to find himself indiscussions with the Japanese who wanted to support his nationalist struggle, ifonly to give further problems to the Allied forces still fighting in the region.Sukarno could then accept the position of head of the Indonesian government, aslong as he also accepted Japanese military control.The Japanese proved as bad as the European powers when it came to brutalizingthe local population, even going so far as to press Indonesian women intoservice as “comfort women”—i.e., prostitutes for Japanese soldiers. They alsoimposed forced labor, and maintained horrendous conditions in prisoner camps.Although the Japanese had promised Indonesian independence—as had the Dutch—itbecame clear that Indonesians were going to have to win their freedom on theirown.Once the war was won and the Japanese retreated from Indonesia, the Dutch, aidedby the British, returned with a vengeance to try to retake their former colony.Resistance was immediate and severe. Independence riots broke out all overIndonesia, and remnants of Japanese forces on some of the islands were stillfighting Dutch and British troops as late as December of 1945, long after theformal surrender. Guerrilla warfare continued until the end of 1950, when SultanHamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta supervised the transfer of political power fromthe Dutch to the new Indonesian government headed by Sukarno, which wasformalized at The Hague and became official on December 27, 1949. Less than tenyears later, Sukarno was calling on the spiritual forces exemplified by thesultan and the Serpent Queen to save his country. And, after Sukarno, hissuccessor Suharto was also known to engage in occult activity.41The importance of Yogyakarta to Javanese history—and to Indonesian history ingeneral—cannot be overstated. Yogyakarta's commitment to the new Republic andsupport for Sukarno was such that it earned the right to be called a “specialdistrict,” answerable directly to the capital in Jakarta. It was the only suchdistrict in the country and one of the last remaining sultanates. It is toYogyakarta and its suburbs that we will go in order to understand the influenceof Tantric thought and ritual in Java, for the city is surrounded with ancienttemples, even in the midst of Dutch colonial architecture and modern Westernhotels, restaurants, and advertising.The Dutch were as brutal and aggressive as their English counterparts, butoriginally they were not in the missionary business or in the business ofcultural domination. That had changed by the end of the 18th century, however,when the Dutch Missionary Society was formed and undertook an aggressive programof conversion to Christianity. The Dutch legal system was imported to Indonesiaand became the basis for modern Indonesian jurisprudence—as the English systemdid in India—and a smattering of Dutch loan-words survive in Indonesian. By andlarge, however, their influence on the people, culture, religion, and customs ofthe people was scant, especially when compared to other colonial situations.When the Dutch finally left after the revolutionary movement kicked them out atthe end of the World War II, there was little left of Dutch culture in thecountry. Today, the relationship between the two countries is a cordial one,with an ongoing exchange of students from Indonesian and Dutch universities.5 Brown and Harper, eds., “Introduction,” The Roots of Tantra (Albany, NY: StateUniversity of New York, 2002).6 Andre Padoux, “What Do We Mean By Tantrism?” The Roots of Tantra, p. 17.7 For a complete description, with photographs, of this important rite seeTachikawa, Babulkar, and Kolhatkar, Indian Fire Ritual (New Delhi: MotilalBanarsidass, 2001).8 For more information on this aspect of the Homa, see Richard K.

The Roots of Tantra, p. 19.12 The exception to this would be orthodox Islam, which recognizes no ultimatehuman authority and places all authority in the text; yet, in practice, thereare many religious authority figures in Islam and there is a mutable, ifunofficial, hierarchy among certain groups that attracts attention and loyaltyfrom believers.13 Marcel Mauss, Sociology and Psychology: Essays (London: Routledge, 1979), p.122.14 Actually, there has already been some activity in that direction.

The first two dates are before thecreation of the Theosophical Society in New York in 1875. According to a historyof the Society by C. J. Ryan (1937), she visited Java from India in 1857. Thereshe “met two other chelas [disciples of her Master]” and thereby missed thefamous Sepoy Rebellion in India that year. The identity of the two “otherchelas” of the Master is not revealed, but the idea that there would be two ofthem in Java, who were also disciples of the Master who was guiding Blavatsky,is compelling. Were they Dutch? Or local Javanese? From there, Ryan suggests shewent directly to South America where “she gained archaeological information”before returning to Europe by 1860 (Ryan, 1937, p. 22). Blavatsky biographerMarion Meade, however, suggests that the entire episode was a complete fantasy(1980), while Geoffrey A. Barborka (1986) repeats it without comment except tosay that she went to Java “on orders,” presumably from her anonymous Master(Meade, 1980, p. 69; Barborka, 1986, p. 26).35 C. J.

When we discuss Javanese mysticism, we will find a great deal ofevidence of Indian religions—in particular, Tantra—as well as Sufi influences,but rarely will we find Christian elements, even after 400 years of EuropeanChristian domination in the region. This is partly due to the paralleldevelopment of Islam alongside foreign influence in Java during roughly the sametime frame. As the Mataram Sultanate was reaching its greatest power, so was theDutch East India Company. In a way, it may be claimed that the Mataram Sultanateprotected the indigenous population from European religious and culturalinfluence at a time when the danger was greatest.The old royal esoteric beliefs survived alongside normative religious practicesduring the era of the Mataram Sultanate and contributed to a sense of nationalidentity on a plane not always visible to the foreign interlopers, who saw onlygold and spices. The sultans still respected the Hindu and Buddhist ceremoniesof their ancestors and proudly proclaimed lineages tracing back to the olderdynasties of Srivijaya, with their Tantric rites and observances. While idolatryis forbidden in Islam—as it is in the Jewish and Christian faiths—the gods ofthe Hindus and Buddhists, as well as of the indigenous peoples, were notabandoned but preserved, relegated to “spirit” status. In many cases, the Indiandeities were identified with ancient Javanese gods. The Indian epic poems of theMahabharata and the Ramayana were revered, in a sense, as historical documents,and the exploits of Rama, Sita, Hanuman, and Lakshamana were preserved in thefamous shadow plays, the wayang, which—like the early days of theater in theWest—had spiritual and political as well as entertainment value. While notabandoning Islam, many Javanese still respect and revere these ancientpersonalities and the supernatural powers they represent. They are able to dothis because they have realized that there is a hidden, or esoteric, aspect ofIslam, just as there is of the Indian faiths. This is what the Muslims callbatin.Thus, the relationship between the indigenous belief systems and Islam may beconsidered an esoteric one. The ancient gods have found a place within theJavanese Muslim worldview—not as gods, perhaps, but as spiritual forces. Just asthe jinn in Arab lore are believed to be living creatures, some of whom haveconverted to Islam, just so the Javanese spiritual forces may be understood asliving beings, creatures of God like the jinn in the Middle East. This, at anyrate, became a means of accommodating or rationalizing Javanese belief systemswithin an Islamic context.The form of religion that existed in Java before the arrival of Hinduism is amatter of conjecture, since contemporary written records of the pre-Indianperiod in Java do not exist. What we have, however, is a living tradition ofwhat anthropologists have called “animism,” and this needs some clarification.Animism comes from the Latin term anima, which means “spirit” or “soul.” It is abelief system that sees objects in nature as imbued with spiritual life andforce. In Java, the environment provides many opportunities for this type ofperception. There are active volcanoes like Mount Merapi near Yogyakarta, whoseeruption in October 2010 is continuing as I write, with much loss of life andproperty, including that of the shaman who died on the mountain rather thanescape its wrath. There is a pitiless sea to the south of Yogyakarta that isknown as the abode of a serpent queen who must be propitiated by the sultanevery year. It is believed that the end of the world will come when lava fromMerapi meets the ocean, for the flow would have to cross the city of Yogyakartaand the Kraton itself to do that. As I write, the Code River that runs throughthe city is already reaching the high-water mark, filled with debris from theongoing eruption, and hundreds of thousands of Javanese have fled their villagesand fields to seek refuge in the public buildings in Yogyakarta. Many Javaneseperceive this as a spiritual event as well as a purely physical disaster, andsee no particular difference between the two. That there is a continuum—if not astrict identity—between the physical world and the realm of the spirit is aTantric worldview that lies deep within the Javanese psyche.43Recently, anthropologists and archaeologists have suggested that neither a pureform of Vedic Brahmanism nor Buddhism really took hold in Java. While thesojourn of Atisha in Indonesia is well-attested, it is undeniable that thereligion that took hold in Tibet after Atisha's travel there was a Tantric formof Buddhism, what is called Vajrayana Buddhism. In Java itself, there is now atendency to speak of a Shiva-Buddha syncretism: a wholly unique amalgam of thetwo main forms of Indian religion. This syncretic form is Tantric and may evencontain elements of some of the more extreme forms of Tantra—like, for instance,the Kapalika sect that focused entirely on rituals in cemeteries, deathceremonies, skull cups, and bone trumpets, and even, it is alleged, humansacrifice.44 It is possible that these extreme forms of Tantra found fertileground within the indigenous belief systems and that elements of them wereabsorbed and have survived today as elements of Javanese mysticism. That someform of human sacrifice was practiced in Java at the time of the building of thePrambanan temple complex already has been asserted by some modernanthropologists, as we saw in the last chapter. I focus on this, not toaccentuate the more lurid possibilities of this subject, but in order to showthat the form of religious and mystical practice that was imported into Java wasa serious version of Tantra. As we continue our excursion into the remotetemples and shrines outside modern Yogyakarta, we will encounter a wide varietyof spiritual expression along the way, and many of these examples will bevirtually indistinguishable from Tantric practices. First, however, we will lookat those elements of Javanese mysticism that seem to be purely indigenous.For the sake of convenience, we will organize the discussion into separatecategories: sacred space, sacred time, sacred personalities, and occulttechniques.SACRED SPACEJava is a land that is characterized more than most by its ecology. Prone tovolcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and monsoons, the emotional andpsychological impact of the land itself is profound and contributes to the typeof thinking that sees hidden forces at work in the world. This is because thereis no clear cause-and-effect relationship between the work of humans and thedramatic response of the ecology. A volcano will erupt when it wishes to; anearthquake occurs according to its own timetable. It is a very human response toseek meaning in events over which we have no control, whether it is suddenillness, tragic death, or an environmental disaster. On a general level, sciencecan answer the “how” of an event, but not the “why”—the “why” in the question“why me?” That is when human beings turn to divination, religion, or occultismfor explanations, and for reassurance that even events as enormous in theireffects as an epidemic or an earthquake reveal a purpose, a meaning, or the handof God in a way that is relevant to an individual's life.The loci that contribute to this sense of cosmic order behind the disorder aremountains—which, in Java, may frequently be volcanoes—and the ocean, as well ascemeteries, shrines, and certain areas of the forest. If prehistoric humans wereso impressed by thunder and lightning that they deified them as gods, how muchmore dramatic are the rumblings, exaggerated plumes, and eventual eruptions of avolcano?Outside the ancient city of Yogyakarta, Mount Merapi dominates the horizon. Theword Merapi means “fire mountain,” which is as apt a description as anyoneneeds. Yet, Merapi—like many mountains in Java—has also been associated withMount Meru, the legendary center of the world in Hindu and Buddhist religion.Indeed, the word for mountain in Javanese is meru. In the 15th-century Javaneseepic poem, Tantu Pagelaran, part of the original Mount Meru was transported toJava by the Trimurti: Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. Pieces of it fell off here andthere, and these pieces created the volcanoes of today. So, in this sense, everyvolcano is a relic of the original Mount Meru and as such is sacred.These stand-ins for Mount Meru are liminal spaces—places where the earth meetsthe sky and where humans meet the gods. The summits of these mountains are forcommuning with the ancient gods. Further down the mountains, in the dry groundabove the rice fields and swamps, are other places of mysterious powers andspiritual forces. These sacred precincts are often under the control of humanagents, usually men, called juru kunci or “keepers of the key.” Theseindividuals occupy the tangential place between this world and the other,invisible world. They are the conduits through which the cosmic force, shakti,flows. They are sometimes called shamans, because their role is parallel, to acertain extent, to that of the Siberian religious specialists who gave us thatterm. They commune with spiritual forces and report back; they also bringmessages from the human world to the spirit world. In some locations—those witha specific story or legend associated with them—the juru kunci can assist withspecial prayers and offerings to the local spirits for such worldly concerns ashealth, wealth, and love.A site can also be considered powerful due to an historical event—the death of aking in that spot, for instance—or to something more clearly spiritual, like avision or perhaps a haunting. Ghosts are as prevalent in Java as they areanywhere else, and ghosts are believed to congregate in places like abandonedbuildings, lonely sections of forest, or, of course, cemeteries.Cemeteries can be a tremendous source of shakti, depending on who is buriedthere. Those that are believed to be the resting places of famous Islamicsaints, for instance, are especially powerful. Pilgrimages are often made tothese places, particularly during important Islamic holidays (like the Prophet'sbirthday) and on days considered most powerful according to the Javanesecalendar. In Java, however, sacred spaces are not only sources of power; theyare also places where people go to give power to the site.45 Sacred spaces arethus seen as having a reciprocal relationship with the people. Pilgrims givepower to the sacred space to keep it vibrant and valuable to the community inmuch the same way that sacrifices are made in temples in order to give power tothe gods. However, some places have more power than others. The grave of animportant person—political, spiritual, or artistic—has power. Sacred objectsalso have power, whether they are buildings or statues imbued with spiritualforce or implements used by a person of power. In a way, the Javanese belief inthis type of power is analogous to the scientific attitude toward energy: it isneither created nor destroyed, but it may be transformed from potential tokinetic. Although a royal personage may have been dead for centuries, the powerrepresented by that monarch is still strong and can be accessed at thegravesite.The mountain is a sacred space by its very existence. So are graves. They areboundaries between this world and the next, and for that reason are powerful. Inthe previous chapter, we saw how charnel grounds in India are similar in nature:places inhabited by the souls of the departed, tangential places between the twoworlds.It is not only the revered dead—kings and saints—whose spirits possess power;those of people who died a violent death may do so as well. This type of spirit,called siluman, manifests as a water spirit or sometimes as a snake. They dwellin swamps and caves, not on mountains or dry land, and their peculiar specialtyis giving advice and protection, and even winning lottery numbers.46 This ideathat the spirits of the violently dead have power that can be used for positivepurposes is also found among the Tantrikas of India, where the skull of someonewho was executed or murdered is considered especially efficacious as a kapala,or skull cup used in Tantric rituals.Another snake spirit found in the wet lowlands is the ipri or iprit. These mayappear as beautiful women. In West Java, there is a tradition that one can marrysuch a spirit provided the way is paved by the juru kunci, the gatekeeper of thearea where the snake spirit dwells.47 An iprit will be a source of great wealthfor the man who marries her.The most extreme form of this concept is found, not in the wetlands, but evenfarther afield, in the oceans themselves, another sacred space. The oceans,seas, and lakes are also liminal places, because they represent a state of beinginaccessible to those who cannot breathe underwater. Whereas the mountains reachtoward the heavens, however, the watery places—swamps, wetlands, and the oceanitself—draw the unsuspecting or the careless to the Underworld. These are placesof chthonic forces, of darker powers. Their most important manifestation is inthe story of Nyai Lara Kidul—the Queen of the Southern Ocean—and her marriage tothe sultans of Yogyakarta and Solo, which forms the substance of a separatechapter to follow.SACRED TIMEIn the West, it is taken for granted that a week has seven days, that there areroughly four weeks to a month and twelve months to a year. It is also understoodthat this is not a perfect calculation of time, since every four years an extraday must be added to keep the calendar in line with the orbit of the eartharound the sun; otherwise, after a century, the calendar would be almost a fullmonth behind.In Java, a number of different calendars are in use simultaneously (similar tothe types of calendars we find in ancient Central America, for instance). Inaddition to the Gregorian calendar used in the West—which is a solarcalendar—there is also the Islamic calendar, which is lunar-based. These twocalendars are consulted side by side. Indeed, some Javanese calendars give boththe Gregorian (solar) and the Islamic (lunar) dates for each day. But that isthe same throughout the Islamic world.The Javanese, however, have another calendar that is usually added to thesetwo—a “market calendar” or pasaran. This is composed of a five-day week, for atotal of thirty-five days per Javanese “month”—i.e., the time it takes for thefive days of the Javanese calendar to align with the seven days of the Gregoriancalendar (5 × 7 = 35).48 When computing the right days to begin a project or goon a pilgrimage, this calendar is consulted with regularity. Certain days are,of course, more powerful than others, and certain days may be contra-indicatedfor certain actions, like betting on the lottery or getting married. Astrologyis also very much part of this system and a type of literature called primbonhas grown up around these calendars with their auspicious and inauspiciousdates.Image [images/p060-001.jpg]A primbon is a kind of almanac or diviner's manual that is sold everywhere inJava: in bookstores, in sidewalk stalls along Yogyakarta's busy main street,Malioboro Road, and in stationery shops. Its origins are pre-Islamic and theyreflect Javanese cosmologies in their interpretation of life events likemarriage, birth, and sickness. Originally written in the Old Javanese script(Kawi), they are usually published in Bahasa Indonesia for the use of theaverage person. In the Kraton at Yogyakarta, there are several original versionsthat are considered quite sacred and that only a chosen few may read.Like diviners' almanacs worldwide, the primbon is concerned with the right day,the right hour, and the right cardinal direction for the successfulaccomplishment of certain tasks. While terminology and concepts from Indianreligions predominate, there are also Islamic influences. The greatanthropologist Clifford Geertz characterized the Javanese religious system as“syncretism”: a blend of various religious traditions that results in a new orunique form of religious expression. While his claim has been much debated,there is no escaping the fact that a study of Javanese religion and spiritualitywill introduce one to Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and indigenous Javanese terms,concepts, and even practices.Image [images/p061-001.jpg]Therefore, in any given primbon, we will encounter all of these influences,sometimes even on the same page. This amalgamation of so many different culturalapproaches to spirituality can have a stimulating effect, rather like a dreamthat juggles a dozen different, seemingly unrelated, images until onesignificant point is made. In the case of the primbon, the main focus is thedivision of time into discrete elements and the meaning associated with each ofthese.Image [images/p062-001.jpg]This relief gives some idea of the mythology connected to the pasaran week offive daysIn addition to the pasaran calendar mentioned above, there is the pawukoncalendar, which, although common to Bali, is also in use among Javanesediviners. This is a 210-day lunar calendar composed of thirty weeks of sevendays each. It uses a total of ten separate weeks of ten different lengths (froma one-day “week” to a ten-day “week”) that run concurrently. In other words,this is a very complex system that usually can only be understood truly by apriest trained in its structure. Its purpose is strictly ceremonial.When the pasaran calendar is combined with the seven-day-week Islamic lunarcalendar, the result is the wetonan calendar, which gives the thirty-five-daymonth previously mentioned. Moreover, calculations of even greater complexitycan be done by combining all of the above calendars to track dates that areespecially auspicious or particularly inauspicious.As if that were not complex enough, the Javanese also use a cycle of eight lunaryears called a windu. Each year has its own name within the windu, and there arefour windu in all, for a total of about thirty-one years in a complete winducycle. However, the total number of days per year as computed using this systemcomes to about 354 or 355 days, which means that a single windu consists ofabout seven years and nine months, rather than a full eight years. Thus, eachwindu consists of eighty-one wetonan cycles of thirty-five days each, or 2835days.49Let us look at a few examples, to get a flavor of the advice offered.One primbon gives a table for determining the best days of each lunar month formarriage (see Table 1 [12_chapter02.html#tab1], page 60). The months begin withthe name of the month in Java, followed by the Arabic form of the month,according to the Islamic lunar calendar. Thus, the first month, Muharram (OldJavanese, Sura), begins on November 26, 2011; in succeeding years, it falls backat the rate of eleven days per year.50Another primbon, one of the most revered, gives advice for marriage in thetwelve Islamic lunar months (see Table 2 [12_chapter02.html#tab2], page 61).51In addition to the above, there is the following note:The months Jumadilakir, Rejeb, Ruwah and Besar are recommended for marriage ifit can be held on a Kliwon Tuesday, and especially good on Kliwon Friday. Ifthere is no Kliwon Tuesday available, then these months are consideredinauspicious. In that case, one can consider the months Sapar, Rabiulawal,Jumadilawal or Sawal, provided that the month contains a Kliwon Tuesday andKliwon Friday.Note that the spelling changes between one primbon and the next. This is to beexpected, especially when one is transliterating Arabic words into Indonesian.Kliwon is one of the days of the five-day pasaran week, which means that, if aTuesday or a Friday falls on a Kliwon, then the day is auspicious for marriage.This is just the beginning of what become rather laborious calculations,reminiscent of Indian Jyotish (Vedic) astrology with its many cycles of dashas,antardashas, etc. It is also similar in some ways to Chinese horoscope methodsand the Chinese counterpart to the primbon, the Tung Shu. The relief on theprevious page gives some idea of the mythology connected to the pasaran week offive days.52So far, we have no information as to the meaning of the names of the days of theweek, nor of the images themselves. It may be that the five figures at the topof the chart represent gods or spiritual forces “in charge” of each specificday, and that the five figures on the lower half of the chart are scenesappropriate to each of the spirits/days. Thus for Manis, we have an agriculturalmotif; for Pahing, we have either a domesticated animal or livestock. Kliwon(here spelled Kaliwon) seems to be martial in nature, while Wagé (here spelledWagi) indicates the giving of food. Pon seems to indicate a servant and master.A person born on one of the five pasaran days is believed to have certaincharacteristics and possible futures. When the pasaran day is matched with oneof the days in the seven-day week, another set of characteristics is developed.Then there is the lunar month, the solar month, and the year cycle, plus thehours of the day—all of which must be taken into account.In addition to the division of time, there is also a division of space based onthe five-day pasaran cycle, with four of the five days representing cardinaldirections and the fifth representing the center. In one primbon, this is shownas Pon in the North, Legi in the South, Wagé in the East, and Paling in theWest, with Kliwon in the center.53 Thus, time and space become enmeshed in thissystem, just as they do in Western esoteric systems. In yet another primbon, thetwenty letters of the Javanese alphabet are arrayed around the four cardinalpoints as well, with five letters to each quarter, thus offering the possibilityof creating mantras—words of power—based on divisions and articulations of time,space, and sound.54This is not as odd as it may seem. There is a lot of mystification in Javaconcerning the supernatural elements of the twenty letters of the Javanesealphabet. In a book entitled Horoskop Jawa(Java Horoscope), there is a chapterentitled “Human Nature Based on Java Script.”55 This chapter offers a detailedanalysis of each letter, something that will be familiar to any student ofgematria, notarikon, or temurah, the methods used by Jewish Kabbalists toanalyze textual material in the Torah. The cosmological system of the Javanese,therefore, has a great deal in common with Western esoteric cosmologies andsystems of correspondences, at least where their general approach is concerned.The importance given to cardinal directions, the complicated calendar systems,and their association with letters of the alphabet are all elements they hold incommon.SACRED PERSONALITIESTo the Javanese, shakti is everywhere, in everything. The universe hums with itsforce, and even the most untrained, unschooled person may be able to turncontact with that power to his or her own advantage. However, it is alwaysbetter to consult an expert—someone who has devoted his or her life tomaintaining contact with supernatural forces. Some of these experts—like thejuru kunci or “key keeper”—may ensure that the supplicant performs the rightceremony at the right time for the right purpose. Others take on totalresponsibility for ritual and its effects. These latter are known by differentnames in different parts of the archipelago and are even categorized accordingto their specialty.The term dukun is used for a wide variety of ritual specialists, from healers tomediums and workers in the darker arts. They cast spells, commune with spirits,and exorcise demons. Some specialize in love, others in health, or money, orother normal human concerns. One does not normally go to a dukun in search ofenlightenment. A dukun is not a guru, per se. They are specialists in theirfield and offer a service.Rituals performed by the dukun generally contain Islamic references to God orquotations from the Quran, mixed at times with Sanskrit mantras and more clearlyJavanese elements like the names of local spirits. Often, newspaper accountsfeature lurid tales concerning specific dukun who are believed to have causeddeath with their spells. This type of magic—called ilmu hitam(the blackknowledge or the black art)—is universally feared and its practitioners arecalled “sorcerers” (dukun sihir).56Dukun are not to be confused with juru kunci. Juru kunci are located in aspecific sacred space and control access to the space and to the powersrepresented by that space. A dukun may be self-selected due to some perceivedspiritual power, or because of special training and knowledge, or even becausehe is in possession of some object believed to have superior supernatural force.The role of the juru kunci remains consistent with the spirit of the place hetends; a dukun, like a santero in Afro-Caribbean religion, may offer a widervariety of services, calling on a number of spirits or spiritual forces.Some of these types of spirits have already been mentioned. These include theipri and the siluman, a human spirit who takes on the form of an animal, often asnake. The spirits of the dead are often evoked, particularly the spirits ofthose who died violently or who were very powerful in life, as well as thosedeemed to have been saintly while alive or who were powerful dukun themselves.People go to dukun for all the usual reasons—to find love, to keep arecalcitrant lover or wandering spouse, to win at the lottery, to heal sickness,or even to curse a rival or an enemy.There are mantras specific to many of these desires, as well as appropriateherbs and other substances that must be offered or sacrificed in special ways.These prayers may include Islamic references mixed in with traditional Javaneseelements. This short but poignant love spell is found in a locally availablepamphlet, Mantra Orang Jawa (Javanese Mantras):Aji Pangasihan Semar MesembismillahirahmanirahimSrikandi sayang, sang Arjunalah suamimuaku berdiri bagai Togog,duduk bagai Semarkau belas kau kasih menyaksikan sosokkuwahai, Nengina, kasihilah aku,kasihilah demi kasih Allah57This translates as:The Smile of Semar Love SpellBismillah i-rahman i-rahimDear Srikandi, your husband ArjunaI stood like TogogSat like SemarYou pity, you love watching meOh, Nengina, love me,Love me for the love of Allah.As you can see, there are several religious influences brought to bear in theseseven lines. In the first place, the love spell is called “Semar's Smile.” Semaris an important figure in Javanese mythology and in the wayang—the shadow playsfamous throughout the archipelago that carry important cultural and spiritualinformation. The first line of the mantra or prayer is familiar to every Muslim,for it is the opening line of all but one chapter of the Quran: “In the name ofGod, the Compassionate, the Merciful.” This simple phrase is said to encapsulatethe entire meaning and core of Islam.The next line invokes Srikandi and Arjuna, warriors famous from the Mahabharata,of course, but also from the wayang, where Srikandi is interpreted a littledifferently.58 Togog is another character from the wayang, as well as Semar inthe following line. The spell ends with a plea to Allah.59 Thus, in this shortprayer, we have ample evidence of syncretism at work. Islamic, Hindu, and purelyJavanese themes and influences are blended together in one spell, a spell tocapture love. In a way, this invocation represents the entire psychology at workbehind Javanese mysticism and gives us an insight into Javanese culture, sincethese references would be familiar to every Javanese.Javanese culture includes not only human agents of occult forces—the dukun andthe juru kunci—but also spiritual ones. These are unique to Indonesia andparticularly to Java, and they will appear again and again in our examination ofthe temples, so we shall look at a few of them now.SEMARSemar, mentioned in the love spell above, is perhaps the most beloved of all theJavanese gods and is most likely a genuine indigenous personality—a beingworshipped in Java before the coming of Indian religions and thus at least amillennium before Islam came to the island. Accounts of Semar's personality,origins, and function depend on some very scarce documents and especially on thewayang performances, which retain much of what we know about this mysteriousbeing. Indeed, even his name is believed to be related to the Old Javanese wordsamar, which means “not clear,” or “obscure.”60According to old Javanese hand Niels Mulder, Semar is “the God of Java,progenitor of the Javanese race.” Even today, he claims, “messianic hopes seemto be pinned on Semar, the guardian spirit of Java who, as retainer of thePendawa, represents the common folks, and their suffering.”61This is an important aspect of Semar for, even though he is of divine origin andidentified as the elder brother of Shiva, his place is with the common people ofJava and not with the hierarchy.62 His appearance is crude. He is overweight andsloppy, with enormous belly and buttocks, sometimes with a limp, and he is evenconsidered to be, in a sense, hermaphroditic. He sits attentively at the feet ofearthly masters, even though he is far more powerful, far more ancient, andactually divine. He is a savior dressed as a kind of clown or country bumpkin,with a voice at times high-pitched and keening and at others grumbling and rude.He is wise, while appearing stupid or dense. In a way, he is reminiscent of theSufihero Nasruddin, whose gnomic utterances and bizarre behavior always reveal aprofound meaning.It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Semar to the Javanese peopleand culture. He is their identity, their divine representative. He survived intothe Indian period under Hindu influences; even after Islamization, Semarsurvived within the new cosmology. His is an incredible personality, a god whospent thousands of years alone in Java until people began to arrive and he foundhimself protecting them, acting as intermediary between the people and thekings.63The Pendawa, mentioned above, are a group of five personalities that appearfrequently in wayang performances. They have their origin in the Mahabharata asthe Pandava. Among them are Arjuna, the Indian king and warlord who is mentionedin the love spell, and Bhima, another famous warrior whose cult spread to Javafrom India along with that of Shiva. Semar's role in Java is to intercede withthese royal and divine figures on behalf of the native Javanese.Both Semar and Bhima figure prominently in some of the temple architecture thatfollows in the next section. Curious carved reliefs on temple walls depict someof the stories told about these two beings that were preserved in various wayangtraditions. For this reason, it is necessary to devote a little space to adiscussion of the enigmatic Bhima.BHIMA (ALSO SPELLED BIMA)Bhima's birth was miraculous. A caul was left in a forest on Java, guarded bySemar and Arjuna. It remained there for years, until a series of cosmic eventssignaled to Shiva that the caul was responsible. Shiva (or Batara Guru,depending on whether you are following the Javanese or the Indian version of thenames of the characters in the wayang) then tells his son, Gajah Sena(“Elephant” Sena), to crack open the caul and kill whoever or whatever isinside. After many trials, Gajah Sena finally manages to break open the caul. Aby-now-teenage boy emerges and “combines” with Gajah Sena to become oneentity—Bhima.Bhima, the son of King Pandu, joins with Arjuna and three others to form thePandava or Pendawa. He is known by several characteristics, most notable amongthem two long and sharp fingernails, one on each hand, that are formidableweapons. His face is black, possibly as the result of incubating in animpenetrable black caul until his release by Gajah Sena. He is known for hishonesty and humility, as well as for his enormous strength and loyalty.Curiously, his name has another association in Javanese—as the Milky Way(translated as bimasakti, literally “Bima Power”). As far as I know, scholarshave not yet established this as an astronomical metaphor, but a story fromAustralia calls our attention to the fact that the Yumu people of the NorthernTerritory conceive of the Milky Way as two beings—a woman and a young boy, inthis case—stuck together in coitus.64 They are considered kangaroo ancestors.Since Bhima is the result of Gajah Sena (an elephant god) and theboy-in-the-caul “sticking together,” it may be that this tale resonates with anancient mythologem concerning this astronomical phenomenon, with a possiblesexual connotation as well.Bhima's wife, Nagagini, was the daughter of the king of the Underworld. As such,Bhima has associations with death and destruction. His nails are said to havecut down trees and slit the throats of fierce demons. He is also depicted asbeing so hungry that all the food in the world would not satisfy him, so he isshown with a flat stomach (indicating his half-starved state).While Bhima is well-known from the Mahabharata, the Javanese wayang versionschange the story, the personalities, and the names of central characters overtime. The addition of Semar is one indication that the tales have been“Javanized,” since Semar does not appear in an Indian context. We will find thishappening in the story of Togog, the personality mentioned in the love spell, aswell.Togog and Batara Guru are the two brothers of Semar. Batara Guru is usuallyassociated with Shiva. Togog, on the other hand (also known as Tejomantri), wasa bad seed. He usually cooperated with unsavory types like giants and evilknights. In a way, he is the evil twin of Semar. According to the story as toldin the wayang, the father of the three brothers threw an egg onto the ground.The shell became Togog, the yolk became Semar, and the white became Batara Guru.The spiritual development of a human being may be seen as analogous, going fromthe ridiculous (Togog) to the sublime (Guru). Semar represents the middle way.Sarcastic, crude, and sometimes obnoxious, his character is nonetheless pure. Hepartakes of the crassness of Togog without betraying his inner self. BataraGuru, however, represents the full realization of the human spirit and itscomplete identification with shakti.UMAAlso known as Parvati and in various other manifestations (including Shakti,Durga, etc.), Uma is generally understood to be the wife of Shiva who, in Java,is also known as Batara Guru. Uma is responsible for the creation of the humanrace (while Semar is the creator of the Javanese race in particular). She doesthis through a kind of stratagem. Since Shiva chooses to ignore her advances ashe maintains his meditative solitude, Uma must seduce him in order for creationto take place. Strangely, however, this approach works, but in a bizarre way.Shiva does not impregnate Uma in the usual way, through penetration; instead, heejaculates into her hand (in some other versions of the story, into her mouth).The seed spills onto the ground and becomes the origin of humanity.This is clearly similar to other creation myths. The Egyptian God Atum is saidto have created the world in the same way, through an act of masturbation thatresulted in the appearance of the gods Shu and Tefnut. He is sometimes shownstanding and holding an erect phallus.65 Since Shu is connected with the air andsky, and Tefnut with moisture and water, there is also an analogue to anotherJavanese myth concerning the embrace of Shiva and Uma, who produced a rainbowand a water buffalo from their union, symbols of sky and water, or moreaccurately of the upper world and the Underworld.66 Indeed, it seems logicalthat a self-created god or a god who preceded creation would perform the act ofcreation solo, and the best way to represent that concept to a somewhatliteral-minded people would be to depict him in the act of masturbation.However, in the creation story of Shiva and Uma, Shiva obviously already has awife and, moreover, one who has instigated the act of creation. There should beno “requirement” for the type of sexual act that Shiva commits. Yet, it is animportant element of the Javanese myth cycle.In another version of the tale—the one that appears in a wayang performanceknown as the Murwa Kala, which is often performed as an exorcism or purificationritual—the goddess Uma rejects Shiva's sexual advances, which results in Shiva'sseed spilling on the ground and creating a monster, Kala. For her perfidy inrejecting Shiva, Uma is transformed into the demon goddess Durga.67Yet, it is not only monsters like Kala who are created from the spilled seed:For the Javanese, creation involves not a sowing, but a spilling of seed ... Thefalling seed becomes stone, the building blocks of the cosmos....68As if to reinforce our own thesis, it happens that the Kalachakra mantra is usedin one version of the Murwa Kala, thus bridging a gap between Javanese mysticism(and traditional wayang performance as purification ritual) and core Tantricsources.69 It is also important to note that the Murwa Kala is still performedtoday, including at the Kraton in Yogyakarta, when there is a perceived need forpurification even at the state level.70The character of Uma is as malleable as the other sacred personalities inJavanese religion. She can become Durga, or Parvati, or a number of other MotherGoddesses, depending on the context. As Uma, she is the Mother Goddess ascreator of life. As Durga, she can be a fierce protector or an enraged demon. AsParvati, she is the loving wife and mother of Ganesha and Skanda. She alsomanifests as Kali, Chandi, and so many others.In a Javanese context, she is often depicted as the wife of Shiva and is alsoconsidered to be one form of Dewi Sri, the rice goddess of Java. Dewi Sri is oneof the most important figures in Javanese culture, for she ensures the fertilityof the rice crop, which is a staple in that country. (Indonesia is thethird-largest producer of rice in the world after China and India.) Rice isgrown in Indonesia using the “wet rice” method, in which rice is grown inhorizontal fields, the paddies (as opposed to the “dry rice” method that usesthe sides of mountains). These paddies are the domain of snakes, as they must bekept constantly irrigated with a steady supply of water. Thus there is acontinuum of ideas between rice, water, and snake spirits. This leads to someconfusion (among outside observers, at any rate) when trying to distinguishbetween Dewi Sri, Uma, the iprit or serpent-women, and even Nyai Lara Kidul ofthe Southern Ocean. That female goddesses and spirits represent—or arerepresented by—moisture and water is perhaps to be expected because ofassociations with menstruation. These various forms of the Mother Goddess may besaid to reflect more their function rather than their form—thus Dewi Sri isrepresented when rice and associations with rice are under consideration, butUma is introduced when concerns about motherhood and creation are the subjectsunder discussion.At heart, however, the mysticism associated with sexuality affects all of theseindividuals, both human and divine, both male and female.Javanists would agree that the mystery of life is contained in reproduction.Analogies of growth and transformation are usually taken from plant life (thetree contained in the seed, etc), but the deepest mystery, and the absorbingfocus of symbolism, is sexual reproduction. Sex is not only an image of union,but of fertile union.71And that is the key to understanding, not only Javanese mysticism, but Tantraitself. While neo-Tantra practitioners focus on the sexual aspect—promisingbetter and longer orgasms, etc.—the “deepest mystery” is fertility. Ourinvestigation of Javanese esoteric practices may very well help us achieve agreater understanding of Tantra.KEBATINAN AND KEJAWEN: OCCULT TECHNIQUESThere are, in general, two different types of Javanese mysticism or occultpractice. The first is called kebatinan, after batin, the Arabic word for“inner” or “hidden.” The other is called kejawen, which comes from the word forJava itself, jawa. In a way, these two words can be considered to represent aninner-directed, mystical spirituality (kebatinan) and an outer-directed esotericpractice (kejawen).Kebatinan involves the cultivation of inner serenity and peace of mind, but canalso result in the acquisition of supernatural powers. It is a return to apre-Islamic mentality, an attempt to re-connect with the Java of theHindu-Buddhist and pre-Hindu-Buddhist culture. It may also be a reinforcement ofJavanese identity, interiorized.Kejawen, on the other hand, manifests in rituals and practices that involve thecommunity as opposed to the individual, like the slematan, or ritual feast. Oneof these rituals, performed for the good of the community or for individualswithin the community, is the Ruwatan rite. As this ritual becomes important inour review of the temples, it is wise to summarize it here.Ruwatan is a purification ritual in the Javanese style. It takes the form of awayang, a cultural performance like the Murwa Kala mentioned above, or theSudamala with which it is often identified. There is the re-enactment of a storythat has its origins in Indian literature, but which—with the passage of timeand the Javanization of its elements—may not be recognizable to Indians anylonger. Some of its dramatis personae are already familiar to us: Semar, Bhima,Uma, and Shiva.The structure of the Ruwatan ritual is similar to most typical wayangperformances. There is a dalang, who is the main puppeteer and who speaks thelines of the play.72 The role of the dalang can be as important as that of adukun, or shaman, when it comes to wayang of ritual significance, for theperformance is ritual and there are resulting effects that are expected by theobservers and participants. The wayang is usually performed behind a screen,with the images of the puppets projected onto the back of the screen by thedalang, so that only their shadows are seen by the audience. This is interestingfrom a psychological point of view. Although the puppets themselves areintricately designed and often gorgeously painted, the audience sees only theirshadows—that is, their influence or effect and not their essential spirit, as ifthe radiance of their souls is hidden from view. In a sense, this is similar tothe way many religions understand God; we can perceive God's effects, but notactually see the face of God itself. Even Moses was never able to look God inthe face, but was burned by God's radiance (Exodus 33: 20–23).Another interesting point about the wayang is that it mimics modernfilmprojection technology, but in a pre-electric-power context. It is as if thepeople who developed wayang more than a millennium ago had seen a modern movietheater. There is the screen, and a lamp behind the screen that throws theshadows of the puppets onto the screen, where they are seen by the audience. Thepuppeteers are out of sight, and there is a constant voice and musicalaccompaniment.Wayang kulit, or wayang using flat puppets cut from pieces of leather, is themost common form of wayang and the one with which most foreigners are familiar.There are other forms, some using wooden dolls more closely resemblingWestern-style puppets, but wayang kulit gives us the traditional form ofJavanese theater.The Sudamala (a term meaning “to lessen misfortune” or “to remove evil”) and theMurwa Kala are used to purify a person (or an entire community) who has had arun of bad luck. It operates as an exorcism, or as a general purification rite.It tells a story, like all wayang, but is attended with a greater degree ofsolemnity appropriate to the situation. In brief, the story is about therelationship between Shiva and Uma, and how Uma was cursed for rejecting Shiva'sadvances. In another version, she is cursed because she was told to bringmedicine for Shiva and she spilled it. In yet another version, she has an affairwith another god, or is forced to have sex with a man who owns the medicine (inthis case, the milk from a virgin black cow, an image that is itself fraughtwith Tantric significance). There is also a version in which she is responsiblefor spilling amrita over the earth or into the Underworld. In any event, shebecomes Durga, the demon goddess of the Underworld, until she is rescued by thePandava brothers and exorcised.The main rescuers are Sadewa, or Sahadeva, and his twin brother, Nakula. Whattranspires is an explanation for the existence of evil in the world that is verysimilar to the Sumerian story of the Descent of Inanna.73 We have a goddess whodescends to the Underworld and is rescued by two beings who pour the Water ofLife over her.In the version of this story called the Murwa Kala, Uma's transgression—whateverit may be, depending on the version presented—results in the creation of an evilcreature, Kala, who delights in human flesh. This demon must be controlled, andeventually Shiva accomplishes this feat by incarnating as a dalang himself andinstructing Kala to repair to a specific place in the forest, away from humancompany. Kala does this, but asks for supplies to take with him. These suppliesare the basic necessities for life, and they form part of the sacrifices thatdevotees make during the rite.The Murwa Kala ritual requires that the persons afflicted (called sukerta, whichrefers to their congenital or accidental status as bearers of bad luck accordingto a complicated formula) be bathed in water and have their hair cutsymbolically (a few strands), after which the wayang performance proceeds. Thereare also sacrificial offerings in the form of specific types of food. The dalangmust be a spiritually advanced person, or at the very least respected as aspiritual leader. Many of the spoken elements of the Murwa Kala (andSudamala-style wayang in general) are chanted; they are in the form of mantras,including a mantra from the Kalachakra Tantra, as well as diagrams called rajah,which are Javanese versions of yantras (in this case, Rajah Kalachakras).In the Sudamala version that is depicted on the walls of Candi Sukuh, Umabecomes the demon Durga, who must be saved; she is also the mother of Kala, theflesh-devouring monster.74 In both cases, water is an essential component of thestory and of the ritual itself. As we will see in the photographs of CandiSukuh, there is ample evidence that water was an essential part of the Tantricrituals performed there. This water may represent amrita, the water of life andimmortality.One of the offerings at these cleansing rituals is porridge, both white and red.The significance of these two colors has not escaped the attention ofanthropologists, who see in it another Tantric survival, with the redrepresenting the female aspect of nature—blood, especially menstrual blood—andwhite representing the male aspect, semen.75 This idea of the red and whiterepresenting female and male principles is echoed in the texts and iconographyof Western alchemical literature as well, as in the emblems of European andAmerican secret societies, as we shall see. In Tantra, the two kapalas, or skullcups, used in rituals to propitiate the deities are also used in the samefashion, one being filled with red liquid (wine or blood) and the other withwhite (milk or seminal fluid).A central feature of the wayang is a “puppet” that is not really a puppet, inthe sense of an anthropomorphic character, but instead is a representation ofMount Meru, the axis mundi and center of the Javanese universe. It is called thegunungan(after the Javanese word for “mountain,” gunung) or kakayon(after theJavanese word for “tree,” kayu). It is a symmetrical figure, roughly pyramidalor coneshaped, that stands in the center of the performance area behind thescreen. As can be seen by the words used to describe it, it is understood aseither the mountain in the center of the world or as the tree in the center ofthe world. These are both memes that are understood in many cultures asrepresenting the axis of the world. Both the tree and the mountain reach to theheavens, but have their foundation in the earth. Like Jacob's Ladder, theyenable an ascent to celestial heights (Genesis 28:11-19). The fact that “tree”and “mountain” are used interchangeably as names for the same object in wayangsuggests an ancient heritage—whether Hindu or indigenous Javanese—for thisconcept.In Javanese culture, the axis mundi is also found in the Kraton—in the palace ofthe sultans, particularly in Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo). In Yogyakarta, theKraton is located halfway between the active volcano Merapi to the north and theIndonesian Ocean to the south, thus reinforcing topographically the metaphysicalconcept. The sultan himself, therefore, is the earthly representative of BataraGuru (Shiva), united with his Shakti. That identity is reinforced when we speakof the relationship between the sultan and what anthropologist G. J. Resnikcalls his “second divine spouse”—the Serpent Queen of the Southern Sea, NyaiLara Kidul, who, as much as any other deity (Uma, Parvati, Kali, Durga),represents Shakti.76There have been performances of Ruwatan at the Kratons both in Yogyakarta and inSurakarta even in recent memory. In 1998, the Murwa Kala was performed at theSurakarta Kraton on behalf of the Suhunan (equivalent to Sultan) of Surakarta,Pakubuwono XII, and his family.77Another public ritual that is performed with regularity in Java is the slematan,or ritual feast. Since this ritual does not figure prominently in the Tantrictemples, we will not devote a lot of space to it here. In brief, the slematan isa type of communal sacrifice that is offered to ask for favors or to givethanks. The word comes from slemat, a Javanese variant of the Arabic selam orsalaam, meaning “peace.” Its timing depends on the Javanese calendar, but it isusually held in the evening after the evening prayer. According to pioneeranthropologist Clifford Geertz and Niels Mulder, it is the central rite ofJavanese who consider themselves perhaps nominal Muslims, but nonetheless trueJavanese.78 It is sometimes used to heal or cleanse a community by bringingeveryone together at a shared meal.One should not underestimate or ignore the role that community plays in Javanesesociety. A Javanese community—especially in the smaller towns and villages, thekampung or desa— is a kind of extended family guided by principles of status, ofrelations between neighbors and families, and of what is considered halus, orgraceful, smooth, and polite behavior. Javanese village society has managed towithstand more than 1000 years of foreign influence—both benign and malignant—byreinforcing communal identity, often at the expense of individuality. That isnot to say that Javanese are hostile to foreigners or foreign ideas; far fromit. But they are understandably cautious, and manage to incorporate that whichthey believe is useful or helpful into their own context. In this, perhaps, theyare not much different from any other culture.The slematan, therefore, performs a function of bringing harmony back into acommunity that may have become unbalanced due to conflicts or environmental orother calamities, or to give thanks for the birth of a healthy child, or toensure good luck for a long voyage. While we may not come across too manyinstances of the slematan in our investigation, it is worthwhile to carry withus its main message of the seriousness with which the Javanese take communityand social harmony.While wayang and slematan may typify the social culture of kejawen, thetechniques of kebatinan are more private and are directed toward the spiritualcultivation of the individual—although not at the expense of the community, orelse it would not have become such a common aspect of Javanese culture. Itsvalue to the community rests in the taming of the passions and mundane concernsof an individual so that he or she can exert a gentle, nurturing, spiritualeffect on the community. Meditation, fasting, and prayer are essential aspectsof kebatinan, known under the general rubric of latihan or “exercises.” Thispractice is directed toward the heart of those who follow it—to bring it closerto God. Those who practice latihan kebatinan regularly are said to have acalming influence on those around them.These methods are learned at the feet of a guru kebatinan, a teacher of the art.What are known as aliran kebatinan—mystical groups—grow up around the morefamous of the gurus. Some of the more famous and better-organized of theseinclude Subud and Sapta Darma. Subud has been exported successfully to the Westand Subud chapters can be found worldwide today. Sapta Darma is more locallyIndonesian and specifically Javanese; their logo shows Semar in the center of atriangle with their slogan in Javanese script running around it. The goal ofthese groups is the training of something called the rasa, or the inner,intuitive self. This usually requires a period of asceticism (or tapa), duringwhich this refinement of the rasa can take place. It was during just such aperiod of asceticism that Batara Guru, or Shiva, was disturbed by Uma in oneversion of the Sudamala. (We recall that this story involves the spilling ofseed onto the earth: in some contexts, the word rasa, or intuitive self, mayalso mean “semen.”79)The teaching of the cultivation of rasa may take place in the guru's home, butgroups often meet at places considered particularly sacred or potent. Thesekramatan, as they are called, can be located in cemeteries—as is Tantriccustom—or they may be shrines, old temples, or a place in the wild that isbelieved to possess its own particular shakti. Gunung Lawu, the mountain that ishome to Candi Sukuh and Candi Ceto, is also home to a number of ascetics andhermits who draw strength and spiritual sustenance from the very ground itself.Many of the people who live nearby are known to practice a form of spiritualitythat has much more in common with Hindu and Buddhist ritual than orthodoxIslamic ritual.One form of latihan kebatinan is the dhikr. Familiar to those who study Islamicmysticism, dhikr is the constant repetition of the name of God in an effort toreach a deep trance state. Virtually identical to the Indian practice of mantraand the Eastern Orthodox “Jesus Prayer,” this Sufi practice was embraced inIndonesia very early on. In fact, the Sufis had a profound impact on IndonesianIslam and on Javanese spiritual ideas and practices, as they were among thefirst groups to arrive on the islands before the more normative sects.The combination of Sufism with Hindu and Buddhist Tantra is a heady mixture.While anthropologists like Geertz write of syncretism, it might be better tocall the result a kind of synthesis of the best of all the techniques—asynthesis by informed and capable spiritual specialists who discerned the valuein each of the methods to which they were introduced. Sufism is already a formof batin, of inner spiritual practice. Tantra, both Hindu and Buddhist, isanother form. They differ in some outward appearances and in ritual—andcertainly in the metaphysics and philosophy behind them. But in certainessential ways, they are similar technologies aiming at the same goal. They usethe functions of the body, of the nervous system in particular, as tools toachieve direct awareness of the divine. The rajah of the Javanese and theyantras of the Indians—the dhikr of the Sufis and the mantras of the Hindus andBuddhists—are cultural refinements of an engineered approach to spiritualitythat eschews theological hair-splitting and dogmatic combat in favor of actualexperience. Like Cold War scientists on either side of the Iron Curtain, theseSufis, Hindus, Buddhists, and Javanese gurus spoke the same language andunderstood each other far better than their leaders. They were fascinated witheach other's findings, the research taking place on the other side of the greatdivide of culture, religion, and politics. They did not care as much forideology as they did for the practicality of what they were studying.This aroused the ire of conservative religious groups, of course. As an example,what is known as kebatinan and kejawen is frowned upon by conservative Muslimsin Java. Religio-political parties like Muhammadiyah would like these “nominalMuslims” (called abangan, to differentiate them from santri, or orthodoxMuslims) to abandon their “animistic” beliefs and practices and become normativeMuslims. But occultism has always had an allure that transcends theologicaldifferences.Eventually, the fact that this “pure science” of esoteric practice could be putto use for political and military purposes inevitably occurred to the kings andprinces and sultans who incorporated Tantra into their palace ceremonies andwho, in some cases, came very close to identifying themselves with the Divine.42 Nils Bubandt, “Sorcery, corruption and the dangers of democracy inIndonesia,” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), 2006, 12, p.413.43 This is not to say that the eruption was “punishment” for an imagined seriesof sins or religious infractions, as infamously was suggested by the IndonesianCommunications and Information Technology Minister in a way that was reminiscentof the remarks by Evangelical minister Pat Robertson concerning the sins of thevictims of America's Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans (Al Makin, “Mythicalperceptions of nature and survival,” The Jakarta Post, 8 November 2010).44 See for instance, R.

AUnited Nations World Heritage site, it is the largest Buddhist building in theworld. Built in the late eighth century CE, it was covered by a mountain ofMerapi's volcanic ash some centuries later and basically forgotten; whether thiswas due solely to the volcanic eruption or to a shift in political power isstill debatable. Located less than an hour's drive northwest of Yogyakarta, itwas not discovered again until the 19th century, when a team began to dig it outof the ash and soil that had covered it for centuries.What they found was staggering—nothing less than a massive mandala carved instone. Borodubur is not a temple per se—it has no interior cella, no altar, nohall for prayer or meditation or sacrifice. It is an open-air pyramid withvirtually every inch of its surface intricately carved, mostly with stories fromthe life of Buddha. It rises majestically to be crowned by seventy-two“perforated” stupas, each of which once held a statue of a sitting Buddha. Thelast, commanding stupa at the very top was kept empty, signifying the Void.Image [images/p083-001.jpg]Borobudur TempleImage [images/p084-001.jpg]Ground plan of Borobudur, from a 19th-century text.Above is shown the ground plan of Borobudur. The concentric circles in thecenter show the locations of seventy-two stupas, each containing a Buddhastatue. Yet for all of this, there is still some controversy over whether or notBorobudur was always a Buddhist edifice. Some scholars suggest that it beganlife as a Hindu monument, but gradually became a Buddhist one. Others go so faras to suggest the opposite. It is possible that the confusion comes from thefact that the type of religion that was practiced in Java at that time was afusion or synthesis of Shiva Tantra and Buddhist Tantra, for the monument hasbeen accepted by most scholars to be Tantric. Since we have such a difficulttime identifying what is and is not Tantric, it is no wonder that this confusionhas extended to architecture as well. Yet, the Dalai Lama came to Java in 1983to consecrate Borobudur as a shrine of Vajrayana Buddhism, which is, as we havediscussed, Tantric. That indicates that Borobudur is not only the largestBuddhist monument in the world, but the largest Tantric Buddhist monument aswell.The dimensions of Borobudur are one indication of its grandeur. Its basemeasures 123 meters × 123 meters, or 403 feet × 403 feet. The total height fromthe base to the top of the stupa is 35 meters, or about 115 feet. It consists ofsix square platforms rising from the first platform at the base and ascending insuccessively smaller platforms, until it is topped by three circular levels witha large central stupa at the summit. There are 2672 reliefs comprised of 1460narrative panels and 1212 decorative panels, for a total of 2500 square meters(or nearly 27,000 square feet) of decorated surface area. And that doesn'tinclude the thirty-two lion guardians (eight on each side) and 100 rainwaterspouts carved in the image of makaras—strange sea creatures associated withwater, possibly crocodiles, but also similar to a type of fresh-water dolphinknown to inhabit the Ganges River in India. The Hindi word makar refers to thiscreature as the vehicle of both the goddess Ganga (who incarnated as the GangesRiver) and the god Varuna, who is a god of the ocean as well as of the MilkyWay. Moreover, the term also refers to the astrological sign of Capricorn which,in the West, is a half-goat, half-fish creature, and in India is a fish creaturewith four legs and a long snout with sharp teeth.On the following page is one example of a makara at Borobudur.The first level of Borobudur is not visible, but remains buried. It is calledthe “hidden foot” and contains 160 panels depicting the world of human desiresand the effects that they cause. No one is certain why the level is hidden. Onetheory is that this was due to a construction concern. After the base was carvedand the succeeding layers placed on top of it, the base layer may have shiftedor had its integrity somehow compromised, leading the engineers to pile eartharound it in an effort to shore up the rest of the structure. Another theory isthat the structure began as a Hindu shrine and was later transformed into aBuddhist one, so that the message of the first layer was superseded by themessage of the top layers.There is also some evidence that Borobudur was originally sited in the midst ofan ancient lake and was therefore surrounded by water early in its existence.Even the name Borobudur is an enigma, for no one seems to know what it means. Infact, there are so many mysteries surrounding this incredible feat of art andconstruction that one author writes of the need to “decode” it.2Years of analysis of the six levels of reliefs has yielded the conviction thatsome of the panels represent stories from the life of the Buddha before hisincarnation as Siddhartha, stories that come from Buddhist texts known as theJatakas. In addition, texts from various other Buddhist scriptures arerepresented as well, sometimes mixed together in no discernible order. Thesetexts include the Gandavyuha and the Avadanas.Image [images/p086-001.jpg]A makara at Borobudur.The Gandavyuha is a kind of Buddhist “Pilgrim's Progress.” The hero, PrinceSudhana, is sent on a quest to find wisdom by Manjusri, a bodhisattva who isvery important to Tibetan Buddhism (particularly the Gelugpa or “Yellow Hat”sect represented by the Dalai Lama) and to esoteric forms of Buddhism ingeneral. After many trials and encounters, including long periods in meditationalong the way, Sudhana encounters Maitreya (the so-called “Buddha of the Future”who has not yet incarnated), then returns to Manjusri and visits otherbodhisattvas, eventually achieving his goal of complete spiritual illumination.The Avadanas are accounts of famous Buddhist stories and saints, including, inthis case, the tale of Princess Manohara, who was saved by Prince Sudhanakumara.Manohara was a kinnari—a creature that is half-human (in this case female) andhalf-bird. These creatures may be seen in several reliefs at Borobudur andPrambanan, and at other temples, and their appearance is rather startling amongall of the purely anthropomorphic deities ones come across. They are usuallydepicted in pairs—kinnara (male) and kinnari (female)—and they are said to matefor life.Image [images/p087-001.jpg]A kinnara-kinnari pair from Prambanan temple standing at either side of a Treeof Life, the Kalpataru.The Tree of Life, or Kalpataru, was said to have appeared at the famous Churningof the Milk Ocean, and is regarded as a wish-fulfilling tree. Not much else isknown about its origins, nor is it known if it refers to a real tree, althoughthere has been some attempt to identify it with the banyan tree, of which thereare many in Southeast Asia.Aside from the more than 2000 reliefs at Borobudur, there are the three majorlevels that contain them. The first level—the “hidden foot”—is said to refer tothe Sphere of Desires, the Kamadhatu (Kama means “desires”; dhatu means “world”or “realm”). This is the realm of animal instincts and the other moresophisticated desires that originate there: love of money, power, etc.The five square levels are said to represent the Sphere of Forms, the Rupadhatu.Those who manage to conquer their desires reach this sphere, but they are stillin darkness, for this is the sphere of names, forms, and illusions.Image [images/p088-001.jpg]An example of the dhyana mudra, the gesture of meditation.The three circular levels represent Arupadhatu, the Sphere of Formlessness,which is the goal of the devotee. The last level is that of the great stupa atthe very top of Borobudur. This is the stupa that contains ... nothing. Itrepresents absolute attainment in the Buddhist sense of advaita, non-dualism.Thus the whole edifice is said to represent Mount Meru, the cosmic center of theuniverse, the axis mundi. It is to Java what the pyramids are to Egypt, and whatthe ziggurats were to Babylon and Sumer. In fact, Borobudur is almost perfectlyaligned with the points of the compass, with only a slight deviation. The famousziggurat at Ur is also aligned with the compass, except that it is the cornersthat are aligned, whereas it is the sides of Borobudur that face the fourdirections. Another difference is that Borobudur is so heavily decorated on itsexterior walls that we are left with an incredible text in stone. Imagine ifeach immense block of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh bore an intricate carving ofgods, goddesses, and stories from the Egyptian scriptures such that one couldfollow a narrative from the lowest level to the very top.Image [images/p089-001.jpg]A better image of the dhyana mudra.To reinforce the idea of Borobudur as Mount Meru and as a vast mandala in stone,the Buddha statues themselves reveal more mystery, more intricacies. Each of theBuddhas is carved with a specific gesture, or mudra. The mudra shown above andon the previous page is called the dhyana mudra, the gesture of meditation. Thisis associated with Amitabha Buddha, and the cardinal direction of the west.The photo on the following page depicts the bhumisparsa mudra, associated withthe Buddha Aksobhya of the eastern quadrant. The word bhumi means earth, and itrefers to the moment when Buddha attained enlightenment and called the earth asa witness. It also refers to the subjugation of the demons under their king,Mara, when Mara attempted to seduce the Buddha away from his meditations with astring of beautiful women. The photo shows the length of the eastern wall ofBorobudur, with an array of Buddha statues in various states of disrepair, butall showing the same bhumisparsa mudra. There are twenty Buddha statues visiblein this photograph and, although many of them show serious damage, it is stillpossible to get an idea of the grandeur of this edifice.Image [images/p090-001.jpg]The eastern wall of Borobudur. The twenty Buddhas display the bhumisparsa mudraassociated with the Buddha Aksobhya of the eastern quadrant.The next image shows the vara mudra, the gesture of charity, which is associatedwith the Tantric deity Ratnasambhava and the south. Note in the photograph thatthere are creatures at either side of the Buddha—what appear to be little impsholding up the wall. These are called ganas. They are servitors of the Hindu godShiva that predate the arrival of Buddhism by perhaps 1000 years. In fact, thename of the elephant-headed god Ganesha comes from the Sanskrit root gana, whichmeans a group or a tribe, or some type of assembly. In Hinduism, ganas residemainly in charnel grounds and cemeteries, which again reinforces some opinionsthat Borobudur reflects a Tantric viewpoint rather than a purely Mahayanaperspective.In the Borobudur reliefs, it is common to find these ganas sitting atop pillars.These pillars are “reversible,” in that their structure is the same whether welook at them from the top down, or the bottom up. Their perfect symmetry may bean allusion to the vajra, or thunderbolt device used by Tantrikas as a symbol ofShiva's power. It would be consistent with the association of the ganas asShiva's assistants, who hold up the cosmos on the god's behalf (like Atlas inGreek mythology).Image [images/p091-001.jpg]The vara mudra is associated with the Tantric deity Ratnasambhava and the south.The creatures at either side of the Buddha are called ganas.Due to the deterioration of most of the Buddha statues—missing arms andsometimes heads—we do not have a good example of the other two mudras to show insitu. However, we do have examples of mudras from other reliefs at Borobudur,like that on the following page, which shows the abhaya mudra, the gesture thatprotects from fear. It is associated with the north and with Buddha Amogasiddhi,an important Vajrayana deity whose consort is Tara.The mudra that represents the center or the zenith is the dharma chakra mudra,which represents turning the Wheel of the Dharma, or Law. Associated with theBuddha Vairochana, it consists of holding both hands at chest level with thefingers of the right and left hands touching to suggest the turning of theWheel. Unfortunately, there are no good representations of a Buddha statue atBorobudur showing this mudra, since many of them have lost arms or hands, andthose that haven't are only visible from about the waist up. We do, however,have the example shown on the next page from the dim interior of Chandi Mendut—atemple associated with the Borobudur complex—that shows Buddha in an unusualposition: sitting upright, on a throne, as if to emphasize kingship.Image [images/p092-001.jpg]The abhaya mudra that protects from fear is associated with the north and withBuddha Amogasiddhi, a Vajrayana deity whose consort is Tara.These Buddha statues, with their associated mudras, are quite explicitly Tantricin that they represent the five Dhyani Buddhas or the Five Wisdom Tathagatas.They are always associated with the five directions (the four cardinal pointsplus the center) and they have their origin in Vajrayana (Tibetan Tantric)Buddhism. This is a strong argument in favor of the identification of Borobuduras a Tantric monument, but there are still scholars who debate this. A system ofcorrespondences that equates a particular Buddha with a specific mudra, cardinaldirection, and—in the classic Vajrayana system—other attributes like colors,psychological states, or philosophical concepts indicates an esoteric, magicalstructure that is somewhat at odds with pure Mahayana Buddhist thought andpractice and seems more likely to represent some form of Tantra.Image [images/p093-001.jpg]The dharma chakra mudra represents the turning of the Wheel of the Dharma, orLaw, and is associated with the Buddha Vairochana.The so-called “perforated” stupas are themselves marvels of religiousarchitecture. Arranged along the three circular platforms of the Arupadhatu (theFormless World) with a total of thirty-two on the first level, twenty-four onthe second, and sixteen on the top level (below the main stupa), they numberseventy-two in all. It is important to note that these numbers are all divisibleby eight, which is a sacred number in Buddhism that refers to the Eight-foldNoble Path, an eight-step way to end suffering (Right Mindfulness, RightConcentration, Right Effort, Right Livelihood, Right Action, Right Speech, RightIntentions, Right View). Seventy-two also has resonance with Jewish mysticismand the Shem-ha-Mephorash, the Divine Name of seventy-two letters.Each perforated stupa once contained a sitting Buddha showing the same gesture:the dharma chakra mudra. There were more than 500 Buddhas of various types atBorobudur and, of these, more than 340 are either missing or damaged, leaving atmost 160 intact. Some of the damage was doubtless due to environmental factors,for Borobudur was buried under volcanic ash and soil for centuries. In othercases, it is entirely possible that the heads of the statues were taken and soldto museums and private collectors in the lucrative underground antiquitiesmarket.Stupas were generally built as shrines for relics of the dead, particularly ofsaints. Thus, the seventy-two perforated stupas on the three levels of theArupadhatu may signify seventy-two Buddhist saints, although as mentioned, eachof them contained a Buddha performing the dharma chakra mudra. It is possiblethat the main stupa in the very center of Borobudur once housed a relic ofGautama Buddha himself, but this has not been proven nor is there any textualevidence to support the idea.What was the purpose or function behind the construction of Borobudur?Several theories have been proposed, but strongest among them is that Borobudurmay have started as a temple or as a shrine for a particularly sacred relic, butthat, as time went on, the monument took on a purpose of its own. The structureis part of an axis comprised of three temples or chandi: Borobudur, Mendut, andPawon. These three buildings lie in a straight line, with Mendut and Pawonleading the way to Borobudur, which lies at the end of a ceremonial road. ThatBorobudur may have served as an initiatory device is a definite possibility.Visitors are told that one would walk up each level and around it entirely,bearing left and keeping the reliefs always on their right, taking note of thereliefs and the stories concerning the Buddha and the quest for spiritualillumination before ascending to the next level. The entire process eventuallyleads to the Formless Realm where there are no reliefs, only the stupas with thesitting Buddhas. Finally, at the very end of the path, lies the main—empty—stupaas a symbol of ultimate enlightenment, of samadhi.Image [images/p095-001.jpg]ABOVE: A group of “perforated” stupas with the main stupa rising in thebackground.BELOW: Another group of stupas at Borobudur.Image [images/p095-002.jpg]In Javanese spirituality, the center, or zenith, of the palace or kraton is alsothe center of the kingdom and the axis mundi. It is a place occupied by both thesultan or king and his consort, his shakti. In Babylonian spirituality, the topof the ziggurat served the same purpose. Once a year, the king ascended to thetop of the pyramid, where an empty room—and the presence of the goddess—awaitedhim. Some argue that the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalemserved the same purpose and, indeed, this has been claimed in the Gnostictexts.3 If, as some insist, Borobudur is a Tantric edifice, is it possible thatsome sort of hieros gamos or sacred wedding once took place in the main, centralstupa? Since this type of mystical union at the palace level did take place inJava—and continues to take place to this day—there is some degree of internalconsistency to the idea.What argues against the idea of Borobudur as a typical Tantric temple is theexistence of the reliefs, which represent scenes from Buddhist scriptures, as wehave seen. Yet, there is something a little odd about this fact, for there areno Buddhist structures anywhere in India that are designed the same way. Thereis no temple or shrine in which more than 1000 scenes are depicted in so muchdetail. In this respect, Borobudur is an instruction manual, and a scripture instone. But what is being taught?As mentioned above, the reliefs on the five visible rectangular levels depictscenes from the Jataka, Avadana, and Gandavyuha Sutras. The Jataka Sutracontains stories relating to the birth of Buddha; these are probably includeddue to their popularity as a kind of “humanizing” of the Buddha. The AvadanaSutra deals with various stories relating to Buddhist personalities (“saints”)and their quest for enlightenment. The Gandavyuha Sutra tells us of the quest ofSudhana and is especially important to Vajrayana Buddhism; it is the lastchapter of the much longer Avatamsaka Sutra and is usually studied as a separatedocument in its own right.The specific themes of the Avadana Sutra that are represented at Borobudur arequite similar to the scenes of the Gandavyuha Sutra. In the former, we havePrince Sudhanakumara and his rescue of Princess Manohara, the kinnari. In thelatter, we have Prince Sudhana and his quest for enlightenment. Thesepersonalities—Sudhana and Sudhanakumara—are actually one and the same. Thesuffix kumara means “prince” or “young, unmarried male.” Thus, what we may havein the scenes of the Avadana and Gandavyuha Sutras depicted at Borobudur are theexploits of Sudhana before he begins his quest for enlightenment (Avadana) andduring his quest (Gandavyuha).Image [images/p097-001.jpg]Another Borobudur stupa.Sudhana's marriage to a kinnari may indicate a deeper Tantric message. The ideaof a prince whose princess disappears and must be found is a familiar one inIndian literature. The most famous example, of course, is the Ramayana, in whichSita, Lord Rama's beautiful bride, is seized by the demon Ravana and must berescued. In the Avadana story at Borobudur, Princess Manohara—the half-woman,half-bird creature—is forced to flee Sudhana's kingdom while the latter is awayat war. She returns to her native land, and Sudhana is forced to find her thereand win her back after an archery contest.Thus, in the Avadana tale, Sudhana goes on a quest to find and bring back hisbride. The bride's kingdom is none other than Kailash, the famous sacredmountain of Tibetan Buddhism and Tantric Hinduism. To the Hindus, Mount Kailashis the abode of Shiva and Parvati, the archetypal Tantric couple.In the Gandavyuha tale, Sudhana is again on a sacred mission, only this time, itis for his own personal illumination. During the course of this quest, he visitsa total of fifty-two sages and mystics, gathering important information fromeach one, until he finally realizes that the secret to enlightenment was withinhim all along.We may suggest that these two stories have a lot in common, and that they wereselected deliberately because they are related on a deeper level than is obviousat first glance. The Avadana story of Sudhana and Manohara can be interpreted asa dualist approach to spiritual integration, while the Gandavyuha tale is anondualist version. In the first, we have a man and wife who are separated andthen re-united. The wife is a spiritual creature, a hybrid being who lives in anenchanted kingdom and thus may be construed as a source of spiritual power, ofshakti. The union of the earth and the heavens, the mundane and the divine, isrepresented by Sudhana and Manohara.In the second tale, Sudhana goes on his spiritual quest alone. It is strictly aboy's club at this point: fifty-two male sages, including two of the most famousin Buddhist (and especially Tantric Buddhist) lore: Manjusri and Maitreya.Sudhana, therefore, becomes the stand-in for humanity in general, a means ofidentifying with both the austere spiritual quest of the Buddha and with theTantric practice concerned with balancing male and female aspects ofconsciousness. There are many Jatakas, many Avadanas, and of course many sutrasgenerally. The selection process that resulted in the emphasis on Sudhana andhis various quests in the reliefs at Borobudur thus appears deliberate andmeaningful.In a paper written by the independent Java expert J. L. Moens, an attempt ismade to underscore Borobudur's importance as both an initiatory center and amechanism for consecrating the dynasty of the rulers that had created it: theSailendras.4 According to Moens, many scholars ignore the most obvious factabout the shrine—the four stairways that descend from the main stupa down thefour sides of the edifice. To Moens, this indicates that Borobudur was a devicefor incarnating the divine light, a devavatara or “descent from the sky” stupathat combined with the pedagogical nature of the entire building (its dharmachakra pravartana, or the “turning of the Wheel of the Law”) to produce a kindof two-way traffic (like Jacob's Ladder). As the Buddha incarnates and spreadsthe light of his illumination downward, so the rest of humanity—by following theinstructions and the inspiration revealed in the three levels of the temple—canascend the staircases and attain unity. This had special implications for therulers who built Borobudur, for they considered themselves chakravartins: thosewho turn the Wheel. To quote Moens:For the devavatara type of stupa implies the noble birth of the king ... whereasthe dharmachakra-pravartana type emphasizes the fact that the king based hischakravartinship on his Buddha status ... [H] is dynasty ... was supernaturallyendowed for the exercise of its worldly power. Consequently the massive edificeof Barabudur [sic] not only was the spiritual center of the realm, but also thepolitical center of the kingdom.5Mark Long, a translator of Moens who has written extensively on Borobudur, hasdiscovered evidence to prove that Borobudur was a supreme example of sacredarchitecture, what is known as Vaastu: the Vedic equivalent of the Chinesesystem of Feng Shui.6 Further, the Tantric element found at Borobudur—and at theaccompanying chandi of Mendut and Pawon—is inescapable. The arrangement of theirspecific Buddhas and their mudras is completely consistent with VajrayanaBuddhism and, in particular, the cult of Vairochana, who symbolizes Emptiness,or shunyata, and at the same time is shown using the dharma chakra mudra.This identification of political rulers with spiritual enlightenment is mostpronounced, of course, in Tibetan history. The Dalai Lama is at once the head ofthe Tibetan government-in-exile and its most famous religious leader. Tibet wasa theocracy until the Chinese invasions, and the Sailendras of Java were nodifferent. Thus it should come as no surprise that the Dalai Lama himself cameto consecrate Borobudur as a Vajrayana shrine.In ancient times, there was no “separation of church and state.” The secularrulers of Java were also its spiritual leaders, especially in the esoteric sensethat they embodied the shakti of the land, of the kingdom. The correctperformance of rituals not only ensured the success and prosperity of theirkingdoms, it also helped to reinforce the idea in the minds of the people thatthe kings had a “divine right” to rule. While we may regard this cynically, itis entirely possible that this was a mutually dependent relationship. Therituals performed at Borobudur may very well have created the atmospherenecessary for the peaceful pursuit of secular goals. When things did not gotheir way, the failure of the kings could be perceived as a sign from the godsof divine displeasure, thus giving the people the moral right to choose otherleaders.This mythologem of sex, power, spirituality, and politics is one that we willencounter again and again, making Java an excellent example of what the medievalEuropean monk and magician Giordano Bruno called “the link.”72 John Miksic, Marcello Tranchini, Anita Tranchini, Borobudur: Golden Tales ofthe Buddhas (Jakarta: Periplus Editions Ltd., 1991, 2004), p. 45.3 See, for instance, the Gospel of Philip (II, 3) from the Nag Hammadi scrolls.4 J.

Located to the east of Yogyakarta, Prambanan is a clearexample of Hindu architecture and iconography. Dedicated to the Trimurti(Trinity) of the three most important gods of Indian religion—Brahma, Shiva, andVishnu—Prambanan contains all the elements we expect to find in any Hindu templecomplex. There are lingga and yoni, statues of the gods, and accommodations forthe Homa, or fire ritual. Scenes from the Ramayana abound, as well as depictionsof sages and gurus.Prambanan (also a UNESCO World Heritage site) was built about the same time asBorobudur. While the latter is considered Buddhist in nature, Prambanan isHindu. The reasons for building two such different temples at the same time, atopposite sides of what would become Yogyakarta, are still open to conjecture.While both sites may be considered Tantric, their approach is decidedlydifferent.Image [images/p101-001.jpg]Prambanan Temple.Image [images/p102-001.jpg]Some of the 224 ancillary temples at Prambanan.There are three main temples at Prambanan, with that of Shiva, located in thecenter of the complex, being the largest. Those for Brahma and Vishnu areshorter and are located at either side of Shiva. In addition, there are smallertemples for Nandi, the mount of Shiva (usually portrayed as a white ox or bull)and for Hamsa, the Swan of Brahma, and a temple for Garuda, the mount of Vishnu.These six temples—plus two small “flanking temples” (candi apit) whose functionis unknown at this time—are in the center of what is actually a huge complexcomprising more than 200 separate temples and shrines. Most of these are interrible states of disrepair and amount to little more than piles of stoneswhose original purposes can only be imagined. This was the state of the complexwhen it was “discovered” by men working for Sir Thomas Raffles in the 19thcentury. While some restoration work was begun and the center complex restoredto its former glory, a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions has sincethreatened the site again. When the author first visited Prambanan in 2007,access was drastically limited due to the 2006 earthquake that had devastatedmuch of the region to the east of Yogyakarta. It was in better condition in2010, but the complex close to Prambanan, Candi Sewu, was still in the processof being rebuilt after the tremors knocked down huge stones from the many templebuildings there.Image [images/p103-001.jpg]The central Shiva temple at Prambanan.The photograph on page 102 shows some of the 224 ancillary temples at Prambananthat are still in a state of ruin. The number and arrangement of thesetemples—called Perwaras, or “bridesmaids”—has led some observers to suggest thatthere was an astronomical purpose behind the design.8 There are fifty-sixancillary temples per quadrant—which is interesting from a Western esotericperspective, for it is the number of cards in the so-called Minor Arcana of thetraditional tarot deck. The Minor Arcana have astronomical associations,according to complex calculations put forward by the founders of the Britishesoteric group The Golden Dawn.9 In the case of Prambanan, these perwaras arebelieved to be connected to the position of the sun at its highest point, orzenith, 112 days after or before (112 × 2 = 224) the June solstice at the timePrambanan was being built, around the ninth century CE.The central Shiva temple, on page 103, is the tallest of the complex, measuring47 meters (154 feet) in height. The main, eastern chamber of the temple houses alarge statue of the god, and chambers on either side house Durga (north chamber)and Ganesha (west chamber), with a statue of Shiva Mahaguru (Great Teacher) inthe southern chamber. Durga, of course, is one manifestation of Shiva's shakti,his consort, called variously Uma, Parvati, and even Kali. In this instance,Durga is depicted as the Goddess of Death; her ornaments are mostly weapons.Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, is one of their two sons. Thus, we have theequivalent of a “divine family” at this temple.While Durga is represented here at Prambanan, in later temples, as we shall see,Shiva is accompanied, not by Durga, but by Uma or Parvati, representing gentlermanifestations of his shakti. While Durga is associated with warfare and death,Uma is associated with the creation of the world. Durga, however, is a veryfamiliar goddess to the Tantrikas, for she is often worshipped in charnelgrounds and cemeteries.The statue of Shiva sits atop a lingga-yoni pedestal, as do the other primarystatues in the other temples. What cannot be seen, however, is the existence ofa deep well beneath the statue that extends below ground. At the bottom of thiswell were found offerings that were made at the time the construction began.This was—and in some cases still is—a common practice in the building of templesand other public buildings in Asia. The type of offerings change depending onthe purpose of the building and other factors. It is interesting that this ideaof putting a lingga-yoni over a well containing offerings is mirrored in theWestern practice—in Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches—of situatingthe main altar over a relic of one of the saints. The following photos of theBrahma and Vishnu statues—the Shiva statue was off-limits at the time I wasphotographing Prambanan due to post-earthquake restoration work—gives an idea ofhow these statues and pedestals are designed.Image [images/p105-001.jpg]Brahma at left and Vishnu at right stand upon lingga-yoni pedestals.Image [images/p106-001.jpg]The entrance to the Brahma temple with makaras in either side of the doorway.Image [images/p107-001.jpg]Lingga-yoni pedestal at the Hindu temple of Sri Mariamman in Singapore.As one can see, the Brahma statue is standing on a pedestal placed directly atopa yoni, thus implying that Brahma is the lingga of this yoni. Water or otherliquid offerings were made and the excess flowed down the narrow channel on theleft of the statue (to the right in the photograph), where it could be collectedas “holy water.” Vishnu is shown in a position identical to that of the Brahmastatue, but viewed from the side.The photo on the opposite page shows the entrance to the Brahma temple. Note theguardians and the makaras to either side of the entrance, and the one gana onthe left.The picture above, taken at the Sri Mariamman temple in Singapore, a shrine to aSouth Indian mother goddess, shows how the lingga-yoni pedestal normally appearsin a Hindu temple. Here we can see the lingga in its usual form as an erectpenis, with flower offerings. The yoni has a rather large channel—seen to theleft—for the collection of oil or other liquid that is poured over the lingga.What is unusual about this configuration is the placement of a rectangular slabnext to the lingga, whose purpose is a mystery to me.Thus, at Prambanan, in place of a simple lingga, the entire statue of a god isplaced atop the yoni, which clarifies or identifies the type of power that isbeing invoked. The function of the yoni—as a symbol of the feminine—is tomanifest the transcendent power of the universe. Until shakti is involved, powerremains in its potential state—like Shiva meditating alone in the forest. Itrequires the activity of shakti to transform the potential energy into kineticenergy—that is, to create worlds.Lingga are almost always seen as symbols of Shiva, so much so that they areusually referred to as “Shiva lingga.” For Brahma and Vishnu to take the placeof lingga implies a refinement of the Shiva message, or the Shiva power. But atPrambanan, it is still Shiva who takes center stage.THE RAMAYANAAround the Shiva temple, there are numerous reliefs showing scenes from theRamayana: the famous Indian epic of the relationship between Rama and Sita. Ramais usually considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu, not Shiva. However, Shivaplays an important role in the story, for it is Shiva's bow that Rama uses towin Sita as his bride. Further, it is said that the Ramayana itself was told byShiva to his wife, Uma, to keep her entertained. Other sects believe that theMonkey King Hanuman is an incarnation—or “avatar”—of Shiva, and Hanuman's rolein the Ramayana is a critical one. According to a verse in the Shiva Purana(3:20:3–7), Hanuman was born from the seed of Shiva that had been spilled whenShiva lusted after Mohini (a female incarnation or avatar of Vishnu). Thus,there is a strong tradition linking both Hanuman and Shiva to the Ramayana. Thequestion, of course, is one of emphasis and, in Java, the strongest form of“Hinduism” was the Shiva sect that was also the most Tantric.The following relief from the Shiva temple at Prambanan shows a decisive scenefrom the Ramayana as Rama attacks the demon king Ravana with his bow.In the very center of the photograph, one can see the face of Hanuman the MonkeyKing and, indeed, Ravana—at the far right—is being attacked by a horde ofmonkeys. At the far left of the picture is a bearded image holding a trident.This is the sage Agastya, one of the legendary Seven Sages of Vedic India whoonce swallowed the cosmic ocean in order to trap some asuras (demons) who werehiding in its depths. He is related to the cosmic ocean, and his name meansliterally “mountain thrower,” so there seems to be a connection between Agastyaand both the ocean and the mountain, which are symbols of the Samudra Manthan.Agastya is credited with having created many of the mantras of the Rig Veda, andhe is also the sage visited by Rama and Sita during their fourteen-year sojournin the forest.Image [images/p109-001.jpg]A relief at the Shiva temple at Prambanan with a scene from the Ramayana.The trident that Agastya is holding is a symbol of Shiva, representing threeways in which the cosmos is manifested (as creation, destruction, andpreservation). It is not unusual to see three horizontal lines marked on a Shivalingga, or the same three horizontal lines painted on the foreheads of Shivadevotees.Other reliefs from Prambanan afford us an opportunity to see various mudras,incarnations of gods, and scenes of an idealized domesticity. The story of Ramaand Sita is a love story, and begins as such. As those who are familiar with theRamayana know, however, the story ends in tragedy. It may be the original Romeoand Juliet tale, except that in the Ramayana, it is only Juliet who dies!Rama, desiring to marry Sita, approaches her father, a king. The king hasdetermined that whoever is able to bend Shiva's bow will be Sita's husband. Ramaattempts to string the bow and, in doing so, manages to break it. Such powerindicates to the king that Rama is the natural choice and he permits themarriage to take place.Rama and Sita repair to his palace, where his father is dying. Rama is to beking, but the crown was promised earlier to his brother. In order to avoidpolitical difficulties Rama and Sita—and their loyal friend, Lakshamana—go inexile to a forest far from the castle walls. There, they have many adventures,but the one critical to our story is the scene in which Sita sees a beautifulgolden deer and asks Rama to shoot it with his bow and bring it back to her.Rama goes off into the forest chasing the deer, but it was a ruse. Sita iscaptured and taken to the distant land of Lanka, where she is held hostage bythe evil Demon King, Ravana, who wants Sita for his own wife. A stand-offensues, during which Rama enlists the aid of his friends—prominent among themHanuman—to rescue his wife.After Sita is rescued from the clutches of the demon Ravana—who lives on anisland that most scholars agree is today's Sri Lanka—Rama is worried that shehas succumbed to the advances of Ravana, either through desire or force. Sita,of course, is blameless; but, in order to prove her faithfulness to her husband,she jumps into a burning pyre to immolate herself. As it happens, the flames donot burn her and she walks out of the fire unscathed. In fact, in some versions,she walks on live coals as she leaves the fire. Fire-walking is still an Indianritual indicating spiritual purity.In some recitations of this tale, we are left with this somewhat upbeat ending.The performance of the Ramayana ballet that takes place at Prambanan throughoutthe year uses it. “And they lived happily ever after,” we can almost hear themsay. This is because the Javanese version of the tale, the Kakawin Ramayana, hasa vastly different second act that includes the appearance of the indigenousJavanese deity, Semar, and all sorts of other variations. This is the versionfound in the shadow puppet theater, the wayang kulit, all over Java. Theoriginal ending, however, is somewhat more troubling.The original tale tells how Rama and Sita return to their kingdom to live apeaceful life, but rumors soon begin to spread. They say that Rama is a fool totake back a woman who lived with another man. Gossip turns ugly, and Rama feelsforced to send Sita away to live alone in the forest. What he does not know isthat Sita is pregnant with his twin sons.Sita lives long enough to see her sons grow up and become acquainted with theirfather, but her heart is broken and the gods hear her weeping. The earth opens,and Sita is carried away into another world, where she will be happy and atpeace at last.It is possible to see this story as a kind of condemnation of Rama, even thoughthis is not countenanced in India, where Rama is worshipped as a god and as anexample of the Perfect Man. After all, he waged a long and terrible war in orderto get Sita back from the demon king. He lost friends in battle, and reliedheavily on Hanuman when things looked impossibly bleak. He finally overcomes allobstacles and rescues his wife—only to question her chastity! She proves herselffaithful, literally undergoing a baptism by fire, only later to succumb to evilgossip and rumors of impropriety, and to be banished from the kingdom to bearand raise her children alone—the archetypal single mother.Perhaps what is troubling to a Western reader of the Ramayana, taking the storyas literally as possible, is the apparent lack of cause and effect when it comesto blaming Sita for the bitter gossip of the chambermaids who condemn her. In aworld where it is common to believe that one is innocent until proven guilty,this treatment of Sita seems outrageous and cruel. It is possible that there isanother level of interpretation to the story, however, one in which Sita somehowshares the blame for her misfortune. This may be the aspect of the tale thatresonates with Indian audiences, to such an extent that they believe the mererecitation of parts of the Ramayana is enough to cure them of disease or tobanish evil spirits. There is, in other words, something else going on here. Itmay be simply that Rama and Sita both understand that the peace of the kingdomis more important than their own wedded bliss—something like the end of the filmCasablanca, where Rick banishes Ilsa to the United States while he stays behindto fight the Nazis.Sita's origins are a mystery. The name Sita is mentioned briefly in the Rig Vedaas an earth mother figure, but does not appear again until the Ramayana wascomposed, about the fourth century BCE. In that epic, she is discovered as aninfant lying in a plowed field; this may be an allusion to the earlier Sita asearth mother. In the Ramayana, she is considered to be the daughter of BhumiDevi, the Goddess of the Earth, to whom she returns at the end of the tale.Therefore, it is entirely possible that this story is a much later version of anearlier agricultural myth regarding an Earth Mother, fertility, plowing,planting, and reaping. This would have made Sita attractive to the Javanese, whoalready had an agricultural goddess in their pantheon—the Goddess of the RiceField, Sri Dewi.That is not the only metaphor involved, however. As we have seen in the previouschapter on the reliefs at Borobudur, one of the Avadanas concerns PrinceSudhana, who loses his wife, the kinnari, and must win an archery contest to gether back from her father. Rama wins Sita from her father by bending (andultimately breaking) the bow of Shiva. In the Arthurian legend of the West, theyoung Arthur becomes recognized as king when he pulls the sword Excalibur from astone—a feat of superhuman strength or perhaps paranormal ability. The sameachievement is Rama's, for the Bow of Shiva was so strong it was impossible forany mortal man to bend. Rama, who simply wishes to string the bow, breaks it asif it were made of bamboo, thus revealing his superhuman status. Therelationship between archery and the winning of a bride from her father isperhaps a compelling one for future research and investigation, but theassociation of weapons with divine as well as temporal power is something wewill encounter again in a more blatant form in the chapter on the temples ofGunung Lawu, where, as in the Arthurian legends of England, we find miraculousswords, sacred sexuality, and an elixir vitae (an Indian “holy grail”) literallywritten in stone.THE COSMIC OCEANSeveral scholars have noted that the Kakawin Ramayana describes Prambanan, andspecifically the Shiva temple, as representing Mount Meru, especially in thecontext of the story of the Churning of the Cosmic Ocean, one of the set-piecesof both the Mahabharata and the Vishnu Purana, as well as of the Ramayana. InSanskrit rendering, it is known as Samudra Manthan, with samudra meaning “ocean”and manthan meaning “to churn.” As this story is central to the idea ofamrita—the elixir of life and immortality that has many analogues to alchemicalprocesses as well as to Tantra itself, and that is virtually an obsession withthe temples under review in this study—it is worthwhile to summarize it here.The story takes place at the beginning of the Golden Age according to the Vediccalendar. The gods and demons—devas and asuras—cooperate to churn the cosmicocean to produce amrita, the elixir of immortality. In order to do this, theyneed a churn, which they fashion out of the sacred mountain at the north pole,the axis of the world. They remove the mountain from the pole and take it to thecosmic ocean, where they rest it on the back of a turtle. The mountain is thenchurned by means of the king of the Nagas, the serpents. The devas and asuraseach take one end of the huge serpent, which is wound around the mountain, andthe churning begins. Eventually, they produce a vessel full of amrita.According to the Kakawin Ramayana, the Shiva temple at Prambanan is an earthlyrepresentative of the cosmic mountain, the churn that produces amrita. Theimplication is that the Shiva temple might have been used for that purpose insome esoteric sense. It is a kind of counterbalance to Borobudur, which may havebeen intended as an initiatory device, as well as a means of legitimizing thepolitical power structure through association with divinity. At Prambanan, theemphasis is on occult power and physical immortality rather than pure spiritualillumination—if the two can be separated so arbitrarily.Both Borobudur and Prambanan are believed to have been surrounded by water,probably through the construction of artificial lakes. This would satisfy theimage of Mount Meru rising from the midst of the cosmic ocean. The similaritiesend there, however. Borobudur is composed of concentric squares and circles thattaper upward to form a pyramid, with the main stupa at the very top. AtPrambanan, there is a central square with three main temples—for Brahma, Shiva,and Vishnu—with three smaller temples for their mounts, plus two “flanking”temples whose purpose has not yet been discovered. There are also another eightsmaller constructions at the quarter and cross-quarter points, for a total ofsixteen temples in the central square. Outside of that square are more than 200smaller temples, most of which are in complete ruin. Yet, both Borobudur and theShiva temple are believed to represent Mount Meru, the axis mundi and the Asianversion of Jacob's Ladder. That they were also built by kings of temporalkingdoms—perhaps to emphasize their spiritual authority—is not in doubt.In the three main temples, the statues of Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu are standingon yonis. Understanding how lingga-yonis were (and are) used in the Indianworld, we know that oil, water, or some other liquid is poured over the linggaand drains off in the channel at the side of the yoni, where the excess liquidis collected as sacred or charged with supernatural power. In the case of thestatues at Prambanan, it may be that they were similarly anointed and theresulting liquid preserved for its perceived occult properties.In many Indian temples, a kalash (a water pot) is suspended over the lingga sothat the water can drip onto it in a constant manner. This is said to “cooldown” Shiva so that he does not incinerate those who come to pray to him, as heis notoriously ill-tempered and does not like to be disturbed during hisaeons-long meditations. (In some Ayurvedic medicine practices, a kalash issuspended over a patient and special oils or other substances are allowed todrip onto an affected part of the body, often the forehead.) This would seemimpractical in the case of the rather large statues at Prambanan if, indeed,they functioned as lingga to their respective yoni.The number of reliefs at Prambanan that allude to the Samudra Manthan seems toindicate that these temples were used for such a purpose, however, even thoughthe manner of the rituals employed is still a mystery. That human sacrifice alsotook place at the site—probably at the time of its construction—furtherreinforces the idea that the function of Prambanan was Tantric in nature.THE RISHISAs we discussed in the first chapter, Tantra employs various methods for theattainment of spiritual power. These include mantra, mudra, yantra, meditation,and yoga (in most cases, Kundalini yoga) in place of, or in addition to, thepancatattva ritual of the five Ms, which adds additional levels of sensoryawareness. At Borobudur, we saw the Buddha statues in various mudras.At Prambanan, we have examples of the rishis. In India, the term refers to thosewho originally received the Rig Veda. They may be considered sages, except that,in the case of the rishis, the word should not be used in its purelyintellectual sense of “wise,” but also has connotations of “seer” or“ecstatic”—that is, someone with direct experience of the divine.In Vedic astronomy, the constellation Ursa Major is referred to as the SevenRishis. As this constellation has special importance in connection with the axismundi and Mount Meru,10 the presence of the rishis in reliefs on the Brahmatemple at Prambanan may point to an astronomical interpretation of the site, assome authors have suggested.11 The Prambanan rishis are all depicted seated inardha padmasana—a half-lotus pose. This is a relaxed asana for meditation thatplaces the right foot on the left thigh. In a full-lotus, or padmasana, theright foot is placed on the left thigh and the left foot on the right thigh.There seem to be only four mudras depicted in these reliefs: the dhyani mudrafor meditation; a mala mudra (a method of holding the mala, or rosary beads, inthe right hand for counting off the mantras); a mudra that uses the left handinstead of the right to hold a mala that has been draped around the neck; and amudra that cannot be identified due to the extensive erosion that has takenplace. There is also another rishi who is holding what may be a vase of amritain his left hand, at chest level.One of the rishis from the Brahma temple (shown on the next page) holds a mala.The trident on his right and the fly whisk on his left shoulder are prominentand are actually present in almost all of the rishi reliefs at Prambanan. Thetrident, while normally an emblem of Shiva as well as of Durga, may alsorepresent the three gunas—the basic operating principles of the universe:creation (rajas guna), preservation (sattva guna), and destruction (tamas guna).These three concepts are also represented by the Trimurti as Creation (Brahma),Preservation (Vishnu), and Destruction (Shiva), except that, to a Shivaworshipper, Shiva himself represents all three principles—hence his symbol ofthe Trident.Image [images/p115-001.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI I: Holding mala.The fly whisk is another common symbol in Hindu religion (shown above resting oncentral figure's left shoulder). It represents both an instrument to scatterevil influences—represented by flies in much the same way that the Semiticdemon-god Beelzebub was the “Lord of the Flies”—but is also a symbol of royalty.On the following pages are a selection of rishis from the temples of Brahma andVishnuImage [images/p116-001.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 2: With mala and trident.Image [images/p116-002.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 3: With fly whisk, trident, and mala, in varada mudra.Image [images/p116-003.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 4: The trident is partly eroded and the fly whisk onlybarely discernible.Image [images/p116-004.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 5: With trident. The mudra is, unfortunately, impossible toidentify due to the erosion.Image [images/p117-001.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 6: In pose of dhyani or meditation, with fly whisk andtrident.Image [images/p117-002.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 7: With fly whisk, trident and mala.Image [images/p117-003.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 8: With fly whisk and trident, badly eroded. This one isunusual due to the elevation of the left hand to the level of the chest: it doesnot seem to be making a particular mudra, but rather is holding onto a malanecklace.Image [images/p118-001.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 9: The trident and fly whisk are evident, as is the mala.Hanging off the trident is what appears to be a kalash, either a water-pot orperhaps the vase of amrita also known as Amrita Kumbha.Image [images/p118-002.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 10: Varada mudra. This time the fly whisk is obvious, butthere does not seem to be a trident in evidence.Image [images/p118-003.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 11: With trident and fly whisk, holding mala.Image [images/p119-001.jpg]BRAHMA TEMPLE RISHI 12: The trident and fly whisk are there, but in this casethe mudra is done with the left hand, which appears to be holding a container.If so, then it may represent the vase of amrita.VISHNU TEMPLE FIGURESImage [images/p119-002.jpg]VISHNU TEMPLE FIGURE 1: Unidentified male figure flanked by two female figures.He is holding a lotus plant, which is a symbol of Vishnu. It is difficult toknow if the mudra is the varada mudra or the bhumisparsa mudra, but consideringthat this is a Hindu temple and not a Buddhist one, we may consider that thevarada mudra is intended.Image [images/p120-001.jpg]VISHNU TEMPLE FIGURE 2: Another unidentified male figure flanked by two femalefigures and holding a lotus flower.Image [images/p120-002.jpg]VISHNU TEMPLE FIGURE 3: A figure believed to be Rama, flanked by two femalefigures (the one on the right clearly holding a lotus flower) and brandishing abow. As Rama is an avatar of Vishnu, this is consistent with the overall themeof the temple.Image [images/p121-001.jpg]VISHNU TEMPLE FIGURE 4: Another unidentified figure from the Vishnu temple,holding a lotus flower and flanked by female figures. There is some controversyover this relief, since it appears to represent a human ruler with noticeablefacial features and expression and a more prominent stomach (see text below).Regarding the image shown above as Vishnu Temple Figure 4[15_chapter04.html#fig4], it was the practice in Java at the time to carvestatues of the gods that resembled human monarchs as a way of saying that theywere the earthly form and representatives of those gods. Imagine, for a moment,if this practice had become common in the West, with images of the saints, theVirgin Mother, or even of Jesus or Moses patterned on human kings and queens. Ina pre-literate society, or one in which literacy was within the reach of only achosen few, the impact of these images would have been profound and the messageinescapable—disobeying the monarch is tantamount to refusing a god.It is the genius of the Javanese, however, that they found ways around thisproblem, for if the monarch was seen to be ineffectual, it was assumed that thespiritual powers had left him and that he was no longer worthy of support.12Like Arthur in Camelot, once the Grail disappeared and the kingdom was in ruin,it was a clear sign that shakti had left the monarch and had to be regained.It will be noted that none of these figures are shown sitting on a lotuspedestal, unlike the Buddha statues at Borobudur, which are all on lotuses. Thismay refer to the human—i.e., non-divine—nature of the Prambanan figures, sincethe statues of the gods themselves are shown standing on lotus pedestals on topof yonis. It is difficult in Hindu religion to make a sharp distinction betweenhuman and divine figures, since quite often there is some cross-over between thetwo, hinting at an intermediary stage. The rishis, for instance, may refer toindividuals who were once human, but who since have attained divine orquasi-divine status, like that of saints in the West. In Java, the kings werejust such liminal figures. They straddled the worlds of human and divine, notunlike the juru kunci, who mediate between the human world and the supernaturalrealm.That there is much we do not know about Prambanan is revealed in the course ofany serious study of the subject. Scholars debate even points that were onceconsidered beyond question—like whether or not Prambanan is truly a Hindustructure or if it underwent a kind of Buddhist “conversion” at some point; orwhether Prambanan's environs were once flooded to simulate the Milk Ocean. Eventhe identities of many of the reliefs are still being debated.THE GUARDIANSSome visitors find the guardian reliefs and statues at Prambanan to be the mostcompelling of the figures because of their obvious fierceness and hostility.There is an immediacy about the guardians that provokes an almost visceralreaction. Their intense expressions leave no doubt as to their intentions, yetthey face in only one direction—away from the temples. Once intrepid visitorshave passed the demon gates, they need fear the guardians no longer.Image [images/p123-001.jpg]A makara with a serpentine body ending in a ferocious mouth.These makaras are present in Borobudur as well as at Prambanan, as we have seenin the previous chapter. What is not so well known by visitors is that themakaras also represent sexual desire. As water symbols—and as half-goat,half-fish composites—they clearly have resonance with the satyrs of Europeanmythology and pre-Christian religion. As one of the symbols of the God of Loveand Desire, Kamadeva, the makaras carry a charge of sexuality in a spiritual orsacred context. As guardians, they may indicate the raw power of shakti in anatural state, but under the conscious control of the initiate or god. The imageabove shows a typical makara with a serpentine body ending in a ferocious mouth.These were used—as at Borobudur—for water drainage, but it is also possible thatthis seemingly mundane function had an esoteric analogue as well.In addition to the makaras, there are also many instances of dvarapala—door orgate guardians that are a typical feature of Indian Buddhist and Hindu temples,as well as those found on Java and on Bali. In some cases (as at Prambanan),only their heads are shown (see page 124). This is usually an allusion to thedemon Rahu who swallowed some of the amrita before being decapitated by Vishnu.Thus his head became immortal, while the rest of him died. In Indian astrology,it is Rahu who devours the moon, thus causing a lunar eclipse. (In Westernastrology, he is known as the Moon's North Node.).Image [images/p124-001.jpg]Two dvarapalas or door guardians at the Prambanan TempleImage [images/p124-002.jpg]Image [images/p125-001.jpg]Here we see a typical arrangement of door guardians surrounding the entrance tothe Shiva temple. These dvarapala are shown with bulging eyes, wide grins, andsometimes talons. They are the enemies of evil spirits and protect the gods fromharm.Image [images/p126-001.jpg]Another configuration of guardiansThe photo above shows yet another configuration of guardians. In addition to themonster at the very top of the door, there are smaller ones at the foot,surmounted by Shiva's assistants, the ganas. On top of the ganas, you can seemakaras at either side of the door and, at the sides of the staircase, moredemonic beings.On the opposite page is an almost comical dvarapala with an unhappy-looking ganaon top. Above the gana, you can see another makara.The next four photos show some badly eroded examples that nonetheless retaintheir explicit personalities.Image [images/p127-001.jpg]An almost comical dvarapala with an unhappy-looking gana on top.Image [images/p128-001.jpg]The two photos at left show some badly eroded examples that nonetheless retaintheir explicit personalities.Image [images/p128-002.jpg]Image [images/p129-001.jpg]Image [images/p129-002.jpg]Image [images/p129-003.jpg]The two dvarapalas above are also badly eroded but retain their personalities.For comparison, the photo at left is of an identical creature atop the entranceto a Hindu temple in BaliThe dvarapala shown above from the entrance to a Hindu temple in Bali hasexaggerated eyes and ears that may imply a kind of omniscience on the part ofthis entity—the ability to see and hear evil, to detect it, not only in the formof malevolent spirits, but also in the fissures of our own hearts andconsciences. The gaping mouth with the hideous fangs clearly represents thedevouring function of the guardian.When Rahu is intended, the allusion is specifically to the quest for amrita, theelixir of immortality that is a focus of the Tantric sects. The profusion ofRahus (monsters without bodies) and makaras at Prambanan may indicate thespecial purpose of the temple complex, which revolved around amrita and theChurning of the Milk Ocean. One could say that the bodiless immortal Rahurepresents the purely intellectual approach to the subject—an approach bysomeone who has done the studying, but has not made the actual sacrificesrequired. As in our discussion of the Homa ritual in chapter 1[11_chapter01.html#ch1], it is clear from any unbiased reading of the Tantrasthat actual, not virtual, sacrifices are intended. The language is explicit, andthe practice should be as well. Thus the body must be as engaged in the pursuitof Tantric illumination as the mind. It is amusing (and perhaps too unkind) toimagine the scholars of Tantra as so many Rahus who, having tasted of the divinewisdom, warn the rest of us to keep away from the inner chamber of the temple, achamber they have never seen.CANDI SEWUNot far from Prambanan and sometimes considered part of the same complex isCandi Sewu, a name that means “1000 temples.” At the time the author was there,the site was in the midst of restoration after the damage caused by theearthquake of 2006. While there is a lot of construction and reconstructiontaking place there, it is still possible to get a glimpse of some of theoriginal art and architecture.Although the site is named 1000 Temples, there are actually only about 257 inevidence today. They are all part of what had been a huge mandala. Candi Sewu isbelieved to be a Buddhist site, and the pattern of the temples and arrangementof the statues and reliefs is thought to represent a vajradhatu mandala, themandala most associated with the Kalachakra Tantra.13Rather than belabor this study with more discussion of the individualreliefs—those that are in a state to be identified—it is perhaps moreinteresting to focus on the Rahus of Candi Sewu, which are more elaborate insome cases. The tradition that the mouth of the Rahu drips with jewels isperhaps linked to the story of a monster who steals the amrita and takes a drinkof it before being beheaded. The jewels may be the crystallized essence of theamrita he drank. The reliefs at Candi Sewu give us some excellent examples ofthis idea. This Rahu, found over the entrance to the main temple, is resplendentwith ornamentation. Like many Rahu in the Indian tradition, this one lacks alower jaw. Also note the makara on either side of the entrance.The photograph on page 132 shows an image of a boddhisattva with a similar Rahuoverhead.Image [images/p131-001.jpg]Rahu relief at Candi Sewu over the entrance to the main temple.In addition to the elaborate Rahus, visitors to Candi Sewu are greeted by someof the largest dvarapala ever seen. These guardians are truly enormous, andworthy of reproduction here (see page 133). They are depicted draped in serpentsand carrying a club, with a knife or short sword tucked into their belts. Theirfunction is protective, yet they are not shown standing, but in a half-sitting,half-kneeling position that probably fits their role as spiritual guardians ofthe second-largest Buddhist shrine in Indonesia, after Borobudur.Candi Sewu is believed to be related to the famous Javanese story of the LoroJonggrang, or “Slender Virgin.” In this story, two Javanese kingdoms are at war.A cruel giant, ruler of one kingdom, is at war with a wise prince withsupernatural powers, ruler of the other. The giant, however, has a beautifuldaughter—the Loro Jonggrang.Image [images/p132-001.jpg]An image of a boddhisattva with a Rahu overhead.Image [images/p133-001.jpg]Gigantic dvarapalas at Candi Sewu.The giant is defeated, and the armies of the wise prince invade his palace. Theprince sees the giant's beautiful daughter and at once proposes marriage. Sherefuses at first, but after much urging agrees to the union on two conditions:the prince must build a well and he must build 1000 temples in only one night.The prince agrees and builds a very deep well using his supernatural abilities.The giant's daughter, however, piles rocks into the well to trap the prince—tono avail, for the prince manages to escape.The next night, the prince enters into meditation and summons all of hissupernatural forces, including spirits and genii. They begin building the 1000temples. When the 999th temple is complete, the giant's daughter becomes alarmedand begins pounding rice (an activity that normally takes place in the morning).The prince's spirits and genii, fearing the sun is about to come up, abandon thetask. Only 999 temples are built, and the prince has lost.Except ... the prince realizes he has been tricked and, in a fit, curses thegiant's daughter, causing her to turn to stone. It is this stone statue that heuses to adorn the 1000th temple, where she will remain forever.In Java, there are several statues that are believed to be the Loro Jonggrang.One of them is found at Candi Sewu, and another at Prambanan. These are probablystatues of the Indian goddess Durga, but Javanese culture has appropriated heras one of its own or, conversely, has recognized that Durga is the Indian avatarof the Slender Virgin of Javanese folklore.MAGIC, POLITICS, RELIGION, SEXUALITYWhat the summary of the temples of Borobudur, Prambanan, and Sewu have given usis a basis for understanding the temples that appear in the following chapters,as well as some practices that are still being observed in Java—practices thathave Tantric significance. Borobudur and Prambanan both provide evidence of theway in which the Hindu-Buddhist culture of pre-Islamic Java managed to equatesecular rulership with spiritual attainment, and political power with spiritualpower. While the contemporary Western world understands and respects a legaldivision between Church and State, older civilizations (both European and Asian)did not see rulership that way. Power is shakti—at its base, a psycho-spiritualform of consciousness whose essential motivating factor is all but obscured bydogma, culture, and social expectations. It is the locus where matter and energyare one—a state of potentiality, a coiled serpent at the base of the unconsciousspine, at once a promise and a threat.8 See the series of articles on Prambanan found at www.borobudur.tv[http://www.borobudur.tv] accessed on 17 August 2010.9 See Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn (St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1971,1986), pp. 540–621 for a description of this system and its relationship to thetarot, astronomy, astrology, etc.10 See Peter Levenda, Stairway to Heaven (New York: Continuum, 2008), pp.110–119.11 See, for instance, the series of articles on www.borobudur.tv[http://www.borobudur.tv] concerning the proposed astronomical significance ofthe design and construction of Prambanan.12 The story of Adiwijaya, the Sultan of Pajang, is a case in point. Having losta battle against his enemies that was accompanied by an eruption of MountMerapi, he went to the mausoleum at Tembayat in Central Java where it isbelieved one of the nine saints of Java is buried. When the gate refused toopen, he was told by the juru kunci that “the light of royalty” had passed fromhim to the new Mataram dynasty. See Claude Guillot, “The Tembayat hill: clergyand royal power in Central Java from the 15th to the 17th century,” in HenriChambert-Loir and Anthony Reid, eds., The Potent Dead: Ancestors, Saints andHeroes in Contemporary Indonesia (Honolulu: University of Hawai’i Press, 2002),p. 148.13 See Jacques Dumarçay, Candi Sewu and the Buddhist Architecture of CentralJava (Jakarta: Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia, 2007) for a thorough study of thearchitecture of this site, along with a discussion of how the Candi Sewu “cubit”(0.34 meters) was calculated."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE TEMPLES OF MOUNT LAWU AND THE PRODUCTION OF AMRITAOf all the temples found in Java, there are perhaps no more blatant examples ofTantric iconography than those found on the slopes of Mount Lawu.This mountain—actually a quiescent volcano—is on the border between Central Javaand East Java, not far from the city of Surakarta (Solo) and easily accessiblefrom Yogyakarta (Jogja). As one climbs into the foothills, the temperaturebecomes cooler and there is extensive agriculture in the form of terraced fieldsof tea and other commodities. A curving road hugging the side of the mountaintakes the visitor past simple houses, an occasional ox, and scenery ofincredible beauty. For centuries, Mount Lawu (or Gunung Lawu, in Javanese) hasbeen a spiritual center, a kind of Indonesian Mount Shasta.The people who live on the western slope of Mount Lawu practice Hinduism andhave a local priest who officiates at Hindu rituals. The shrines and statues atthe two temples under discussion—Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh—are welltended.There are flowers left in front of statues, incense burning near trees or beforestone phalluses, all left by unseen hands. Mount Lawu is a mystical site, andthe temples of Ceto and Sukuh are especially potent. The temples are places ofpilgrimage for traditional kejawen-type gurus and their students. Yet, for alltheir local popularity, they are rarely visited by foreign tourists.The temples on Mount Lawu are believed to have been built during the 15thcentury CE, meaning that they were already in use when Columbus landed in NorthAmerica. They represent a form of Tantra that had been fused with indigenousJavanese practices and reflect the tensions building in Java with the ascendancyof Islam during the same period.To understand the cultural and religious environment that gave rise to thesetemples, it is necessary to know a little about the history of Java in the13thcentury, immediately before construction began at Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh.One of the most famous Tantric Javanese kings was Kertanegara, the last of theSinghasari dynasty. An initiate of Hevajra Tantra (which became one of thecentral Tibetan teachings), Kertanegara represented a fusion of Hinduism andBuddhism within a purely Tantric context. Indeed, he believed himself to be theavatar of both Shiva and Buddha. He was also one of the most notorious of allthe Southeast Asian rulers of the period, for he openly opposed none other thanthe great Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.School children know of the Great Khan from their study of the voyages of MarcoPolo, who visited Kublai Khan's court. A grandson of Genghis Khan, Kublai soughtto extend his empire throughout Asia and eventually turned his attention to theJavanese kingdoms to the south. He sent envoys to demand tribute from the courtof Kertanegara, who promptly had the men arrested, cut off their ears, and sentthem back to China, where the Khan reacted with predictable anger.At the same time, Kertanegara had sent an army to Sumatra to subdue the Islamickingdom of Jambi. Since Jambi had already formed an alliance with the Khan,Kertanegara assumed that it would align itself militarily with him as well. Whenthe Khan's forces finally did arrive in Java around the year 1290, they foundthe Singhasari dynasty in disarray. A revolt had taken place against Kertanegarawhile his troops were off fighting the Jambi kingdom in Sumatra. Kertanegara washimself slain during a Tantric ritual at which large quantities of wine had beenconsumed, rendering him and his retinue intoxicated and defenseless.The rebellious commander was eventually slain by Kertanegara's son-in-law, theRaden (Prince) Wijaya, who not only defeated the rebel armies, but also managedto rout the Mongol forces sent by the Khan. It was through Raden Wijaya's linethat the last non-Islamic dynasty of Java, the Majapahit, was founded in 1293.This dynasty lasted for over 200 years, during which time most of present-dayIndonesia as well as present-day Malaysia were incorporated within the Majapahitempire. It was in the later period of this dynasty that the famous andmysterious Tantric temples of Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh were built andconsecrated, probably during the reign of King Brawijaya V, the last monarch ofthe Majapahit and thus the last non-Islamic monarch in Java. As enemy forcesbegan squeezing the armies of the Majapahit, many fled to neighboring Bali,where the Hindu way of life and religion was preserved. Others wound upscattered throughout Java, hiding in the mountains and building their templesand shrines to the Javanese-Hindu-Buddhist religion they practiced sofaithfully.Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh are two of these temples. They remained largelyforgotten and in ruin until the 19th and 20th centuries, when foreign officialstook note of the sites and began excavation and restoration. The sites werestill revered by the people who lived on Mount Lawu, who regarded them assources of spiritual power.We will look at Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh in turn.CANDI CETOThe photo below shows the entrance to the temple—a lintel-less gate that istypical of Javanese religious architecture. The stone figure at the entrance,called Nyai Gemang Arum, does not appear to be a guardian, but a devotee.Nyai is a term of respect for women, especially women of high social rank,although the statue in this case does not appear to be female. In Bali, the sameterm may be used to signify “you” or “thou,” also terms that imply respect forsomeone of higher social status. Thus the confusion may rest there, as theBalinese were and are devout Hindus and Candi Ceto is a Hindu-Javanese shrine.Image [images/p137-001.jpg]Entrance to the Candi Ceto temple.Compare this statue to the two others on the facing page that flank the mainentrance. They are called Nyai Agni, which may be a reference to the Sanskritword for “fire” (agni) and which is also the name of the God of Fire inHinduism, both of which are male. The Hindu deva Agni is usually shown with twoheads or two faces. The fact that there are two Nyai Agni here may be areference to this, but the religious symbolism of the temple has been soJavanized that any clear association between it and classical Indian religion isa bit problematic.To add to the confusion, the restoration of the temple was conducted in acavalier fashion. All of the wooden elements had, of course, deteriorated to thepoint that new wooden roofs, beams, and structural supports had to be made. Muchof the stonework was in disarray as well, leaving some of the reconstructiondesign up to the imagination of the workers. However, enough elements of theoriginal Candi Ceto (begun about 1451) remain to allow us to develop theoriesabout the purpose for the entire site.At the top of page 139 is one of the two Nyai Agni found at Candi Ceto. From thebeard, we can assume that the figure is not female. However, the statue isback-to-back with a female figure, shown in the second image, that is notidentified, thus adding a greater degree of confusion. Notice also the offeringof rice and incense that has been made to the statue. What appear to bewristwatches on either arm of the figure have contributed to some hilarity amongsome visitors.The second Nyai Agni at Candi Seto, shown opposite below, is in much disrepair,but also sports facial hair.On page 82 we see the Candi Ceto temple complex as it appeared in 2008. All ofthe wooden structures are, of course, new and part of the restoration work thatwas begun in 1970.On page 140 is another view of the complex that gives some idea of the layeredeffect of the fourteen terraces that made up the original design. Only thirteenof the terraces remain at the present time.The complex contains two statues of historical figures, advisors to the lastking of the Majapahit dynasty. They are shown on page 141. The first isSabdapalon, a loyal subject of King Brawijaya V, and a priest as well as aspiritual and political advisor. According to the story, he cursed the king whenthe latter converted to Islam in the year 1478. He foretold that theHindu-Javanese kingdom would return in 500 years, but not before widespreaddevastation on Java. The 1978 eruption of Mount Semeru—also known as Mahameru orMount Sumeru, after the Indian original—was believed to be one sign that theprophecy was being fulfilled.Image [images/p139-001.jpg]Image [images/p139-002.jpg]ABOVE LEFT AND RIGHT: Nyai Agni statues flank the main entrance. The Hindu devaAgni is usually shown with two heads or two faces. However, the statue at CandiSeto is back-to-back with a female figure, shown above right.Image [images/p139-003.jpg]LEFT: The second Nyai Agni at Candi Seto is in much disrepair, but also sportsfacial hair.Image [images/p140-001.jpg]The terraces of the Candi Seto Temple complex.The second statue is of the advisor Naya Genggong, who is sometimes believed tobe one and the same person as Sabdapalon.Because of the prophecies made by Sabdapalon, recorded in an ancient documententitled Ramalan Sabda Palon Naya Genggong (The Prophecy of Sabda Palon NayaGenggong), and the latest eruption of Mount Merapi outside of Yogyakarta inNovember 2010, there has been a resurgence of interest in this narrative and,consequently, something of a mystical revival taking place at the temples onMount Lawu. Sabdapalon himself is believed to have left Java for the island ofBali, where Hinduism still flourishes, but so many stories are told about himthat he has acquired a mystical status in his own right.One of the few surviving reliefs at Candi Ceto shows what may be a typical scenefrom the shadow puppet theater. In the center of this stone is what appears tobe Mount Meru, the cosmic mountain of Indian religion, depicted in wayangfashion. At either side are archers. This may be a scene from the Ramayana, butthe erosion that has taken place has made it difficult to make out much detail.Image [images/p141-001.jpg]ABOVE LEFT: Sabdapalon, a priest and spiritual advisor to King Brawijaya V.Image [images/p141-002.jpg]ABOVE RIGHT: Naya Genggong, perhaps the same person as Sabdapalon.Image [images/p141-003.jpg]A relief at Candi Seto may be a scene from the shadow puppet theater.PALANGOne of the most shocking elements of Candi Ceto is the huge stone lingga andyoni on one of the terraces that marks the entrance to the main building. As youcan see opposite, these lie flat on the ground rather than standing vertically,and their sheer size is arresting. The photo on page 144 shows a close-up ofsome curious ornamentation found on the lingga in the form of round balls orspheres at the head of the phallus, below the glans at either side and on top.This may reveal a cultural practice called palang.Palang is a practice known in one form or another throughout Southeast Asia, butalso mentioned in the Kama Sutra.14 It is a practice that involves the insertionof a rod in the penis—laterally, perpendicular to the head of the penis and justbelow the glans—and the attachment of small balls or beads on either end of it.This is supposed to increase female enjoyment during the sex act. The method hasundergone a renewal in the modern world, much like piercing the body in otherareas, like the tongue, navel, and breasts. After the first incision, a smalllength of bamboo is inserted to keep the wound from closing. When the sex act isto be performed, the bamboo is removed and replaced with a metal rod and the twoballs attached, one at each end.Other methods involve the insertion of precious stones, pearls, or gold balls inthe skin of the penis where they usually remain.15 In some cases, small bells,ball bearings, and even silicon are inserted. The use of semi-precious stones,gold, and pearls is believed to provide the added benefit of increasingsupernatural power, while also advertising the bearer's wealth and socialstatus, thus increasing his desirability as a potential husband or mate.Image [images/p143-001.jpg]Image [images/p144-001.jpg]Closeup of lingga with palang at Candi Seto.Another supposed benefit of palang is the ability to remain in sexualintercourse for hours at a time.16 That is one of the Tantric ideals, of course,just as prolonged periods of meditation are considered evidence of thesupernatural power and sincerity of the practitioner.Palang has profound implications for the way in which Tantra was understood inJava at that time. The method of palang does not provide much enjoyment to themale; its purpose is strictly to increase stimulation in the female partner. Thenumber of rods and balls can be considered signs of status—two, three, or moresuch rods could be inserted in the penis, with the respective number of balls;or a large number of balls or jewels could be directly and permanently insertedunder the skin of the penis. This degree of attention to the female experiencein the sex act indicates a focus on the female and her enjoyment that seems tobe inconsistent with generally accepted ideas concerning patriarchal societiesand their emphasis on the male orgasm. For instance, in cultures where “femalecircumcision” (clitoral mutilation) is practiced, something like palang would beinconceivable.Image [images/p145-001.jpg]At left is a shrine at Candi Seto containing the stone phallus shown at right.Why, then, would this practice attain the elevated status it enjoys in the stonesculptures of Candi Ceto? Is there another level of meaning that escapes theuninitiated observer? After all, these are not the usual phallic monuments weexpect to see in Shiva temples. Lingga and yoni are prevalent throughout theIndian cultural sphere. Yet, it seems that we find lingga pierced in the styleof palang only in Java (and Bali).A possible answer will become clear as we move through the very detailedstonework of the temple, for Candi Ceto, like its sister Candi Sukuh, wasdesigned for a very specific purpose—the collection of amrita.The sculptures and iconography at Candi Ceto are very selective. All the symbolsfound there today can refer to one concept only—amrita—and the methods used tocollect it. The juxtaposition of the lingga (with palang) and yoni, next to whatappears to be a giant Garuda indicates that the entire complex was dedicated tothis most Tantric of Tantric rituals. In order to decode it—and Candi Sukuh—weneed to understand a bit more about the mysticism concerning biological fluidsthat was current in Indian Tantra and alchemy.PRECIOUS BODILY FLUIDSGroup Capt. Lionel Mandrake: Uh, Jack, Jack, listen, tell me, tell me, Jack.When did you first become ... well, develop this theory?General Jack D. Ripper: Well ... I first became aware of it, Mandrake, duringthe physical act of love.Mandrake: Hmm.Ripper: Yes, a profound sense of fatigue ... a feeling of emptiness followed.Luckily I ... I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence.Mandrake: Hmm.Ripper: I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women uh ... women sensemy power and they seek the life essence. I, uh ... I do not avoid women,Mandrake.Mandrake: No.Ripper: But I ... I do deny them my essence.—Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the BombWe can isolate two separate phenomena that take place in the context of Tantricworship and ritual, and specifically of the pancatattva or Five Elements ritualthat incorporates sexual intercourse. One of these is the sex act itself, whichmay be considered from a psycho-biological viewpoint as the mating of two humansin an intense and focused ritual that may even take place before the gaze ofonlookers (other members of the Tantric circle). Like the sex act between twopeople in love with each other, this act is both passionate and “animal,” butalso contains higher elements, like a desire for union that transcends thephysical. In that sense, the Tantric ritual of Maithuna is a kind ofre-enactment of the moment when two lovers first embrace, as opposed to a sexact that takes place, for instance, between a prostitute and her client, orbetween a rapist and his victim.This is the element of the Tantric rite that is pure consciousness, a symbol ofthe creation of the world (and of the specific creation—i.e., the conception—ofthe two individuals performing the rite). The moment of orgasm is usuallydelayed for a long period of time so that the partners reach a plateau ofexperience—much like an intense state of meditation that can last for hours oreven longer—during which both partners lose themselves completely in the act, tothe extent that it is difficult to know where one body ends and the otherbegins. Orgasm, if and when it occurs, can be intense, breath-taking, and, insome cases, truly illuminating.The second phenomenon derives from the first, and involves the use and even theconsumption of the bodily fluids created by the sex act. This is the element ofTantra that is often overlooked or ignored—if it is even understood orrecognized—by practitioners of New Age Tantra, who focus primarily on improvingtheir sexual experience and their relationships with lovers. However, it is asimportant to the process as the sexual act itself, for, just as sex often leadsto conception and procreation—that is, the materialization on the physical planeof what began as something ephemeral like desire, lust, or love—so the Tantricact must also lead to a kind of procreation or materialization. And just as thesex act within the Tantric circle mimics the Ur-intercourse of the gods that ledto the creation of the cosmos, so are worlds created through the medium of thesexual fluids.We cannot understand some of the Western alchemical writings unless we recognizethe importance of physical substance and its potential for transformation. Thesame true in Tantra. The seminal fluid, mucoid excretions, and blood that may bethe effluvia of the sex act are all preserved or, in many cases, consumed on thespot by the practitioners. There is, actually, no bodily excretion at all thatis considered tabu in the Tantric context.The exoteric explanation is usually the recognition that the initiated adept hasgone beyond a dualistic view of creation, and sees bodily excretions as nodifferent from a field of wildflowers or a lover's sigh. All is Maya; all isillusion—the manifestation of desire in the created, albeit illusory, world. Allis one; there is no difference between you and me. Thus, there is no reason tofeel disgust at the sight of fecal material, just as there is no reason to feeldesire at the sight of a beautiful person. There is no beauty, no ugliness. Thisis the exalted state of advaita, or nonduality. To demonstrate that one hasachieved this state, one can as easily consume menstrual blood as a glass ofwine.The esoteric explanation is somewhat more mechanistic. If we make a general (andby no means adequate) distinction between the exoteric and esoteric as themystical versus the magical, we may say that the esoteric explanation in thiscase is purely magical. It involves the conscious manipulation of reality tocreate new forms of reality. In a purely Buddhist sense, this may seem horrible,of course. The Buddhist goal is to transcend reality, to recognize “reality” asa concept without special spiritual attributes; reality is something inherentlyuseless to those on the path. The multiplication of states of reality wouldseem, then, to be demonic, when viewed from the point of view of a Theravadin—ifthe Theravadin believed in the objective existence of demons, that is.However, not everyone has the luxury of retreating from society and engaging inthe quest for enlightenment. This is especially true of those who are inpositions of power or authority—like kings or generals—and who feel aresponsibility to their people and their professions. While some monarchs didretreat from the world, it was usually a temporary measure designed to enablethe king to find his center, his source of power. Thus, we find that heads ofroyal houses in India as well as in Java engaged in Tantric rituals to ensurethe fertility and security of their kingdoms.As Indologist David Gordon White has demonstrated, Tantra was not a purelysymbolic practice, with the sex act idealized in some way and visualized bymonks in solitary cells as a divine process far removed from the comparativelymore bestial act experienced by householders and outcastes.17 Tantra was fleshand blood—quite literally—and was a practice that made use of every aspect ofthe human experience, with a focus on the biological. Eating, drinking,breathing, excretion, and sexuality were all parts of the doctrine and wereelements of the rituals. Much ink has been spilled over this issue. For a longtime, the first Western observers in India, the British colonialists, eitherdenigrated these ideas or simply refused to accept that the prescriptions in theTantric texts were meant to be taken literally. The most famous of thesecommentators were Sir John Woodroffe, who wrote under the nom de plume ArthurAvalon, and Max Mueller, whose Sacred Books of the East was a milestone inIndological and other Asian research and scholarship. These authors eitherframed this potentially shocking material in a purely spiritualized way (Avalon)or simply omitted some of the most disturbing references altogether (Mueller).They may have believed they were doing Mother India a favor by presenting theirsacred texts in the most positive light possible, but, in the process, a centralelement of these practices was dropped from the discussion, with the result thatgenerations of students of Asian culture were left with a skewed perception ofthe subject. Much of this was due, also, to the reluctance of Indian scholarsthemselves to acknowledge this aspect of Tantra, either because they werestaunch Vedic Brahmins for whom Tantra was a suspect practice, or because theyfeared British disapproval and reproach.This was not so among the esotericists, however. A hundred years ago, secretsocieties like the Ordo Templi Orientis in Germany and the Hermetic Brotherhoodof Light in Europe, the Middle East, and America insisted not only that thesexual act itself was a core ritual intended to be performed actually ratherthan simply visualized, but that the bodily fluids present or created during thesex act had magical potency and should be retained in some manner or consumedunder the appropriate circumstances. At the same time, however, neither of thesegroups or the others involved in this practice ever assumed that all they had todo was perform sexually and somehow that would be sufficient to procureenlightenment and attain occult powers.The spiritual, magical aspect of the sex act was the essential aspect of theritual—not the sex alone, but the sexual act ritualized to the extent that bothparticipants were spiritually prepared. This usually happened either throughpersonal meditation or study, usually at the direction of a teacher—someone whohad already gone through these experiences, or through a specific series ofinitiations—or both. The act itself was surrounded with all the impedimenta ofoccult ceremony: incense, chanting, etc. The timing and pace of the ritual wasjust as important and, far from being trivialized, was rather subject toscrutiny and almost obsessive attention to detail. In other words, the ritualwas made to conform to what we would today call “laboratory conditions,” if thatis not too secular a framing of what takes place in an occult ritual. In fact,the terminology is apt if we remember that Western alchemy may be based on justsuch an esoteric interpretation of sexuality—a laboratory for the transformationof matter.Whereas Western alchemy is couched in chemical language and metaphor, Tantra isframed in biological language and metaphor. The bodily fluids so prized inTantra have their correlates in the chemicals valued by the alchemists. The twocultures were essentially discussing the same secret and, at times, usingvirtually identical language to do so. The later European secret societiesunderstood some of these equivalents, but it is not clear that they had thecomplete key to the process.The major components were, of course, seminal fluid and menstrual blood.Initiates, however, were concerned, not only with the grosser aspects of thesetwo elements, but with their “etheric” counterparts. While menstrual blood wasvalued as an essential component of the elixir vitae, or amrita, it was believedthat the female genital organ was the source of other “essences,” depending onits time within the menstrual cycle. These essences were called kalas, areference to the Sanskrit word for “time,” as well as to “essence” and “unguent”(kala). It was believed there were sixteen of these kalas, based on the sixteen“digits” of the lunar cycle in Indian astrology and hence related to a similardivision of a woman's menstrual cycle. Thus, at different times of her period, awoman “excretes” a different kala, a different essence. This, of course, wouldbe of intense interest and subject to observation by Tantric practitioners, whowould time rituals of collection of these essences for optimum results.The importance that the Javanese Tantricists gave to this concept is evident intheir obsession with the mythical hero Garuda and with the story of how Garudaseized the amrita—the elixir vitae—from the grasp of the Nagas, the serpentgods. Depictions of Garuda are found everywhere in Indonesia, of course; theirnational airline is named after him. In Java, however, Garuda appears in asomewhat different form from the way he is normally shown in India and even inBali. In Java, Garuda is thin, tall, even gangly. He has the head and talons ofa bird of prey, and the body of a man. He is almost always shown with his clawson the backs of serpents and with the vessel of the precious amrita within reachof his talons.At Candi Sukuh—arguably one of the most blatantly Tantric of all Javanesetemples—Garuda is present in various forms throughout the complex. In the photoon the facing page, the heart-shaped instrument at his waist is the vessel ofamrita. Considering that Candi Sukuh is where we find shrines to the phallus andstatues of men with prominent members, the Garuda statues, with their serpentbases and their vessels of amrita, can only have been understood in a purelyTantric sense—especially as the sacred vessel itself is shown tied to Garuda'sbelt and dangling in front of his groin, as if it were a heart-shaped fig leaf,as the photograph shows.In this case, the statue has been beheaded—possibly by art thieves—but the restof the image is clearly that of Garuda, from his wings to his talon-like feetand the amrita vessel at his waist.There are, of course, at least two different approaches to the concept ofamrita. Like the quotation from Dr. Strangelove above, there is one school thatcautions practitioners to retain their “precious bodily fluids” rather than losethem in the sex act. In this case, the male either refrains from ejaculationaltogether or draws the ejaculated seminal fluid from his partner's vagina backthrough his penis into his own body. The latter practice requires long trainingand is potentially quite dangerous, as it reverses the normal action of thegenital organ, making it, in effect, a kind of vacuum cleaner. The saferapproach is to refrain from ejaculation and retain the seminal fluid, coaxing it(or, more correctly, its etheric counterpart) to enter into circulation in thebody, raising it to the level of the pineal gland in the brain. This practice iswell-known to practitioners of Hatha yoga and, in particular, Kundalini yoga.Image [images/p151-001.jpg]A statue of Garuda at Candi Sukh.Those who are familiar with Kundalini yoga remember that the goddess Kundaliniis represented by a serpent. The serpent is made to rise through the sevenlevels of the human etheric body—the seven chakras—in order for initiates toattain enlightenment. This association of a serpent with the vital force, oramrita, is found in the stone carvings at Candi Sukuh representing the missionof Garuda, who stole the elixir from the serpent gods, the Nagas. Theiconography is remarkably consistent with what we know of the actual practice ofTantra.Image [images/p152-001.jpg]The serpent king Ananta or Shesha at the Bangkok Suvarnabhumi InternationalAirport in 2008.To give an idea of the creation of amrita from the churning of the cosmic ocean,we have the following photographs, which were taken in Bangkok SuvarnabhumiInternational Airport in 2008 of a huge sculpture commemorating the event as itappears in the Mahabharata.18 The first two show the serpent king—Ananta orShesha—with many heads and his demonic devotees (the asuras) pulling him in aweird tug-of-war with the divine warriors (the devas). The third photo shows usa close-up of the churning Milk Ocean, in the midst of which we see a turtle,with the coils of the serpent on top. This particular juxtaposition of turtle,serpent, and elixir vitae (and Milk Ocean) is one we will come acrossagain—particularly in the case of Candi Ijo and its mysterious shrine tocreation itself.Image [images/p153-001.jpg]ABOVE: The asura pulling the serpent king.BELOW: Churning Milk Ocean with a turtle in the midst and the coils of theserpent on top.Image [images/p153-002.jpg]Image [images/p154-001.jpg]Vishnu at the Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International Airport.In the foreground of the churning Milk Ocean on page 153, you can see a conch ona pedestal. It is believed that the conch was the first created form to emergefrom the ocean, followed by the goddess Lakshmi. The conch symbolizes lifeitself and is an important element in many Hindu rituals, or puja, where it isused either as a horn (much like the shofar is used in Jewish ceremonies) or asa vessel for holding sacred water. Vishnu is often shown holding a conch in hishand, as in the detail from the sculpture on the facing page.Thus, as we have seen, there are two important narratives concerning amrita. Thefirst is the Churning of the Milk Ocean, which produces amrita; the second isthe theft of amrita from the Nagas by the mythical bird-man Garuda. In both ofthese narratives, serpents (Nagas) are essential elements. Turtles also appear,forcing us to ask the obvious question: What is the relationship betweenamphibious creatures and the production/procurement of amrita?In the following photograph, we can see some detail of the “yoni” figure thataccompanies the lingga-palang figure at Candi Ceto. In the center of the yonitriangle can be seen a crab (another amphibious creature) with what appear to bethree frogs in the very center of the sculpture. At the ends of the trianglebarely can be seen the figures of lizards.Image [images/p155-001.jpg]Yoni figure at Candi Ceto.Image [images/p156-001.jpg]The turtle figures in situ at an unnamed shrine at Candi Ceto.We can conclude that it requires the assistance of amphibians to obtain theamrita, for it is hidden in the ocean. Both the turtle and the serpents areessential to the story of the Milk Ocean. The addition of crabs and lizards (andpossibly frogs) to the large stone emblem at Candi Ceto seems to place emphasison this aspect of the story. Our attention is being drawn to this part of thecode in a very deliberate manner.In the next two photographs of an unnamed shrine at Candi Ceto, we see the useof turtles once again. They seem to be functioning as steps, but I am notcomfortable with that description. They may serve a sacrificial purpose and, ascan be seen, offerings of flowers and incense were made some time before myarrival.Image [images/p157-001.jpg]Close-up of turtle figures at Candi Ceto.In fact, the large sculpture of a Garuda that is flat on the ground next to thelingga-yoni bears yet another turtle on its back, as can be seen in the photo onthe next page. The turtle's head can be seen rising from the circular form atopthe large, winged sculpture lying flat to the rear of the yoni. Between theGaruda-cum-Turtle and the triangular yoni, there is a small circular sculpturerepresenting a solar disc with seven rays. This was the symbol of the Majapahitdynasty.The yoni in this sculpture is virtually crawling with amphibious creatures, andGaruda is himself carrying a huge turtle on his back. This is excessive, even byTantric standards, unless a point is being made. The ability to rise from thesea to dry land and to return indicates that amphibians are liminal creatures,like divine kings and juru kunci. They thus have a special affinity as shamanictotems. Birds can be seen as liminal in the sense that they fly, and this may bewhy both a bird—Garuda—and a turtle are involved in the amrita narratives. Ifpresent-day paleo-zoological theories are true, dinosaurs are the directancestors of birds, which indicates an even greater degree of liminality—aconnection with an ancient time and with a world where humans did not yet exist.Image [images/p158-001.jpg]Garuda figure flat on the ground with a turtle on its back at Candi Ceto.This idea of liminality may be enough for a general appreciation of theiconography, but when it comes to Tantra, there are always deeper levels ofmeaning. Tantra is about action and action is the manifestation of process—andthis specific process involves fluids of various kinds.The human foetus begins its existence as an amphibian, living in the fluidfilledsac of its mother. Even earlier, it is created through the mingling of fluidsfrom both parents. When the infant is born, there is an expulsion of more fluidfrom the mother, and the almost ritualistic bathing of the newborn. Theseassociations were not lost on those who created the Tantric worldview. Theyunderstood that there was a power in these specific fluids that far exceededtheir appearance as mere bodily excretions. Blood and semen became the Red andthe White tinctures of alchemy, of course, but the esoteric philosophers andalchemists who began this investigation did not stop there. They extended theirresearch to other bodily excretions as well, including urine and feces, but alsovaginal secretions at various times during a woman's period. They attempted tounderstand precisely which organs and other elements of the human body owedtheir creation to the male contribution of fluid, and which to the femaleessence. Attempts were made to synchronize bodily rhythms to solar and lunarpatterns, to create complex matrices that would enable practitioners to caressthe entire web of existence and provoke one or another response based on theirunderstanding of the process.Once it was understood that such a matrix did exist, the realization set in thatit existed in every aspect of human experience—biological, psychological,chemical, spiritual, physical, architectural, musical, even political. Hence theelaborate calculations and iconography at Chartres Cathedral in France, forinstance, which contains much alchemical symbolism in the form of statues andother images, but which also was built as a kind of device for enhancing thespiritual experience according to the mysticism associated with its geometricalproportions—what in Asian religion is called mandala. The science behind thecreation of these mandalas in stone is known as Vastu in India, and themathematical and geometrical considerations that go into their design arespecific to their purpose. Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh—as well as Borobudur,Prambanan, and other monuments in Java—were designed with a goal similar, if notidentical, to the Gothic cathedrals of France.CANDI SUKUHThe temple keepers have erected wooden gates to prevent visitors from trippingon the genitalia.Jakarta Post, 26 October 2008Less than a mile from Candi Ceto is Candi Sukuh. This temple is so notoriousthat one Indonesian academic felt compelled to write an article entitled “CandiSukuh is not a Porno Temple.”19 To be sure, there are even more Tantricreferences at Candi Sukuh than at Candi Ceto. The photograph of a headless manclutching his em-palanged phallus opposite represents only one of them.Image [images/p160-001.jpg]Temple at Candi Sukuh.While Candi Ceto's main iconography was the lingga-yoni and Garuda sculpturesflat on the ground, at Candi Sukuh we have an extensive inventory of reliefs ina typical Javanese (rather than Indian) style. As you can see in the imageabove, we also have some interesting architecture that many visitors haveassociated with a type of design more common in Mexico and Central America thanin Southeast Asia, which has given rise to all sorts of von Daennikenesquespeculation.These reliefs are informative, for they emphasize once again the relation ofthese temples to the gathering of amrita. Considering the time at which theywere built—toward the end of the last Hindu-Javanese dynasty—one could alsoclaim that their builders’ obsession with amrita and with associated ideas ofimmortality, health, power, and fertility seem nearly desperate. It may be thisvery desperation in the face of imminent collapse that led the builders toreveal more of the secrets than they might have otherwise.The reliefs depict scenes from various stories familiar to audiences of thewayang kulit, the shadow theater. Prominent among them are Semar and other Javanese personalities, including several strange Garuda figures that actually mayor may not represent Garuda, as well as ithyphallic reliefs of various types.Unfortunately, the same haphazard restoration work that plagued Candi Ceto isalso evident at Candi Sukuh.Image [images/p161-001.jpg]Closeup of headless man grasping em-palanged phallus (see page 195).According to published reports, there were “scores” of yoni figures at Sukuh,but the workers who managed the restoration had no idea where to put them, soinstead they stacked them in a warehouse. The yoni were made in the typicalIndian style, “with a groove for water to flow through ... these were used tocollect and make holy water ...”20In the Indian religious context, “holy water” is, of course, amrita.In addition, the main lingga—nearly six feet in height, and complete with palangballs—that stood at the entrance to Sukuh was removed and brought to theNational Museum. Therefore, in order to understand the complete design, one hasto visualize the replacement of these critical structures. What is presented,then, is a temple to the sacred sexuality of Java.On the opposite page are three photographs that show the structure at Sukuh. Thefirst shows one of the wooden gates erected by the temple custodians. Above thegate is the inevitable guardian, shown close-up in the second image. The stylemore closely resembles those of Bali than the previous examples at Borobudur andPrambanan. The third shows the other side of the shrine, with another set ofwooden gates and the obligatory guardian at the top. At the left of the picture,you can see a figure with an exposed (and uncircumcised?) penis. The photo atthe top left of page 164 gives us a closer look at this enigmatic creature.On the other side of the gate there is another figure, shown top right on page164, in a serpentine motif. These odd, almost surreal, images are believed to bechronograms, or candrasangkala in Javanese. They are a graphic method of statingthe year in which the edifice was completed. It is a kind of Javanese Kabbalism,in which an image represents a word and that word represents a number. Thisone—which shows an elephant, a serpent, and other images—is understood asrepresenting the year 1378 in the Saka (Hindu) calendar, or 1456 CE. While thisinterpretation is certainly accepted by most scholars, there are those who seein the use of these symbols something deeper than the calendar.21 That may bebecause the range of numbers is limited to the digits 1 through 9, but thenumber of words that can be used to represent numbers varies widely and seems tobe at the discretion of the person creating the chronogram.Thus at Candi Sukuh, we find images—representing words, which themselvesrepresent numbers—that seem to be consistent with the theme of the temple andthat are not merely “dead” numbers. An elephant swallowing a snake isrepresentative of the Tantric nature of the site, for both elephants andserpents are very much in evidence in the other reliefs and have decidedlyTantric associations. The type of word-play involved in developing thesechronograms will be familiar to anyone who has studied Western alchemicalliterature, as well as to those familiar with the elaborate word games found inthe Zohar. It's one example of the twilight language that we described earlier,which serves both to conceal and reveal the intentions of the creators.In the photograph on page 165, we find what the wooden gates are protecting—alingga-yoni figure on the floor of the shrine, at the entrance where visitorswould have had to step over it in order to get into the inner areas. In thiscase, the lingga is clearly piercing the yoni. No ambiguity here. The yoni isroughly heart-shaped, with what appear to be fingers at either side, and thewhole image is surrounded by what may be a serpent or serpentine motif witheleven coils. The debris that can be seen in and around the figure are theremains of flower offerings.Candi Sukuh Temple:Image [images/p163-001.jpg]TOP LEFT: One of the wooden gates erected by the temple custodians.Image [images/p163-002.jpg]TOP RIGHT: Above the gate is the guardian, shown here in close-up.Image [images/p163-003.jpg]BOTTOM LEFT: The other side of the shrine, with another set of wooden gates andguardian at top.Image [images/p164-001.jpg]AT LEFT: A figure with exposed penis. AT RIGHT: Another serpentine motif.Taken as a whole, the lingga-yoni depicted here resembles a chalice with thelingga as the stem and the yoni as the cup. Considering some of the speculationthat has surrounded the identity of the Holy Grail in Western esotericliterature, this device may very well add another level of interpretation.There are several narratives displayed on the reliefs at Candi Sukuh—severaldifferent myth cycles that reflect legends common to Javanese culture and to thewayang kulit performances. In fact, the figures at Candi Sukuh are almostcertainly based on the designs of the leather puppets that are used throughoutJava even today. Their departure from traditional Indian styles is obvious anddramatic, yet their themes remain remarkably consistent with Indian Tantra.The story of Sudamala, the first of these narratives, bears some explanation. Asusual, it centers around the relationship between Shiva and his consort, Uma. Inthis case, Shiva wanted to make love to Uma, but she refused him on the basisthat the time was inappropriate. Angered, Shiva cursed Uma, turning her into thedreaded Bathari Durga. Durga, of course, is the demonic form of Uma. Desperateto have the curse removed, she turned to the five Pandawa brothers (heroes ofthe Indian epic Mahabharata). Impersonating their mother, she asked them topurify her. One of the brothers, known as Sadhewa, agreed and she was purified.Image [images/p165-001.jpg]Dramatic lingga-yoni on the floor of the inner shrine of the Candi Sukuh temple.The transformations of gods and goddesses is well-known in world religions. TheGreek gods frequently transform into animals or humans. Transformations can tellus a great deal about the personalities, powers, and functions of the deitiesinvolved. In the case of Uma, she has already been transformed from Parvati.Now, under the curse from Shiva, she undergoes another transformation, this timeto become a creature of the Underworld. Yet even that transformation is only apreliminary to her next incarnation as the mother of the five Pandawas.The message of the transformation of divinity may be a way of expressingimmanence—the presence of the divine in ordinary events, average persons, theenvironment, etc. Moreover, there is an implied reciprocal process—that of theaverage, the ordinary, the mundane becoming divine through transformation. Thisis the core concept in alchemy, whether of the chemical, the biological, or anyother form. While the religious experience is largely one of submission to thewill of God, the esoteric approach allocates to itself the ability—and thecourage, or foolhardiness—to become God.The narratives in stone that we find at Candi Sukuh and Candi Ceto are decidedlythe latter. There is no sense of submission to divine will in these temples.They were designed to be active machines for the transformation of consciousnessthrough the manipulation of symbols known as ritual.In the Sudamala narrative, we have a transformation from the demonic to thedivine facilitated through the use of water, the purifying substance parexcellence. The scores of yonis discovered at Candi Sukuh imply an aggressivecampaign of purification and transformation. To find that many yonis at thecomparatively small (by Borobudur or Prambanan standards) temple complex meansthat the approach taken at the site was mechanistic—one imagines an assemblyline of yonis and files of practitioners (believed to be hermits and ascetics)bathing in the sacred, life-giving water. This does not represent devotion inany generally accepted sense of the term, but rather direct manipulation of thesystem and its tools—in other words, a Tantric approach to spirituality.This becomes clearer as we examine more closely the iconography at Sukuh andrealize the extent to which Bhima, among others, has become “tantricized” andbeen enlisted in the process of spiritual transformation—a process that involvednot only being “tantricized,” but also “Javanized.” The result is a form ofTantra that can be considered unique, yet just as efficacious as its Indianoriginal.THE BHIMA CULT AND RITUAL PURITYAnyone who studies Indian religion comes to the realization that there are asmany forms of that religion as there are villages and towns in India. Someworship Shiva as the ultimate god; for others, it may be Brahma or Vishnu. On alocal level, different regions have loyalties to different gods and goddesses.Some worship Kali or Durga. Others worship Krishna, or Ganesha, or Uma, orParvati. Some Tantric sects are considered Shakti denominations, for theybelieve that the Mother Goddess is supreme; others, of course, are Shivacircles. The varieties are endless, but, in the final analysis, all aremanifestations of an overall belief system that we call Hinduism for the sake ofconvenience, for they have more relationship to each other than to anythingoutside of Indian culture.This malleable quality of Indian religion lends itself well to regionaldifferences abroad, as well. In Indonesia, the forms that were adopted early inits history were more or less normative. The architecture of Borobudur andPrambanan is evidence of a careful emulation of its Indian source—in theirlayout, in their adherence to the requirements of Vastu, in the iconographicdesigns of Buddhas, gods, and goddesses, and even in the lingga-yoni structures.Centuries later, however, all of this changes.The temples at Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh represent a significant departure fromIndian norms. The Majapahit dynasty was under enormous pressure from within andwithout. Islam was dominating the archipelago from its outposts along the coastsand the trading centers, moving slowly inland and converting Javanese to itsfaith. Added to this was an internecine political situation of nearly Byzantineproportions. As Islam moved into Central and East Java, the Majapahit rulersmoved farther and farther east, up into the mountains where they establishedtheir cult centers. At this point, either due to lack of time or funding, or toa general desire to reconnect with their cultural roots in the face of the“alien” faith of Islam, they abandoned traditional Indian architecture.These two temples in particular are built in a terrace style, layered up theside of the mountain. Rather than having a central shrine or temple that is inthe center of a square or rectangular plaza, the main temples at each site areapproached from one direction only, terrace by terrace. There has been muchspeculation as to the purpose behind the design. Why is the main temple in theform of a truncated pyramid? Or is the appearance of the temples more the resultof bad or incomplete restoration work than deliberate design? In the nextchapter, we will look at another such terrace-style temple complex, but for now,what draws us more deeply into Candi Sukuh is the proliferation of symbols thatdemand closer inspection.Bhima is one of the central personalities of the Mahabharata. This epic tale isthe story of a war between two families, the Pandawas or Pandavas, and theKauravas. Bhima, a member of the Pandawas, is well-known for his militaryprowess and incredible physical strength. He is the son of the Lord of the Windand Air, Vayu, and brother to Hanuman, the trickster and monkey god who is theloyal friend of Rama and Sita. (Vayu is also known as the first of the gods totaste the amrita when it was produced by the Churning of the Milk Ocean.)Esoterically, Bhima is associated with the “ether,” the source of existence and“fulfiller of desires of all living or lifeless beings,” according to the LingaPurana.22 This is consistent with his lineage from Vayu, the Lord of the Windand Air.Bhima's attraction for the Majapahit rulers was probably his role as the fabledmilitary commander in the Mahabharata. Some of the reliefs at Candi Sukuh showBhima defeating his enemies. The panel on page 169 depicts Bhima in thecenter—recognizable by his curled hair—lifting an enemy into the air with onehand.23 The enemy figure is usually described as the giant Kalantaka (a form ofYama, the God of Death) or his twin, Kalanjaya, both of whom have been cursed byShiva to live in a cemetery as servants of Durga.24 This may be part of theSudamala story (see below), or it may represent the search of Bhima for amritaand his war against the God of Death, who must be defeated before the amrita issecured.Political legitimacy was as much a requirement for the Javanese rulers asmilitary superiority, however, and legitimacy was bestowed by the identificationof the political rulers with spiritual forces. Thus, Bhima had two functions forthe state: military strength and invincibility, plus his role as the provider ofamrita. The supply of this elixir vitae was seen as evidence of both thesupernatural power of the rulers and the favor of the gods. It was alsoessential to the rites of purification that were undertaken by the Tantricascetics at Sukuh. Purity was at the heart of the process of spiritualtransformation, just as it is in chemical transformation. Impurities can hinderor even derail the process at the very outset, so steps must be taken to removethose impurities before the process begins and all during the course of theprocess itself.Purity may be understood in two ways: as ritual purity, which comes from strictadherence to laws concerning mostly biological functions (eating, drinking, sex,menstruation), and as moral purity, which is more difficult to establish on anindividual basis. Often, moral purity was understood to be a reflection ofritual purity: if one followed all of the rituals laws, it was assumed one wasin a pure state.Image [images/p169-001.jpg]Relief at Candi Sukuh shows Bhima lifting an enemy in the air with one hand.Ideas of purity and tabu preoccupied social anthropologist Mary Douglas, who sawin these rituals an attempt to impose order on chaos. She also understood thatthere are political implications where purity and tabu are concerned, and that“bodily orifices seem to represent points of entry or exit to social units, orbodily perfection can symbolize an ideal theocracy.”25Purity, especially of water, was an obsession among the ancient Jewish Qumrancommunity as well. Discovered by accident in 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls tell usof a group of men and women for whom purity was so important that they believedprospective members of the community would pollute their water supply merely bydrinking from it. They thus imposed a two-year probationary period on newinitiates before they were allowed to drink from the community's water.26 Theyalso believed that if pure water was poured into an impure vessel, the entirepitcher of pure water became polluted (as if the impurity of the vessel couldtravel up the stream of water into the pitcher).27 These two ideas—of newinitiates being forbidden to drink pure water, and of impure vessels pollutingpure water—are obviously related. A prospective initiate is an impure vessel,and is in danger of polluting the entire community. When Mary Douglas waswriting her seminal work, Purity and Danger, there was not much known about theQumran community, as the bulk of the Dead Sea Scrolls had not yet beentranslated and published. Her observations about purity in Indian religion arethus restricted to Brahmanism and do not include antinomian Tantric practices,yet her insight concerning the importance of purity and tabu in ordering societyis relevant to our study nonetheless:... if uncleanness is matter out of place, we must approach it through order.Uncleanness or dirt is that which must not be included if a pattern is to bemaintained. ... It involves us in no clear-cut distinction between sacred andsecular. The same principle applies throughout. Furthermore, it involves nospecial distinction between primitives and moderns: we are all subject to thesame rules. But in the primitive culture the rule of patterning works withgreater force and more total comprehensiveness. With the moderns it applies todisjointed, separate areas of existence.28Douglas’ “rule of patterning” can certainly be applied to any study of thetemples on Mount Lawu. “Matter out of place” can apply, not only to ordinaryideas of dirt and pollution, but also to threats to society coming from outsidethe body politic. In this case, the “matter out of place” can be construed asthe threat to the Majapahit dynasty coming from Islam. The multiplication ofyonis at the site of Candi Sukuh seems to imply a greater insistence on ritualpurity, which may be a reaction to the perceived threat. The elevation of Bhimato the status of a cult totem may be another reaction: strength and militarymight as a deterrent to the forces massing against them.The third component is the proliferation of phallic symbols throughout the siteand the reliefs depicting military conquest on one hand and the elixir ofimmortality on the other. As Douglas observes, “there is no clear-cutdistinction between sacred and secular.” The state and the cult were one and thesame. The monarch was the earthly representative—if not the actualincarnation—of a god. In the Islamic context, this would be the height ofblasphemy. In that context, there would be no place for Tantric kings. It wasnot only one monarch's political sovereignty that was in peril; it was theoverall “pattern” itself. The entire social structure was in jeopardy—not onlythe Majapahit dynasty or any one monarch of it, but the entire Hindu-Javanistworldview. Monotheism would replace polytheism; Islamic art with its abhorrenceof icons and statues would replace Hindu art with its celebration of sensualityand voluptuousness, of divine, human, and animal forms. The arcane Javaneselanguage of ritual would be replaced by Arabic—the Mahabharata and Ramayana bythe Quran.Drastic measures were required, and these measures help us to understand howTantric ideas of sexuality were promoted and practiced in 15th-century Java. Thecult of Bhima is one way the last pre-Islamic rulers of Java sought toconsolidate and reinforce their power.At the time of the temple's construction, there was a struggle for power goingon between two Majapahit leaders. One was a queen, Suhita, who was bending tothe pressure of both the Islamic forces encroaching on Java and the Chineseenvoys who were jockeying for position at the court. The ascendancy of theseforeign influences was threatening a permanent dislocation of the Javanesenobility, causing some of them to rally around a rebel commander, Bhre(“prince,” sometimes translated as “duke”) Daha.29 Bhre Daha successfullyoverthrew the Queen, but was himself overthrown shortly thereafter. He fled tothe mountains east of Yogyakarta and declared his independence sometime around1437 CE, consecrating a royal lingga at Candi Sukuh in 1470 CE.This political situation was interpreted in the context of Javanese religion.The Queen of Majapahit was identified with Durga, in this case a form of Durgathat inhabits cemeteries. As we discussed above, this narrative belongs to theSudamala story in which Uma is cursed by Shiva. The reason for the curse isinterpreted variously, depending on the text involved (whether normative Hindutexts like the Mahabharata, or a Javanized form like the Kakawin Ramayana, orothers). In one version, already mentioned, Shiva wanted to have sex with Uma ata time she deemed inappropriate; in another version, Uma had illicit intercoursewith Brahma, which incurred Shiva's wrath. Regardless, the reason for the cursehad to do with sex and, moreover, inappropriate or illicit sex.Uma is cursed for a period of twelve years. She must spend the time as Durga,haunting a frightening graveyard, until her sentence is over or until she hasbeen freed by Sadewa. Her companions are ghosts and other creatures of thenight. The implication is that Queen Suhita is Durga, the evil goddess, who mustbe overthrown by the heroic Pandawa brothers. Bhima is one of those fivebrothers. In the relief shown opposite above at Candi Sukuh, he is shown withSemar, the quintessential Javanese god, banging a gong and preparing for war.In the next photograph, opposite below, we see the story of the Evil Queen—inthis case, Durga. She is in the cemetery of the gods, standing in the center ofthe relief and surrounded by ghostly emblems. In front of her, tied to a tree,is Sadewa, who alone has the power to free her from the cemetery. Durga isthreatening to kill him with her sword unless he relents and releases the cursethat Shiva has put upon her. In front of her is a bodiless head reminiscent ofRahu, but perhaps intended to be a ghostly figure. There are other weirdcreatures behind the tree to which Sadewa is tied.Behind Durga are two of her female servants, one of whom possibly representsKalika (her demonic servitor). The hanging, pendulous breasts are usually signsthat the women being depicted are evil, sometimes witches. For comparison, seethe example on page 175 from Prambanan, where an evil goddess or witch issuckling two imps on her rather tubular breasts.The only way Sadewa can lift the curse from Durga is if his own mother, Kunti,asks him to do so. Kalika, the female servant of Durga, demonically possessesKunti, who then demands that Sadewa lift the curse. Reluctantly, mother and sonreturn to the cemetery, but Kalika leaves the body of Kunti too early and theruse is revealed. Mother and son then return home, but Kalika once againpossesses Kunti.Image [images/p173-001.jpg]ABOVE: Bhima banging a gong, with Semar, preparing for war.BELOW: Uma, as Durga, in the cemetary of the gods.Image [images/p173-002.jpg]To make a rather long and intricate story a bit shorter, Sadewa finally doeslift the curse from Durga, who then turns back into the beautiful Uma. Shivablesses Sadewa and gives him the name by which this story is known, Sudamala(“one who cures sickness”). Further along in the story, Sudamala cures a hermitsage of his blindness and is rewarded with a wife.Many elements of this story could have been applied easily to the politicalsituation at the time, even going so far as to legitimize the reign of BhreDaha. Queen Suhita is, of course, Uma-become-Durga. Bhre Daha is himselfSudamala, or perhaps Bhima. The nobles who stayed with Queen Suhita can beportrayed as having been possessed by Kalika, and so on. In a sense, it is ablameless way of presenting political events: the Queen has been cursed; hersupporters are possessed by demons; all will come right in the end if Bhre Daharemains steadfast and lifts the curse from the Queen so that she comes to hersenses. Perhaps Queen Suhita was “cursed” for the same reason Uma was cursed byShiva: for whoring after the foreign elements, the Chinese and the Muslims.The warlike atmosphere represented by some of the reliefs at Candi Sukuhcertainly seems to reflect a preoccupation with armed conflict. The relief onpages 176 and 177 is controversial, and scholars disagree on what exactly isbeing represented, since the figures seem anomalous for a temple. There is someagreement that there is a panel missing between the left panel and the center.Nevertheless, what we have is certainly suggestive for anyone who has studiedthe works of Eliade concerning alchemy.30 The general impression is of an ironworker (left panel) who is engaged in making weapons of war, among them thefamous kris—a weapon believed to have mystical properties. At the far right is afigure of a person working the bellows that keep the fire burning hot. Whatseems totally out of place is the rather strange dancing elephant and dog in thecenter panel.A closer look allows us to see the weapons being made more clearly, just to theright of the iron worker's head. They are obviously swords and axes used inbattle, minus their wooden hilts. Above the figures of the swords are enigmaticsymbols that some observers claim are mystical signs associated with thecreation of weapons.Looking yet more closely, in the photo on page 177, we can see that thosesymbols are tridents (usually associated with Shiva), a sword shape, anhourglass type figure, and several serpentine forms. The author has yet to see aconvincing identification of these figures.Image [images/p175-001.jpg]An evil goddess or witch is represented at Prambanan suckling two imps on herrather tubular breasts.Image [images/p176-001.jpg]OPPOSITE ABOVE: Relief at Candi Sukuh suggestive of the manufacture of weaponsof war.OPPOSITE BELOW: Detail showing swords and axes.Image [images/p177-001.jpg]ABOVE: Close-up showing tridents associated with Shiva and other weapons.As reference to Eliade's work suggests, the presence of these reliefs at aTantric temple may not be as out of place as it seems:In our view, one of the principle sources of alchemy is to be sought in thoseconceptions dealing with the Earth-Mother, with ores and metals, and, above all,with the experience of primitive man engaged in mining, fusion and smithcraft.... Now these techniques were at the same time mysteries, for, on the one hand,they implied the sacredness of the cosmos and, on the other, were transmitted byinitiation ... mining and metallurgy put primitive man into a universe steepedin sacredness.31Eliade identifies alchemy and alchemical processes with ceremonial initiation,as well as with psycho-biological processes, and rightly understands that Indianalchemy and Tantra are linked.32 By completing the circle with metallurgy andsmithcraft, Eliade has given us a tool for understanding the role that thisrelief plays in such an erotically charged Tantric temple as Candi Sukuh. TheGerman Tibetologist Siegbert Hummel goes even further when he demonstrates thatthe blacksmith represents fertility and shamanic initiation in Tibet, a countrywith close ties to Java, as we have seen.33We can as easily identify the figure at the far right of the relief as operatinga churn as a bellows, and it was the churning of the ocean that gave us thewater of life, the sacred amrita. The iron worker on the left panel istransforming the raw material of the earth into items sacred to Shiva, a processanalogous to human procreation. The kris—the long knife (or short sword)familiar to anyone who has spent time in the region—has long been understood torepresent Shiva and the vital life force. The mysticism surrounding this iconicIndonesian and Malaysian weapon is profound and extensive. Even such awell-known personality as Gerald Gardner (1884–1964), founder of the modernWicca or Witchcraft movement that bears his name, wrote a monograph on the krisduring his sojourn in the archipelago that is still reprinted today in studiesof this enigmatic device.34To Indonesians or Malaysians, the kris (sometimes spelled keris or kriss) isequivalent to the Arthurian Excalibur. The knife often (but not always) has awavy, serpentine blade that is immediately recognizable. A kris must be made bya qualified craftsman who is also part shaman. It is a sacred duty, to be begunon propitious days and tied to the personality of its owner; the knife itself isbelieved to embody the maker's soul or spirit, his shakti. Like Excalibur, it isa personal weapon; not everyone can lift the sword from the stone. No one shouldtouch or use another's kris, except under particular circumstances. They areworn by sultans and (male) members of noble households on ceremonial occasions.They can be very simple, or as ornate as possible, their scabbards studded withprecious gems and cased in gold and silver.That the kris has peculiar characteristics is something to which the author canreadily attest. Once, in the city of Melaka in Malaysia, he was browsing througha small curio shop crowded with the usual odds and ends, souvenirs, andbric-a-brac. On one shelf, behind rows of tiny figurines and other precariouslyarranged merchandise, was a simple wooden kris. He noticed it, but did notretrieve it for a closer look (worried as he was that he would knock down anintervening row of delicate clay figurines in the process). Instead, as he madeto leave the aisle, the kris “fell” off the shelf and landed on the floordirectly in front of him.The sheer impossibility of this was astonishing. None of the merchandise thatblocked the knife had moved or been disturbed in any way. It was as if the krishad flown over them from the back of the shelf and through the very narrow spacebetween the figurines and the next shelf above them. (For what it's worth, thistook place on October 31. Halloween, however, is not a holiday celebrated inthat predominantly Muslim country.) Of course, the author felt compelled topurchase the kris, which is shown in the photo on page 180.The panel in the controversial relief shown above that contains the elephant andthe dog has given rise to all sorts of speculation. The author believes itrefers to one of the stories in the Jataka—the tales of the previousincarnations of the Buddha, some of which are depicted on the panels atBorobudur. In this case, the Jataka in question is the Abhinha Jataka, which isquite short.35 In the story, a dog befriends an elephant. The dog eats whateverfalls from the elephant's mouth and grows fat in the process. Gradually, theelephant becomes aware of the dog and they develop a close friendship. It shouldbe noted that this is no ordinary elephant, but the elephant of state—a memberof the royal retinue.Image [images/p180-001.jpg]Magical kris purchased by author.One day, however, the mahout (the man in charge of the elephant) sells the dog.The elephant falls into a deep depression, and no one knows why. Finally, a wiseman discovers the truth and asks the king to demand that the dog be returned, orelse a penalty will be imposed on the owner. This is done, and the dog and theelephant live happily ever after.According to this Jataka, the dog was a lay disciple of the Master (the Buddha).The elephant was an aged Elder, and the wise man was the Buddha himself. Thisstory was told as an illustration of reincarnation, for the frame of the taleconcerns several monks remarking on how close a lay disciple and an Elder areand wondering at its meaning. The Buddha tells them that they knew each other ina previous life, as a dog and an elephant.What relevance does this episode—from an anomalous Buddhist and not a Hindu orJavanese source—have for Candi Sukuh? Is it another allegory of the politicalsituation? Since we seem to be missing at least one of the relevant panels, wemay never get to the bottom of this mystery. Is it possible that the elephantrepresents the Majapahit kingdom, and the dog represents the kingdom's subjects,who have been “bought” by the evil Queen Suhita? Does the restoration of thedynasty by force—the iron worker making an arsenal of weapons—represent the kingdemanding the return of the dog, under dire penalty?Realizing that Candi Sukuh is a temple, and a Tantric one at that, it isnecessary to look a level or two deeper. We have seen that the panels showingthe manufacture of weapons at an ironsmith's anvil is a metaphor for thealchemical—i.e., Tantric—process. The other erotically charged emblems at thesite reinforce the idea that this was not the place to make a naked politicalstatement, but a machine in stone for effecting cosmic change and transmutation.A necessary quality of the “twilight language” is that it can refer to multiplelayers of meaning simultaneously. A political illustration is also an alchemicalfigure, is also a Tantric yantra or mandala, is also a spiritual truth.THE BIRD-MEN OF CANDI SUKUHThe stonework at Sukuh is awash in references to amrita, to the transformationof gods into demons and back again, and surprisingly to the practice ofKundalini yoga, the art of transforming physical energy into spiritual force.Let us look at some of these examples before we come to any conclusions.First, let us examine the “bird-men,” which some assume to represent Garuda.These figures—most of them missing their heads and thus causing more difficultyin identification—are usually associated with the gathering of amrita from theNagas, or serpents. They seem strangely humanoid, unlike the usual depictions ofGaruda. In some cases, they are shown standing on serpents, which is a directreference to the story of Garuda and his seizure of the amrita from the Nagas.Some have talons; others, like the one on page 182, seem to have human feet andhands, although they all have wings.Image [images/p182-001.jpg]A “bird-man” statue at Candi Sukuh.Image [images/p183-001.jpg]A “bird-man” at Candi Sukuh, standing on serpents.Image [images/p184-001.jpg]Garuda holding an elephant and turtle in his talons.The relief opposite shows Garuda holding an elephant and a turtle in his talons,a reference to the tale of Garuda in the Mahabharata that occurs immediatelybefore he is sent to retrieve the amrita from the Nagas, the serpent gods.The photo opposite and the two photos below clearly show the Nagas at the baseof one of the reliefs and one at the entrance to the complex, thus reinforcingthe idea that at least some of these bird-men are Garuda and that the theme ofthe statuary is amrita.Image [images/p185-001.jpg]Serpent gods or Nagas at the base of a Garuda relief.Image [images/p185-002.jpg]Nagas at the entrance to the temple complex.Image [images/p186-001.jpg]Massive turtles at Candi Sukuh above and opposite.Now let us look at the massive stone turtles that are one of Sukuh's mostimpressive features. The next three images show stylized turtles at the base ofthe temple entrance. The last shows, in a close-up, sticks of incense insertedin the ground next to the turtle.The turtle has a special significance, of course. It was on the back of theturtle that the Churning of the Milk Ocean took place, so their appearance atSukuh only serves to reinforce the idea that the purpose of the temple was thecollection of amrita. Many authorities believe that these statues served somefunction as offering tables or altars. Another scholar, however, has offered adifferent interpretation of the turtles at Sukuh and it is worth considering.Victor M. Fic was a Czech student at the end of World War II who escaped toCanada at the time of the Communist takeover, after having been arrested andsent to prison. He became involved in Asian studies and, in the 1960s, wasexecutive secretary of the Institute of Southeast Asia at the prestigiousNanyang University in Singapore. Fic has written extensively on Communism andEastern European politics on the one hand, and on Asian religion, culture, andpolitics on the other. His special interest seems to be Indonesia, and he haspublished several books on that country. In one of these, he makes the startlingclaim that the turtles of Candi Sukuh represent nothing less than an esotericmaneuver from Tantra yoga known as the vajroli mudra.36Image [images/p187-001.jpg]Image [images/p188-001.jpg]Note sticks of incense sticking in the ground.According to the Shiva Samhita—a core text of Hatha yoga that has influencedgenerations of scholars and practitioners alike—the vajroli mudra is “the secretof all secrets, the destroyer of the darkness of samsara.”37 The term vajrolicomes from the word vajra, or “thunderbolt” (in Tibetan, dorje). In order toprevent the loss of psycho-spiritual energy, yogins attempt to restrict the flowof semen during sex using various methods. Some of these permit orgasm butrestrict ejaculation, instead diverting the ejaculate back into the body usingone of two methods. The first, called sahajoli mudra, involves blocking theurethra in such a way that the seminal fluid flows into the bladder, from wherethe grosser physical elements are eventually expelled, but not the rarer,spiritualized elements. The second, known as amaroli mudra, uses the penis as akind of vacuum cleaner to draw the ejaculated semen as well as any fluiddischarge of the female partner—a mixture of male and female fluids known as theamrita—back into the male body. These methods are subsumed under the rubric ofvajroli mudra, the “thunderbolt” mudra.In both cases, yogins train by exercising various muscle groups, contracting theurethral muscles used to restrict the flow of urine (for example), or, in thecase of yoginis (female practitioners of yoga), the vaginal muscles. The idea isto retain the energy that would otherwise be dissipated in the sexual act andredirect it upward along the nadis or etheric nerve channels in the body,activating the chakras along the way until the sacred marriage of Shakti (theenergy) and Shiva (consciousness) takes place in the chakra in the brain, behindthe eyes.The relationship of the turtle to this process becomes clear if we think of howthe turtle withdraws into its shell. This retraction mimics the retraction ofthe urethral or vaginal muscles during the vajroli mudra. Understanding thatthis mudra is the “secret of all secrets” and is at the very heart, not only ofHatha yoga, but of Kundalini yoga and Tantra, we can appreciate the importanceof Candi Sukuh as a temple designed specifically to train its devotees in themost powerful of all Asian esoteric practices. This mudra is designedspecifically to collect amrita—the commingled male and female essences thattogether guarantee immortality and liberation. It is represented in a templecomplex surrounded by symbols of amrita and transformation. Should the templeever be completely restored to its original design—complete with the many yonisand lingga—the overall effect would be deeply profound, for it would becomeobvious that Candi Sukuh was much more than a mysterious pile of rocks andstones, but was as important in its day as Chartres Cathedral was in France.They were both designed as a book of instruction, as well as engines ofalchemical transformation. Although both monuments refer to the same process,they use different forms of the twilight language to do so. In the case of theGothic cathedrals, the form the language takes is Biblical; in Candi Sukuh, thereferences are to Hindu-Javanese religion and scripture. The differences mayreflect cultural distinctions and not a different process entirely.At Sukuh, we find the fascinating relief on page 190, showing a personageholding two thunderbolts. Depictions of stylized thunderbolts, known as vajra ordorje, are rather rare in Javanese temples, so this one commands a great deal ofinterest, aside from its vaguely Central American appearance (another reasonmany visitors are reminded of Mayan temples when they see Candi Sukuh). Whetherthis figure is a king or a god is difficult to tell. He is standing on whatseems to be a crescent moon, and is wearing a crown, reminding us of the famousBurney relief (shown on the opposite page), now at the British Museum, of aMesopotamian goddess (Ishtar, or Ereshkigal?) or the demoness Lilittu (theoriginal “Lilith”).Image [images/p190-001.jpg]Figure holding two thunderbolts at Candi Sukuh.In the Burney relief, the winged figure is depicted holding the “rod-and-ring”insignia in her two hands. This is believed to represent a measuring cord androd, implements that the Sumerian goddess Inanna took with her during herdescent into the Underworld. They were also given to the god Marduk—who defeatedthe dread monster Tiamat—as symbols of his authority and as weapons.With her wings and taloned feet, the figure in the Burney relief easily could bethe female version of the Garuda statues at Candi Sukuh. In fact, in one episodein the life of Garuda, he lifts an elephant and a turtle with his talons inorder to devour them. As we have seen above, there is a relief at Sukuh thatdepicts this episode, and the iconography is reminiscent of the goddess in theBurney relief with her talons on the twin lions. There is even a similarity inthe headdresses of the two.Image [images/p191-001.jpg]The Burney relief with “rod-and-ring” insignia.The author is not suggesting there is a direct link between these two figures,but rather that the idea of half-human, half-birdlike creatures that descendinto the Underworld to steal the secrets of immortality is a meme that deservesgreater investigation than can be accomplished here. Either the twocultures—Mesopotamia and India—developed the same concept independently, orthere was actual contact between the two at some remote period in history,either directly or through an intermediary culture. If the former, then theconcept may reflect some common experience rooted in agricultural beliefs andpractices of a chthonic (and perhaps lunar) nature.Image [images/p192-001.jpg]Phallic image with palang insertions.Image [images/p193-001.jpg]Ithyphallic image at Candi Sukuh.Some of the other figures are more clearly phallic in nature, as the reliefsshown on pages 192 and 193 demonstrate. The photograph on page 192 shows afigure that is probably only partially restored. While the penis is not erect,it nevertheless shows the presence of the palang insertions discussed earlier.On page 193, we see a relief showing an ithyphallic creature holding twoinstruments. The one in his right hand seems to be a horn, but the one in hisleft hand is unidentified. The creature's open mouth may serve a functionalpurpose, for the dispensing of holy water or simply for drainage. Its posturecalls to mind the ganas of Shiva that are found at Prambanan.Then there is the famous statue of a headless man grasping his penis shownopposite. While the palang insertions can be seen just below the glans, what isnot evident is any sign of other ornamentation or any means of identifying whothis is supposed to be. The figure's stocky quality may lead us to believe thatthis is Bhima, and there is something on his right hand that adds some credenceto this.One of Bhima's characteristics is a long, curving thumbnail on his right hand.This is said to be his most important weapon, and it can be seen on a reliefshowing him lifting Kalantaka, one of the giants of the Underworld. There issome similarity between that depiction and this one, so it may be purelyspeculation at this point, but it is probably safe to say that this relativelyunadorned statue represents Bhima. From the presence of incense sticks in frontof the statue, we realize that the local Hindu population reverences this figureas much as any other in the Sukuh pantheon. Its placement is alsosignificant—next to what appears to be a Bhima shrine, as shown in thephotograph at the top of page 196. On either side of the shrine are figures inrelief that appear to be standing on pedestals, with supplicants standing orkneeling before them. This is an image we will come across later.Another side of the same shrine shows rows of figures, including some monstrousentities on the lower panel, one of whom displays a phallus with the palanginserts (see bottom photo on page 196).Perhaps the simplest expression of the phallo-centric nature of Candi Sukuh,however, is the standing stone shown on page 197. It is possible that this stonepredates the construction of Candi Sukuh, and that may be one of the reasons whyMount Lawu and this site in particular was chosen for the temple. Mount Lawu wassaid to be sacred before Sukuh was erected, and was a place where ascetics cameto pray and meditate.There is something carved at the top and side of the phallic stone, but thedegree of weathering and erosion is so great that identification is difficult.One can hazard a guess, however, that it represents an animal of some sort,perhaps a serpent or something with a long hanging tail.Image [images/p195-001.jpg]Headless figure at Candi Sukuh holding phallus with the palang.Image [images/p196-001.jpg]ABOVE: Bhima shrine at Candi Sukuh.BELOW: Closeup of relief on the other side of shrine shown above.Image [images/p196-002.jpg]Image [images/p197-001.jpg]Ancient phallic stone at Candi Sukuh.Phallic statues—although they are the features that usually dominate anydiscussion of Candi Sukuh—are only one aspect of the site, however. We have seenthe multiple Garudas with their Nagas, and the giant turtle sculptures that mayor may not represent the vajroli mudra; we have seen the forge where the orefrom the earth is refined into sacred objects and the mysterious dancingelephant with his pet dog. We have also gazed at the reliefs that tell theSudamala story, with their Durga and Bhima, their Semar and Kalantaka. But thereis one final relief that demands our attention and it, too, is as mysterious asthe rest of the complex. It is replete with symbolism and open to a variety ofinterpretations.It is a large panel, shown opposite, ovoid in shape, suggesting the Greek letteromega. The shape is defined by the tails of two birds that meet at the top,where a wrathful Kala figure is seen as if it were guarding the entrance to atemple. Within the omega are two figures, standing on a serpent with two heads.One of the figures is on a pedestal, which implies divine status. The otherfigure is human and may represent Bhima. The divine figure is offering somethingto the human figure—and there has been some speculation that what is beingoffered is a flask containing the amrita whose collection is at the heart of theentire temple complex.Once again, we are faced with an artistic expression that is unique in Java.This is not the standard Indian-inspired iconography of the other temples wehave discussed so far. And, although the figures bear resemblance to thewayangstyle designs of the Sudamala reliefs, the overall composition of thepanel is quite strange. Due to the restoration work on the site that has beenproceeding on and off for decades, we cannot say for certain that the panel iseven in its original location. Its association with Bhima and the symbols ofbirds and serpents, however, seem to emphasize its relation to the amrita theme.Another possibility is that the ovoid shape represents what, in the West, iscalled a vesica piscis. The association of this shape with female emblems andsymbolism is well-known, and it may represent the vaginal opening. This wouldnot be out of the question at a site that contains “scores” of yonis. If thisanalysis is correct, then the figures within the ovoid—a double-headed serpent,a god on pedestal, a human receiving amrita—are consistent and may illustratethe actual practice of mingling the male and female essences in the vagina ofthe yogini in order to extract the elixir vitae.Scholars have noted the many ways in which Candi Sukuh does not fit thetraditional criteria of Hindu-Javanese design. One theory is that the truncatedpyramid style of Sukuh was intended to replace the traditional tri-partiteIndian mandala model of Underworld/world/heaven with a simplerthis-world/otherworld design. The top of the truncated pyramid may be the“interstice” between the two worlds—the place where the king or high priest metwith the gods.38 Whereas Borobudur, for instance, is a model of Mount Meru,Candi Sukuh seems to represent a more functional architectural design that isconcerned more with magic than religion—with the summoning of supernaturalpowers and attaining illuminated status in the here-and-now rather than innumberless incarnations. There is no sign of Buddhism at this site, other thanthe rather anomalous elephant-and-dog relief that seems to represent a storyfrom the Jataka that may have become part of Javanese sacred literature purelyon its own merits.Image [images/p199-001.jpg]The ovoid shape of the large panel is formed by the tail of two birds.Image [images/p200-001.jpg]Side view of the pyramid.This is Javanese spirituality pared down to its bare essentials. It was clearlyunderstood, at this late date in Hindu-Javanese culture and political hegemony,that amrita was the key to the mysteries, and that time had run out for thepatient wooing of divine succor from above. Although many previous monarchs hadbeen active in the practice of Tantra, as we have seen, at this late stage inthe last Hindu-Javanese dynasty, the impulse was stripped of its “higher”spiritual accoutrements and reduced to pure alchemy.Even more interesting is the fact that in the ... Bhima relief from Candi Sukuhthe existence of a sanctuary with purifying water is brought into prominence.The relation between Bhima and the elixir of life is evident from contemporaryliterature concerning Bhima ...39Image [images/p201-001.jpg]View from the top of the pyramid.The image above and the one on page 200, give two different views of CandiSukuh: the first is a side view of the “pyramid”; the second is a view from thetop.When viewing the site from the entrance, as in the photo on page 202, theanomalous design is plain to see, keeping in mind that the landscaping is newand not part of the original site. In this photograph, the terraces are easilydiscerned. The temple is on the western slope of Mount Lawu and thus thisentrance faces east.Image [images/p201-002.jpg]ABOVE: Terraces at entrance of the temple on the western slope of Mount Lawu.OPPOSITE: A close-up of the entrance showing the two guardians flanking thesteps.The photograph on page 203 gives us a closer look at the narrow staircase andits two guardians.Both Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh were sanctuaries that had water purification andthe elixir of life as their most salient characteristic. This process was notthe simple “immersion” type of baptism known to generations of Christians, oreven the mikvah, or ritual bath, of the Jewish religion. This process wasbuttressed by symbols implying a grand, sacred project of tremendous importanceand energy. Guardian statues abound, as well as images of Garuda, the serpents,and the turtles. These were not temples devoted to ablutions as a preliminaryrite, but sites sacred to the very idea of amrita as transformative. Aninscription at Candi Ceto concerning purification reinforces this idea in aprofound way:The first part of this inscription is similar to the Sukuh inscription, but hasa few added words at the end, hawaki ra ya hilangi, which translates into “thedisappearance of the body.” This has no other meaning than the deliverance ofthe immaterial soul from the material body.40Image [images/p203-001.jpg]OPPOSITE: A close-up of the entrance showing the two guardians flanking thesteps.The phrase “disappearance of the body,” which is said to take place through therituals of amrita at Candi Sukuh, has levels of meaning that may transcend theconcept of the deliverance of the soul from the cycles of samsara. This“disappearance” is what takes place during the ritual of the pancatattva, or“five elements,” which culminates in maithuna: the ritual sex act. For the riteto be successful, both partners must become gods. Their physical bodies aretranscended in the act and their grosser elements disappear in the process ofmarrying Shakti to Shiva. Otherwise, why would a temple devoted to purificationbe surrounded by emblems of lingga and yoni? Traditional Western ideas ofbaptism by water are pale imitations of the type of purification that isrequired by the acharyas or priests of Sukuh.What is also noteworthy about the system of symbolization at Candi Sukuh is thatthe male and female elements are always shown separated. There are massivephalluses and the many (missing) yonis, but aside from the single relief of thelingga-yoni at point of penetration at the very entrance to the complex, thereis no overt depiction of the sex act. When we remember some of the more blatantimagery found in India, and particularly at the famous Khajuraho temple inMadhya Pradesh with its countless depictions of men and women cavorting in avariety of sexual positions, the system at Candi Sukuh seems to be purelyutilitarian and functional. Sukuh is not a temple devoted to sexual pleasure anderoticism, but to the deliberate use of sexual functions for a different purposeand in a different context. The stress is entirely on the collection of amrita,which is also the central obsession of the Western alchemists, as well as of theChinese Daoist alchemists. Immortality and transformation are the key elementshere, in a remote temple that was designed as a very serious application ofTantra to spiritual growth and political stability, seen as differentmanifestations of the same process—and at a time of tremendous cultural andpolitical tension.14 See Richard Burton's translation (1883), Chapter II [12_chapter02.html#ch2]:“The people of the southern countries think that true sexual pleasure cannot beobtained without perforating the lingam, and they therefore cause it to bepierced like the lobes of the ears of an infant pierced for earrings. Now, whena young man perforates his lingam he should pierce it with a sharp instrument,and then stand in water so long as the blood continues to flow. At night, heshould engage in sexual intercourse, even with vigour, so as to clean the hole.After this he should continue to wash the hole with decoctions, and increase thesize by putting into it small pieces of cane, and the wrightia antidysenterica,and thus gradually enlarging the orifice. It may also be washed with liquoricemixed with honey, and the size of the hole increased by the fruit stalks of thesimapatra plant. The hole should also be anointed with a small quantity of oil.In the hole made in the lingam a man may put Apadravyas of various forms, suchas the ‘round’, the ‘round on one side,’ the ‘wooden mortar,’ the ‘flower,’ the‘armlet,’ the ‘bone of the heron,’ the ‘goad of the elephant,’ the ‘collectionof eight balls,’ the ‘lock of hair,’ the ‘place where four roads meet,’ andother things named according to their forms and means of using them. All theseApadravyas should be rough on the outside according to their requirements.”15 There has been some recent research on this subject among modern Indonesians,Thais, Burmese, and Filipinos. See, for instance, Terence H. Hull, “Penisenhancements: popular with sailors and miners, but not necessarily with theirwomen,” Inside Indonesia, Vol. 68, Oct–Dec 2001; and Terence H. Hull and MeiwitaBudiharsana, “Male Circumcision and Penis Enhancement in Southeast Asia: Mattersof Pain and Pleasure,” Reproductive Health Matters, Vol. 9, No. 18, Nov. 2010,pp. 60–67. Also Donald E.

Moore, “The penisinserts of Southeast Asia: an annotated bibliography with an overview andcomparative perspectives,” occasional paper No.15, Centre for South andSoutheast Asian Studies, University of California at Berkeley, 1988. This paperdiscusses the idea that palang indicates higher social status of women.16 See Laurence Bergreen, Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's TerrifyingCircumnavigation of the Globe (New York: HarperCollins, 2004), p. 266, pp.372–373 for the account of a 16th-century explorer visiting Java less than 100years after Candi Ceto was erected.17 See, for instance, his Kiss of the Yogini (Chicago: University of Chicago,2003), and his The Alchemical Body (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1996).18 The sculpture has since been moved.19 Prof. Dr. Bani Sudardi, “Candi Sukuh Bukan Candi Porno,” on the website ofthe Fakultas Sastra dan Seni Rupa Universitas Sebelas Maret (Faculty ofLiterature and Fine Arts at the March 11 University in Surakarta, Indonesia) atwww.fs.uns.ac.id [http://www.fs.uns.ac.id].20 Godeliva D.

One of theauthorities on early Javanese history—the text known as the Pararaton or “Bookof Kings”—implies that the Bhre Daha is a princess and not a prince; however, weknow from other sources that the title bhre was a title of nobility that wasprobably applied more often to princes than princesses. See J. Noorduyn, “TheEastern Kings in Majapahit,” Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 131(1975), no: 4, Leiden, 479–489. As for Daha, that was the capital of the kingdomof Kediri, which disappeared about the same time as the collapse of theSrivijaya dynasty in the 13th century CE. Thus the title Bhre Daha may have beenceremonial more than actual, except that there was a very brief resurrection ofthe kingdom just before the end of the Majapahit dynasty, of which the templeson Mount Lawu may be the best archaeological evidence.30 Mircea Eliade, The Forge and the Crucible (Chicago: University of ChicagoPress, 1962, 1978).31 Eliade, The Forge and the Crucible, p. 142–143.32 Eliade, The Forge and the Crucible, p. 127–141.33 Siegbert Hummel, “Der Goettliche Shmied in Tibet,” Folklore Studies Vol. 19,(1960) pp. 251–272.34 See G.

Built in the terraced style of Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh, thiswas evidently once an important spiritual center. This complex dates to the endof the ninth century, however, and as such is actually contemporary withBorobudur and Prambanan and about 500 years older than Candi Ceto and CandiSukuh. The highlight of the complex is the enormous lingga-yoni in the mainbuilding, with a few discrete bas-reliefs of Shiva and Uma depicting the momentof the creation of the world.I visited the site on a rainy spring day, after a hazardous ride up the dirtroad that clung, sometimes precariously, to the side of the mountain. The templewas deserted and the rain had just stopped. The silence was impressive and alittle unsettling. There was a sense of presence, something otherworldly, aboutthe place. Why that should be was not immediately apparent, since, at firstglance, Candi Ijo (the “Green” temple, named after its location on Green Hill)is similar to many other temples I had visited in Java over the past four years.Perhaps the utter lack of tourists or other visitors contributed to the solemnfeeling that was generated by the rain-swept stones and the glaring Kalas overthe temple entrances.Image [images/p205-001.jpg]Main building in temple complex of Candi I jo.Then, as I prepared to take photographs of the site, there came the sound of agreat buzzing of insects that suddenly rose up all around the silent shrines.This, combined with the gloom of the morning and the feeling of isolation fromthe rest of the world, almost made me forget my purpose in coming there.In fact, according to legend, the site is inhabited by a Naga called KyaiPoleng, who manages a flock of doves that the villagers claim can sometimes beheard flying at night.41As mentioned, the site dates to the late ninth century CE. It is not imposing inthe sense of Borobudur or Prambanan, with their hundreds of detailed reliefs andenormous statues to the gods. Instead, this complex—which originally encompassedeleven terraces and is now reduced to only a few—is simple in design andconstruction. It, too, has suffered from tremendous deterioration and ruin overthe centuries, and has tolerated a degree of restoration work in places. Thefour main structures have been wholly or almost wholly restored, and thesecomprise the main building and three ancillary buildings facing it.The main sanctuary, which houses the lingga-yoni, is quite impressive in itssimplicity. The lingga-yoni structure is about nine feet tall—the yoni about sixfeet high and the lingga another three feet on top of that. It towered over me,and I am almost six feet tall. The most interesting aspect of this structure,aside from its enormous size, is the carving of the snake and the turtle holdingup the spout of the yoni. We shall return to this in a moment.The three buildings that face the main structure are believed to have housedstatues of the Trimurti—Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu—but this really does not seemto be the case. Perhaps due to “creative” restoration, one of the buildingshouses a Nandi bull—the vehicle of Shiva—next to a pedestal on which there is nostatue at all.In another of the three buildings, there is only what appears to be a fire pit,probably for the Homa sacrifice. And in the last of the three buildings, thereis a simple yoni, minus lingga or any other statue. If the three buildingsrepresented the Trimurti at some point, those associations have since been lost.Image [images/p207-001.jpg]The main structure in background with three smaller structures in foreground.In the photograph above, you see the main structure in the background and thethree smaller structures in the foreground. There is a utility pole marring theview, whose purpose was not revealed to me during my visit.Below is a closer view, with the main temple in the background and the smallertemple housing the Nandi and pedestal in the foreground. The wall that surroundsthe four temples is easily visible, as well as another terrace a level down.Image [images/p208-001.jpg]Closer view of the main temple in background and smaller temple in foreground.Some detail of the wall and roof of the main temple contain motifs familiar fromthe shrines at Prambanan like the Kalas, the carved pillars on the reliefs, andsome of the ornamentation. There are a few figures in asana barely visible inthe niches on the roof of the structure, but the main niches in the walls areall empty.The photos below show two empty niches in the wall of the main temple. Thefamiliar Kala is there, as well as some carving above it of buildings that mayrepresent Mount Meru, judging from the triangular shape of the relief, whichsuggests a hill or mountain. The niche at right shows most of the same features.The entrance to the main temple housing the lingga-yoni is shown opposite. Ithas the dvarapala at the top and makaras at either side, as well as thepyramidal shape of the roof, which once again suggests Mount Meru.The lingga-yoni in the main temple at Candi Ijo is shown on page 210. As we willsee in a moment, there are two small reliefs on the wall behind the structure,one on the right showing Uma and one on the left showing Shiva.To stand in this temple, in the presence of this device, is truly moving. Thereis a heaviness about the place and the same eerie sense of presence felt at thesite is enhanced or magnified when standing inside this building. It isdifficult to describe a sensation that is at once claustrophobic and somehowmenacing. One is reminded of the phrase Terribilis est locus iste that one findsin the chapel at Rennes-le-Chateau. The large Naga serpent holding up the yonionly contributes to the feeling that one is in the presence of forces ancientand potent, and largely incomprehensible to the intellectual faculties.Image [images/p208-002.jpg]Two empty niches in the wall of the main temple with dvarapals and makaras.Image [images/p209-001.jpg]Entrance to the main temple.The photo on page 211 gives a closer look at the serpent and turtle holding upthe yoni. What is remarkable about this arrangement is that it differs fromother lingga-yoni designs in which the turtle is at the base supporting theserpent—which would be consistent with the Churning of the Milk Ocean, in whichthe turtle supports the entire operation. The author submits that this design isdeliberate, and refers back to the significance of the turtle in Kundalini yogaand in Tantra, representing the vajroli mudra. This placement of theserpent—obviously a phallic reference—below the turtle may indicate just thatpractice.Image [images/p210-001.jpg]The lingga-yoni in the main temple of Candi Ijo.The relief on the top of page 212 shows the goddess Uma, riding on a cloud andcarrying objects in her hands that resemble damaru—the Tibetan drum made fromtwo conjoined skulls. The reference is somewhat obscure, for the gods are rarelyshown flying on clouds. The implication is that the events being related tookplace before the creation of the world, before there was dry land. The authorwas fortunate that is was raining when he took this photo, for the waterdripping onto the relief made it more visible in the meager light available inthe building.He was not so fortunate in the relief shown at the bottom of page 212. HereShiva is also on a cloud, and also holding similar objects in his hands. Thatthese may be containers of amrita is a distinct possibility, for the creation ofthe world between Shiva and Uma required an act of sexual intercourse that isnot exactly what may generally be understood as intercourse.Image [images/p211-001.jpg]Turtle supporting the yoni resting on the head of a serpent.In virtually every episode in which Shiva and Uma “mingle essences,” Shivararely penetrates Uma in the usual fashion. Instead, his seed falls either inher mouth or her hand.42 Occasionally, it falls to the ground, where it createsmonsters or, in one version, Skanda (also known as Kartikeya, one of Shiva's twosons, the other being Ganesha). Shiva has the reputation of being an ascetic andhermit. He is normally portrayed naked or wearing animal skins; his hair ismatted and his flesh covered in ashes. He wears snakes for belts. He remains ina state of silent meditation for aeons at a time and does not like to bedisturbed. When he is disturbed, there is danger of his third eye opening—thedread Eye of Shiva that has enormous destructive power.Image [images/p212-001.jpg]ABOVE: The goddess Uma riding on a cloud on the wall at right of thelingga-yoni.BELOW: Shiva is also shown riding on a cloud on the wall at left.Image [images/p212-002.jpg]Yet, Shiva also has the reputation of being excessively sexual. He embodies bothextremes of sexuality: complete renunciation and a total, aggressive lust(kama). He is often in a state approaching madness and intoxication—that is,when he is not sitting in asana and lost in trance. According to one version ofthe tale, when Shiva and Uma first had intercourse, that single act lasted formore than 1000 years. The other gods became so anxious over this excessivelength of time that they used various means to try to interrupt them. One ofthese methods involved singing Shiva's praises outside the chamber where he andUma were in passionate embrace. When Shiva withdrew from Uma in order to seewhat the singing was about, his seed—which, until then, he had retained—fellonto the ground, making a golden pile. Agni, the God of Fire, saw it andconsumed it before Uma/Parvati could seize it. The end result was that all themale gods became pregnant, which was painful for two reasons. In the first andmost obvious place, a pregnant male presumably is not a happy male; in thesecond place, the seed of Shiva burned like fire itself.Books have been written in the attempt to decipher many of these legends, notonly from a historical or religious perspective, but also from Freudian andJungian perspectives, as well as a wide variety of other approaches. Part of theproblem lies in the fact that there is no single, coherent narrative. The RigVeda is one source, the Puranas another. Then there are the Tantras themselves,which are dialogues between Shiva and Shakti that add new material that may beat variance or inconsistent with the older texts. However, once we realize thateven the oldest book of the Abrahamic religions, Genesis, contains two separateand conflicting versions of the Creation myth, we are forced to accept the factthat, even though there may be inconsistent versions of the same legend, thatdoes not devalue any particular one of them. Instead, we have to analyze thetexts in an attempt to identify both the similarities and the differences, andunderstand why the differences exist and what they can tell us.As we have seen, the Javanese versions of the Indian epics are substantiallydifferent from the originals. In the case of Candi Ijo—which was built at thesame time as the more orthodox Prambanan—we have two reliefs that express astory concerning Shiva and Uma and display emblems for which we have noimmediate explanation. The deities seated on clouds are one anomaly; the vesselsthey carry are another. Authorities are generally in agreement that the reliefsreference the Creation; and where Shiva and Uma are concerned, creation alwaysimplies the seed of Shiva.As we saw in the previous chapter, there was an intense preoccupation with theelixir of life, amrita, at the late Majapahit temple sites. At those sites, theimportant figures were Bhima, Garuda, Durga, and the Nagas, with some assistancefrom Semar. Although we know that Durga is Uma and that Uma was cursed by Shiva,we do not see Shiva represented at these later temples except in the form oflingga. The legends depicted at Ceto and Sukuh are concentrated onamrita—immortality—and not on creation. At Ijo, on the other hand, therelationship between Shiva and Uma is more explicit and their presence in themain temple at either side of the large lingga-yoni reinforces the idea that thetemple is dedicated to their mystical union. We may say that creationnecessarily precedes immortality, and that the unifying characteristic betweenthem is this mysterious substance called amrita, which, somehow, is equated withhuman sexuality.As the first “couple,” Shiva and Uma are the source of all created beings. WhileBrahma is usually called the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva theDestroyer, one version of the myth in the Shiva Purana has Brahma unable tocreate until Shiva—who is originally androgynous, a form called Ardhanarishvara(from the Sanskrit root ardha which means “half”)—cleaves himself in half andthen mates with his female side, his Shakti who is Parvati and Uma. Thus Shivabears the connotation, not only of destruction, but also of regeneration. Shivadestroys his original nature in order to reproduce.The lingga is the symbol par excellence of Shiva. It is the source of the seedof Shiva that—when combined with the yoni of Parvati/Uma—produces the amrita ofimmortality. The Churning of the Milk Ocean is widely understood to be ametaphor for the sexual act, just as the fire stick—whose friction createsfire—is a sexual metaphor. The aeons-long intercourse of Shiva and Uma was saidto create enormous heat, which was one of the reasons the gods did what theycould to stop it. That the God of Fire, Agni, consumed the spilled semen ofShiva resonates with this concept.The enormous lingga-yoni at the main temple at Candi Ijo is easily understood torepresent the churn that produced the amrita and, in fact, the water that ispoured over the lingga is collected from the spout of the yoni and used as the“water of life.” Thus, there is a deliberate attempt to equate the creationstory of Shiva and Uma with the lingga-yoni and amrita.In a Tantric context, this act of creation is replicated in the practice ofKundalini yoga. The goddess at the base of the spine—actually, at the base ofthe sushumna nadi, which is analogous to the spine—rises up the seven worlds(called bhumi) or chakras to the sixth chakra at the level of the so-called“third eye” (the cranial vault), where she mates with Shiva, resulting in thespiritual orgasm at the seventh chakra that produces the flow or “rain” ofamrita (amritavarsa) that descends throughout the body. That the goddess takesthe form of a serpent is not as strange as it may seem. The religion of Java,for instance, is replete with serpentgoddesses who mate with human males.Kundalini yoga, however, is an individual practice designed for yogins whoretain their semen and cause it to ascend to the level of the head without theassistance of a female partner. In the Tantric rituals that incorporate sex,semen is also retained, ideally, by the yogin through various means, as we sawin the previous chapter, and made to ascend the same channel, the sushumna.However, great value is also placed on the female excretions, which areconsidered essential to the production of amrita. The mingling of these twosubstances is called maharasa or “great fluid.” What is not usually discussed sobluntly is that the actual physical elements—if produced by trainedpractitioners—are as valuable as the internalized ones, which is why the vajrolimudra is so critical to the ritual.While the processes typified by Kundalini yoga are designed to result in anindividual's attainment of that intense stage of meditation known as samadhi,those that are represented by the Tantric ritual of the Five Ms—the pancatattva—may have more mundane applications as well as spiritual ones. The distinctionsimply may be the distinction between mysticism and magic, as discussed in thefirst chapter. In the West, we have the tendency to view mysticism as a solitarypractice, something that concerns hermits and saints. We do not understand it asa group effort, or as something in which there is a partner. We may accept aguruchela (disciple) relationship, but not one in which there are two equalpartners of opposite gender cooperating in a single mystical effort. Mystics aresolitaries, in the Western worldview. They are usually not members of societiesor fraternal orders.Tantra offers a range of options, however. There are dualist and non-dualistsects, Shiva sects and Shakti sects. There are solitary, mystical approaches andthose that require a partner. There are those that include sexual intercourse,alcohol, and consumption of animal flesh as well as (possibly) entheogens, andthose that proscribe these practices. Yet, in the final analysis, Tantra is allabout method and less about dogma. Mantra, mudra, yantra—these are the basic,sensory elements in virtually all forms of Tantric practice, which indicatesthat the manipulation of reality through what the French poet Rimbaud called the“derangement of the senses” is at the heart of what Tantra is really all about.Whether this manipulation is for spiritual enlightenment or for more mundane,magical goals is up to the users of these systems. We are told that theacquisition of occult powers is a kind of side-effect of the practice and shouldnot be sought after for its own sake. The opposite is probably also true—thatthe pursuit of magical or occult powers will result in some form of spiritualenlightenment.At Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh, it seems likely that the pursuit of amrita wasmotivated at least as much by real-world concerns as it was by a purelyspiritual longing. At Candi Ijo, however, the mundane applications may not be soapparent to the casual observer. It was built, after all, at a time when theHindu-Javanese project was strong and unchallenged. But fertility and creationhave always been concerns, especially to an agriculturally based civilization,and the worship of the forces of nature has always been seen as a necessity.With Garuda and the Nagas so prominent at Candi Sukuh, we can understand thatthe theft or seizure of amrita from the serpent gods was the operatingprinciple; at Candi Ijo, there is no theft of amrita, but the actual creation ofit by Shiva and Uma. For that reason, if for no other, Candi Ijo is sacredground.Directly across from the main temple at Candi Ijo is a smaller temple thathouses Shiva's mount, the bull Nandi. The photo on opposite page shows the Nanditemple from the doorway of the main temple. Because Nandi is present here, it isassumed that the temple is dedicated to Shiva himself, especially as there is apedestal next to Nandi that is unoccupied. As at the main temple, theShiva-Nandi temple has the usual dvarapala head atop the entrance and makaras tothe sides.Inside this temple are the Nandi and the pedestal, as shown opposite.There is very little space inside this building for both of these objects, so itis a safe assumption that the Nandi is not in its original place. It may havebeen erected outside this temple, with the pedestal placed in the center with astatue of Shiva on top. As we will see in a look at the newest temple discovery,Candi Kimpulan, it is not unusual to have a Nandi statue outside in theelements.The photograph on page 218 shows the pedestal and the limited amount of spacearound it.Next to the Nandi temple, to the left of it facing the row of three ancillarytemples from the main doorway, is another temple with only a yoni present, shownon page 219. If theorists are correct, this would have been the Brahma temple.As we saw at Prambanan, the statue would have been placed on top of the yoni sothat the priests could pour water over the feet of the statue. The water thendripped into the yoni and, in that manner, become sanctified. Again, however,the yoni seems quite cramped in this small building.Image [images/p217-001.jpg]ABOVE: Nandi temple as seen from the doorway of the main temple at Candi Ijo.BELOW: Nandi, the bull upon which Shiva rode, is housed inside with an emptypedestal next to it.Image [images/p217-002.jpg]Image [images/p218-001.jpg]This photograph of the empty pedestal in the Nandi temple conveys a sense of thelimited amount of space in the room where it is housed.Image [images/p218-002.jpg]Yoni found in the small building that may have been a Brahma temple.Image [images/p219-001.jpg]Perforated window may be seen at the rear of this third ancillary temple.The third ancillary temple is notable because of the perforated window at therear. This photograph, taken from the front, shows the window on the rear wall.On the next page is a closer view of the perforated window.The purpose of the window was most likely to let out the smoke from a Homasacrifice, as there is nothing in this temple except what appears to be a firepit. Even here we can see the remains of some incense sticks that were burned inthe pit, indicating that it is still in use.Image [images/p220-001.jpg]ABOVE: Closer view of the perforated window.BELOW: Fire pit of the Homa sacrifice.Image [images/p220-002.jpg]Image [images/p221-001.jpg]This outdoor fire pit for the Homa sacrifice is in the shape of a reversedpyramid.Farther out, and down to a lower terrace level, there is a large pit obviouslydesigned for the Homa sacrifice, for it is in the shape of a reverse pyramid,which is the typical form for a Homa fire pit. Note the difference in stylebetween this fire pit and the one in the ancillary temple.Thus, the original purpose of these temples is still not completely certain.Except for the main temple building that houses the lingga-yoni quite easily forits size, the designation of the other three ancillary temples as Brahma, Shiva,and Vishnu seems somewhat contrived. There is only a yoni in the Brahma temple,and it is a very tight fit. There is a bull and a pedestal in the Shiva temple,also a very tight fit. And in the Vishnu temple, there is a perforated windowthat suggests it was designed for the Homa sacrifice, even though its fire pitis not in the traditional reverse-pyramid design, but is rather a simplerectangle. The reverse-pyramid style was known to the builders of Candi Ijo, forthere is a large one on one of the other terraces. Thus, we are faced with moremysteries.Image [images/p222-001.jpg]ABOVE: Note the size and sophistication of the terrace ruins of Candi Ijo.BELOW: View of the ruins of the upper terrace where the main temple is located.Image [images/p222-002.jpg]Image [images/p223-001.jpg]A closer view of the terrace ruins shows the foundation of a structure.The terraces are in near-total ruin, for the most part. The photographs oppositeand above nonetheless give some sense of the size and sophistication of thissite. It is well to remember that Candi Ijo is the name given to the site byrecent generations because of its location on Mount Ijo. There is no record ofits original name, nor of the people who built it.The photo at top left on page 222 is a view of some of the ruins, as seen fromthe upper terrace where the main temple is located. Below it is a view of one ofthe terraces taken from a bit farther down the hill. Above, we see the ruin ofthe central structure.As the top photo on page 224 shows, some of the foundations are more or lessintact, but the walls themselves collapsed long ago. The restoration project isslow and woefully underfunded. The site does not attract the attention thatBorobudur or Prambanan do, yet there seem to be as many as seventeen separatebuildings located on at least eleven terraces here. Most of the statues havedisappeared, and although there were some inscribed stones that made referencesto purification ceremonies, these were no longer in evidence when the author wasthere.The stone shown at the bottom of page 224 would probably have appeared over theentrance to one of the ruined temples. For now, however, it sits ignominiouslyon the ground.Image [images/p224-001.jpg]ABOVE: Inscribed stones make reference to purification ceremonies.BELOW: This carved relief would have been above the entrance to one of thetemples.Image [images/p224-002.jpg]Image [images/p225-001.jpg]Some roof ornaments are visible in the background of these ruins, as areremnants of makaras at either side of the makeshift entrance.Image [images/p226-001.jpg]This appears to have been a roof ornament with a lingga-like shapeImage [images/p227-001.jpg]Another perforated window suggest this building was used for the Homa sacrifice.In the image shown on page 225, there are some roof ornaments visible in thebackground, and remnants of makaras at either side of the makeshift entrancethat are a little difficult to make out due to the erosion.The photo opposite gives us a closer look at the roof ornaments and at whatmight have been a lingga-like finial for the top.The photo above shows another perforated window that suggests that the originalpurpose of this building was the Homa sacrifice, as the window would have letout the smoke.And on page 228 is yet another of the many temples in a state of ruin.Finally, the photo on page 229 shows the rear of the main temple at Candi Ijo.The dvarapala can clearly be seen in relief, as well as the elaborateornamentation carved into the stone, including pillars like those at Prambanan.What is clearly evident, however, is the attempt at restoration that showsstones of various colors and sizes pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle. This iscommon throughout the restoration work taking place in Java. There are simplytoo many stones, scattered over too large an area, and it becomes an impossibletask to fit them precisely back where they originally belonged. In addition,villagers have taken stones from the collapsed buildings to use in otherconstruction—a practice that is common worldwide.Image [images/p228-001.jpg]Another of the many temples in a state of ruin.Image [images/p229-001.jpg]A view of the rear of the main temple at Candi Ijo.POSTSCRIPTAs I was preparing to leave Candi Ijo, I decided to take some video footage ofthe site. I stood next to the main temple—the one housing the lingga-yoni—andsimply panned the entire area around it. When I finished, I found that my camerahad stopped working and was frozen in mid-function. I could not turn it off.None of the controls were working. So I removed the batteries, waited, andreinserted them. The camera worked fine after that.When I got home, I decided to view the video footage. That was when I noticedthat, every time the camera panned toward the main temple, there was anelectronic stutter, like a minor short-circuit. It only happened when the videocamera moved over the surface of the temple from its extensive pan of thesurrounding terraces.This peculiar malfunction has never happened before, or since. It was only atCandi Ijo that the camera acted strangely.41 See Sasono, Elbaz, and Ardyanto, Situs-Situs Marjinal [Sites out of Sight](Yogyakarta: PT Enrique Indonesia, 2002), p. 35.42 Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty, Śiva: The Erotic Ascetic (Oxford: Oxford UniversityPress, 1973, 1981), p. 271: “Even when Pārvatī receives the seed, she receivesit not in her womb but in her mouth or hand.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7CANDI KIMPULAN, THE WHITE TEMPLEOn December 11, 2009 workers beginning an excavation for a new library at theIslamic University of Indonesia were startled to find that their backhoes hadhit something quite solid. They had already dug down to a level about seven feetbelow the surface and had begun removing soil when they found that the soil wasnot as stable as they would have liked. They decided to dig down another twentyinches or so, and that is when they struck what they thought was solid rock.Instead, it turned out to be one of the most important archaeologicaldiscoveries of the decade.Image [images/p231-001.jpg]The main and ancillary buildings at Candi Kimpulan, the White Temple.Image [images/p232-001.jpg]A view of the archaeological site of Candi Kimpulanin the Spring of 2010 with a mosque in the background.What they found were two completely intact Hindu temples, conservatively datedto the ninth or tenth century CE. What is important about this discovery is thatit is the first time a temple from that period has been found in perfectcondition, with the statues still standing in their original positions. At theother, more famous, sites like Borobudur or Prambanan—or even Candi Suku, Ceto,Ijo, or any of the others—there had been significant destruction of thebuildings and deterioration of the stone reliefs, and the statues and pieces ofstatues were found scattered all over the landscape. Here, at the newlydiscovered site are two buildings—a main temple and a smaller ancillarytemple—that still had a Nandi bull, an exquisite statue of Ganesha, alingga-yoni, and some pedestals or altars, all in their original positions. Itwas as if someone had planted a time capsule almost three meters undergroundover 1000 years ago.Another striking feature of this site is the fact that the stones are allcompletely white. As you have noticed from the other photographs in this book,the usual coloration of the andesite stonework is dark brown to dark grey. Thisis odd, because it is entirely possible—even probable—that the volcanic eruptionthat buried Borobudur in the ninth or tenth century CE was the same eruptionthat buried this site. Yet, the larger complex shows significant damage from theelements, while the smaller site is unbelievably pristine.Image [images/p233-001.jpg]A closeup of the main building of the White Temple. Some damage may be seen tothe yoni above. Note the convex circles that will be discussed on page 238. Thestatue of Ganesha was found on the pedestal to the right of the lingga-yoniThe temple, called the White Temple, is a small one, probably used by a localvillage. That it was a temple to Shiva is obvious from the Nandi (Shiva'smount), as well as the statue of Ganesha (one of Shiva's two sons). There is theubiquitous lingga-yoni—one at each temple, which in itself is unusual—as well assome stranger features. In the first place, no statue of Shiva has been found sofar at the site. That implies that it was taken into safe-keeping at the time ofthe eruption, but that is pure speculation on the author's part. Also, the wallsof each building are rather high, yet there does not seem to be any means ofentering the temples except through some rather narrow doorways that are missingstaircases. It is possible that the staircases were made of wood that presumablydisintegrated over the centuries, since the temples are also missing roofs.Image [images/p234-001.jpg]ABOVE: A closer view of the main temple showing dvarapala heads at variousintervals along the top of the wall.BELOW: This is the smaller building showing two pedestals in front oflingga-yoniImage [images/p234-002.jpg]Image [images/p235-001.jpg]ABOVE: A closer view of the smaller temple.

However, it raises the question: Why have no similar temples been found inJava?On page 232 is a full view of the site as it appeared in the spring of 2010. Youcan see the imposing Islamic structure behind it, which is the university'smosque. That a temple to the Hindu god Shiva should be located so close to amosque is one of the things about Indonesia in general that is fascinating andso endearing. University authorities have stated that they will build around thetemple site and will attempt to incorporate it into the architecture. After all,they say, it is part of their culture and their heritage.In the first photograph of the White Temple itself on page 233, you can see somedamage to the yoni. It is not certain when this damage took place. The mostintriguing elements, however, are the convex circles that dot the floors of bothtemples. Some are of the opinion that they were supports for wooden pillarsholding up a wooden roof. If this were so, however, the circles would be flat.Some of them are, but others are clearly convex and could not have been used tosupport anything. Moreover, there is a vague sense that the circles were placedin a deliberately symmetrical fashion, which may imply either a more elaboratesuperstructure than has been imagined, or perhaps the representation of aconstellation in stone.All of this is pure speculation, of course. At this time, we have no way ofknowing what these strange circles represent. They are not found at any of theother sites we have so far investigated and, since the general consensus is thatthis site is the best-preserved in all of Java, it would be very useful to knowmore about them. The Ganesha statue was found in this temple, in front of thelingga-yoni and facing the entranceway, but it was removed for safe-keeping dueto the danger of relic hunters who sell these statues for a hefty profit on theblack market.The photograph at the top of page 234 gives a closer view of the main temple.You can see the dvarapala heads at various intervals along the top of the wall,as well as some small bas-reliefs at the putative doorways. If you look at those“doorways,” you can see that they are completely self-contained and are rathermore like window sills than doorways. It is still a mystery how anyone managedto get to the top of the temple, since so far there is no evidence of a ladderor stairway. One possible explanation is that the buildings were located in themiddle of a body of water and accessible only by means of a small boat, but thatmay be too fanciful a suggestion.At the bottom of page 234, the smaller building is shown, complete with theNandi and another intact lingga-yoni. There are also two pedestals that appearto be lotus pedestals, upon which the statues of the gods would have beenplaced. There are two in this building, which implies that two statues are yetto be discovered.At the top of page 235 is a closer view of the same building. Notice the pit onthe right that may have been a fire pit, but also may have been used to storewater for the temple ceremonies. The strange stone circles are present here aswell, but in this case, they seem flat and utilitarian. They are at the fourcorners of the building, with one oddly placed circle near the main entrance. Ifit was used to hold up the roof, then someone walking onto the floor from theentrance would have had to walk around the roof support, which seems odd.On the bottom of page 235 is another angle of the same building, showing thecircle placements. As you can see, the circle closest to the entrance is in aproblematic position if it is, indeed, a roof support.The four photographs shown on pages 236–237 were taken from different angles andfrom positions as close to the buildings as the author was permitted to get. Asyou can see, the walls are quite high. The number of circular structures on thefloor seem to be far in excess of what would have been required to hold up awooden roof.Some suspect that there may be two more temple structures yet to be discoveredat this site, one on either side of the smaller temple. This would be more inline with the typical Hindu temple arrangements in Java at the time, with a maintemple facing three smaller ones. We will have to wait for the excavation torestart before we know any more.Once the temple was accidentally found in December of 2009, the building of theuniversity library obviously came to a halt while everyone decided what to do. Akind of turf struggle took place between the university, which owns the site,and the government agency responsible for the preservation of antiquities. Allwork stopped and nothing more was done for months. Finally, at the end of 2010,work was scheduled to begin again, but the eruption of Mount Merapi—oddlyenough, probably the same volcano that buried the site in the first place 1000years ago—stalled work once again.The temple is called variously Candi Kimpulan (after the village in whosedistrict it was found) or Candi Pustakasala (the Sanskrit word for “library”).Like most Javanese temples, no one really knows what it was originally called.The fact that the structure is so unusual when compared to other Javanesetemples indicates that it may have been the center of a spiritual leader or sectthat was still Hindu, but different enough that an individual vision determinedthe style of the temple.That each building has its own lingga-yoni suggests that the purification ritesassociated with the production of amrita were just as important here as at theother temples. There are no Garudas or Nagas, no stories from the Mahabharata orRamayana. The simplicity of the temples may be their strongest point.Image [images/p240-001.jpg]One of two reliefs on either side of the entrance to the main temple shows asitting figure next to what appears to be a lotus plant.There are only two reliefs presently visible, to either side of the entrance tothe main temple. One is shown above. They seem to be identical. One is a sittingfigure—not in asana or any formal pose, but in a casual position—next to whomthere appears to be a lotus plant. Unfortunately, this does not help us toidentify the figure, since virtually every Hindu deity has been associated atone time or another with the lotus.The symbolism of the lotus is based on the unique nature of the plant. Its rootsare in muddy waters, but its stem rises high above the surface of thewater—sometimes several feet high—and then the actual flower rises stillfarther. For that reason, it is considered to be a metaphor for the human soulthat can rise above the mud and aspire to the heavens.According to Indian tradition, Vishnu was born from a lotus that grew from thenavel of Brahma. Buddha was also believed to have been born from a lotus, andthe badly deteriorated relief at Borobudur shows him walking on a series ofseven lotus plants at the time of his birth. Lotuses are also associated withthe chakras. Their flowers open as each chakra is awakened by the rise ofKundalini.The popular Indian goddesses Lakshmi and Sarasvati are usually depicted withlotuses, as are Krishna and Vishnu. It is rare that Shiva is associated with alotus, however, although it does happen. The figure in the relief with the lotusis, as mentioned, seated in a casual way, which does little to enhance itsimportance as a deity. Even its gender is not determined. As we have seen, thegods are usually depicted as standing, or sitting in a formal meditation asana.We are tempted to say, therefore, that the casual posture may indicate that thefigure is not an Indian god, but a human being or even a person from Javanesesacred literature, even though its style is, in all other respects, Indian. Thepresence of this relief at either side of the entrance to the main temple isjust another mystery of the site.The temple at Candi Ijo was built at about the same time as Candi Kimpulan. Tobe sure, Candi Ijo is relatively austere and simple when placed against CandiSukuh (for example) or Prambanan. It therefore has more in common with Kimpulan.Yet the architecture is quite different, aside from some ornamentation in theform of the dvarapalas and, of course, the lingga-yonis. That there would be twosuch entirely different building styles within a few kilometers of each other,and built during the same period, naturally raises questions and emphasizes oncemore how little we really know about the history of Indian religion in Java."},{"pageContent":"SECTION IIITANTRIC PRACTICEPRINCE HERMES.

The sexual referencesare clear and unambiguous in Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh—the later iterations ofthis theme in Java—and somewhat less obvious, but no less present, in theearlier Candi Ijo, Candi Kimpulan, and Prambanan in the form of lingga and yonithat are unambiguously sexual.We have also analyzed some of the narratives concerning sexuality in the Indianand Javanese epics, so we know that there has been a great deal of mystificationconcerning the sex act, and concerning gender relationships on otherlevels—jealousy, celibacy, motherhood, adultery, etc.That all of this is by no means restricted to Java or even to Asia is clear toanyone who has studied ancient religions. The religions of Sumer, Babylon,Egypt, Greece, Rome, and so many others all expressed sexuality in religious ormystical terms. Perhaps the most interesting of these is the hieros gamos: thesacred wedding. In this scenario, either two divine partners marry, or a divinepartner marries a human partner, or two humans marry under particularly sacredcircumstances.In any case, the two partners in question are identified as a king and queen.The natural reaction is to associate them with secular rulers, but we mustremember that kings and queens had more than a mere political function. They hadan additional, spiritual dimension, of which the Western concept of the “divineright of kings” is but one manifestation. There are biological lineageissues—bloodlines—that relate directly to sexuality, and there are spirituallineage issues that involve the blessing and favor (and sometimes theincarnation) of the gods.There is a similar blending of the secular and the spiritual in Jewish religion,where the Messiah is both a political and a spiritual leader, and must come fromthe appropriate bloodlines. The emperor of Japan is called a “son of heaven” andthe secular ruler of Tibet, until the Chinese invasion, was the Dalai Lama, whowas also the head of one sect of Tibetan Buddhism. While we may consider Tibetto have been a theocracy, the same is not true of Japan; yet both rulers havespiritual lineages and associations as well as secular ones. Indeed, the idea ofthe separation of church and state is relatively new.In Java, this concept managed to survive 500 years of Islamization by the simpleexpedient of incorporating Islamic elements, like the recitation of appropriatesurahs from the Quran, references to Allah and the Prophet, and others. Therewas a “readjustment” of the existing Hindu-Javanese practices so that theyconformed—at least in appearance—to prevailing Islamic theological requirements.This was not unusual for a country that had already accommodated both Buddhistand non-Buddhist Indian religious practices by assigning Javanesecharacteristics to them. This simply goes to the author's main argument thatpractice was more important than theory in Java, and Tantra, being more of apractice and somewhat less of a theory, fit well within the Javanese paradigm.This is particularly true of a very unusual ritual that takes place with someregularity to this day—a ritual that has nothing at all to do with Islam and yetone that the rulers of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo) are expected toobserve—the ritual marriage with the Queen of the South, Nyai Lara Kidul.Also known popularly as the Queen of the Southern Seas, Nyai Lara Kidul is aspirit queen who lives in an underwater palace in the ocean off the southerncoast of Java. She commands a spirit army. The legends concerning her areextensive and often contradictory, but the basic elements are that she was ahuman princess who either refused to marry or was exiled from the palace due toa disfiguring skin disease. In either case, she wound up alone in the forestmeditating and, one day, either heard the call of the spirit world in the oceanor—according to another version—felt so miserable that she threw herself intothe ocean to end it all. In any event, she was embraced by the spirit world thatexists under the seas and became its queen.The second phase of the story concerns a prince, Senapati, who is meditatingalone on the beach, trying to find his path, the destiny chosen for him as theleader of a new kingdom. His meditation is so strong that the oceans begin tochurn and Nyai Lara Kidul rises from the sea to discover the source of theagitation. To make a long story considerably shorter, the Queen brings theprince to her underwater kingdom, where they make love for a period of threedays. The Queen tells the prince that he will become the ruler of a greatkingdom and that she will guarantee the continued well-being of that kingdom ifevery ruler in the future will marry her and continue the tradition begun withhim. Senapati goes on to found the Mataram dynasty in the late 16th century CE.Ever since then, succeeding rulers have sought the advice of the Queen throughmeditation in caves near the beach at Parangtritis, where it is believedSenapati first encountered the Queen. They also perform various rituals intendedto placate or invoke her. What is inescapable is the fact that, even in thepresent day, the Sultan of Yogyakarta and the Sunan of Surakarta are expected tocohabit with this strange spirit ritually, thus keeping alive a tradition thathas been unbroken for more than 400 years. In fact, in recent years, theserulers have affirmed that they have encountered Nyai Lara Kidul on more than oneoccasion.THE SERPENT QUEENVarious scholars have suggested that Nyai Lara Kidul may represent an ancientIndonesian serpent goddess, a nagini. In Java, snakes are symbols of fertility,as they are frequently encountered in rice fields. This association with snakesand rice gives rise to a host of concepts linking them to the rice goddess, DewiSri (the Javanese equivalent of the Indian Sri Dewi), and from there to variousmother goddesses and goddesses of fertility. The link between an ocean spiritand a snake may seem tenuous at first, but in this case there is an associationon the basis of Nyai Lara Kidul's skin disease. Some have suggested that itresembled the scales of a serpent; others say that the fact that the Queenappears young, whole, and beautiful during the waxing moon and old, ugly, anddeformed during the waning moon is a reference to the snake shedding its skin.That there may have been a snake cult in Java before the advent of Indianreligions is postulated as a near certainty, but there is virtually noinformation about it in documentary sources. However, it is known that thesecults did exist throughout Southeast Asia and that, in some countries, theritual marriage of a king to a serpent was commonplace. It is far too early tosuggest that these ancient “weddings” may have provided a template for theconcept of a serpent goddess at the base of the spine—the coiled serpentKundalini—who rises along the body to mate with a god in the cranial vault, butthe parallels are arresting, since the metaphor seems consistent. The serpentresides in the watery “Underworld”—i.e., the place where the fluids, semen andmenstrual blood, urine and feces are stored—and must leave the Underworld inorder to mate with the male divinity at the upper regions of the body. If weview the churning of the ocean as a metaphor for sexual arousal, then even themeditation of Senapati that causes the Southern Ocean, the home of Nyai LaraKidul, to foam is consistent with this idea, and moreover consistent with theIndian tradition of the Churning of the Milk Ocean that gave us amrita. Further,during that episode, the goddess Lakshmi was produced from the churning ocean.Lakshmi—as a young, beautiful goddess of good fortune, fertility, and materialwealth—is the consort of Vishnu. She appears in the Ramayana as Sita, the wifeof Rama. Usually, she is also depicted either holding a lotus, or seated orstanding on a lotus. She is the daughter of the king of the Milk Ocean, and thushas further associations with Nyai Lara Kidul. Lakshmi is believed to representthe power of Kundalini, as she emerged from the Milk Ocean due to the churningproduced by the great Serpent King; when she appeared, she was holding alotus.3The lotus is a symbol of the chakras in the human body that are opened bythe rise of the serpent goddess Kundalini; it is also, in a sense, a symbol ofthe entire process, as its roots are in the mud and its flower high above thewaters.It may be that the Sudamala story that we outlined in the chapter on Candi Sukuhis also relevant here, for in that tale we have the beautiful Uma transformedinto the ugly Durga, only to be redeemed and become the beautiful wife of Shivaonce again. This certainly parallels the tales told of Nyai Lara Kidul, whoseappearance changes with the phases of the moon; in fact, Durga lives in acemetery surrounded by evil spirits, and Nyai Lara Kidul lives in an underworldpalace where she is the queen of demons.Thus, there are many coincidences between the story of the Churning of the MilkOcean and that of Nyai Lara Kidul herself. How much of the Javanese legend wasdirectly influenced by the Indian epics and how much is indigenous to Java isdifficult to tell. Yet, this fairy-tale-like story of a goddess living under thesea and a human king living on the land, and their annual tryst guaranteeing theprosperity of the kingdom, survives to this day as the aition for a series ofofficial state rituals.The first of these, the Labuhan, is performed annually on the birthday or theanniversary of the coronation of the Sultan of Yogyakarta. The term labuhancomes from the Javanese word labuh, which means “to throw.” This is a ceremonyin which offerings to the Queen are literally thrown into the sea. The offeringsmust be of a certain type, and very carefully prepared. They include garments ofcertain colors and designs, cloth, perfume, lotions, incense, and even currency.Also included are the hair and nail clippings of the sultan, provided in specialwooden boxes.This last seems to be a kind of reverse spell (at least, the way it isunderstood in the West). As is known through popular literature going backcenturies, “witches” cast spells using the hair and nail clippings of theirintended victims. They are the link necessary in order for the spell to work.Today, we know that some of these bodily elements may contain an individual'sDNA and thus do contain the identity of the person intended. In the case of theLabuhan offerings to Nyai Lara Kidul, the sultan provides his own clippings tothe Queen, thus sealing their relationship on an esoteric plane.The Labuhan offerings are cast into the sea, brought into the waves by aprocession of courtiers after the recitation of the appropriate mantras. After awhile, the offerings are washed back ashore because of the strong current comingin from the Indian Ocean, particularly in the area of Parangtritis, where many aswimmer has simply disappeared into the waves. The attendees of the ceremonythen take what they can, believing these offerings to have been blessed by theQueen of the Southern Ocean.The Labuhan ceremony is colorful and not a little strange. It takes place moreor less simultaneously with two other rituals, one at Mount Merapi (the volcano)and the other on Mount Lawu (the location of Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh). Theofferings there are roughly the same, but made to different spiritual forces.Merapi is the northern part of the north-south axis that runs through thepalace— the Kraton—of Yogyakarta and to the sea at Parangtritis. The Kraton isthe axis mundi, the center of the world, but the spirits in the north and thesouth must be propitiated as well. Thus, another ritual similar to the Labuhantakes place at Merapi, fixing the axis and ordering the world.The ritual at Mount Lawu takes place because the present sultan of Yogyakarta isa direct descendant of the last king of the Majapahit empire, Brawijaya V. (Wesaw the statues of his assistants at Candi Ceto.) Therefore, the ritual ofordering the spatial axis of the Kraton must also include a ritual acknowledgingthe spiritual and genetic bloodline of the sultans (one may say, the timeline ortemporal axis). Once again, the offerings are similar: clothing, incense, etc.The most astonishing ritual of all, however, is the ceremony that takes place inYogyakarta (less frequently) and in Surakarta (more frequently), when the sultanhas what can only be called a tryst or sexual liaison with the same Queen of theSouthern Ocean. This ceremony indicates that the sultan has a “wife” who is aspirit; in fact, the queen of spirits in the Underworld. The fact that, atvarious times, both the Sultan of Yogyakarta and the Sunan of Surakarta haveadmitted actually seeing the Queen or being in some way aware of her presencemeans that this spiritual entity is taken very seriously and the ritualconsummation equally seriously. Both leaders are also, of course, Muslim.Therefore, they have been married in some manner to this spirit, otherwise asexual relationship would be haram—forbidden.This is not as unusual as it may seem at first. Before we go into a detaileddescription of this ritual, however, a look at how this meme has been observedsince time immemorial will help us put this practice into context.SEX IS NOT A METAPHOROne of the earliest written records we have of a sacred marriage is that of theAkitu festival of ancient Mesopotamia (probably dating from the Old Sumerianperiod, or circa 3000 BCE–2340 BCE).4 This was the New Year's festival—a time tocelebrate fertility and wealth. In the various city-states of what we know asSumer, these festivals were accompanied by ritual intercourse between the kingand a goddess, often the goddess who descended to the Underworld: Inanna.There is a great deal of controversy over this topic. Scholars are divided as towhen the practice known as “sacred marriage” originated, and where. Even themeaning of the ritual has been open to some debate. While it is generallyaccepted to be a fertility rite, some aspects of it remain mysterious andundefined. There are astronomical features that are little understood, as wellas questions about precisely whom the king is supposed to represent. Is the kinghimself a god, at least for the purposes of the ritual? Or does he represent ahuman being (and thus representative of the populace) in intercourse with adivine being? In other words, does the king represent heaven in this ritual, orearth? It seems to depend, at least in part, upon the nature of the goddessbeing invoked. No matter what, it is certain that the ritual is intended toguarantee fertility and protection for the kingdom and, in that sense, itspurpose is identical to the Javanese version.Why would this be so? Why would practices in countries as remote from each otheras Sumer and Java, and in times as distant as the second millennium BCE and thefirst millennium CE, have such common—yet very specific—elements?The first common element is the idea that the goddess represents the Underworld.This is a trope we find in agricultural societies in which the fertility of theearth is a major concern. The goddess represents either the earth or the cropsthe earth produces, and thus has associations with the power residing under thesurface of the earth. The powers that are believed to reside below the earth areknown as chthonic and, in Java, the chthonic deities include most famously andimportantly Nyai Lara Kidul.5 While she resides below the seas—which is also achthonic metaphor—she is represented by a snake or serpent and takes on theserpent's coloration and appearance. Serpents are considered chthonic by theirvery nature, of course.Inanna—the Goddess of Love, the planet Venus, and fertility—is chthonic in thesense that she descended to the Underworld through an elaborate ritual thatinvolved seven stages or stations, and then returned to the earth, only to betold that she must spend eternity in the Underworld if she cannot find someoneto take her place. She offers her husband, the wild shepherd god Dumuzi, as herstand-in.Dumuzi has some personal characteristics in common with Shiva. He lives in thewild, meditates constantly, and has a somewhat erratic relationship with hiswife, Inanna. He is an untamed figure, while Inanna is the picture of grace andsophistication (and lust).In the praise poem known as Shulgi × (a text dating from around 2050 BCE), KingCulgi (Shulgi) approaches the chamber of Inanna, who greets him with thesewords:When I have bathed for the king, for the lord, when I have bathed for theshepherd Dumuzid, when I have adorned my flanks (?) with ointment (?), when Ihave anointed my mouth with balsamic oil, when I have painted my eyes with kohl,when he has ... my hips with his fair hands, when the lord who lies down besideholy Inana, the shepherd Dumuzid, has ... on his lap, when he has relaxed (?)... in my pure (?) arms, when he has intercourse (?) with me ... like choicebeer, when he ruffles my pubic hair for me, when he plays with the hair of myhead, when he lays his hands on my holy genitals, when he lies down in the ...of my sweet womb ... when he treats me tenderly on the bed, then I will tootreat my lord tenderly.I will decree a good fate for him! I will treat Culgi, the good shepherd,tenderly! I will decree a good fate for him! I will treat him tenderly in his...! I will decree the shepherdship of all the lands as his destiny!6Thus we have all of the basic elements of the Javanese rite reflected in this4000-yearold Sumerian practice. A king owes his power, authority, and fate to agoddess who lives at least half of the year in the Underworld. Further, the kingis identified with Dumuzi—the husband of Inanna and a Shiva figure in his ownright—making the love match represent a divine marriage taking place in theheavens. The Sumerian (and, later, Babylonian) king must re-enact this ritualonce a year to ensure the success of his administration.I should note that there is no pretence of a metaphorical interpretation ofthese events. Inanna, in the poem, speaks clearly and passionately about sexualintercourse. She refers to her genitals, her pubic hair, her self-adornment, andexplicitly to intercourse. Like the core texts of Tantric initiation, thisritual obviously is not meant to be understood symbolically, but actually. Theonly symbolic elements are the ones we expect from Tantra—that the participantsin the ritual identify themselves and their partners with gods. To assumeotherwise—that is, to put forward the idea that these rituals and sentimentswere not meant to be taken literally, but were intended as poetic languagereferring to other-worldly matters for which sexuality is only a metaphor—is toremain ignorant of the real intentions (and the real functions) of this ritualcomplex.It is entirely possible that the same mistake has been made with reference tothe Biblical Song of Solomon, which has many elements in common with thisliterature. I submit that, in these and other similar rites and texts, sex isnot a metaphor. Sex is the process, and the sexual act is necessary for there-enactment of the process. It's not the language that is metaphorical, but, ina way, the act itself. The language is literal—participation in the ritual aswritten is necessary if one is to understand the process of which sex is themethod.Other examples from the ancient Near East are numerous and what details areavailable are suggestive. For instance, a cuneiform tablet regarding the city ofIsin from between 1974 and 1954 BCE gives information about the New Yearfestival:... the king ritually slept with a priestess of Inanna, performing, what hasbeen termed, the Sacred Marriage Rite. This ritual was based upon the originalmotif of the god Dumuzi marrying Inanna, their union ensuring a year of plenty.7In this case, the information is explicit: a sexual act took place with apriestess of Inanna, the king representing Dumuzi. The reason is the same:ensuring fertility.Another, first-millennium BCE text has even more detail. In this case, a specialchapel for the New Year has been established next to a graveyard. When the kingapproaches the chapel, a voice summons him from within and he enters. There is agreat slaughter of sheep, chanting, the burning of incense, and finally thesacred marriage rite. In this instance, the king waits outside the bridalchamber—the chapel constructed for this purpose, which is also referred to asthe “perfumed hideaway.” There is singing from the graveyard as the king and thegoddess await the right moment. The implication is that the ceremony is takingplace at night. Finally, the king turns to the goddess and invites her into thebridal chamber, saying: “My beloved, enter the door into our house. With mymouth, consort of our lord, let me kiss thee.” We are then told that the goddessis laid upon an embroidered bedspread.8Here we have the modification of the bridal chamber being erected next to agraveyard. The king retires into the chamber with the “goddess”—presumably apriestess, but this is not specified. When he emerges, he comes with blessingsand promises. The goddess in this case is identified as Nana (a shortened formof Inanna and not to be confused with the God of the Moon, Nanna).In a Sumerian incantation from the Ur III period (the second millennium BCE), wesee that the sacred marriage and the consecration of water were inextricablylinked:As heaven became king, earth became queen,Erra became king, Mami became queen,then Enki, the king of the Abzuin order that heaven should purify the holy water,created the virgin water, the holy water ...9Erra was a war-like king of the heavens; Mami was a creation goddess who formedhuman beings out of blood and clay. Enki was the god of magic who dwelled in theAbzu, a watery abyss. The word abzu was used to refer to vessels of water thatwere kept in Babylonian temples for purification and initiation. Thus, therelationship between magic, water, creation, and the hieros gamos is once againreinforced by this ancient incantation. A note to the translation of this textstates:The assumption by Erra and Mami of the kingship of heaven and earth, which wasundoubtedly the mirror of the political kingship, must have reflected apolitical event. This kingship was also the pattern and the ideological reasonfor the sacred marriage.10As the eminent Sumeriologist Samuel Noah Kramer has pointed out, one of theroles of the king in the akitu ritual was to identify himself with the lineageof kings going back to the very origins of the kingdom. As the husband ofInanna, he was reiterating the role that they both played in the very beginningof the first Sumerian kingdom, when it was believed that Dumuzi was its humanking and Inanna its tutelary goddess.11 This again parallels neatly the Javaneseritual, for the sultan who marries Nyai Lara Kidul is a descendant of theoriginal monarch of the Mataram II dynasty, and this sacred marriage solidifiesthat ancient relationship.The first month of the year was known in the Old Babylonian period (2000–1600BCE) and perhaps earlier as “the throne of the sanctuary.”12 This was also atime when food was distributed to temple personnel, at least at Nippur andprobably at other cities as well. The association with the New Year, an abundantharvest, and the sacred marriage ceremony is clear. (The title of the month as“the throne of the sanctuary” also raises important questions about how thesacred precincts of a temple were understood in Sumer and Babylon, and attendantimplications for the Temple in Jerusalem, a point to which we will returnshortly.)With these examples as a guide, let us now look at the sacred marriage of thepresent-day sultans of Java with the Serpent Queen.THE BEDHAYA SEMANG: THE SPIRIT DANCE OF YOGYAKARTAThe Sultan of Yogyakarta and the Suhunan of Surakarta both claim to be thehusbands of the divine consort, Nyai Lara Kidul. As such, both observe—to oneextent or another, and often depending on the personality of the rulerinvolved—the rituals necessary to placate this demanding spirit. The reason forthis is that both cities were part of the Mataram II Empire and, in the year1755, the kingdom was split into two courts as part of Dutch attempts to divideand conquer. Each court then developed its own traditions and rituals, althoughbased, of course, on those of the Mataram dynasty that they both represented.The literature on these rituals is not extensive in European languages, but theyhave been mentioned in articles or in passing references in books by suchexperts on Indonesian religion, culture, and anthropology as Robert Wessing, RoyJordaan, Niels Mulder, and others. In the Indonesian languages, of course, theliterature is much more comprehensive, albeit still rather confusing.The Sultan of Yogyakarta usually commands more attention from the government,because Yogyakarta famously and aggressively supported the independence movementagainst the Dutch, while the response of the administration in Surakarta wasrather tepid by comparison, the latter basically throwing their lot in with thecolonizers. Yogyakarta itself is a “special district” answerable only to thepresident of the republic for this reason. However, the sacred dance to invokeNyai Lara Kidul is often more intensively and regularly practiced in Surakarta(Solo). Even so, due to the fact that the special district of Yogyakartacommands a much larger stretch of shoreline than Solo, many Javanese believethat the relationship between the sultan and the “Mermaid Queen” is strongerthere.The main ritual in honor of the Queen is a dance called (in Yogyakarta) theBedhaya Semang, which translates roughly as “spirit dance.” This dance involvesnine human dancers and one spirit dancer, who is Nyai Lara Kidul herself.In Solo, this dance takes place at least once a year, on the anniversary of theSuhunan's consecration. In Yogyakarta, it had not been performed in decadesprior to a performance in October 2002 due, it is said, to the dangers inherentin its performance. A version of it—known as Bedhaya Harjunowijoyo—was performedfor the sultan on the occasion of his sixty-sixth birthday, on April 17, 2010 atthe Kraton.13 In both cases, the dance may be performed only in the Kraton andonly before a very select audience. In the old days, the dancers were all younggirls or women—usually unmarried and, in some cases, concubines of the ruler,although it is said this is not the case today.14 They are dressed as brides, animportant detail that emphasizes the sacred marriage aspect of the ritual.Today, in Solo, the dancers are princesses and other members of the suhunan'sroyal household, as long as they are able to perform the slow and intricatemovements required and to devote all the time and energy necessary to learningthe dance (which may be rehearsed only one day out of every thirty-five). Theymay not be menstruating during the dance. If a dancer is menstruating, she isreplaced in order to keep the total number of dancers at nine. The instructionsfor the correct performance of the dance are quite severe and the dancersresemble persons in a trance—which is sometimes the case. Before the 20thcentury (and perhaps for a few decades into it), when it was believed that NyaiLara Kidul had possessed one of these dancers, she was led to the chambers ofthe ruler after the dance for the requisite sexual intercourse. To deny theSpirit Queen this special attention was to invite disaster.The reason the author is devoting so much space to this dance is because thisarcane and complex ritual is still performed to this day, and for all the samereasons, by the court of the Suhunan of Solo. The creator of this dance—known inSolo as the Bedhaya Ketawang—is said to have been Senapati himself, who was afifth-generation descendant of King Brawijaya V (whom we last met meditating onMount Lawu and building Candi Ceto and Candi Sukuh). Indeed, not only thisdance, but also the gamelan music that is associated with Indonesia, is said tohave been his creation or the creation of his grandson, the famous Sultan Agung.The music of the gamelan is said to duplicate the sounds Senapati heard while inthe palace of Nyai Lara Kidul. If one accepts this, then listening to thegamelan becomes a rather other-worldly experience, for one can understand howthe strange timbre, scales, and gongs of the gamelan orchestra might duplicatesounds heard under the ocean. The dance itself is said to be one that Senapatilearned while with the Queen in her underwater palace, which may explain theexaggeratedly slow movements of the dancers—as if they were moving under water.Their delicate gestures and attitudes are known as halus or alus—a word that canmean “grace” or “refinement,” but also a term used to describe the elevatedstatus of court personnel, princes, and princesses, and elegance, manners, andetiquette in general.In order to practice the dance, rehearse the music, or even transcribe the notesof the music, offerings and sacrifices first must be made to the Spirit Queen.She will tolerate no mistakes, no sloppiness. The stress on the performers andmusicians is such that some have been known to faint, become ill, or even—in onecase—go mad.15 (It is claimed that this is one of the reasons why the Sultan ofYogyakarta has not authorized a Bedhaya Semang in quite some time, although theLabuhan ceremony described above is still observed regularly.) If the three-hourdance is performed correctly and without error, however, the Queen is said tobecome very happy and to bless the court with good fortune and security. This issomething that is taken very seriously indeed.In the old days, the sultan or prince was identified as a god in his relationswith the Spirit Queen, who was, and remains, a goddess. It was the sameShiva-Shakti relationship that we know very well from Indian religious traditionand especially from Tantra. Today however, this is not allowed because of themonotheistic framework of Islam. Instead, the rulers are identified as men offaith who submit to God, rather than as gods themselves. The Spirit Queen,however, remains a goddess, a consort, a shakti. She does not aspire to a higherspiritual state, as a human being does. She is, in a sense, imperfectible,whereas humans are—theoretically—perfectible. Nyai Lara Kidul may have beenhuman once, but now she is given over wholly to the realm of spirit. Regardlessof the theological distinctions, in practical terms the relationship between thesultan and the Spirit Queen is essential to the well-being of the region.There are rooms reserved at several hotels in the vicinity of the beach wherethe Labuhan ceremony takes place and where it is believed Senapati first met theQueen. These rooms are reserved for the goddess and have become places ofpilgrimage for Javanese, as well as minor tourist attractions in their ownright. The rooms are always decorated in green—Lara Kidul's favorite color—andprovided with flowers, incense, and, of course, basins of fresh water. Thesultans used these rooms to meet the Queen at various times, but it is not knownwhat transpires there between them.Nyai Lara Kidul does not restrict herself to these thoughtfully provided rooms,however. It is well-known that she would meet the Sultan of Yogyakarta in whatis known today as the Water Palace—more accurately, the Taman Sari, or “FlowerGarden”—that is believed to have a secret underground tunnel leading, not onlyto the Kraton, but also to the sea. It is believed that the Spirit Queen wouldtravel through the tunnel to meet with the sultan at the Water Palace for theirprivate trysts. In addition, members of the sultan's harem of concubines alsoused Taman Sari for recreation. There was a large swimming pool there, as wellas a bathing pool and numerous other smaller pools (hence the term Water Palace)and artificial islands. It was built by a an architect using European methodsand styles in the 17th century, and probably had a military purpose as well—thesultan and his family could escape the Kraton through a tunnel and wind up inthe more easily defended Taman Sari in case of an attack. Most of the complex isin ruin, and what used to be part of Taman Sari is now a village that surroundsthe site.Image [images/p258-001.jpg]ABOVE: An entranceway at Taman Sari, with a restored Kala head above it.BELOW: Another restored entrance showing the Kala in greater detail.Image [images/p258-002.jpg]Image [images/p259-001.jpg]One of the mysterious underground tunnels through which Nyai Lara Kidul herselfis said to walk.There are underground passages at the Water Palace.

The white building in the background is the eastern gate.At the bottom of page 261 is a photograph taken from within one of theventilation buildings. Again, the light fixture is new.And finally, at the top of this page, we see a view of some of the damage doneto the structure by a 19th-century earthquake. The entire complex was alsoheavily damaged when the British came through during an invasion of Yogyakartain 1812—the same year they were also invading the United States.One of the mysteries surrounding Taman Sari is the identity of the architect whodesigned it. Known as Demang Tegis or Demang Portegis, he is said to be thesurvivor of a shipwreck who turned up on the Parangtritis beach and walked intoYogyakarta like a ghost. He could not speak Javanese, and eventually revealedhimself to be Portuguese. Since he had knowledge of construction, he was put towork designing and building Taman Sari.16While this story has been the subject of much discussion and historical debate,what is relevant here is the belief that the man literally walked out of the seaonto a beach sacred to Nyai Lara Kidul, and became a servant of the sultan whohad just formed the Yogyakarta sultanate. Thus, as the Kraton itself was beingbuilt, this unknown Portuguese sailor who came from Lara Kidul's underwaterrealm was enlisted in the building of the complex where the sultan wouldmeditate and meet with the Spirit Queen (according to tradition). While the ideathat Taman Sari represents Portuguese (or any foreign) architectural influencehas been denied by scholars for decades, more recently the allegation hasundergone some revival at the hands of both Javanese and Portuguese authorities.IN MODERN TIMESWhile much of the above may seem like a fairy-tale or imaginative literature, itis worthwhile to point out to what degree of seriousness this relationshipbetween the sultan and the Spirit Queen is taken by present-day politicalrulers. The accounts are much more numerous than one may imagine, and involvevirtually every modern Indonesian president, from Sukarno on.Neils Mulder speaks of the intention of President Sukarno, the first leader ofIndonesia after independence, to annex Dutch New Guinea as part of Indonesia.Realizing that this would require a major military undertaking, he decided toenlist the aid of Nyai Lara Kidul and her spirit army. So he went to Yogyakartain an attempt to recruit her to the cause. According to Mulder:Through her help, he was successful. However, when Western New Guinea becamepart of the Indonesian territory, Sukarno failed to pay tribute to the Nyai and,therefore, the spirits that had been recruited to recover the new province couldnot find their way back to their aquatic origin. Roaming around in theYogyakarta area, they caused havoc to the rice harvest. Because of this, themayor of Yogyakarta ordered the performance of the powerful shadow play SemarBoyong on the mystically potent beach of Parangtritis.17The ploy worked, the crops recovered, and all was well with the world. It wasnot the first time a wayang (shadow play) would be used to correct a politicalsituation, nor would it be the last. As mentioned previously, the wayang kulitis not merely an entertainment; the puppet master, the dalang, is as much ashaman as a performer. Certain plays are selected to be performed according tothe needs of the community. Thus, the shadow play is as much ritual as it istheater—if, in fact, the two can be separated.In 1957, for example, a group of men from Yogyakarta decided to underwrite theperformances of all of the episodes of the Mahabharata as wayang. As theperformances proceeded—one every three weeks, in order—they eventually came tothe scene where Karno, one of the heroes, dies. On that same day, November 30,students attempted to assassinate Sukarno with grenades. What is so strikingabout this episode is that Sukarno was usually known by his nickname, Bung (or“Brother”) Karno.18 Thus, it is believed that the wayang is so powerful that itcalls into play sinister forces from the world of spirits that impinge on theworld of human beings, often with disastrous results. For that reason, selectionof the right play to perform at the right time is of utmost importance. In fact,the word dalang is often used pejoratively, to refer to someone who iscontrolling political events from behind the scenes. While the West uses theterm “puppet master” in precisely the same way, it does not carry with it thereligious and occult overtones that the word dalang does in Indonesia.In 1984, the previous sultan of Yogyakarta, Hamengku Buwono IX, granted anaudience with the journalist Paul Spencer Sochaczewski.19 During that interview,the sultan revealed an incident that took place at the Kraton during the time ofthe Dutch occupation. One evening, he and his companions heard the sound ofsoldiers moving about the palace, wearing armor and beating drums. There was noone in the Kraton but himself, his family, and his staff. Yet they all heard thesounds of an invisible spirit army, which they insist was that of Nyai LaraKidul.What makes this episode all the more poignant is that Yogyakarta, of course, wasthe center of resistance against the Dutch in Java. The sultan himself had beenVice President of Indonesia, under Suharto. We are discussing educated,powerful, political leaders with an ancient relationship to a serpent goddessand who, moreover, believe in that relationship and take it seriously.When the sultan died in 1989 and his son was crowned as successor, the fact thatthe new sultan's wife did not ride with him in the golden carriage during thetriumphal procession was a subject of much gossip. As later reported, the reasonwas simple: Nyai Lara Kidul had appeared and taken her place next to the sultan.The sultan's human wife graciously remained behind with her family and friendsto allow this supernatural wife the honor.20When we think of the hieros gamos, or sacred wedding, we usually place it in anancient context like that of Babylon or Sumer. We rarely understand this to betaking place today, and particularly not in what is usually called the largestMuslim country in the world. Yet, as we have seen, not only is this conceptalive and well, it is also largely unchanged from its ancient forms andfunctions. That the sacred marriage between the Sultan of Yogyakarta and theQueen of the Southern Ocean has been filtered through the Tantric framework ofShiva and Shakti is clear. The association of the Queen with magic, withfertility, and with the protection of the realm, combined with the human agencyof the sultan and his careful observation of the rituals ensuring his power andsovereignty—all meeting together in a spiritual wedding that, at least prior tothe 20th century if not later, included some form of sexual intercourse—meansthat the spiritual culture of Java reflects this worldview. A spiritualizedconcept of power including religion, magic, and sexuality is the core element ofthe Javanese political structure, as it is of Tantra. There is perhaps no otherplace on earth where this is understood as clearly as it is in Java, andpracticed as deliberately—not only by high-ranking politicos and palacecourtiers, but by the people themselves.2 “A bold suitor, the Red Lion/in a tepid bath wedded the Lily/both thentortured by an open flame/and forced to another Bridal Chamber.”3 Woodroffe, in commentary on his translation of verse 12 of theSat-Cakra-Nirupana, references Lakshmi as being identical with Kundalini and thereceptacle of the amrita (Sir John Woodroffe, [Arthur Avalon], The Serpent Power(New York: Dover Publications, 1919, 1974), pp. 351–353). Further, Kali, in histranslation and commentary of the Devimahatmya, alerts us to the fact thatLakshmi is identified with Sri (Shri)—the original Mother Goddess—in the Vedas.(Devadatta Kali, In Praise of the Goddess: the Devimahatmya and Its MeaningBerwick, ME: Nicolas-Hays, 2003, pp. 7, 88, where he cites the Srisukta as thefirst text to mention this identification.) Sri Devi, or Sri Dewi, is the DewiSri of Java, a rice goddess of fertility who is often identified with snakes, aswell as with Sita of the Ramayana. This myth is examined in detail in RobertWessing, “Sri and Sedana and Sita and Rama: Myths of Fertility and Generation,”Asian Folkore Studies, Volume 49, 1990: 235–257.4 The basis for this dating can be found in Samuel Noah Kramer, The SacredMarriage Rite: Aspects of Faith, Myth and Ritual in Ancient Sumer (Bloomington,IN: Indiana University Press, 1969).5 See Robert Wessing, “A Princess from Sunda: Some Aspects of Nyai Roro Kidul,”Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 56, 1997: 317–353. On page 321, he makes a casefor the chthonic nature of Nyai Lara Kidul (mentioned here as Nyai Roro Kidul).6 As translated in J. A. Black, G.

There are somany elements of this phenomenon that are purely Tantric that we are forced toaccept that some of the most esoteric aspects of what is popularly known as“left-hand-path” Tantra are virtually common knowledge among the population ofthis predominantly Muslim country—and not only in theory, but most certainly inpractice.Kemukus is located in the Sragen District of Java, not far from the Sultanate ofSolo and the temple complexes of Candi Sukuh and Candi Ceto. It is understood tobe the tomb of a Javanese saint, Prince Samudra, who died for love (see photoopposite). Unfortunately, this is not a Harlequin Romance sort of love story.The woman he loved was his own mother.There are several different versions of the story of Prince Samudra. Most arenot as shocking as the popular version that involves incest and palace intrigue.But all versions agree that Prince Samudra is a symbol of unconditional (andillicit) love.His tomb is at the top of the mountain— gunung—Kemukus. There is a steep stonestaircase leading up to the tomb itself from a main gate (which is typical ofmany Javanese shrines). Along the way, there are small houses and shops sellingbottles of water and local snacks. The small, concrete houses are used bycouples to consummate their relationship—that is, when they do not use the openareas around the tomb. They are also used by local prostitutes to service themen who arrive on certain days of the Javanese calendar to find a stranger forthe ritual, since there are usually many more men than women in attendance. Asmay be imagined, this has contributed to a kind of legalized prostitution atKemukus.Image [images/p267-001.jpg]The entrance to the shrine at Kemukus.SEX IN A CEMETERY... something beyond this seems to be involved in the use of corpses andcremation grounds, for it is often clear that people undertaking these ritualsare householders who have not renounced the world, are not engaged in asceticpractices, do not seem primarily concerned with affirming the underlyingdivinity of the forbidden or the polluted, and are not undergoing initiationinto a tantric cult. It is also clear that the desires that motivate this typeof spirituality are often worldly: power over one's enemies, kingly authority,eloquence in speech, and so on. ... Corpses and cremation grounds ... seem tofunction as objects and places of power by ... means of which or in whichextraordinary achievements may be accomplished.22The devotees at Kemukus begin arriving as the sun goes down. Certain days—theFriday Pon and to a lesser extent the Friday Kliwon—are considered mostauspicious for the performance of this ceremony These days are calculatedaccording to the Javanese calendar, which uses a five-day week.23 The ritualspecialists say that this ritual must be performed in seven consecutive monthsin order to be effective.Couples pair up in the foreground of the shrine, along the walkways. Or, in manycases, men select one of the prostitutes who ply their trade at the shrine. Thisis not to say that all or even most of the women at the shrine are prostitutes,however. Many women do come to Kemukus because they have business concerns orfamily issues and have been told that this system works. It is a Javanese formof the Catholic novena in many ways, if the novena included sex.The couples must then offer incense, flowers (and cash) to the juru kunci, the“key keeper” or guardian of the shrine. This is a Muslim man and, some claim, adukun, or shaman, who actually blesses the union of the couple. The couplecircumambulates the tomb of Prince Samudra and then retires to a privatelocation to consummate the union. This often occurs in the open air, outdoors inthe dark under the trees. In the last few years, however, rows of smallbuildings have been constructed to house the many couples who come to Kemukusseeking favors from the spirits.On the author's visit to Kemukus in 2008, accompanied by two colleagues from theuniversity, he witnessed several of these ceremonies. The concern of the womenwas that the men be circumcised—a necessary Islamic practice, but not one thatis normally found among Hindu men. Thus, it seems that this quintessentiallyTantric and Hindu ceremony has been Islamicized to an extent. The generalatmosphere is solemn, not what a Westerner might expect of a place wheretemporary sexual liaisons are sanctioned. It is the union that is blessed, andthe union has as its purpose the securing of a favorable outcome in the mundaneworld—an outcome guaranteed by spiritual forces. The sexual act is the secondpart of the ritual, the first being the blessing ceremony itself, which imposesupon the act the necessary seriousness and the invocation of the spirit ofPrince Samudra.This is not a concept unique to Java. As Sir John Woodroffe points out,concerning the iconic Tantric ritual of the pancatattva:As I have said, the ordinary rule is that the wife or Ādyā Śakti should beco-performer (Sahadharminī;) in the rite. An exception, however, exists wherethe Sādhaka has no wife or she is incompetent (Anadhikārinī). There seems to bea notion that the Śāstra directs union with some other person than the Sādhaka'swife. This is not so. A direction to go after other women as such would becounsel to commit fornication or adultery. What the Śāstra says is—that if theSādhaka has no wife, or she is incompetent (Anadhikārinī), then only may theSādhaka take some other Śakti. Next, this is for the purpose of ritual worshiponly. Just as any extra-ritual drinking is sin, so also outside worship anyMaithuna, otherwise than with the wife, is sin.24Similarly, the partners in the Kemukus ritual must be blessed before they canproceed to the remainder of the rite. It is not necessary that the sexual act beperformed with a stranger, but this has become enshrined in the pilgrimage riteanyway. This fact has prompted Islamic purists to criticize the practice—as wellas the pilgrimage itself—but it persists in spite of this.25This may be because the fact of sex with a stranger seems to create a specifictype of tension necessary for the ritual to succeed. There is no emotional stakein the relationship, no “baggage” that one carries into the ceremony that comesfrom a shared history with an individual partner. There is, in short, nothing todeflect attention away from the ritual itself. Both parties are there,ostensibly, for the same purpose—to get the attention of the spirit and toobtain favor. In the case of the prostitute, of course, the goal is different.She is there to facilitate the operation, but does not necessarily share in thedesired outcome (improved health, success in business, etc). In this, however,she is not so different from the traditional female participants in some Tantriccircles, who were chosen because of their low caste or outcast status. She isthere as an object, to be true, but as an object of veneration. She representsShakti, the female energy of the universe, just as the male represents Shiva.Quite simply, the fact that she is not her partner's wife may be a source of thepower she brings to the ritual.The need for what would ordinarily be called an “illicit” sexual relationshiphas a long pedigree in Tantra, a discipline that requires the breaking of aseries of tabus. That is one reason why the story of Prince Samudra is socompelling. According to the version understood by the pilgrims, Samudra wasinvolved in a carnal relationship with his own mother; in another version of thestory, he stole one of his father's concubines. The Oedipal implications in bothscenarios are clear; yet, the emphasis in the stories is on love, no matter whatthe cost, no matter how disapproving society may be.26 People go to Kemukusprepared to “love” a total stranger—to worship the idea of love itself asseparate from any identification of the actual sexual partner and to attainunion with a source of power (Shiva or Shakti) both within and beyondthemselves. While the Tantric texts can help illuminate what takes place atKemukus—and at a few other, similar sites in Java—the rituals of Kemukus canactually help us to understand Tantra better.The name of Prince Samudra is, itself, suggestive. The Churning of the MilkOcean, by which means amrita was created, is called in Sanskrit Samudra Manthan,which resonates with the name of the ill-fated Prince of Mount Kemukus. The wordsamudra can mean any body of water, but in this context, the temptation to linkthe Tantric rituals of Kemukus with the attainment of amrita is very strong,especially when we realize that temples in the same vicinity—Candi Sukuh andCandi Ceto—are also monuments to amrita.There is prostitution in Java, of course. While many foreigners may not be awareof it in the smaller cities, it is certainly apparent in Jakarta. Local men,however, know how and where to procure prostitutes in the other cities andtowns. There is no particular need to go to Kemukus for sex. The difference isthat Kemukus is government-sanctioned: it is a religious site where a religiousritual is performed that happens to include sex. Indonesian sensitivity to localspiritual customs is an important hallmark of that society, and has contributedto the reputation of Indonesia as a democracy and a moderate Islamic country—onethat understands and accepts the importance of adat, or local customs.Also, Kemukus is not that easy to reach. It requires something of a pilgrimageand, in many cases, devotees treat it in exactly that way, choosing a morearduous approach across a nearby lake rather than simply driving up the mountainin a four-wheel drive. Anyone going to Kemukus has an agenda in mind that is notnecessarily purely sexual. Yet, the allure of anonymous sex in a traditionalreligious setting, protected by the government and thus not subject to civil orcriminal or religious penalties, may be part of the attraction, althoughcertainly not the main attraction. People come to Kemukus with real problemsthey need to solve, real pain they wish to heal. They resort to this practicebecause of the consensus view that it works. It is a mundane application of aspiritual practice—the use of a deeply esoteric mechanism to achieve worldlygain. In this sense, it falls within the realm of magic rather than mysticism.THE ANONYMITY OF BODIESOne point that may be important to this discussion is the fact that the corpsesencountered either in the cremation or charnel grounds, or in the relativelymore pristine Javanese cemetery, are those of strangers to the Tantrikas. Therites that are carried out in sometimes hideous circumstances—sitting atopcorpses, kindling a sacrificial fire (a homa) in the corpse's mouth, havingsexual intercourse next to, or on top of, a corpse—are all performed inproximity to the dead bodies of unknown persons. The intention is to sacralizedeath, to elevate the corpse to the status of a symbol of all bodies, allcorpses, all death. But that is the “enlightened” view. In actuality, peoplewith the best of spiritual intentions must confront the gruesome quality of adecaying body while in a psychologically vulnerable state. All the meditation,self-deprivation, fasting, and chanting does not prepare them for the actualconfrontation. Add to this a requirement to perform sexually, and we may beforgiven if the impression we receive is that of a peculiar kind oftraining—perhaps that of a serial killer or other psycho-sexual monster.The corpse is a stranger to the Tantrika, just as the victim is a stranger tothe serial killer or lust murderer. They are both “stand-ins” for somethingdeeper. In the case of the male serial killer of female victims, the victim is astand-in for the mother, or a woman who has abused or betrayed the killer, orfor womankind in general. To the Tantrika, the corpse is a stand-in for Deathitself, but in a grander, more macrocosmic manifestation. The corpse is astand-in for the Tantrika, as well, for the Tantrika will one day become reducedto that very state, to the charnel ground or the cemetery. It represents thestage in alchemy of the putrefaction of the body, a necessary preliminary toobtaining the Philosopher's Stone. It is also part of the initiation of Siberianshamans, who must experience death and dismemberment and even disembowelingbefore they can reach spiritual attainments.What if the corpse in the charnel ground, however, were that of a loved one? Orof someone known to the Tantrika in some other context? Theassociations—psychological, emotional, perhaps even sexual—would provide avirtually insurmountable obstacle. The concept of death would be more real, morepoignant—–and would, in this case, threaten to derail the entire ritual bymaking it an act of pure necromancy. The vivid memories of the life of the bodywould be recalled in the midst of this intense and extremely focused ritual, andthe fundamental purpose of the rite would be forgotten. It is impossible tothink of death in the abstract with a corpse in front of you—especially when itis the corpse of someone you know.The necessary anonymity of the dead body is thus a key for understanding thenecessary anonymity of the living body—either the sexual partner of a Tantrikain a rite of pure Tantra, or the “tantroid” rite that is performed at GunungKemukus. It is the abstract concept of shakti, of psycho-sexual power if youwill, that is the focus of the ritual and not the desire someone has for a lovedone. As death is rendered symbolic and abstract, even with the corpse presentbefore the Tantrika, so is love rendered equally abstract, equally symbolic,even as the body of the partner is joined in sexual embrace.There is a strong tradition in Indian religion—including most especially Tantricforms—of meditation in cemeteries or charnel grounds. The reality can be muchmore hideous than this simple description seems to convey. In India (as well asin Tibet and Nepal), bodies are either cremated or, in some cases, left in theopen air to decay gradually and become the food of carrion birds, jackals, andother predators. This is sometimes referred to in the West as “sky burial.” Thatmeans that the rituals that are said to take place in “cemeteries” actually takeplace in some of the most frightening and disturbing places on earth—placeslittered with decaying bodies and whitened bones, with the eerie sounds ofanimals and birds feasting on the remains. It is a nightmarish tableau, withsimilarities to the experiences in the forests and jungles of shamans, who mustundergo their own virtual dismemberment and destruction at the mercy of wildanimals, demons, and nature. The Western concept of cemeteries does not do thisscenario justice.In the West, a dead body is handled in a discreet and nearly invisible fashion.From the hospital or morgue to the funeral home to the cemetery or crematorium,the body is handled by professionals. It is usually embalmed (unless there is areligious objection) and put in a box, fully dressed, where it may be viewed ina decorous public area like a church or funeral home, and then brought to acemetery and buried (or cremated from the coffin itself ). The point is thatWesterners are “protected” from the gruesome facts of death. What is left isgrief over the loss of a loved one, but the terror of the charnel ground—theblunt fact of the horrorshow image of the decaying body left out in the elementsto be devoured by birds and beasts—does not obtain.The grounds at Kemukus do not in any way resemble the Indian version, of course.Prince Samudra is said to have converted to Islam, and Islamic burial customs donot include “sky burial.” But the idea of sex with a stranger at a tomb is asclose to the Tantric ideal as one is likely to get in Java, or anywhere elseoutside the Indian sub-continent.While reports of Tantric circles meeting in charnel grounds in India andperforming intricate sexual rituals there are commonplace in the literature, werarely come across an analysis of what the psychological or psycho-spiritualeffects of this particular aspect of Tantric ritual may be. Imagine, for amoment, the sights, smells, and sounds of a place reserved for the open-airdisposal of corpses. Imagine that place at night, in the company of Tantricpractitioners, after an appropriate fast and many hours of chanting mantras. Theritual of the five elements takes place; alcohol and perhaps a hallucinogenicdrug are consumed.27 Then the sexual aspect of the ritual—the fifthelement—begins. What is the impact of this on human consciousness—which is,after all, the ground of spiritual experience?One might say that to have sex—to commit an act of creation—in a place of deathis to collapse time.The goddess of the graveyard is Kali, the Black Goddess who appears to theuninitiated as a hideous being with a necklace of skulls and a skull cup(kapala) filled with blood. She has a long, lolling red tongue and is oftendepicted dancing on the inert body of Shiva. Entire volumes have been writtenabout this goddess and her importance to Indian religion generally, includingthe fact that blood sacrifice is still an essential element of her worship inmany regions. Her name is the feminine form of the Sanskrit root kala, whichmeans “black,” but also “time.” We have come across this term before inconnection with the sixteen vaginal secretions known as kalas that refer to thedivisions of the lunar month as well. Thus, the relevance of Kali to Tantricesoteric philosophy consists of these ideas of time, death, and the feminine, inaddition to traditional Tantric concepts of fertility for those Tantrikas whoview Kali as the Mahadevi, or Great Goddess.In Java, however, one is hard-pressed to find any evidence of a Kali cult at thevarious temples we have been investigating. The feminine is usually representedby Uma, Parvati, Sita, or the more fearsome Durga who, in some Tantrictraditions, is a manifestation of Kali and is also often worshipped incemeteries or in other desolate places. Durga worship was certainly known inJava, particularly in the 10th to the 13th centuries.28 Statues of Durga havebeen found at various sites, some of them royal temple complexes where it isbelieved the kings of Java invoked Durga to protect their kingdoms from enemies.These statues are virtually identical in many respects to those of Kali.Both Durga and Kali are considered feminine aspects of Shiva, representing hisless pacific attributes of anger and fierceness, respectively. (Parvati and Umarepresent Shiva's calmness.) It is important to remember, however, that each ofthese feminine aspects of Shiva represent Shakti, or the spiritual power ofShiva. In this instance, then, we may say that Durga is the shakti, or power, ofShiva, just as the other goddesses are. Although Durga has a differentpersonality from that of Uma or Parvati, she is nonetheless also a manifestationof Shiva's power. Calmness, anger, and fierceness become normal, acceptable,even expected attributes of divinity, and the goddesses become carriers of theseforces. Indeed, Durga is often pictured astride a lion, thereby evokingsimilarities with the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet (and by extension, with thefamiliar tarot trump, Strength). To make matters more interesting, both Sekhmetand Durga are considered responsible for epidemics. Yet, even though Sekhmet isconsidered the personification of anger and fierceness, she is also a benevolentgoddess under the right circumstances—yet another similarity she shares withDurga.The categorization of the feminine as the source of spiritual power was one ofthe supreme contributions of Tantra to Asian religion, for it elevated thestatus of women—every woman, of every caste—to equality with men. Femaledivinities enjoyed equality with male divinities—if not, at times, superiority.This happened in the cult of Shakti, which elevates the female above the maleand includes the worship of Durga. As we have seen, it is to Uma that we owe theactual Creation itself, otherwise Shiva would have been content to remain inmeditation for eternity. While it is beyond the scope of this work, it isinteresting to speculate on whether the elevation of women in Tantric theory andpraxis was one reason for the vehement opposition of the Brahmins to thisdiscipline, for it upset the social hierarchy and especially the caste system.That said, no temple to Durga has been discovered in Java so far, leading somescholars to believe that the predominant form of Tantra in Java was the worshipof Shiva rather than Shakti.29 Regardless, the graveyard is still an importantlocus for Javanese spirituality and specifically for those rituals associatedwith invoking spiritual assistance in worldly affairs. Durga, like Kali, isoften invoked in the graveyard setting, especially when asking for magicalassistance in some mundane goal. Further, while no temples specificallydedicated to Durga have been found in Java, statues of Durga in Shiva templesare nonetheless common there, so her worship was normative.To have sex in a graveyard setting, however, is to take the concept of a magicalspell for power a step further. It is an invocation of the feminine power, ofShakti, in the last place one would expect it. If the core of feminine power isfertility, conception, and birth, then a cemetery would seem to be aninappropriate place to worship a goddess, or the power of a goddess. Theconnection can be found in the iconic image of Kali dancing on the corpse ofShiva.To Tantrikas, this is a profound revelation of the identity of Shakti. Itinstructs that the human body is no more than a lump of flesh without thequickening power of the feminine. It is the energy expended in the act ofintercourse that is preserved in the human being that results from it. For amale, the energy is dissipated immediately after orgasm; for the female, theenergy is preserved in the process of conception and gestation. The male isspent, even falls asleep; the female begins the nine months of alchemicaltransformation. We may see an analogue to this in the concept of Kundalini, theSerpent Goddess said to reside at the base of the spine. She represents Shakti,and must rise through the chakras of the human body to mate with Shiva, whowaits for her, inert, at the highest chakra. All the energy, therefore, isfeminine. It is the goddess who must seek out the god, as Uma sought Shiva.Further, to have sex in a charnel ground drives home an important point thatlanguage itself is inadequate to convey. To achieve orgasm in front of acorpse—to create this terrible contradiction—is to experience divine power in away that is inexpressible in words. The initiate, who has been prepared byintensive periods of meditation and fasting, breaks the five tabus of thepancatattva, one by one, until finally the partner is embraced and the sexualact, the maithuna, begins. Seeing the end result of conception before you as youlabor to conceive raises basic, primal —yet wordless—questions. It puts into akind of relief the emotional baggage many have acquired in relation to sexualityand neutralizes these “hang-ups” by changing the context in so dramatic andextreme a fashion. While there are no corpses lying on the ground in Kemukus, itis still a tomb and a place of death. Associating the sex act with PrinceSamudra's incest removes the practitioner from the social and religious framesin which sexuality is normally contained, while at the same time providinganother, equally acceptable albeit very different, context. It is a ritual thatprovokes, even demands, transcendence. It is an act oddly imbued withimplications of compassion, of clarity and revelation.It is also an act of defiance.In the West, the nexus of sex and death has taken on hues of rebellion. Thefamous Black Mass has similarities to Tantric rites. Like the pancatattva, italso breaks social and religious tabus in an atmosphere of illicit ritual andsexuality, but it is strangely devoid of any redeeming spiritual dimensions. TheBlack Mass is almost completely political, designed to repudiate the Church'sdogma and organization and to “liberate” its participants from the psychologicalhold of the Church. There is no pretense of attaining higher spiritual statesthrough the practice of the Black Mass; the very practice itself implies thatsuch higher states are a fiction, since by performing the Black Mass one riskseternal damnation in the eyes of the Church. However, according to some sources,the Mass can be used to obtain worldly benefits if it is used as a means toworship the Church's main opponent, Satan. In this way, the more mundane goalsof both Tantra and the Black Mass find common ground.This is not to say that Tantra was not political, or did not have politicalovertones. Secret meetings of groups consisting of mixed castes and gendersoccurring in graveyards at night were de facto political. They constituted achallenge to acceptable religious and social behavior and may even have arisenas a response to this behavior. Yet, the main purpose—the organizing principlebehind these occult Tantric groups—is not understood as political, but rather asspiritual in nature. The difficulty lies in separating the spiritual from thepolitical in any situation where there are groups of individuals meeting insecret for ideological reasons (as opposed to purely criminal conspiracies). Asit says in 1 Samuel, 15:23: “Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.”The similarities between Tantra and Western occultism do not end there, however.One can easily interpret the grimoires of the medieval European magicians andsorcerers as Tantras. Books in which the use of occult diagrams, words of power,and ritual gestures—what in Tantra are called yantra, mantra, and mudra,respectively—are recommended for the acquisition of temporal power, and theacquisition of power outside normal channels of endeavor at that, are always athreat to social institutions. According to these sorcerer's workbooks, ideallocations for the summoning of spiritual forces are remote and desolate places,including mountains, caves, forests, and deserted buildings. Thus, the samesites that could be used for conspiratorial purposes are also recommended forritual contact with spiritual power.30For necromancy in particular, of course, a cemetery is the ideal site.So we may pose the question: Is the ritual undertaken at the tomb of PrinceSamudra in Kemukus, and at other shrines throughout Java, a form of necromancy,of communication with the dead?TANTRIC NECROMANCYThere is considerable evidence that Tantrikas performed rituals that would beconsidered necromantic by Westerners. One of the most famous of these is thereanimation of a corpse.One of the texts giving instructions for this procedure is called theUddisa-tantra, but the idea that a dead body can be reanimated is known toIndian literature just as it is in the West.31 A more important function ofcemetery magic, however, is the acquisition of siddhas, occult powers, throughthe agency of the spiritual forces that inhabit the charnel grounds.The cemetery or charnel ground is a liminal site, a borderland between two formsof existence.32 The living go there to leave the dead; the dead pass through toanother form of existence, eventually even another life in this world (accordingto Indian beliefs concerning reincarnation and the afterlife). Thus, one canlook at the cemetery as a place where the normally impermeable border betweenlife and death is a bit more transparent, a bit more fragile. Charnel groundsare believed to be filled with strange creatures, ghosts and vampires, demons,and otherworldly forms of life that can be contacted by Tantrikas for purposesmundane as well as lofty. Rituals are performed before decaying or burnedcorpses or, at times, on top of them. There are even rites in which a sacredritual fire is lighted in the very mouth of a dead body.In Java, cemeteries are considered to be full of shakti that is derived from theancestors who are either buried there or who are deemed to be in some sort ofsacred relationship with that particular spot. People who died violentdeaths—either in that spot or buried in that spot—are good sources of this typeof shakti. Their spirits are called siluman, and are invoked by those lookingfor wealth who offer sacrifices to them for that purpose.33 This is in line withTantric thinking on the subject, which values the skulls of people who have diedviolently for use as sacrificial vessels (kapala). Skulls of criminals and theinsane are valued for this purpose as well.In addition, it is not uncommon to hear of those who marry the ghosts andspirits that frequent these cemeteries, including a snake spirit called an iprithat takes the form of a beautiful woman. The ipri arrives at midnight and hasintercourse with her “husband,” then leaves him money. The marriage is usuallyarranged by a shaman local to the haunted site; he may even be the caretaker ofthe cemetery, the juru kunci. This theme of marriage to a beautiful snake spirithas become enshrined in one of Java's most famous rituals, in which ideas ofpower, fertility, and transgression are interlaced. This is mentioned toemphasize the fact that the beliefs and practices we are discussing do notrepresent the actions of a marginal community in Java, but rather reflectgeneral attitudes that extend to the sultans themselves. We discussed thephenomenon of the Goddess of the Southern Sea, Nyai Lara Kidul, and her marriageto the sultans of Yogyakarta and Solo in the previous chapter. For now, it isenough to understand that these facets of the Javanese belief system may beremnants of Tantric rituals that were introduced to the island from India asearly as the sixth or seventh century CE.A serpent goddess is a familiar meme to those who study Kundalini yoga, in whichthe shakti of a human body—the Kundalini—is represented as a snake goddesscoiled at the base of the spine. The goal of Kundalini yoga is to raise theserpent goddess up the chakras of the body to mate with Shiva, who rests at thelevel of the sixth chakra, analogous to the pineal gland in the brain, or whatsome devotees refer to as the “third eye.” Just as the snake goddesses arechthonic entities who dwell below the earth, so Kundalini is a snake goddess whodwells at the lowest extremity of the torso.34 Both are “married” in occultrites, resulting in the acquisition of siddhas—paranormal and other abilities.For Western readers, the image of the serpent goddess Kundalini rising up thespinal column calls to mind the familiar scene of the serpent in the Garden ofEden. The serpent's promise to Eve—“ye shall be as gods” (Genesis 3:5)—isreflected in the expectations of yogins who intend to attain enlightenmentthrough this practice. The same image is used frequently in Western alchemy, asa serpent crucified to a wooden cross, which symbol is usually understood asrepresenting fixed mercury (an iteration of the same concept in a seeminglydifferent context).As we saw in a previous chapter, the connection of the serpent with divineknowledge, even immortality, is an essential part of the Indian belief system.The churning of the cosmic ocean takes place with a serpent wrapped around MountSumeru, which results in the production of amrita, the elixir vitae. In Java,the serpent spirit (the siluman) gives wealth. In Kundalini yoga, the serpentspirit gives immortality (amrita). In this, the beliefs are virtually identicalto those of Western alchemy, which strives to produce both the elixir of lifeand the Philosopher's Stone—immortality and the transformation of base metalsinto gold.In both systems, it is necessary to proceed through the stage known to thealchemists as putrefactio: putrefaction, the decaying corpse. In Tantra, thisstage is embraced in actual practice through rituals in charnel grounds, butalso in the use of skeletal material for ritual objects. As mentioned above, oneof these is the kapala—a cup made from the skull of a person who died a violentdeath. The photo on page 280 shows an example of one of these that is in theauthor's possession.The interior is made of silver, and the rim is decorated with a series of silverskulls around the circumference of the skull. Liquids like blood, wine, milk,and other substances are poured into this vessel. Examples of the kapala arefound in many Tibetan tangkas, particularly those of wrathful deities like Kali,when it is usually depicted as full of human blood.The photo on page 281 shows the heavily carved crown of the skull, depicting agod and goddess in the embrace known as yab-yum. As can be seen, the deities aretrampling on two corpses. The god wears a tiger skin and a belt of skulls, andone of his arms is holding a trident—all of which indicates that the god inquestion is Shiva, in erotic embrace with his Shakti.That the skeletal material for these kapalas comes from unfortunate souls whodied violently or had horrific lives is born out by the memoire of acontemporary traveler in Northern India and Nepal, Andrea Loseries-Leick, whowrites:Image [images/p280-001.jpg]A kapala, a ritual cup made from the skull of a person who died a violent death.For certain Tantrik practices the use of particular skulls is indicated. Forinstance all offering rites (gser skyems) for female protectors such as PaldenLhamo (dPalldan Lha mo) and Ekajati should be performed with a skull of a25-year-old woman who has died during childbirth. In the Yamanataka-Tantra usedin the Drikung lineage a black skull (thod nag) as an offering vessel ismentioned, ideally derived from a promiscuous woman, as well as a skull of anincestuous person.35She also writes concerning an object known as the kangling, a trumpet made froma human thighbone, noting that “... a Kangling made of the left thighbone of asixteen-year-old Brahmin girl is valued highest.”36The photograph on page 282 shows a typical kangling. As can be seen, silver isused at both ends of the device, as in the kapala.Another instrument made of human skeletal material is the damaru, or sacreddrum, shown on page 283. The damaru is made from two skulls bound together atthe crowns with silver, with animal skin stretched across each one to make thedrum's surface.Image [images/p281-001.jpg]The heavily carved crown of the skull showing two deities in the yab-yumembrace.Image [images/p282-001.jpg]A kangling, a trumpet made from a human thighbone.Concerning the damaru, Loseries-Leick writes:Ideally, one skull should be from a sixteen-year-old girl born in the Year ofthe Dragon, while the other half may derive from a sixteen-year-old boy born inthe Year of the Tiger ... In any case, the two skulls should be of differentgender.37She goes on to write that certain Tantric sects, like the Kapalikas and Aghoris,use human fat to anoint the skulls to keep them from drying out.38 This fat isobtained from the cremation grounds themselves, as it drips from the bodies. Sheclaims she personally used this substance on her own collection of ritualskulls, but they were confiscated at a border crossing.The intention of this author is not to shock or titillate his readers but toconvince them of the seriousness with which this type of morbid ritualactivity—involving death, putrefaction, and the direct confrontation of theabsolutely worst facts of human existence—is taken by the Tantrikas. As we sawpreviously, the use of every type of human excretion and remains is acommonplace among some Tantric sects. Indeed, their incorporation, eithersymbolically or in reality, is central to many otherwise benign-soundinginitiations—for instance, the famous Kalachakra initiation of the Dalai Lamathat has been conducted as part of his global spiritual program, involving attimes thousands of participants, in many countries around the world. It is safeto assume that very few of these initiates are aware of the language of the coretexts of the Kalachakra Tantra, like the Sekoddesa commentary on theParamadibuddha.39 This commentary uses language so explicit that it bears awarning by the editor:Image [images/p283-001.jpg]A damaru, or sacred drum, made from human skeletal material.Please judge yourself and the material wisely, recognizing your own limitationsand respecting the text if you find parts of it incomprehensible at this time.40Without devoting too much time to an analysis of this text, with its descriptionof the “descent of semen” and the necessity of maintaining “the vajra erect,” itwill be enough to quote the commentary on stanzas 83–85:With the stanza that begins “The ambrosia of the moon” ... the Blessed showsthat, during sexual union, beings meet in an unmistakable situation, as alsooccurs at the moment of death.41This enigmatic statement equating sexual union with death is an appropriate onewith which to end this discussion of the fascinating sexual ritual that takesplace at Gunung Kemukus at the tomb of a prince who fell in love with hismother, and was slain.21 Helen Crovetto, “Bhairavi Cakra: Goddess Mandalas/Rituals in ContemporaryTantra's Nondualism,” Pacific World: Journal of the Institute of BuddhistStudies, Third Series, Number 8, Fall 2006, p. 241.22 David Kinsley, Tantric Visions of the Divine Feminine: The Ten Mahavidyas(Berkley: University of California Press, 1997), p. 235.23 The five days are called Legi, Pahing, Pon, Wagi, and Kliwon, names that weencounter in the extremely complicated Balinese calendar system as well.Recourse to a Javanese calendar (or the traditional almanac known as primbon) isnecessary for understanding how this five-day week relates to the othercalendars in use in Java, and to the greater cyclical calendars also in use bythe Javanese. The “Friday Pon” is, as the name implies, when the Javanese day ofPon falls on the Gregorian day of Friday. This occurs once every 35 days(Javanese 5-day week × Gregorian 7-day week = 35 days). Thus, the ritual shouldbe performed once every 35 days on the Friday Pon, for a total of sevenconsecutive Friday Pons. Perhaps coincidentally, a cycle of five phases of sevendays each appears in a Japanese Tantric context as the gestation period of amystical fetus (see James H. Sanford, “Wind, Waters, Stupas, Mandalas: FetalBuddhahood in Shingon,” Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 1997 24/1–2, p.20).24 Sir John Woodroffe, Shakti and Shakta (London: Luzac, 3rd edition, 1929), p.580.25 As the union is blessed, and as the sex involved takes place only within theritual context—the sacred time and sacred place—there is a strong argument thatthis does not support claims of adultery or fornication, which would be againstIslamic law. The acceptance of polygamy in Islam, as well as the relative easeof getting a divorce, may also contribute to the somewhat relaxed attitudetoward this practice.26 As we have seen, even the sultans of Yogyakarta and of Solo are expected tomaintain an extra-marital “relationship” with the Goddess of the Southern Oceanin an annual ritual that appears to have Tantric roots.27 The use of datura as an entheogen in Tantric rites and texts iswell-documented. See Parker and Lux, “Psychoactive Plants in Tantric Buddhism:Cannabis and Datura in Indo-Tibetan Esoteric Buddhism,” Erowid Extracts, Number14, June 2008, pp. 6–11; Parker, R. C., “The Use of Entheogens in the VajrayanaTradition: a brief summary of preliminary findings together with a partialbibliography,” 2008, n.p.28 See, for instance, Hariani Santiko of the Universitas Indonesia, “The GoddessDurga in the East-Javanese Period,” Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 56, 1997:209–226. However, no temple dedicated to Durga has so far been discovered inIndonesia, although other temples contain cella in which her statue may befound.29 Santiko, “The Goddess Durga in the East-Javanese Period.”30 It is, perhaps, the genius of the Indonesian government to accommodate thesepractices as statesanctioned, which tends to rob them of their value as a threatto the political status quo and instead keeps them in the realm of the purelyspiritual. We will look at this idea—the idea of transgression—in a moredetailed way in the chapters that follow.31 See, for instance, references in David Kinsley, Tantric Visions of the DivineFeminine: The Ten Mahavidyas (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997),p. 138.32 See Victor Turner, The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure(Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin, 1969) for the seminal work on liminality.

Arnold, ed., As Long as Space Endures: Essays on the KalachakraTantra in Honor of H.H. the Dalai Lama (Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion Publications,2009), p. 51. The Paramadibuddha is the root Tantra of the Kalachakra system,which, according to tradition, was taught by the Buddha himself one year afterhis enlightenment. There is no complete text of this document in either Sanskritor Tibetan, although portions of it do exist in various forms. While the coretext can be reliably dated to the first years of the 11th century ce, it isbelieved the Kalachakra initiation is much older and can be dated to the seventhcentury CE. An abridged form of the Paramadibuddha became known as the SriKalachakra, which is the Tantra in regular use by Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhiststoday.40 Arnold, As Long as Space Endures, p. 52.41 Arnold, As Long as Space Endures, p. 73."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10KABBALAH, TANTRA, AND SEXUAL GNOSISPreludeSurely one of the most influential forces in the rise of modernsexual magic was the complex body of texts and traditionsthat make up Jewish Kabbalah. ... Erotic symbolism ispervasive throughout Kabbalistic literature ...42To many students of Kabbalah, it will come as something of a shock to realizethat there is a Tantric thread running through the tapestry of Jewish mysticism.Yet modern Kabbalah scholars, from Moshe Idel to Elliot Wolfson to Rafael Patai,have all pointed out the Tantric element of Jewish mystical writings andpractices. Patai in particular emphasizes the possible identity of theShekinah—the feminine aspect of the Jewish deity—with none other than the Hindugoddess Kali. These are the conclusions of respected scholars, not the wildspeculation of armchair anthropologists. What this means for any student ofreligion—or, indeed, any Kabbalist or Tantricist—is profound. Patai himself goesso far as to speculate that there was a historical connection between Kabbalahand Indian Tantra, perhaps to the extent that one influenced the development ofthe other.This uniting of two separate esoteric strains—one from India, the other fromIsrael by way of Spain and North Africa—is evidence of a phenomenon that isalready well-known to Western occultists—that the secret teachings of all placesand times share a basic fundamental understanding of the created world. Thisconcept has come under tremendous pressure and criticism from postmodern sourcesthat insist on the uniqueness of every culture and deny the relevance andaccuracy of what they term “universalism,” which they characterize as justanother relic of the colonial era.Far from denying the uniqueness of individual cultures or religions, theesoteric approach recognizes that there are basic elements of human biology andpsychology that find unique forms of expression from culture to culture, butthat nonetheless point to a deep commonality. Social organization differs fromplace to place and from time to time, and is dependent on a wide variety ofenvironmental factors. Thus it is a mistake to draw too fine a parallel betweenthe religion of the ancient Teutons (for instance) and that of ancient China orMexico. The esoteric approach insists, however, that certain basic elements ofhuman consciousness are identical across racial and culture boundaries. The mostobvious of these elements is human sexuality.Regardless of whether a culture views the sun as male or as female, forinstance, the sexual polarity of sun and moon is recognized in many culturesthat have had little or no contact with each other. The role of parents, theraising and initiation of children into society, the sex act itself—all of theseare experienced everywhere, in every culture, and often have drawn about them acloak of tabu and mysticism. The association of human fertility with thefertility of crops or the availability of game is another phenomenon worthmentioning, as is the mysticism associated with war, disease, and death.Thus, although this is a study of the Tantric temples of Java, the author feelsit is useful to provide a look at Western ideas of Tantra in order to promotegreater communication between the two approaches. Many people in the Westbelieve they know of what Tantra consists, especially those who have engaged ina study or practice of what is sometimes (disparagingly) called “neo-Tantra.”Just as many people in the East take it for granted that there is nothingworthwhile in Western ideas about Tantra, since they are formulated by those whohave no direct knowledge of the Asian versions, do not speak any of thelanguages, and do not have a grounding in the culture or literature. Indeed, itseems to the most casual observer that what passes for Tantra in the West is aglorified excuse for sexual license. In other words, some of the samerecriminations that are directed against Tantrikas by the Brahmins in India mayfind their parallel in those aimed at the Western “Tantrikas” by its genuinepractitioners.Without coming down on one side or the other, the author will try to describevarious aspects of Western Tantra—in particular, those elements that are commonto ceremonial magic and alchemy—in order to give a more solid platform fordiscussion and investigation. In the past thirty years or so, the field hasbecome much more sophisticated, as a growing number of scholars have attemptedto analyze Western Tantra within their own disciplines.Among the names one encounters in any serious study of the subject are PaschalBeverly Randolph and Aleister Crowley, who are related via the teachings of anesoteric European society known as the Ordo Templi Orientis. However, thetradition of what we call Western Tantra goes back much farther than that, to atleast the time of the Florentine Academy, if not to the Jewish mysticaltradition that inspired some of its leading lights. It also includes the fieldof alchemy, long considered to be the ancestor of modern chemistry, but which,in fact, reflects a different worldview in which no element is static. Ratherall are part of an ongoing process of evolution and transformation.In this chapter, we'll consider how these Western forms of mysticism and magicrelate to Tantra, and especially to their Javanese “tantroid” manifestations.The idea is not to prove that Javanese practices somehow influenced—or wereinfluenced by—Middle Eastern and European forms, but rather to point out thatthe Javanese approach to Tantra is mirrored in the Western approach as a way ofreducing the enormous cultural and religious structures of Indian Tantra totheir basic, functional components. Hopefully, we will learn something aboutWestern Tantra in the process, of course, but we will also gain a deeperunderstanding of Tantra itself.THE BRIDAL CHAMBER OF GODThe early history of the Jewish people and their religion includes references toan Asherah. Although this term appears forty times in the Tanakh, there is theusual academic controversy over what it means. To be sure, Asherah is notclearly identified in any of the books of the Bible, and perhaps with goodreason. The inferences are startling—the Asherah can be nothing less than theconsort of the Jewish god, Yahweh.In 1929, an archaeological discovery in Syria of Ugaritic texts yielded someartifacts that offered the first non-biblical references to Asherah and enabledBiblical scholars to begin identifying her. The later excavation at Kuntillet‘Ajrud in the eastern Sinai (1975–1976) gave scholars more clues to heridentity. Citations in the books of the Old Testament were vague and ambiguous.In some cases, the Asherah was believed to represent a cult object of some sortrather than a deity. That assumption was in error for several reasons, not theleast of which is the idea that a cult object can exist independently of thedeity for which it was created or identified. The 1929 Ugaritic inscriptionsgradually made it clear that Asherah was probably referred to as both a deityand a cult object. The object, in this case, is believed to be a wooden post orpillar that was placed near the altar in the sanctuary.To understand this, it is necessary to realize that the early, pre-exilic(pre-sixth-century BCE) form of Judaism was not identical to the form of thereligion we know today. There was a purely monotheistic, Yahweh, branch of thefaith, as well as a more syncretistic form that incorporated elements of theCanaanite and Phoenician religions of the area. The Bible as we know it islargely the result of the Yahweh cult extirpating the syncretisic cult, bothpolitically and in the books of the Bible (although references to these otherpractices are well-known to Biblical scholars, as well as to careful readers ofthe texts).That Yahweh would have a consort, then, is understandable in light of the factthat the other gods of the region had consorts, much in the way we have alreadynoticed in the Indian religions. Asherah may, in fact, have begun life as aconsort of El, the local god with whom Yahweh was eventually identified oramalgamated.Recently there has been considerable interest in the idea that Asherah may belinked to, or even identified with, the goddess Qudshu. Qudshu was knownthroughout the Middle East, from Egypt to Babylon, as a goddess of fertility.She was often depicted standing on a lion nude or partially nude—en face, fullyfacing the observer—holding lotus flowers in one hand and snakes in the other.This iconography is very similar to the bas-relief of Lilith or Ishtar that wesaw in the chapter on Candi Sukuh, but the added presence of lotus flowers,lions, and serpents brings to mind a host of associations with the goddesses ofIndia that eventually made it to the religion of Java, including Durga, who isoften shown riding a lion and holding lotus flowers. In fact, one of theepithets of Asherah is “Lady of the Sea,” which recalls Nyai Lara Kidul.43Another is “Lion Lady,” which recalls Durga, who has been identified with thesame Nyai Lara Kidul and, possibly, with Sekhmet in Egypt.44 Both Asherah andNyai Lara Kidul are ladies of the sea, goddesses of fertility and eros who areassociated with serpents, and the consorts of rulers. Scholars have pointed outthat one of the epithets for Asherah may be “She who treads on the Sea Dragon,”which is eerily reminiscent of the Queen of the Southern Seas.45 This is not toinsist that there is an identification between the two, but only that theyreflect a similar concept and do so employing similar symbols.Asherah/Qudshu was characterized as a goddess of extreme eroticism. In herAkkadian incarnation as Ashratum, she is described as the “bride of the king ofheaven,” as well as “mistress of sexual vigor and rejoicing.”46 As Qudshu, hername is translated as “holiness” or “sanctuary,” a concept that will bring uscloser to one of the most mysterious aspects of pre-exilic Judaism—the secret ofthe Holy of Holies in Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.47 As Rafael Patai pointsout:... the Biblical notion that the tabernacle was built in order to service as adwelling place for Yahweh is transformed in Talmudic literature into the ideathat both the desert sanctuary and the Solomonic Temple were the earthly abodeof the Shekina.48One of the Gnostic gospels found in the Nag Hammadi corpus in 1945 is the Gospelof Philip. This document, which has been dated to the third century CE, isconcerned with ideas of androgyny and sexuality in a sacred context and makesrepeated references to the “bridal chamber,” which is seen as a means of unitingthe split between humans and God. The separation of woman from man in Genesis(with the creation of Eve) is a metaphor for the exile of humanity from thedivine, an exile that can only be ended in “the bridal chamber.” In fact, itvery specifically states, with reference to the Temple in Jerusalem:The Holy of Holies is the bridal chamber. Baptism includes the resurrection [andthe] redemption; the redemption (takes place) in the bridal chamber.49The theme of the sacred water (baptism) and the image of the bridal chamber arerepeated constantly in the Gospel of Philip. The identification of the Holy ofHolies with a bridal chamber is arresting; it calls to mind the other temples ofthe region, those of Babylon and Sumer that had chambers built at the top wherethe king or the high priest met with the goddess once a year at the New Yearfestival. Similarly, the Jewish high priest was only allowed into the Holy ofHolies on the Jewish New Year. If the God of the Jews had a consort, then thedepiction of the Holy of Holies as a bridal chamber is perfectly consistent withother Middle Eastern religions of the same era. We remember, in fact, the visionof Ezekiel (8:11–18), in which it is pointed out that women cry for Tammuz infront of the Temple. Tammuz is, of course, Dumuzi, the shepherd king whoseconsort was Inanna/Ishtar, who spent months in the Underworld every year, andwhose ritual was accompanied by mourning. It is possible that, by the time ofthe post-exilic period, the idea of Asherah had been repressed to a certainextent and become less a concrete image of a goddess than an ambiguous woodenpole that was planted next to Yahweh's altar to represent the power Yahweh hadto manifest in the created world—a pole that was decorated as a tree, as in theTree of Life.One of the problems with Asherah and identifying her definitively as the consortof the Jewish god lies in understanding the role of the consort in MiddleEastern religion. Is Asherah a goddess in the sense that El, Baal or Yahweh aregods? If not, then how to define her?We find a clue in an article by B. A. Mastin, in which the author gives us anintriguing possibility in a passing reference.50 In citing the work of P. K.McCarter, Mastin says that the “asherah of Yahweh” may refer to “theEffective/Active Presence of Yahweh,” which then became personified in thewooden pole and identified as Yahweh's consort.51 This raises the possibilitythat the goddess represents the power, or shakti, of the Jewish god. If so, thiswould solve the problem of Yahweh and “his Asherah” quite neatly, for therewould be no reason to justify or defend the notion that early Jewish religionwas polytheist if we see Asherah as an “emanation” of the “active presence” ofGod.This idea has been put forward by Simo Parpola of Helsinki University, whopublished translations of some of the Assyrian oracles in 1997. For Parpola, theAssyrian goddess Ishtar—with whom Asherah has sometimes been identified—is bestunderstood as the “breath” of the god Asshur:Ištar, who in the oracles addresses the king as her child, is Aššur revealed inhis mother aspect. In speaking through the prophet, she, however, is at the sametime also an entity distinct from Aššur: a divine power working in man and thusbridging the gulf between man and god. ... Accordingly, Ištar can be viewed asthe “spirit” or “breath” of Aššur (= God)—a concept well-attested inNeo-Assyrian texts.52 [emphasis in original]This concept of the masculine divine manifesting as a female quality is one weencounter in Kabbalah and most specifically in the personality of the Shekinah,of whom the Zohar speaks as the Matronita.THE MATRONITA—KABBALAH AND THE SHAKTIUndeniably, one of the great contributions of Kabbalists to the history ofJudaism is the explicit utilization of gender images to depict the nature of Godand the consequent application of erotic symbolism to characterize thedivine-human relationship.53 The most famous—if not the earliest—text of Jewishmysticism is the Sepher ha-Zohar, the Book of Splendor. Composed as a commentaryon the books of the Torah and in the frame of a dialogue between famous rabbis,it made its first appearance about the 13th century CE in Spain, in a regionnear Barcelona where there was an active and influential community of Jewishmystics. The Spanish environment of the author(s) of the Zohar can explain theuse of the Spanish word Matronita to refer to the Shekinah, although the word isrendered in Aramaic. Matronita is the diminutive form of the word matron, whichmeans “matron” or “wife.” Applying a diminutive—essentially saying “littlematron”—implies that the person being described is young or inexperienced, evenvirginal. Although the root of matron is the same as for “mother”—mater inLatin, or madre in Spanish—the idea of motherhood is not necessarily implied.Instead, it may mean a young woman with elevated status.The idea of the Shekinah as a young bride is a constant theme in Jewishmysticism. The respected scholar of Kabbalah Moshe Idel has gone so far as toidentify two “consorts” of God in Kabbalistic texts: the Shekinah, and a divineconcubine or mistress.54 That there is a feminine aspect or power to the JewishGod is taken for granted in the Kabbalah. Shekinah is perceived as representingthe people of Israel in exile from God; she is also considered to be apersonification of Malkuth, the last, or lowest, sefirah on the Kabbalistic Treeof Life. As such, she also represents the created world and the first stage in aprocess of spiritual illumination. Without putting too fine a point on it, wecan say that there is a rough analogy between Shekinah as Malkuth and Kundaliniat the muladhara chakra at the base of the spine. Both are spiritual femininesrepresenting the first step in the attainment of cosmic consciousness. The goalof both is to unite with the spiritual masculine in the bridal chamber. Shekinahseeks union with God in Kether, the very first sefirah at the top of the Tree ofLife. For Kundalini, it is union with Shiva at the level of the sixth chakra,usually identified with the thalamus or hypothalamus in the human brain—thalamusbeing a Greek word that means “chamber.” Both of these ascents are templates foran individual's quest for union with the divine.According to other Kabbalists, at the moment of sexual union, the mind of thehusband is in fact elevated to the supernal realm and draws down the divinelight and the Shekinah herself. These spiritual forces descend into the drop ofsemen, infusing spirit into the seed.55The Zohar frequently uses marriage and sexual metaphors to describe therelationship between God and his Creation, a fact that has not escaped theattention of a new generation of Kabbalah scholars like Moshe Idel, ElliotWolfson, Melila Hellner-Eshed, and many others.56 A complete discussion of thistopic requires a book in itself, so, for the moment, we will have to be contentwith a few examples that help frame the argument for a Tantric interpretation ofKabbalah.One of the most important prayers in Judaism is the Shema. It derives from averse in Deuteronomy (6:4) and reads “Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, theLord is One” (Shema Yisra'el YHVH Eloheinu YHVH Ehad). The prayer is anaffirmation of monotheism and, as such, is used in liturgical observances in thesynagogue and also by pious Jews upon going to bed and in many other situations.According to the Zohar, when the Shema is uttered “with perfect intention,” aspark flies down from the heavens and illuminates the Tree of Life:Then that Tree wafts fragrances and aromas, and all the trees of the Garden ofEden waft fragrances and praise their Lord, for then Matronita is adorned toenter the canopy with her Husband. All those supernal limbs unite in one desire,in one aspiration, to be one with no separation. Then Her Husband is arrayed forHer, to bring Her to the canopy in single union, to unite with Matronita. ... Atthat moment, Matronita prepares and adorns Herself, and Her attendants escortHer to Her Husband in hushed whisper, saying “Blessed be the name of Hisglorious kingdom forever and ever!” (Zohar 2:133b)57This is clearly a hieros gamos, a sacred marriage, and is only one of many suchreferences in the Zohar. There is a husband and a wife, the trees in the Gardenof Eden, a canopy, and a “single union.” Here, the sacred marriage of Inannawith Dumuzi has been re-imagined to reflect, not only the relationship of thepeople with their national God, but that of an individual with the divine. Bysaying the words of the Shema—with perfect intention—the individual assists inthe act of bringing the people of Israel closer to God and, at the same time,increases his or her own state of grace. Through a process of internalization,the individual becomes an active participant in the sacred marriage and notmerely an observer. The reference to the Garden of Eden implies that the husbandand wife represent Adam and Eve, and that the sacred marriage performed in theGarden is a way of redeeming the Fall.There is evidence that this internalization process began about the time of theadministration of King Herod in the first few years CE (although it could havebegun much earlier, as the Book of Ezekiel suggests). At that time, there wereconflicts between various religious and political factions in Jerusalem over theconduct of the high priests at the Temple and the way in which Jewish law shouldbe interpreted. The famous account of Jesus throwing the money lenders out ofthe Temple is one example of how some Jews saw their sacred spaces beingpolluted. The records left behind by the Qumran sect offer further evidence ofthe tensions that existed between Jews who were supporters of the Maccabeandynasty in Jerusalem and those who considered themselves purists in a kind ofself-imposed exile on the shores of the Dead Sea. The Song of the SabbathSacrifice is one example of how the outsiders at Qumran “spiritualized” theTemple of Solomon, creating a “virtual” temple to replace the one that wouldsoon be destroyed by the Romans.When the rituals and sacrifices normally associated with the Temple of Solomoncould no longer be performed due to its destruction, a process ofre-interpretation of these rites took place in an effort to retain theirspiritual power. This was seen in the texts of the Jewish mystics who relied onthe Vision of Ezekiel as a template for how one could “visit” the “virtual”temple. This method is known to us as the “Descent to the Chariot,” and asMerkavah mysticism. It is a process of visualization of various levels ofspiritual understanding until one arrives at the Throne of Heaven. We rememberthat the high priest was allowed into the Holy of Holies at the Temple ofSolomon only once a year, on New Year's Day. This tradition was kept alive bysome mystics, who used New Year's Day as the occasion to “descend to theChariot,” thus reinforcing the idea that there is a link between the Temple ofSolomon and Jewish mystical practices.58This concept also extended to the sacred marriage. As we can see through a closereading of the relevant mystical texts like the Zohar, the idea of sacredmarriage was expanded to involve individuals, not only kings or high priests.Once the physical Temple had been destroyed, its spiritual counterpart becameaccessible to everyone—and that included the rituals associated with it,properly internalized through the methods of mystical trance and intensevisualization. However, not all of these methods were purely mystical.Sexual relations between a husband and wife were seen to replicate the unionbetweeen Shekinah and God. In referring to one of the oldest Kabbalistic texts,the Sepher ha-Bahir, Elliot Kiba Ginsburg writes:In terse, allusive fashion, the Bahir has created the basis for imagining theSabbath as the time of hieros gamos, the union of the divine king and bride.59Indeed, the Sabbath was considered an ideal time for a husband and wife toengage in sexual intercourse, for it was the time when God and Shekinah were inunion; thus, intercourse between a husband and wife shared in that divineintimacy. In other words, we see once again that sexuality is not a metaphor,but was meant to be taken literally as a practice and a process. The externalelements of temple, god, goddess, and sacred marriage were internalized throughmental and biological processes, in much the same way that Tantra internalizedthe cosmic creative process and made it accessible to individuals of all castesor genders. Indeed, noted historian of Jewish religion Rafael Patai has eveninsisted that there exist direct historical links between Indian Tantra andJewish mysticism, going as far as to suggest that Kali and Shekinah arecognates.60This type of thinking was castigated in the postmodern era as representinguniversalism, a theory of anthropology and comparative religion related to thedoctrine of diffusionism. Briefly, diffusionists believe that many of theworld's cultures influenced each other in remote antiquity. As an example, thisis considered to be the reason why Mayan ruins resemble Egyptian pyramids or theJavanese temples on Mount Lawu. This same point of view is used to argue thatthe Native American culture had links to ancient Phoenicia, for instance, or toWelshmen from the time of the Round Table, or to Chinese Buddhist monks—to namejust a few of the more popular theses.Many commentators regard diffusionism as inherently racist— such as theimplication that the Native American population could not have built the famous“burial” mounds of the North American continent or the Mayan or Aztec temples ontheir own without outside help. Opponents of diffusionism are called“independent inventionists,” because they believe that individual cultures grewand evolved on their own without influence from the outside, especially in anydiscussion of Native American cultures. This is, of course, the postmodern viewthat has superseded the universalist theory that all cultures have elements incommon and may come from a common source or sources—an “Ur-kultur.”The amount of epigraphic and other evidence in North America (particularly) thatsuggests the presence of European and North African missions in North Americalong before Columbus is problematic for independent inventionists, however. Bethat as it may, the opprobrium with which any hint of diffusionism is greetedmeans that some evidence will have to wait until new theories emerge that allowus to accept that these two perspectives are not mutually exclusive.Until then, we can draw interesting and educational parallels between IndianTantra and Jewish mysticism, and between these and European alchemy, that bridgethe gap between the two and demonstrate that there is an underlying methodologyunderstood by disparate cultures that permits individuals to attain union withthe divine and to take part in the ongoing act of Creation.THE CHEMICAL WEDDINGThe rituals and religions of other cultures, other places, and other times are akind of Rorschach test. They provide outlines, colors, and even drama, but oftenthe real core of the system evades us because we project onto it what we alreadyknow from our own culture. Thus our analysis of these cultures tells more aboutwho we are than about who they were. In a nutshell, this is the argument thatpostmodern anthropologists have with the universalist approach to comparativereligion of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.There have been stories of lights in the sky and gods coming from the heavensfor thousands of years, at least since the beginning of written language. In the20th century, this was interpreted as aliens from other planets. What in ancientIndia they saw as flying chariots we, in this period, call flying saucers. Inanother 100 years, we can expect that there will be another technology andanother paradigm, and we will interpret those lights in the sky as somethingcompletely different.But the lights will not go away. They will continue to demand an interpretation.Somehow, the authors of Western alchemical texts understood the value of thiskind of approach. They realized that there was more than one way of looking at aphenomenon. Explanations that were too specific robbed the phenomenon of itsmeaning and of its relationship to other phenomena, cutting it off from the restof creation and making it something singular and isolated.While alchemy has a long and fascinating pedigree, there is no space here to gointo historical detail. What the author proposes is to take one particular andfamous example of the alchemical literature as a starting point—the enigmaticChymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz. While there may be doubt that theChymical Wedding is a true representative of alchemical texts, popularlyunderstood—since there seem to be no formulas or recipes for preparing metalsfor transformation, etc.—it has had tremendous influence on the growth ofWestern secret societies, who have adopted its hero, Christian Rosenkreutz, as asymbol of a person on a spiritual quest of personal transformation.Briefly, the story is that of Christian Rosenkreutz, a Christian knight whoreceives an invitation to a wedding at a castle. He receives this invitation onthe eve of Easter Sunday—i.e., Holy Saturday, which represents for Christiansthe time that Jesus was in the tomb before the Resurrection. It is also,according to some Christian traditions, the day that Jesus descended to theUnderworld to free the souls that had been trapped there since the time ofAdam's sin. (It is worthwhile to remember that one of the earliest recordeddeities, Dumuzi, also spent time in the Underworld. The mourning for the deathof Tammuz/Dumuzi recorded in Ezekiel is paralleled in the mourning for the deathof Jesus on Good Friday.)Christian receives this letter while he is in the midst of meditation. As he issitting in silent prayer in his home, a great storm rages outside. He ignoresthe storm, as he is used to this phenomenon while he is meditating. At thistime, a beautiful woman appears who hands him an invitation to the wedding.We can see that this single image resonates with our Javanese hero, Senapati,meditating on the beach. A great storm rose up then, the ocean churned, and outof the storm appeared Nyai Lara Kidul, a “beautiful woman.” Both experiencesbring the meditator to an other-worldly kingdom—Senapati to Nyai Lara Kidul'spalace beneath the waves, and Christian Rosenkreutz to the castle of the kingand queen. In the former, it is Senapati himself who marries the Queen of theSouthern Ocean; in Christian's case, he will witness a strange wedding in thecastle.The author has covered this text in some detail elsewhere, so will not dwell toomuch on its convoluted plot.61 Instead, we will focus on a few elements thatreflect our theme. The hieros gamos takes place on the fourth day of a seven-dayevent. In this wedding, however, the bride and bridegroom are slain—in fact, twoother Kings and two other Queens are slain as well, along with the executioner,who is identified only as “the Moor.” This brings the total number of dead toseven. The constant reappearance of the number seven throughout this text isremarkable, indicating some of the same concerns as those of the Qumran sect inthe document known as the Song of the Sabbath Sacrifice, which invokes a“virtual” temple through the repeated use of the number seven, as well as of theBook of Revelation—The Apocalypse—with its repeated “seven” imagery. The authorhas identified this preoccupation with “seven” as an indication of deepersignificance than the seven planets or days of the week, etc. He argues, rather,that it represents the idea that the constellation of seven fixed stars known asthe Big Dipper or the Chariot (Ursa Major) was the subject.62It is interesting that a Moor is singled out as the executioner. Moors inEuropean literature meant Muslims and North Africans, members of the Arab armiesthat had invaded Europe in the eighth century CE and who remained in power inSpain until 1492. That a Moor would execute members of a Christian royalhousehold may be a gloss on European history. In alchemical terms, however, aMoor has other associations, so the juxtaposition of Moor and King and executionin the Chymical Wedding is perfectly tuned.63 To be sure, it was the arrival ofthe Moors (Muslims) in Central Java in the 15th century that signaled the end ofthe Majapahit Empire and the beginning of Mataram II, at about the same time asthe period in which the Chymical Wedding is set.64The sacred wedding and massacre take place on the fourth day; on the morning ofthe fifth day, Christian Rosenkreutz comes upon a tomb beneath the castle where“Lady Venus” is kept. She lies, naked and beautiful, on a bed draped around withcurtains. This is another reference to Ishtar/Inanna (Venus) in the Underworld(the tomb). She is motionless—not dead, but dreaming in her underground crypt.An enigmatic poem on a tablet next to the bed reads:When the fruit of my tree has completely melted, I shall awake and be the motherof a King.65Again we note the association with royalty and fertility. We will return to thetree motif shortly. Adam McLean, in his commentary to the Wedding andspecifically to the Venus episode, notes that Lady Venus represents “thepowerful passions of the feminine side of human nature,” while the masculineside represents “lofty abstractions” such as the “Arts and Sciences.”66 Themeeting between the two forces “must result in inner struggle and death. Thusthe wedding of the King and Queen can only be achieved in this castle through adeath process.”67 The Queen is thus identified with Lady Venus or, at least,with the forces that Lady Venus represents.However, what if death, in this case, was not meant literally, but rathermetaphorically? What if the death of the King and Queen at the time of thesacred wedding, or hieros gamos, is a reference to le petit mort of the humanorgasm? After all, the death of the two royals was required in order for theelixir vitae and the Philosopher's Stone—the amrita of the Tantras—to beproduced. The bizarre juxtaposition of marriage and massacre may be a referenceto this basic biological fact in an appropriately “hermetic” context, with theadded instruction that both partners are slain—i.e., both attain orgasm. If weremember that we are dealing with twilight language—just as we were with theTantric texts—we can begin to read the Chymical Wedding with different eyes.This is not to insist that the entire allegory can be understood sexually in allof its detail; but the sexual allegory is one level of the tale, whichrepresents, after all, transformation and transmutation through the union ofopposites. That is why it is entitled a “Wedding” and not a “Massacre” or an“Execution.” The Wedding is filled with allusions to male-female polarity; theyare inescapable and take place on each of the seven days and often multipletimes on each day. When we add to that the set piece on the sixth day of theascent up a tower of seven levels that is accomplished by means of ladders,ropes, or wings, we have before us a hermetic representation of the ascent ofKundalini, which is understood here, not in its purely Indian aspect of apsycho-biological process, but in terms of a spiritual-chemical process,referencing the seven steps in the alchemical transmutation of base metals intogold. Keep in mind, however, that these processes are manifestations of the samebasic process as it appears in different realms. Acknowledging this, we can usethe one to interpret the other.The metaphor of the tree is constant in alchemical literature as well. We findillustrations of trees in many alchemical texts, from the Splendor Solis ofTrismosin (1582) to The Pleasure Garden of Chymistry (1624) by Daniel Stolcius,the appearance of which, eight years after the publication of the ChymicalWedding, presents us with material that helps to illuminate, somewhat, thenarrative of the Wedding. Often, the tree is referred to as “the Tree of thePhilosophers,” and the allusion to the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Edenis sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit.68Eve was tempted in the Garden by a serpent who bade her eat of the fruit of theTree (Genesis 3:1-7). In the Wedding, Venus lies in the tomb beneath the castle,waiting for the fruit of the tree to melt so that she can be freed. There aretwo Trees in Eden: the Tree of Knowledge is the one from which Eve took theinfamous apple (or, possibly, pomegranate) and the Tree of Life—i.e.,immortality. We are accustomed to interpreting these episodes in a moral orethical framework: humanity sinned against God and was denied immortality andhence has been suffering ever since. The language of Genesis makes that clear.In other cultures, however, this is interpreted differently and, indeed, Eve iscalled by Adam the Mother of All Life (Genesis 3:20). Her name comes from theHebrew root hawwa meaning “life.” If we stand back from the Biblical account alittle, however, and look at Eve as a Mother Goddess—at least, as representativeof the Shekinah or the shakti of God—we can see this story in another way. Weknow, for instance, that Eve was created by being split from Adam's body. Thus,Adam and Eve were originally one person, one being. This androgyny isreminiscent of how the primordial Shiva is often represented in India. Uma isShiva's feminine nature, his shakti and creative power. In this way, we can seeEve as Adam's shakti. Their “marriage” takes place after they have eaten of thefruit of the Tree of Knowledge, when they first realize they are naked in theGarden. Yet, according to Genesis, they have forfeited immortality, for theyhave not eaten of the Tree of Life.The story of humanity then becomes a quest for the Tree of Life, hidden behindthe walls of the Garden. In India, as in Java, this is the quest for amrita, theelixir vitae that is produced by the churning of the cosmic ocean, snatched fromthe possession of the Nagas, the serpents. The Tree of Life itself—the etzchaim—becomes a potent symbol of spiritual progress in Kabbalistic circles. Itcan be considered the Tree of Eve, an etz hawwa. Both refer to the word “life”and they are both linked with the serpent.Indeed, the symbol of Asherah, the consort of Yahweh, was a wooden pole or tree.Groves of trees were also sacred to Asherah. This identification of a primordialor divine female figure with a tree in ancient Jewish religion may give us a wayto comprehend the story in Genesis a bit better.To those who object that this turns Adam into some kind of god—if Eve is theMother Goddess—one only has to point to the Kabbalistic tradition of AdamKadmon, the “Primordial Adam.” Adam is here identified as the Perfect Human,representing the source of all human souls. Far from the view we have of Adam asthe man who docilely followed Eve's example and ate of the forbidden fruit, tothe rabbis and later the Kabbalists, Adam represented something far morepowerful and sublime. Kabbalists, comparing the two seemingly contradictorystatements in Genesis concerning the Creation, understand that Adam was firstcreated both “male and female”—that is, androgynous—and then was split from hisfemale nature to produce Eve. Until that moment, Adam was the perfect “image andlikeness” of God, the closest we can come to experiencing the Divine directly.It is this bringing back together of Eve and Adam to re-create the Androgynethat is the meaning of teshuva, or redemption, a word that also means “return.”In alchemy, the androgyne is represented by another constant symbol, shown inthe two images at the top of page 302. The two woodcuts are both taken fromdifferent versions of the famous alchemical treatise Rosarium Philosophorum. Inboth, we find the symbol of the androgyne in the center and a Tree of Life tothe left. Both androgynes are winged, holding serpents in their left hands.In the second woodcut, we see the figure standing on serpents in a way that isreminiscent of the Garuda figures from Candi Sukuh (shown again at bottom righton page 302). It bears an uncanny resemblance to the alchemical woodcutsabove.69The figures in the two woodcuts at the top of page 302 are holding a cup withthree more serpents in their right hands. This image of the elixir vitae beingsecured from serpents by a creature that is a winged human is so specific thatit is striking to find such a parallel between a 16th-century European text anda 15thcentury Javanese sculpture. We can only suspect that the connectivetissue, in this case, must be India.The first woodcut represents the perfection of Luna, and the second that of Sol.In alchemical terms, Luna, or the moon, represents silver and Sol, or the sun,represents gold. Of course, there are also layers of associations,correspondences, and meanings attached to these two concepts, foremost amongthem that of Luna as feminine attributes and Sol as masculine. The androgyne orhermaphrodite is a symbol of the hieros gamos perfected, shown at bottom left ofpage 302. The two halves of the human personality—the Shiva and the Shakti, themale and the female—have been united, returned to a pre-lapsarian state in whichAdam had not yet been split from Eve and was still in direct communication withGod. The return to this state is the goal of the alchemical mystics as well asof the Indian and Javanese Tantrikas. In both cases, this state is attainedthrough a “refined”—in the sense of metals—version of sexuality, of the hierosgamos, the sacred marriage that is nonetheless enacted with real elements, realflesh-and-blood elements.Image [images/p302-001.jpg]TOP LEFT: The Androgyne is a constant symbol in alchemy.Image [images/p302-002.jpg]TOP RIGHT: An androgynous image from the Rosarium Philosophorum.Image [images/p302-003.jpg]BOTTOM LEFT: The hieros-gamos rite of the sacred marriage from an alchemicalmanuscript.Image [images/p302-004.jpg]RIGHT: The serpents at the base of the Garuda statue at Candi Sukuh recall theserpents in the Rosarium woodcut above.In the Catholic Church, the term “elements” is used to indicate the bread andwine that are transformed into the body and blood of Christ and consumed by thefaithful during the Mass. The technical term for this transformation istransubstantiation, a term that only came into general use in the Church in the12th century. The concept involves recognizing that the substance of the breadand wine has changed into the body and blood of Christ, but that the appearance—what are called the “accidents”—have not changed.In alchemy, there is transmutation rather than transubstantiation. Elements arechanged both in substance and in accident, or appearance. Lead becomes gold,truly. However, in a more Tantric approach, the idea of transubstantiation hasmerit, for the body is not outwardly changed. We can still recognize theTantrikas as the same human beings who started the Tantric process, but theyhave been changed inwardly and attained a degree of spiritual transformation.The alchemical transmutation of the elements is considered a physical sign ofthe inner transformation—or transubstantiation—of the alchemist.The physicality of the Catholic Mass —the elevation of body and blood intosacraments and the consumption of them as a requirement for every Catholic—haslent itself to occult manipulations. Several grimoires, notably that of PopeHonorious, require some contact with these elements to enhance the magicaloperations. Others recommend stealing them from a church or having a priestconsecrate them especially for the rituals. That there is occult power investedin the transubstantiated bread and wine has been a common belief for centuries.Without trying to make too sharp a point about it, the vaguely cannibalistic ortheophagic nature of the Mass has similarities with some Tantric ritualsinvolving the flesh of corpses and the consumption of forbidden foods. The veryidea of the Mass is horrifying to a pious Jew or Muslim—the idea that God canbe, and should be, eaten verges on the savage and surely can have little to dowith monotheism. Thus, the Protestants of the Reformation insisted that the Masswas more of a memorial service commemorating the Last Supper of Jesus, ratherthan a magical rite involving changing the substance of bread and wine into thespiritual body and blood of God.The actual transubstantiation is carried out through the grace of the HolySpirit, the third member of the Holy Trinity that also includes God the Fatherand God the Son. The Holy Spirit is usually depicted as a dove, and is alsoidentified with water via the sacrament of baptism.70 It was the Holy Spiritthat was responsible for the Virgin Birth, i.e., the impregnation of Mary withthe divine essence of God. This combination of ideas is remarkably similar tothose of the elixir vitae and the action of Garuda, the winged deity, insecuring the water of life. It is Garuda who is depicted many times at thetemples on Mount Lawu, where amrita was collected and dispensed to the faithful.The author mentions this to demonstrate that Tantric or tantroid elements—ideasand rituals involving the elevation of spirituality through the manipulation ofmatter—can be found everywhere, even in the West and even in the most sacrosanctof Western religious thought and practice. Magic is the Western form of Tantra,as Francis King has pointed out, and the Catholic Mass is considered by many tobe a form of the highest magic.7142 Hugh B.

Briefly, the seven stars of the Dipper revolvearound the Pole Star and thereby represent seven levels in the approach toimmortality (the seven stages in alchemical operations; the seven palaces inmerkavah mysticism, etc.). Since the Pole Star represents north, and the Dipperis circumpolar and never rises or sets, the association of this constellationwith ideas of immortality and centrality—the axis mundi—is certain.63 A common instrument in the alchemist's laboratory was a cold still, called a“Moor's Head.” But there are also references to a “man, black as a Moor”(Schwarz wie ein Maure) in the “Fourth Parable” of the Splendor Solis of SolomonTrismosin, dated 1582 (British Museum, Harley MS 3469). This figure representsone of the phases of the alchemical process. The accompanying plate shows a manwhose torso is black, whose head and right arm are red, and whose left arm iswhite. Ascending out of a muddy pit is a beautiful woman, white, who standswaiting for him with a red cloak. She wears a crown and has wings, and a starhovers over her head. Like all alchemical illustrations, this one seems to bedesigned to elucidate the obscure prose, but succeeds rather in tempting us witha range of possibilities.64 On the sixth day, according to the text, Christian Rosenkreutz finds an urnon which the date 1459 is inscribed, which refers to the year the Wedding takesplace. The meaning is uncertain. We know from other sources, including a codewithin the Wedding, that Christian was born in the year 1378, so while 1459 mayhave other esoteric associations, it is within reason (barely, perhaps) thatChristian would be alive and 81 years old at the time of the Wedding. In 1459,the Islamic Sultanate at Granada in Spain—site of the famous Alhambra—was stillin existence and thus there were still Moors in Europe.65 Joscelyn Godwin and Adam McLean, The Chemical Wedding of ChristianRosenkreutz (Grand Rapids: Phanes Press, 1991), p. 7466 Godwin, The Chemical Wedding, p. 129.67 Godwin, The Chemical Wedding.

Apollonius ... carries with him a commendatory letter to the Brahmins ...Here these admirable eastern magicians present him with such rarities as in verytruth he was not capable of. First of all they shew him—as Philostratusdescribes it—a certain azure or sky-coloured water, and this tincture wasextremely predominant in it, but with much light and brightness.... Apolloniusconfesseth how the Brahmins told him afterwards that this water was a certainsecret water and that there was hid under it or within it a blood-red earth.Thomas Vaughan, The Fraternity of the Rosy Cross (1652)72As mentioned in the previous chapter, two of the most influential occultists ofthe West in the last 100 years are P. B. Randolph (1825–1875) and AleisterCrowley (1875–1947). While other names may be better known—H. P. Blavatsky,Manley Palmer Hall, Krishnamurti—Randolph and Crowley were interested less inrepeating or revising the hermetic and occult writings of the past than theywere in blazing new paths and developing an entirely new esoteric paradigm. Itis from studies of Randolph and Crowley that a generation of both practitionersand academics has arisen in the last thirty years, a generation that isre-evaluating Western occultism and making it a field of serious study andrespect. Much of this has to do with the interest generated by Kabbalah studieson the one hand, and by Tantric studies on the other.The interpenetration of these two fields has provided us with a means ofappreciating the richness and depth of a literature and a praxis that has beendismissed too often by mainstream scholars. The relevance for Javanese studiesrests in the pragmatic integration of sexo-magical practices from diversesources that characterizes Western occultism. Many of these sources areidentical to those that helped form the Hindu-Javanese experience. Hindu andBuddhist forms of Tantra are foremost in this Western phenomenon, whichdeveloped hundreds of years after a similar approach took root in Java. Indeed,the blending of Islamic and Hindu esoteric philosophies and practices that wefind in Java are duplicated to some extent in Europe and the Americas, and inparticular in the modern secret society, the Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO.As this chapter's epigraph illustrates, the belief that the famous Greekmagician of the first century CE, Apollonius of Tyana, visited India where helearned the secrets of alchemy and the amrita was current at the time that theRosicrucian Fraternity was being introduced in the 17th century. The author ofthe quotation is Thomas Vaughan, a Welsh alchemist whose works are thinly veileddescriptions of the Tantric aspect of alchemy. Vaughan is believed to haveperished due to “unguided autonomous nervous system experiments,” according toKenneth Rexroth in his Foreword to Vaughan's collected works—certainly a bizarreclaim if Vaughan's alchemy had been strictly of the chemical or mineral kind.73What makes this all the more interesting is the fact that this reference toApollonius, India, and the “secret water” takes place in an essay on theRosicrucian Fraternity.The 19th and 20th centuries were rife with organizations claiming a Rosicrucianlineage. These include groups founded by Randolph and Crowley, as well as theGolden Dawn. With Randolph and Crowley, we have substantial and irrefutableevidence that their focus was on precisely this “biological” aspect of magic andalchemy, and on the “autonomous nervous system experiments” that it is saidkilled not only Vaughan, but also his wife.The history of Randolph, Crowley, and their colleagues has been told in severalplaces in greater or lesser detail, so we will not spend too much time on ithere.74 Rather, we will focus on the element of their work that most concerns usand that has attracted the greatest attention from specialists and casualobservers alike—the interpretation of sexuality within spiritual and esotericcontexts.THE BROTHERHOOD OF EULISOne night—it was in far-off Jerusalem or Bethlehem, I really forget which—I madelove to, and was loved by, a dusky maiden of Arabic blood. I of her, and thatexperience, learned—not directly, but by suggestion—the fundamental principle ofthe White Magic of Love; subsequently I became affiliated with some dervishesand fakirs of whom, by suggestion still, I found the road to other knowledges;and of these devout practicers of a simple, but sublime and holy magic, Iobtained additional clues—little threads of suggestion, which, beingpersistently followed, led my soul into labyrinths of knowledge themselves didnot even suspect the existence of. I became practically, what I was naturally—amystic, and in time chief of the lofty brethren; taking the clues left by themasters, and pursuing them farther than they had ever been before; actuallydiscovering the ELIXIR OF LIFE; the universal Solvent, or celestial Alkahest;the water of beauty and perpetual youth, and the philosopher's stone ...75We begin with a look at Pascal Beverly Randolph, certainly one of the mostenigmatic figures of the 19th century, and one who wielded enormous influenceover the growth of secret societies in the 20th century. Randolph, anAfrican-American spiritualist, became involved in more extreme forms ofoccultism while visiting Europe and the Middle East. It is the knowledge—and,perhaps, the initiations—received abroad that led him to create his own secretsociety, the Brotherhood of Eulis. The Brotherhood was based on his system ofoccultism, which included sex, drugs, and a method of communication anddivination through the use of magic mirrors. The term “Eulis” is problematic,and seems to have been Randolph's own creation.76 At times, he connected it withthe Eleusinian mysteries, an ancient (circa 1500 BCE) form of worship that wasbased on the story of Demeter, Persephone, and Hades, the lord of theUnderworld.77 Like the annual festival of Inanna and Dumuzi, this was anagriculturally based celebration commemorating the time of the year whenPersephone was held in the Underworld and the land above lay fallow. Thecelebration of the Eleusinian mysteries took place annually in Greece for nearly2000 years, until the fourth century CE, making it one of the longest-lastinginitiatory cults in history. It allowed men and women, slave and free, to becomeinitiated into its secrets, which to this day have never been discovered orrevealed. This rite became the basis for a theatrical presentation by AleisterCrowley known as the Rites of Eleusis.Another possible meaning for “Eulis” is grounded in the Greek root eos, meaning“dawn.”78 Regardless of the ultimate meaning, the Brotherhood of Eulis was basedon a spiritualized interpretation of human sexuality and the application ofsexuality to magical power. The Brotherhood became the source for several othersocieties that were spun off from Eulis or inspired by it. As we have seen,Randolph claimed to have discovered the secret of the elixir vitae, the amritaof the Indian Tantricists, which he calls the “water of beauty and perpetualyouth.” That this was somehow connected with sexuality and with drugs leads usto the impression that he was dabbling in a form of Tantra, with all thetransgressive ritual that this implies. At the same time, his discussion ofsexuality is always very conservative and respectful of the married state and of“soul union.”Whether Randolph discovered the elixir vitae or not, his obsession with it hasfueled Western esotericism for hundreds of years.79 At least since the days ofthe Fama Fraternitatis in the 17th century, when the Rosicrucian Society firstmade its appearance, the quest for immortality has been linked with thetransmutation of metals. Alchemy and immortality go hand-in-hand, and not onlyin the West. Chinese alchemy, for instance, shares the same dream. In Java, thetemple of amrita at Candi Sukuh also depicts the ironworker manufacturing thesacred kriss. There is an association between transmutation and immortality thatat first seems contrived, until we realize that the ancients believed thatmetals evolved over the course of thousands of years.Long before Darwin and his study of human and animal evolution, the belief inthe evolution of metals and souls dominated alchemical thought and practice.Gold, according to this theory, is the highest form of metal and all metals aregradually turning into gold; it is their apotheosis. The Philosopher's Stone,mentioned above by Randolph in the same breath as the elixir of life, is asubstance that accelerates the process of evolution and enables the alchemist tochange lead (the least evolved metal) into gold (the most evolved), the symbolof perfection, both of metals and of the human soul. Those who can control theprocess of evolution become immortal. Disease and sickness are traits associatedwith the lesser metals, while control over the evolutionary process indicates anactive role in Creation itself. Lead is metal in an imperfect state that iseventually destroyed as it transforms into higher and higher forms of metal.Gold alone is indestructible—i.e., it cannot evolve into a higher metal. It hasreached its state of perfection and is immune to disease and decay.Sexuality, then, is a biological function in service to human evolution; hencethe wide range of sexual metaphors and analogies we find in alchemical texts (aswell as in Kabbalistic literature). It mimics on a human plane what takes placeon the plane of metals and plants. Randolph called this process “affectionalalchemy.”In the Randolph scheme, the affectional alchemical process required thecommingling of both male and female essences in the sexual act. That means thatthe act required both a man and a woman, excluded the use of condoms or otherbirth control devices, and required that ejaculation take place within thefemale's vulva so that specific male and female secretions would take place andmix. This composite mixture, called “magnetic” in Randolph's phraseology,fulfills “God's purpose in bi-sexing man.”80 The secretions were identified inRandolph's work as those from Cowper's Glands (source of the pre-ejaculate fluidin men) and from the Glands of Duvernay (actually Bartholin; the Duvernay glandswere discovered in cows), which provide some lubrication for the vagina duringintercourse. Neither of these two fluids has any function known to science otherthan as lubricant for the sex organs during intercourse, but to Randolph, theywere elements of the water of immortality and were possessed of secret,“magnetic” properties that lead to a “bi-sexing” of the human organism.To Randolph, as to most alchemists, Kabbalists, and Tantricists, the androgyneis a symbol of perfection. Each one of us possesses elements of both genders toa greater or lesser extent. As we will see in the section on Crowley, thisconcept was elevated to the status, not only of doctrine, but also of ritual.ALEISTER CROWLEY AND TANTRA... I would suggest that the key differences between traditional forms of Tantraand Crowley's system lies not in the details of sexual union but rather in theemphasis that is placed on sex in the first place. (Emphasis in original)81A search through the book that can arguably be called Crowley's mostfamous—Magick: in Theory and Practice—reveals references to Hindu mysticism andyoga in nearly every chapter. Terms like asana, prana, pranayama, samadhi, andnirvana abound, and many of the practices prescribed for followers of Crowley'sunique form of ceremonial magic include yoga and meditation. This is certainlynot what one would find in an examination of the European grimoires that formthe basic texts of magic, and it is not something he would have learned from histime with the British secret society, the Golden Dawn.It is therefore equally surprising to realize that there is virtually no mentionin this text of Tantra itself. The references to sexually based occult practicesare there, of course (this is Aleister Crowley, after all), but in apredominantly Western context in the form of the Rose and the Cross, or theGnostic Mass, etc. What Crowley does do is refer his students to a handful oftexts translated from Sanskrit and Pali that can be found in the Sacred Books ofthe East series that was virtually the only source of Hindu, Buddhist, andDaoist scriptures at the time (the early 20th century). The texts he recommendsinclude the Shiva Samhita and the Hathayoga Pradipika, as well as the YogaAphorisms of Patanjali and the Dhammapada.While Crowley's emphasis is clearly on yoga and the intensive training of themind in meditation for the attainment of mystical illumination, the ShivaSamhita in particular can be considered a Tantric text, as it connects thepractices of asana, mudra, and pranayama with the attainment of supernaturalpowers, and also provides a brief discussion of Kundalini and the pathways knownas ida, pingala, and sushumna. Indeed, the Shiva Samhita is in the form of adialogue between Shiva and Parvati and, in that sense, is consistent with otherTantric works.The sources for Crowley's education in matters Indological can be identifiedeasily enough. The Theosophical Society began as a Western-oriented occultsociety when it was founded in 1875 in New York City, but its creator andspiritual guru, Madame Helena Blavatsky, quickly abandoned Euro-centered occultliterature for an approach that was largely Asian. Her emphasis switched fromKabbalah and Hermeticism to Buddhism and Hinduism, leaving the field open togroups like the Golden Dawn and the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (and itsassociated Societas Rosicruciana in America) to concentrate on the Westernesoteric tradition. Crowley was quite familiar with both areas of study, and wasproud to notice that his birth year and that of the Theosophical Society werethe same. The Society was, in fact, the best-known occult society in the Westfor many years, and has survived to the present day with branches throughout theworld. Its headquarters were moved to India during Blavatsky's lifetime, and itbecame influential in the Indian independence movement, as well as in theindependence movement of other Asian countries. At one point, Crowley evenattempted to gain control of the Society—an attempt that was never in any realdanger of succeeding, but that demonstrates the extent to which Crowleyidentified with the organization and its Asian-centered approach to esotericmatters.Other than the Theosophists, Crowley's other real contact with Asian religionand mysticism came in the form of his good friend and colleague—one would evensay mentor—Allan Bennett, who was one of the first Englishmen to be ordained aBuddhist monk and who introduced Buddhism to England. Bennett's role inpromoting Buddhism has never been forgotten; Theravadin monks of the author'sacquaintance from Sri Lanka (where Bennett studied under Sri Parananda in theearly years of the 20th century) still revere his memory under his religiousname, Bhikku Ananda Metteya.Bennett was a member of the Golden Dawn, the British secret society that hasproduced such notable figures of modern occultism as Crowley, Arthur EdwardWaite, MacGregor Mathers, and even Nobel Prize-winning poet William ButlerYeats. The Golden Dawn's origins are controversial. The claim that they were theBritish branch of a German Masonic society was regarded as a hoax for manyyears, until recent scholarship has suggested that these claims may be true.Regardless of the society's actual origins, the organizers were members of theSocietas Rosicruciana in Anglia, a putative Rosicrucian order that was formed byFreemasons.Crowley joined the Golden Dawn in 1898, received his revelation concerning theLaw of Thelema in Cairo in 1904, and then joined the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)in 1910, receiving a charter for the OTO in Great Britain and Ireland in 1912.The dates are deceptively simple, for the impact that the Golden Dawn and OTOinitiations had on both Crowley and on Western occultism since those years hasbeen far-reaching.The Golden Dawn taught an organized system of ceremonial magic based on theKabbalistic Tree of Life and Egyptian mythology. This system includes aninitiated version of the tarot cards, of astrology, and of the Angelic Tabletsof Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley, two Elizabethan-era magicians who claimed tohave received, not only a system of magic directly from the angels, but also anangelic language with a grammar, syntax, and vocabulary all its own. The GoldenDawn system was nothing short of brilliant, for it brought order into the messyworld of grimoires, talismans, and occult ritual of the Middle Ages and beyond.Crowley easily climbed the grades of the Golden Dawn and married the sister ofone of its members, taking her on a honeymoon to Cairo where, in April of 1904,he received the Book of the Law, a testament that became his sacred scriptureand the core document of the movement that grew up around it: Thelema (Greek for“will”).It is important to note that there was nothing overtly Tantric or sexual aboutthe magic that was taught at the lodges of the Golden Dawn. It was all veryVictorian and very proper—to the extent that ceremonial magic can be considered“proper.” There was no nudity, no real or mimed sexual acts, no suggestivelanguage. That said, the Golden Dawn did admit members of both genders and didacknowledge the role of goddesses as well as gods in the Egyptian pantheon theyadopted.Crowley's own Book of the Law, however, did contain material that was Tantric intone, if not in nature. The Book is divided into three chapters, the first ofwhich contains the words of the Egyptian goddess Nuit. Her admonitionsconcerning “wine and strange drugs” and her overtly sexual language about howshe should be worshipped are evidence of a tendency toward the Tantric—or“tantroid”—that became increasingly shrill in Crowley's ouevre. The secondchapter is that of Hadit, the male counterpart of Nuit, with more suggestivelanguage and sexual references. The third and final chapter contains the wordsof Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the “Crowned and Conquering Child” of the New Aeon, or NewAge. This, the most controversial chapter, contains militant language and rathervile imprecations concerning the world's religions. The transgressive nature ofthe Book of the Law so upset Crowley himself that he put it away and ignored itfor years, while continuing to practice magic and occultism and maintaining hisfriendship with other occultists like Alan Bennett, who had since retired toAsia to become a Buddhist monk.It is entirely possible—though so far not proven—that Crowley's knowledge ofTantra came from his travels in India and other parts of Asia, and from hisconversations with Bennett. This is the kind of narrative with which scholars ofreligion have become all too familiar: the European who goes to the mysteriousEast and comes back with arcane knowledge. Although this may be said to havebegun with Marco Polo, it includes personalities both real and mythical likeChristian Rosenkreutz, Apollonius of Tyana, and even Prester John. Since the19th century, when Sir Richard Burton gave us his famous travelogues among themysterious shamans of India and Arabia, all sorts of adventurers, spies,mercenaries, soldiers, mystics, and adepts have found themselves on the Journeyto the East with greater or lesser success. This phenomenon was roundlycriticized by Edward Said, who deplored the archetype of the civilized Europeangentleman who dips his toe into the brackish waters of the Ganges and comes backwith tales alternately thrilling and disgusting of exotic lands, savagery, andbeauty—tales that revealed more about the English imagination than it did aboutthe foreign lands themselves.This was precisely the image conjured up by the founders of the Ordo TempliOrientis—the Order of the Temple of the East. Their narrative includes theorigins of their Order in the travels of their founder, Carl Kellner, who spenttime in the Middle East and came back with the sexual secrets of Sufi and Indianmystics (a story that runs parallel to that of Randolph).According to tradition, Crowley's occult writings up to that point (c. 1910)contained several veiled references to sexuality in a Rosicrucian context thatattracted the attention of the OTO. The Order decided to initiate Crowley intoits membership with the aim of preventing him from revealing any more secrets,however innocent or inadvertent the previous revelations had been. When Crowleyrealized the sexual aspect of his work up to that point, he felt illuminated andenergized and set to work creating a comprehensive approach to magic andspirituality that would raise human sexuality to its rightful place. It alsoenabled him to revisit the Book of the Law and to accept the openlytransgressive element of the more offensive passages as being essential to hisunique process of genuine spiritual attainment. What Crowley had done—perhapswithout being aware of it—was to write a peculiarly Western Tantra.As noted previously, the Indian Tantras are written in the form of a dialoguebetween Shiva and Parvati (Shakti). The goal of the dialogue is to revealcertain secrets of the universe through myth, ritual, and occult instruction. InCrowley's Book, there are three chapters, each dictated by one of three Egyptiangods: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Nuit is the quintessential female goddess,while Hadit is her male counterpart. The presence of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, however,brings the traditional form of Tantra into a new dimension. The focus moves fromthe female-male polarity of Indian Tantricism to a third party: the Crowned andConquering Child, the product of the hieros gamos. The third chapter repudiatesall other existing religions and insists on replacing them—all of them—with anew vision and a new form of spirituality of which magic is the tool.Egyptian religion is not the sole reference point for the Book of the Law,however. The very first chapter mentions the Beast and the Scarlet Woman,personalities famous from the New Testament's Book of Revelation (Book of theApocalypse).82 This infamous couple, who are signifiers of great evil in theBible, become identified with the prophet of the New Aeon—Crowley himself—andhis Bride. It is important to note that Crowley had a succession of theseBrides, called Scarlet Women, whose function was purely ritualistic. By anymetric, these women can be understood to have served as the shaktis in Crowley'sunique system of magic and Tantra.We now enter what is probably the most problematic aspect of Crowley's lifework—his relationships with a string of Scarlet Women and other sexual partners,male and female, who were involved with him in his pursuit of the Great Work.The fact that some of these partners fared rather poorly in the process iswell-documented, beginning with his first wife, Rose Kelley, who was committedto an asylum for alcoholism in 1911 (eight years after their marriage and theensuing birth of their two children, one of whom died less than two years aftershe was born).That Crowley had a succession of mistresses and wives and also frequentedprostitutes is well-known. That this seemed scandalous in Victorian England isunderstandable, but we often observe the same behavior among Tantric adepts inIndia. On the one hand, it is too easy to claim that Crowley's sexuality wasthat of an initiate of the great mysteries and therefore beyond our ken, that weare incapable of judging him or his behavior because we have not attained thesame level of initiation. On the other hand, it is also too easy to take at facevalue the stories that were printed about him in the tabloid press and condemnhim outright for them.Crowley's biographers—and there have been many—have done their best to separatethe lies from the truth, a task made more difficult rather than easier by thepublication of Crowley's own diaries and autobiography. His references toprostitutes, mistresses, homosexual encounters, masturbation, animal sacrifice,and drug use (hashish, opium, heroin, etc) are legion; what is remarkable isthat most (if not all) of these references are within the context of magicalworkings and rites of divination. Clearly, this can be interpreted as Crowleyjustifying his actions by appeal to a higher, occult purpose. Perhaps there isno reliable way of understanding the truth of Crowley's career without followingin his rather moist footsteps, but that is a subject for another book entirely.What we will do here, instead, is look at some of what he has writtenspecifically on the subject of occult sexuality and interpret it using what weknow of Tantra, and especially of the syncretistic form of Tantra we haveuncovered in Java.Probably the most blatant expression of Crowley's ideas concerning sexuality andmagic is a short pamphlet of twenty pages usually entitled De Arte Magica thatwas first published in 1914.83 In this text, he writes of the elixir of life anduses primarily alchemical symbols like the Red Lion and the White Eagle.However, he also includes references to prana as well as to the sefirot of theKabbalistic Tree of Life, and both thinly veiled sexual allusions and moreblatant references to semen, menstrual blood, and other bodily fluids. The usualclaim is made that this is the great secret at the heart of magic and occultism,and those who possess it have complete power over nature and the elements andcan bend the universe to their will. In all of this, we can see similarities tothe form of Tantra we find in Java—the syncretism, the importance of the elixirof life, the sexual allusions, and even the occasional references to prana andother Indian concepts.Crowley goes somewhat further in this text, however, by gradually abandoning the“twilight language” and expressing the ideas and the technology more openly. Inone place, he openly advocates the consumption of the “elixir”—the bodily fluidsgenerated by sexual intercourse—and in another he extends the discussion to aform of deliberate sexual exhaustion he refers to as “eroto-comatoselucidity.”84 In chapter 16 of De Arte Magica, which is entitled “Of certainHindu theories,” we find what may be Crowley's first mention of the word“Tantra” when he refers to the Shiva Samhita. In this chapter, he also refers tothe practice of the vajroli mudra (see chapter 5 [16_chapter05.html#ch5]), butwithout mentioning it by name. He seems focused on the idea that the male IndianTantrika does not ejaculate, but retains his semen. While this is true for someTantric practices, it is not true for all. It was, however, a common perceptionamong the scholars of Crowley's time, and to some extent remains so.85Crowley's reference to the Shiva Samhita, certainly one of the most explicit ofthe Tantras, is interesting, because it contains an admonition to retain semenat all costs in its fourth chapter, the section dealing with the vajroli mudra.An edition dedicated to the Theosophical Society that was published in 1887contains the clear language of the original.86 The more recent edition by JamesMallinson claims to have restored some text excised from the Sris Chandra Vasutranslation that specifically concerns the vajroli mudra. While the twotranslations are not identical, however, there does not seem to be anythingmissing in that regard.87The Shiva Samhita contains the phrase: “Death arises through the falling ofsemen.”88 It urges adepts to retain semen at all costs—thus the recommendationto practice the vajroli mudra, the “vacuuming” of the seminal fluid from thevagina after ejaculation if, indeed, ejaculation has taken place. De ArteMagica, however, speaks clearly about the consumption of the mingled male andfemale fluids and goes so far, in the chapter on “eroto-comatose lucidity,” asto recommend complete sexual exhaustion. This seems to be the antithesis of thepractices recommended in the Shiva Samhita.89One thing is clear, however; for Crowley, as for the Indian Tantrikas, the sexact itself represents the essence of magic. Variations of the sex act—positions,fluids, partners—are different elements of a complex technology of spiritualattainment. Each variation produces a different effect. The fact that somegroups emphasize abstinence, others the avoidance of ejaculation, and stillothers the ejaculation and consumption of fluids does not indicate levels ofmoral or ethical superiority, but different paths leading ultimately to the sameend—transformation of human consciousness into something resembling cosmicconsciousness.That sexuality and magic are inextricably linked is underlined by theKabbalah—not only in the general way that the Shekinah is understood as a femalequality of Godhead, but in some specifics as well.Moshe Idel points out, for instance, that the Hebrew term shimmush designates“magical operations” as well as “copulation.” Another term, rendered by theHebrew letters ZQQ, “denotes both having a sexual relationship and making someform of invocation.”90 This meme seems to be at the heart of Western magic, asit is of Tantric practices. Tantra, for all its emphasis on sexuality, is alsothe most occult of the Indian religious practices. It is often identified withthe acquisition of supernatural powers (the siddhis), as well as with spiritualattainments. Because of the use of mantras (which are considered magic spells inthe West) and yantras (the equivalent of magic seals and talismans), Tantra isboth magical and sexual. There should be no surprise that a magician with thescientific approach that Crowley promoted would be as drawn to Tantra as hewould be to Kabbalah and Egyptian magic. One holds the key to the other.Crowley's use of alchemical imagery in De Arte Magica was relatively rare in hisother published work, however. While he correctly understood the sexual aspectsof alchemical terminology, it is doubtful whether he was able to interpretalchemical texts successfully from a purely (or largely) sexual perspectivewhile maintaining the chemical (and psychological) levels of interpretation atthe same time.In another text, the outline of what he called the Cephaloedium Working that wasconducted at the end of 1920, we have sexual references that are so explicitthey verge on the humorous:Aiwaz is spelt Ayin, the Eye, i.e. that of Shiva or Horus, the Meatus Penis andthe Anus: Yod, the Phallus, Spermatozoon, and Hand; Vau the Fertility of theTestes and Uterus as well as the Nail of the mentula, being Taurus the Cow Isisand the Bull Apis or Shiva, the Son in Tetragrammaton, the Redeemer byReproduction, the Mithraic Bull of Resurrection and Initiation in the strengthof the Body. .. And spelt fully Ayin is the Erection and Leaping and Extensionof the Phallus; Yod is the Spermatozoon, the Solitary Boy Hermes, the Virgin;while Nun is the Eagle of sexual Ecstasy ...91You get the picture.The above would be viewed with horror by modern religious studies scholars andanthropologists as the worst sort of universalism. We have Hebrew letters mixedwith Indian and Egyptian terms and gods, Mithraism, and so many sexualreferences that the insistence seems deliberate—an attempt to convince oneself.For instance, the Bull is simultaneously that of the Egyptian god Apis, theIndian god Shiva, and the bull of the Mithraic initiation process—not to mentionthe “Fertility of the Testes and Uterus.” However, we should not allow ourselvesto be dismayed by what appears to be a flagrant disregard for scholarlyrectitude. What Crowley is doing is decoding the twilight language in which theesoteric texts were written. While we may suggest that sometimes a cigar is justa cigar, in the context of this ritual, the biological references areappropriate.In this same spirit of excessive transgression, Crowley describes the femalepartner or shakti—the Scarlet Woman—in these terms:... Léa my concubine, in whom is all power given. sworn unto Aiwaz, prostitutedin every part of her body to Pan and to the Beast, mother of bastards, aborter,whore to herself, to man, woman, child and brute, partaker of the Eucharist ofthe Excrements in the Mass of the Devil ...92The shocking mention of something called the “Eucharist of the Excrements” hasits parallel in the Kalachakra initiation ritual, where a vase of urine and avase of feces occupy positions in the “pristine consciousness” mandala, asJeffrey Hopkins, translator and editor of the definitive text on this TibetanBuddhist initiation written by the Dalai Lama himself, tells us:The two vases in the east are filled with purified marrow; those in the south,with purified blood; those in the north, with purified urine; those in the westwith purified excrement. Above and below, there are also vases filled withpurified semen and menses respectively. They are on lotuses and are covered withlotuses.93This initiation, again according to Hopkins, had its origins in Java with theinitiation by Atisha of Pindo Acharya, the “famous Kalachakra master.”94 Whilethe scatological references in Crowley may be due more to Crowley's own desireto be as extreme as possible in pursuit of forbidden knowledge rather than aninsight into the more scandalous forms of Tibetan Tantrism, it is possible thatthe basic impulse is the same in both cases—a desire to overcome dualistic ideasof purity and filth, of what is acceptable and what is automatically rejected.Transgressive sexuality is followed to its logical conclusion: the sexualization(and hence sacralization) of all human biological emissions and substances.This approach has been solidified in what is perhaps Crowley's longest-lasting(or best-known) legacy, the secret society known as the Ordo Templi Orientis, orOTO. The higher degrees of this society are known to embody secrets pertainingto sexuality in its spiritual manifestations. The rituals for the VIII, IX, andXI degrees are not written down, but are believed to represent solitarysexuality, sexual intercourse, and anal or possibly homosexual sexuality,respectively. That this is a gross oversimplification is certain. The VIIIdegree may as easily represent abstinence and celibacy as self-gratification,for instance. The IX may represent the alchemical secret of the Rose and Cross,etc. When we are dealing with occultism, however, we are speaking in “twilightlanguage,” in which one set of symbols can be used to encode analogous processesin other systems. Recourse to Crowley's own writings reveals the practicalapplication of some of these sexual secrets, so failing an actual initiationinto the OTO or a similar order, it is up to the reader to make what use of ithe or she is able.Crowley lived at a time when serious research into Tantra had only just begun.Many of the most important texts had not yet been translated, or had beentranslated inexpertly. Moreover, Crowley was not fluent in any of the Indianlanguages, so did not have access to the deeper levels of meaning hidden withinthe texts that were available. It required scholars like David Gordon White andHugh Urban—decades after Crowley's death in 1947—to reveal the closerelationship between alchemy and Tantra, and to provide scholars and magiciansalike with the context for understanding the alchemical process as a biologicalone, while not abandoning the other levels of interpretation (and praxis) thatare equally relevant and important. The tools that are available today for aserious re-evaluation and rejuvenation of Western esotericism are many andpowerful, and we can expect that a 21st-century version of the Golden Dawn mayyet take advantage of these developments.SEX, MAGIC, AND POLITICSIn Javanese history, many of the Hindu-Buddhist kings were Tantrikas; those thatwere not often had Tantric priests as members of their courts. This openconsolidation of esoteric with political power is unusual. In the West, we havethe occasional example of a king or an emperor with an avid interest inoccultism, alchemy, or hermeticism who brings experts in these fields to hiscourt. Sometimes the goal is purely mercenary: hiring alchemists to make gold,for instance. In other cases, however, the hermetic arts had actual patrons inthe royal houses of Europe. Still, it was rare to find a monarch that openlypracticed magic or alchemy. Remember that Europe was the scene of theInquisition and the witchcraft trials and, later, the wars of the Reformation.The Church had such a hold on the spirituality of the people that any deviation,no matter how benign, was punishable by imprisonment and death. One only has toremember what happened to Giordano Bruno or Galileo Galilei to understand thateven scientists and philosophers were not exempt from this persecution and couldfind themselves sharing a prison—and a stake—with illiterate peasant womenaccused of witchcraft or poisoning their neighbors' cows. Even a powerful entitylike the Knights Templar was disbanded, its members arrested, its landsconfiscated, and its leaders executed.In Java, there was (and still is) room for spiritual experimentation. At thetime the Templars were being persecuted in Europe, Tantra was enjoyingtremendous support in the courts of the Javanese kings. Perhaps this was due toa Javanese perception that there exists in the world a “hidden force” that isrepresented equally by the world of politics and by the world of spiritualityand magic, and that one factor connecting these worlds is sexuality.95The relationship between charisma and sexuality is an interesting one, a fieldthat is little understood because it is so controversial. We have seen, in theWest, how a politician's sexuality can destroy his career, particularly if it isof a “transgressive” nature—extra-marital affairs, homosexuality, pedophilia,etc. Some of our most attractive politicians—the most charismatic anddynamic—have been womanizers or have been accused of being so: Jack Kennedy,Robert Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Martin Luther King. The tension, especially inAmerica, between sexuality and public life, and thus between politics andreligion, is such that no calm and objective approach is possible. It isvirtually heretical (in a secular way) to suggest that Jack Kennedy's sex lifemight have been an integral part of his personality as a charismatic andvisionary leader. While Americans applaud the separation of church and statethat is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, they still applystrict religious perspectives to their political leaders and expect them to be“spiritually” pure as well as politically astute—a state of affairs that thosein other nations find somewhat humorous or, at the least, confusing.Adultery and homosexuality are viewed by pious Americans as threats to thesanctity (or spiritual integrity) of marriage. Marriage is considered to be aunion so fragile, so tenuous, that assaults upon it are legion—especially thosewe cannot see. There is a raging discourse in America concerning the rights ofhomosexuals to marry, the argument being that allowing homosexuals the samerights as heterosexuals somehow undermines straight marriages. The logic is hardto follow, but may have more to do with how marriage and sexuality wereunderstood by America's European ancestors than with religion itself.Since the history of love and marriage in the West has been shown to be a topicworthy of several large volumes, I will not attempt to duplicate the efforts ofother authors in these pages, but will instead suggest that the central, legalconcern of marriage in the West is property and inheritance. Any study ofEuropean history will show that succession—of kings and queens—was a constantobsession in the courts. There had to be a legitimate heir; the bloodline wasmore important than competence or capability. An outsider (a commoner) could nothope to ascend the throne, no matter how brilliant. Thus, love was irrelevant tothe condition of sexual reproduction and the manufacture of legitimate heirs.In the life of everyday people, property was still an issue. Deciding who wouldinherit property after the death of a parent became a jurisprudential obstaclecourse. Different cultures and different religions had widely differing opinionsand laws on inheritance. An illegitimate child could not hope to inherit, thusimplying that bloodline and community sanction was necessary for the peacefultransfer of real estate. This may be among the many reasons why cultures haveforbidden homosexuals to marry, for their children would almost certainly not betheir own or, at the very least, not the product of both parents, even ifartificial insemination came into play. Without a “legitimate” heir, propertyownership could not be determined. If the children of homosexual couples werepermitted to inherit, then illegitimate children of heterosexual couples couldbe considered viable heirs as well.That this was true, not only for monarchs, but also for the citizens of therealm is underlined by the typical marriage ceremonies of India, Malaysia,Indonesia, and even Eastern Europe and Greece. In these ceremonies, the weddingcouple is considered king and queen for the duration of the ceremony. They aretreated as royalty. In the Russian Orthodox Church, the couple wears crowns ofgold. In the Greek Orthodox Church, the crowns may be of flowers, but they arenonetheless crowns. The association of marriage with political power andrule—with the monarchy—is thereby acknowledged, and the association of marriage,political power, and sexuality is made manifest. Even in the Chymical Wedding ofChristian Rosenkreutz, the married couple at the heart of the mystery are a kingand queen.This demonstrates the nexus between power and sexuality. The rules concerningownership of a farm are mirrored in those of the ownership of a country. Alawful marriage is a prerequisite; but the state's involvement in married lifedoes not end there. As Michel Foucault has pointed out:Up to the end of the eighteenth century, three major explicit codes—apart fromcustomary regularities and constraints of opinion—governed sexual practices:canonical law, the Christian pastoral, and civil law. They determined, each inits own way, the division between licit and illicit. They were all centered onmatrimonial relations: the marital obligation, the ability to fulfill it, themanner in which one complied with it, the requirements and violences thataccompanied it, the useless or unwarranted caresses for which it was a pretext,its fecundity or the way one went about making it sterile, the moments when onedemanded it ... its frequency or infrequency, and so on. ... The sex of husbandand wife was beset by rules and recommendations.96Thus, what a man and woman do together, even on the matrimonial bed, is subjectto proscriptions and prescriptions, inhibitions and prohibitions. What istransgressive in this environment is not only the standard “crimes” of adulteryand homosexuality, but virtually any sexual act that does not havereproduction—the creation of property and an heir to property—as its goal. Anadulterous liaison does not produce a legitimate heir; nor do homosexualliaisons. This idea was extended to oral intercourse and anal intercourse aswell, which were condemned because they were not capable of producing a humanchild. This relationship between sexuality and property has been the dark shadowbehind all public discourse about marriage, sex, deviation, etc.—no less in thecivil arena than in the sacred spaces.Is it any wonder, then, that the Tantric circle was vilified, not only byBritish colonialists, but by Indian Brahmins as well? The type of sexualityhonored and practiced in the rituals of the Kaula Tantrikas and the Vama Margpractitioners was a physical and material repudiation of the idea that sexualityis purely for the purpose of producing more children—boys to inherit the land,and girls to be sold off into virtual slavery as wives of men they had nevermet. Love is suspect in this equation; it is a wildcard element that has to becontained, controlled, and directed toward an appropriate end. Love is volatileand unpredictable, and its sudden phosphorescent appearance in a stable andsociety-conscious family can be perceived as a threat to the community. This isespecially true when the emotion of affection is accompanied by sexualattraction.Sexuality, however, is considered contained once the bond of matrimony issealed. The matrimonial commitment is made, not only to one's spouse, but (andprobably most importantly) to the community at large. It is a statement thateach partner has now accepted the rules and regulations of the community wheresexuality is concerned, and that it is expected that viable heirs to whateverproperty may exist will be safely produced. One defies these expectations atone's peril, as the archetypal example of Romeo and Juliet informs us.LÀ-BASTantra, however, calls all of our preconceived notions about sexuality intoquestion. The Tantric circle is, in Western eyes, a Black Mass. There is ritual,there is illegitimate worship, there is secrecy and the unsettling environmentof the cemetery, and there is sexuality. Most important, there is also power andthe attainment of that power by those not legitimately entitled to it. TheTantric circle implies the creation of an alternative system of religion andgovernment, an alternative culture, and an alternative sexuality. Tantra, in itspurest form, is an act of rebellion.This was also true of the Black Mass, which is said to be performed by defrockedCatholic priests and to feature a nude virgin as the altar. This Mass representsthe ultimate rebellion against the Church, which also means against the state.It is a denial of everything that both ostensibly stand for. The control andsuppression of sexuality as noted above by Foucault results in its expression inviolent images and extreme behavior—a condition that is still with us today.As Georges Bataille (1897–1962) has noted, reproduction is opposed toeroticism.97 Bataille speaks of the idea of continuity and discontinuity—thatwe, as discontinuous beings, yearn for continuity. He notes that we are bornalone and die alone, as individuals, and that this is at the heart of ourfeeling of discontinuity. Community cannot solve that problem effectively.Eroticism, on the other hand, does provide the sensation of continuity, of beingat one with another person and, by extension, with the cosmos itself. He callsthis state of being dissolution—a term revealing for the way it resonates withalchemy and with Tantra and the amrita:The whole business of eroticism is to strike to the inmost core of the livingbeing, so that the heart stands still. The transition from the normal state tothat of erotic desire presupposes a partial dissolution of the person as heexists in the realm of discontinuity. Dissolution—this expression correspondswith dissolute life, the familiar phrase linked with erotic activity. ... forthe male partner the dissolution of the passive partner means one thing only: itis paving the way for a fusion where both are mingled, attaining at length thesame degree of dissolution.98The term “dissolution” is used in alchemy to refer to the second step in thealchemical process of transformation. This step involves dissolving a solidsubstance in a liquid; one of its symbols is the bath. There are manyillustrations of this in alchemical texts; often, they depict a king and queentogether in the bath as if it were a wedding bed or a coffin. The processrequires repeated steps of dissolution and coagulation, and is often referred toby the Latin phrase solve et coagula.In the quotation above, Bataille is referring to a dissolution of consciousnessin which both the male and female partners are “mingled” in the sexual act. Itcould just as well refer to the alchemical process or to the Tantric process.The mingling is an essential step in the creation of the amrita, the elixirvitae. Indeed, Bataille's study of eroticism is subtitled “Death andSensuality.” The connection between eroticism and death is, in Bataille's view,a necessary one. As humans, we are made mortal and subject to death as“discontinuous” beings when we are “created” through the process of a sexualact. We seek continuity, and do so through eroticism—an eroticism that does notavoid or negate death, but that provides a sense that death is not final butpart of (or an extension of ) the erotic experience. As we noted in a previouschapter, the connection between death and orgasm—le petit mort—is common to manycultures.Bataille's work was often banned, thus showing once again the sensitivity ofgovernments to open discussions of sexuality. His short novel, The Story of theEye, has a Black Mass as its climactic scene, with elements of fellatio, theconsumption of urine and semen with the sacrament, and ritual murder.99 Thisstory echoes that of J. K. Huysmans' famous novel of Satanism, Là-Bas (1891),which also ends with a Black Mass and contains references to the notorious massmurderer, Gilles de Rais.While the prototype of the Black Mass was, as noted, anti-Church as well asanti-state, by the time Bataille was writing, the notion of the Black Mass hadtaken on a general anti-establishment, anti-cultural signification. While thedesecration of a church and its sacrament may be considered scandalous and evenhorrifying today, for many 21st-century Christians, pious and otherwise, theidea of the Black Mass has gradually lost its ability to shock. With the readyavailability of pornography and the boundary-testing programs of commercialtelevision and film in the areas of extreme violence and sexuality, it isreasonable to expect that the Western psyche has become desensitized to what wasonce considered blasphemous and transgressive. The ongoing, highly publicizedscandals involving pedophile priests have also meant that many Catholics—andnon-Catholics—no longer feel that the Church is as sacrosanct as before.Instead, we have another figure, another unholy icon, in the character of theserial killer. Previously known as the “lust killer,” the serial killerrepresents a fusion between violent murder and sexuality. As I have suggested inan earlier work, the serial killer may be, for the West, a shamanic symbol.100Serial killers are known not only for murder itself, but for the grisly elementsthat accompany their kills—dismemberment of the body; torture; sexual actsbefore, during, or after the murder; the retention of souvenirs; etc. These areritualistic kills in the broadest sense of “ritual,” as an act that is repeatedin exactly the same way as a kind of compulsion that has meaning for theritualist. These elements are often present in the development stage of theSiberian shaman, but they occur internally as part of a psychological (andperhaps psycho-biological) process. The popularity of books and movies in theWest that romanticize this figure is evidence that the close association ofmurder and sex has resonance with the general public. There is a sense that theidea of the serial killer represents something sacred or at least somethingsecret and encoded. It is the Minotaur in the Labyrinth, perhaps. The Shadow inthe Machine. Isn't the theme of “death and sensuality” present in the Tantrasthemselves? Even in the Kalachakra Tantra, which is the core text of theinitiations carried out worldwide by the Dalai Lama? As suggested previously,the time has come for a Foucaldian interpretation of the Tantras with an assistfrom Bataille and Derrida, perhaps.This modern fascination with sex and death may be early evidence, therefore,that the Tantric practices of today may have to undergo a kind oftransformation. Does the need still exist for rituals that break tabus in theirpreliminary stages? If so, what tabus are left to break? How will modern Westernseekers approach Tantra and tantroid practices in their effort to attain higherdegrees of spiritual awareness and gain siddhis in the process, when they havebeen inundated with sexually oriented media since birth? Where will the breakbetween normative reality and an alternate reality occur? Where is the liminalboundary between a modern man or woman and the Unknown, the Forbidden, theOther?It may simply be different for each person. While society at large may havedisposed of many of the tabus that once loomed so large that the breaking ofthem was a dangerous spiritual act, on an individual basis, many tabus stillremain. Society has not suddenly attained higher spiritual states because thetabus have been lifted. On the contrary. It is possible, then, that for modernWesterners to make effective use of this spiritual “technology,” they will haveto revisit old neuroses, to chant the forgotten hymns, to become reacquaintedwith the world as it was known only a century or so ago. Only then will theillusion that the tabus have been broken become the accepted wisdom. Asconservative forms of religion become more dominant in Western society, we mayfind that what we thought had been discarded now returns with a vengeance. Whenthat happens, Tantra will show a way out, and a way up.72 Arthur Edward Waite, ed., The Works of Thomas Vaughan, Mystic and Alchemist(New York: University Books, 1968), p. 353.73 Waite, The Works of Thomas Vaughan, p. 10.74 For Randolph and his occult activities, see Joscelyn Godwin, ChristianChanel, and John P.

Spirituality is notdetermined by dogma or doctrine; individual spiritual seekers are nottheologians. They are practitioners, and as practitioners, they accept whatworks and discard what does not. That does not mean that the discarded rites andvalues are worthless; at any time, they may be revisited. The needs of spiritualseekers change as their level of understanding changes, and as their needs inthe world change.Tantra is a way of action, a magical approach to spirituality that is eclecticand dynamic. That we find syncretism in the religious life of Java should,therefore, come as no surprise. While the West is still struggling withevaluations of sexuality and its place in religion, politics, andspirituality—and confronted by increasingly blatant expressions of sex,violence, and criminal behavior (both real and fictionalized) in themedia—Tantra acknowledges the power of transgressive behavior and channels itinto areas conducive to psychological development.In Java, this approach to life and to power has never been denied or suppressedfor very long. It may have reached its heyday during the Hindu-Buddhistdynasties that lasted for 1000 years on the island, but it managed to survivethroughout the later Islamic period and up into the present day as an integralpart of Javanese culture. There were Tantric kings on Java, just as there areinnumerable temples that enshrine—literally—the principles of amrita, ofKundalini, and of siddhi. We have seen that these sites are often still the lociof worship and ritual. The rulers of modern Indonesia have acknowledged theimportance of these beliefs in their own lives. The Islamic sultans ofYogyakarta and Solo still recognize the power and importance of the Queen of theSouthern Seas, and offerings are made to her regularly.What the West can learn from Java and the Javanese is tolerance andacceptance—but also something deeper. Javanese religious and cultural life is ademonstration of the way in which an individual's spirituality can beaccommodated by the community, even in (or because of ) the apparentdiscontinuity of a culture in which monotheistic Islam is merged with Hindu andBuddhist beliefs and practices as well as indigenous religious ideas andrituals. This is a phenomenon that has been remarked upon by anthropologistslike Clifford Geertz, Neils Mulder, and Robert Hefner among others, and that hasattracted a steady stream of academics and researchers since the 1950s. What theWestern academic community often decries as “universalism” is a fact of lifeamong the Tantric temples of Java, where common ground is discovered andcelebrated in common—spiritual—denominators.That is not to say that there is no religious or sectarian violence inIndonesia. Far from it. There are old wounds in the archipelago that evenenlightened political and religious discourse cannot eradicate overnight. TheChinese in particular have been the object of racial and sectarian violence; sohave some of the Christian communities there. The ugliness of these attacks,which leave innocent people dead and maimed in the name of ideologies, cannot beignored or swept under the rug. The famous tolerant attitude of the citizens ofIndonesia can become undone in an instant, depending on the stressors involved.Yet, in the West, we have witnessed and still witness similar incidents ofracial violence directed at entire communities. Somehow, when it happens in atropical “third-world” country, it seems worse. Colonial ideas about savages andunholy rites rise to the foreground like old ghosts intent on haunting newhouses.It should be remembered, however, that the Republic of Indonesia is only aboutsixty years old. When the United States was of a similar age, Americans werekilling Native Americans with reckless abandon, held slaves, and were on theverge of a civil war. We can argue that times have changed and expect the restof the world to catch up to what Americans consider normal or acceptablebehavior, but that is naive. Instead, we should focus on the tremendous stridesthat Indonesia has accomplished in those sixty years since independence, andespecially in the years since the Reformasi (“Reform”) movement brought down thegovernment of President Suharto and ushered in an era of national soul-searchingand the lifting of sanctions against other religions and races. The resurgenceof popular expressions of Hinduism and Buddhism in Java is another example ofthe willingness of the Javanese to make room for alternate forms of religiouspractice and belief.This is not without controversy. The famous Pancasila edict of Sukarno made itmandatory that every Indonesian profess membership in one of six (originallyonly five) state-approved religions: Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism,Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. The state insisted that a belief in onegod and the possession of a sacred scripture were mandatory requirements for areligion to be considered acceptable. Also, the religion must be acceptedworld-wide— it must be a “world religion.” This has had the effect ofmarginalizing those Indonesians who are considered “animists” or “pagans” byWesterners, and has created a broad category of “nominal,” or abangan, Muslimswho still practice many rituals that are considered kejawen or “Javanese.” Ithas also created some discomfort among Buddhists (who have many scriptures andwho are not believers in one God) and among Hindus (whose have as manyscriptures as the Buddhists and who embrace the worship of more than one God).Confucians are another problematic category, for some of the same reasons. Andare Jehova's Witnesses considered “Protestant” under this law? For a long while,they were not.This requirement of belonging to one of the six approved religions has itsparallel in the imposition of Bahasa Indonesia, a derivative of the Javaneselanguage, as the national language. This is another means of trying to create anational identity—insisting on one language for all, even if it is not native tomillions of Indonesians. Was the motive behind this proclamation an attempt tode-emphasize or devalue the cultures and languages of Indonesians other than theJavanese (who are in the majority)? Some have thought so. By creating a somewhatartificial national language and insisting on membership in a limited number ofapproved religions, the new government is attempting to bring order into chaosand to create a sense of nationalism. The goal is certainly to eradicatepotential pockets of resistance and nonconformity, and to get everyone marchingin the same direction. Considering the Cold War mentality of the time, we canapprove or disapprove of these measures, but certainly now, they can berevisited and they probably will be.The Javanese attitude toward Tantra and tantroid ideas and practices is oneindication that Indonesia may provide a blueprint for tolerance that is notbased on a sterile legalistic approach to the phenomenon of multi-culturalism,but one that is the result of a common-sense, pragmatic attitude toward whatworks and what does not. That an enlightened view of sexuality that cuts acrossdenominational and sectarian lines will be one of the factors influencing suchan approach is suggested by the fallout from the recent Mount Merapi eruption ofOctober 2010.As thousands of villagers were forced to flee their homes and set up temporaryhousekeeping in shelters throughout Yogyakarta—a situation that lasted for weeksand then for months—an unusual request was made to the Indonesian authorities.Married couples were unable to have sex because of the crowded, publicconditions of the shelters. They asked that special accommodations be built sothat they could still enjoy a sex life even though they were living in exilefrom their villages.101The government acquiesced to their request.101 Antara, “Merapi Evacuees Yet To Take Advantage of Stress-Busting SexShacks,” Jakarta Globe, 24 November 2010."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARYLanguage key:A = ArabicB = Babylonian (also used here for Akkadian and Sumerian words)C = Chinese (Mandarin)D = DutchE = Ancient EgyptianF = FrenchG = GreekH = HebrewI = Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)J = JavaneseP = PaliS = SanskritT = TibetanPlease note: There are many ways to spell Javanese and Indonesian words.

Where logical, I will offer variant spellings of the sameword to make the transition between older and newer source material easier forthe reader.The same is true for Chinese. While Pinyin has standardized Romanization ofMandarin words, older texts use different orthography. Thus, Tao in the oldsystem equals Dao in the new.To complicate things further, many words in Indonesian come from Sanskrit,Arabic, and even Dutch and Portuguese sources. Often, the word survivesunchanged, such as the word for “teacher”: guru (from the Sanskrit).

The temples aretexts themselves, and are meant to be read as such. The Indian temples werealways intended to be instructive, and those of Java are no different. What mybook hopes to accomplish—in tandem with the other writers and scholars I havecited in these pages—is to help decode these texts or, at the very least,provide a means to allow the interested reader to do the same. Along thoselines, then, I can heartily recommend a direct, close, and personal reading ofeach of these temples by the reader. Indonesia is not that far away any more.The land is lovely, the people are friendly, tolerant, and helpful, and thetemples themselves will speak to you if you have the time or the inclination tolisten.Antara. “Merapi Evacuees Yet To Take Advantage of Stress-Busting Sex Shacks,”Jakarta Globe, Nov. 24, 2010.Arnold, Edward A., editor.

AUTHORPETER LEVENDA is the author of many works on esoteric subjects. His UnholyAlliance: A History of Nazi Involvement with the Occult bears a foreword byNorman Mailer and has been translated into six languages. Stairway to Heaven:Chinese Alchemists, Jewish Kabbalists, and the Art of Spiritual Transformationis a classic study of Merkavah or Chariot mysticism. The Secret Temple: Masons,Mysteries and the Founding of America is an excellent introduction to theMasonic Brotherhood. He is also the author of the three-volume study of theinfluence of esoterica on American politics, Sinister Forces: A Grimoire ofAmerican Political Witchcraft. While searching through the jungles of Java in2008, gathering material for Tantric Temples, Levenda came upon evidence of aNazi escape route that led from Europe to Argentina, Tibet, and eventuallyIndonesia. This research forms the substance for his newest book, Ratline:Soviet Spies, Nazi Priests, and the Disappearance of Adolph Hitler, alsopublished by Ibis Press."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/backcover1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Image [images/backcover.jpg]"}]
