Now shalt thou adore me who am the Eye and the Tooth, the Goat of theSpirit, the Lord of Creation. I am the Eye in the Triangle, the Silver Star thatye adore.18. I am Baphomet, that is the Eightfold Word that shall be equilibrated withthe Three.23. I am the hideous god, and who mastereth me is uglier than I.27. Whom I love I chastise with many rods.—Liber A'ash vel Capricorni PneumaticiTHIS IS A WORK OF HERESY, a book meant to challenge. What else would the readerexpect from that Dark Lord who inhabits the most primal and hidden depths of theunconscious? The Lord of the Shadow Realm, whose very existence has beenhysterically lambasted as an evil aberration, who has been conceived asblasphemous and terrifying since people first sat around campfires near theopenings to their caves, whose devotees have ever been feared and hunted. TheEnemy, the Other, the Adversary, He who inhabits the undiscovered territorywhich must be charted and mapped by any who wish to consider themselves worthyexplorers of the psyche. Lovecraft has warned us against these dark mysteries inthe most dramatic terms. Crowley assumed the mask of the Beast 666 to frightenaway the shy, the reticent, the cowardly. Kenneth Grant celebrated thisarchetype in an almost frenzied literary oeuvre that straddles the lines betweenscholarly discourse, imaginative fiction, and poetic invocation.In The Dark Lord, Peter Levenda, has, once again, applied his considerableerudition and creative mind and pen to the unity of various streams ofconsciousness. Describing what he calls “the tip of an eldritch iceberg,”Levenda posits a mystic alliance between the thematic content of the fiction ofH. P. Lovecraft and the magical writings of Aleister Crowley, and makes acompelling case for the confluence of events that existed in real time betweentheir efforts.Crowley is known as the Prophet of the New Aeon, inaugurated in 1904, thefounder of the magical system and religion of Thelema. His sweeping intellectand spiritual exaltation allowed him to explore and synthesize all the world'sthen-known sacred beliefs and practices and distill their essence into his ownsystem of Scientific Illuminism—the Method of Science, the Aim of Religion.Scientific Illuminism has proven to be a perfect paradigm for our modern world,in which images and information travel with the speed of the electron, and theestablished religions have become increasingly irrelevant.The dimensions explored by Lovecraft's fevered imagination continue to haunt andresonate in popular culture nearly a century later. Lovecraft's words andphantasms are a staple of derivative modern fiction, graphic novels, art, film,and music. The extraordinary popularity of Simon's Necronomicon (over onemillion copies in print since 1977!) is a case in point. The talented painter H.R. Geiger has brought Lovecraft's terrifying visions to life in his own artisticNecronomicon. The brilliant Australian artist Rosaleen Norton, whose compellingpainting of the Dark Lord is featured on the jacket of this book, was anotheradept of the Darkly Splendid Worlds.Kenneth Grant, the British writer and occultist, shared Levenda's fascinationwith both Crowley and Lovecraft. Grant is celebrated the world over for hisbiographies of Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare—who each served asteachers and guides to the young magician. Yet it is Grant's writing on theTyphonian Gnosis that captures Levenda's attention in these pages. Grant'sembrace of the hidden byways of imagery and symbolism, and the obscure andantinomian practices of widely divergent peoples the world over, evoke thedarker dimensions of the shadow-self of humankind.Levenda conducts a veritable symphony with strains of religious and esotericknowledge as he explores the roots of the beliefs and doctrines Crowley utilizedto develop his system of Thelema. The reader may expect to be introduced to Yogaand Buddhism, Tantra and Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Alchemy, and Egyptology,Confucianism, Daoism, and Afro-Caribbean magic, as well as the more-familiarJudaism, Christianity, and Islam. You will walk through ancient Sumerian templesof the third millennium BCE, participate in the magical circles of thenineteenth century Golden Dawn, and witness contemporary rites of the TyphonianOrder. You will learn details about the shadow side of myth that never quitemade it into your copy of Larousse or Bullfinch. Nor is Levenda's discussion ofTantra what your mother understood as the ritual of the “five M's.”This book will be of interest to people across a variety of disciplines. Fans ofLovecraft will find his worldview explored in ways that may shock or frighten.They will learn that Lovecraft's fearful fantasies may have a greater connectionto reality than they might have hoped. Certainly, readers of Kenneth Grant willbe delighted to have the mysteries of his writings made more clear by Levenda'spenetrating explication and high regard for Grant. One can imagine Grant himselfsmiling with satisfaction in the Field of Reeds as he reviews Levenda's analysisof the complex ideas he worked so hard to communicate during his lifetime.Students of Crowley are in for a whirlwind ride of speculation, insight,historical, mythic, and spiritual associations that will enlighten andentertain, as they may also stimulate intense disagreement. (Since Levendadiscusses The Book of the Law quite openly, those with the strongest objectionsare free to identify him as a “centre of pestilence” and thereby recover theirserenity.) In my opinion, there is more here for Thelemites to learn than toreject.Peter Levenda and I have known each other for so long our hair was jet blackwhen we met. Larry Barnes, the publisher of the Necronomicon, introduced me toSimon, the book's translator and editor, in 1977. Larry proposed that I designand produce the book for Schlangekraft/Barnes Graphics. This would become myfirst project in Studio 31. Simon introduced me to Peter, who acted as hisliterary agent and production editor: proofreading various iterations of thetypography and dealing with the ever-frenetic Larry. Yes, Simon meticulouslyscrutinized the seals we had commissioned to be redrawn for publication based onhis original and precise felt-tip pen renderings. Simon also paid particularattention to proofing the language of the spells themselves. But Peter handledthe bread and butter day-to-day progress of the book. This was well before thedays of personal computers so Simon's manuscript needed to be totally retyped bythe typesetters, a process offering limitless possibilities for errors. We wereall very busy indeed.Unlike Peter, I am a member of what he refers to as the “Caliphate” O.T.O. (Icall it “the O.T.O.”) To be fair to the storm of critics who may question mypresence in these pages, let me begin by saying that Peter is my friend.Furthermore, he is one of the best researchers into the world's religions on theliterary scene today. His Stairway to Heaven and Tantric Temples are two of myfavorites of his books. His quest for human dignity forced him to also look intosome of the darkest political conspiracies of our time, such as those recordedin Ratline, his recently-published history of the Nazi escape routes followingGermany's defeat in World War II. I am thus honored to play a small part in TheDark Lord, despite the fact that Peter and I may part company on a number ofimportant issues.However, when a religion or creed is successful, it opens itself to a broaderexposure and discussion in the wider culture. Certain forms of doctrinalexegesis may, of necessity, be confined to those who identify themselves mostclosely with the specific writings and magical system under discussion. Butaspects of the system will make their appearance in literature, music, art, andphilosophy in an “unsupervised” manner. While some will undoubtedly rejectexcursions by those outside the confines of established orthodoxy, such thinkingmay well herald the death of innovation and the establishment of dogmaticrigidity.One conclusion that is inescapable here is that the author brings muchintelligence to his subject. He shares his vast scholarship of the religioustraditions of all times and places in his exploration of the congruence of thearchetype vibrated and celebrated by Aleister Crowley, popularized and feared byHoward Phillips Lovecraft, and researched and embraced by Kenneth Grant. Here isa book to study and explore, to weigh and consider, one that will serve as abasis for additional study, exploration, and discussion. It is also a book toenjoy. The author is an excellent writer with a subtle wit and sense of humorthat have become his literary trademarks.The Dark Lord presents perhaps the most compelling and encyclopedic compilationof this archetype—the nightmare figure of humanity's earliest and mostpersistent childhood fears.Yet, at the end (and this is the point) when we do at last encounter Him, whowill we meet but ourselves?15. I have hidden myself beneath a mask: I am a black and terrible God.16. With courage conquering fear shall ye approach me: ye shall lay down yourheads upon mine altar, expecting the sweep of the sword.17. But the first kiss of love shall be radiant on your lips; and all mydarkness and terror shall turn to light and joy.—Liber Tzaddi vel Hamus Hermeticus"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONTHE BEAST IN THE CAVEThe creature I had killed, the strange beast of the unfathomed cave, was, or hadat one time been a MAN!!!1 [part0005.html#aft1]AS IS PROBABLY WELL-KNOWN to readers of this study, Crowley was in Cairo in thespring of 1904 when he received The Book of the Law.What is not so well known is that—during the very same period—a young man ofhigh school age was composing a short story, one of his earliest, and it wouldreflect so completely a vision that was experienced thousands of miles away atthe same time that the coincidence is indeed uncanny.The writer was H. P. Lovecraft, considered by many to be the father of themodern gothic horror story. And this early attempt at writing supernaturalfiction was entitled “The Beast in the Cave.”As we know, Crowley called himself the Beast, and identified with the Beast inthe Book of Revelation. In Lovecraft's story—written when he was only fourteenyears old—the Beast is at first thought to be some sort of monster living in thebowels of the earth but is instead revealed to be a human being—a man.As Lovecraft's stories often involve dream communications and the transmissionof information by psychic means or through the visions of artists and othersensitive souls, could it be possible that Lovecraft—an artist himself, ofcourse, as a writer of imaginative fiction—“picked up” the events of Cairo thatwere taking place at the very same time he was composing and writing his storyabout a Beast who was really a man? As outlandish as this suggestion may seem,it is reinforced by further evidence in Lovecraft's own stories, as we shallsee. But before we dive into the strange and otherworldly material of Lovecraft,Crowley, and the British occultist Kenneth Grant, we should set the stage forwhat is to follow.There are two sides to existence, to life itself. There is a bright side, wherewe live and work every day; and there is a dark side, what Kenneth Grant callsthe “nightside” of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.Spies know this. Criminals and the police who fight them know this. Sexualpredators know this. Serial killers know this. Business people know this.Politicians know this.And occultists know this.Everyone who has a secret they desperately want kept secret knows this.There is a dark side to everything from politics to religion. And it is in thedark side that the most tangible, the most basic elements of life can be found.The prima materia. The fons et origo. One cannot truly know life without knowingthe dark side, without peering into its depths, for it is in the dark side thatseeds are planted, that sustenance is taken, that dreams are born and take rootin the damp recesses of the sunken cellar of the human soul: the cave whereinthe Beast resides, the Beast that is—as Lovecraft tells us—a Man.In average human beings, this dark side is to be found in their unconsciousminds, unrecognized and unacknowledged without extensive depth analysis (theterm “depth” is instructive); but its impulse can be sensed in their darkestconscious desires, the ones they keep secret from society at large and fromtheir closest loved ones. It is not only sexuality, although sex can be thedoorway to knowing the dark side. Freud knew this. Wilhelm Reich knew this. Jungknew this and trembled at its power. Kabbalists knew this, and called it theSitra Ahra, the realm of the damaged gods they called the qlippoth. TheTantrikas know this. And Kenneth Grant knew this.In our lives today we have been ceding the territory of our unconscious littleby little: to reality television, to social networking sites, to CCTV cameras onevery street corner, to our credit card transactions, to vulgarity in cinema andentertainment generally, to even casual use of the Internet. Electronicdatabases may know more about our lives and our desires than we can rememberourselves. Profiles can be established that delineate our personalities andplumb the depths of our unconscious using clever algorithms that manipulate theelectronic trails we leave behind in our passage through cyberspace—likeelectromagnetic snails on silicon glass. In this environment it becomes harderand harder to function secretly, either as members of secret societies or asindividuals. (Are there any true secret societies left; any society that has thematurity to avoid broadcasting itself on the Internet?) Our inner lives are indanger of being ripped open, a process that began in the 1950s when some G-scaledoctors and imbecilic psychiatrists pried open the black box of consciousnesslike sorcerers's apprentices in a Grade-B horror film.Perhaps it began even earlier, at the dawn of the twentieth century, in a smallapartment in Cairo where an English couple were spending their honeymooncruising the Nile, visiting museums, and talking to gods.This is a dark science, this occultism of the nightside. The word “occult” means“secret,” “hidden,” “dark.” There is no occultism without darkness. There is noreligion without darkness, either, but that is one of the secrets that religionkeeps to itself. Religions are of the daylight, of the Sun, of society andcommunity, of public rituals and private anxieties. But any religion that speaksonly of the Sun and its Light is lying: to others and to itself.For religion is nothing more than the refuge of failed magicians.We erect edifices of ritual and dogma against the darkness and call it faith,call it religion. But the most useful element of any religion is its ability toexorcise demons. It is a practical ability, one with observable and measureableresults. Everything else, all sacraments, depend on faith and the suspension ofdisbelief: penance, baptism, Holy Orders, Extreme Unction, matrimony, even HolyCommunion. But a possessed person is a fact, and the successful exorcism of thedemon is another fact. Many otherwise lukewarm individuals have been brought tothe faith after having witnessed demonic possession. It is a great recruitingtool for the Church, if nothing else. Sacraments may bind one to the community,reinforce the bonds between the individual and the group. They are rituals ofidentity. But exorcism ... well, that's another story. Exorcism is not asacrament. It's a tool, something useful, something with an easily definablemission. It is the place within religion where true magic lies, as if in wait.It is the essential contradiction in religion, this axis of possession andexorcism, of cause and effect. It is the strongest connection in religion toancient knowledge of the dark side of human experience. It reveals what religionwants kept hidden. Secret. Occult.Thelema calls itself a new religion, and at the heart of this new religion isthe very darkness of which we speak. There is a general desire among somebelievers to represent Thelema as a religion of the Sun, of the ancient Egyptiandeities Osiris, Isis and Horus, of Thoth and Sekhmet.But it is not.As we shall see, the very creed of the Gnostic Mass—the ritual designed to bethe public face of Thelema to the world—speaks of a god called Chaos. And Chaosis the code-word for Set.The Dark Lord.The interrelationship of the concepts Tutulu, Cthulhu, Oz, Zaa, Yezid, AL, L,Nu-Isis, etc., demonstrates unequivocally the essential identity of theNecronomicon (555) and the Therionic (666) Currents. Oz as the Manifesto andManifestation of Man are equated in the Necronomicon Gnosis: “The Power of Manis the Power of the Ancient Ones. And this is the Covenant.”—Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 14The above correspondences link irrefragibly the Necronomicon, Kamite, andThelemic currents, showing the three strands as a continual linear development,in both a chronological and a magical sense.—Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 92In the above two citations from the work of Kenneth Grant we are faced with abold—if outlandish—concept.Grant—the late head of the Typhonian Order in England and an intimate ofAleister Crowley—has insisted throughout many books that the magical currentrepresented by Crowley's Thelema and that represented specifically by the“Schlangekraft recension” of the Necronomicon (sometimes referred to as the“Simonomicon”) are not only compatible but in fact are identical. He refers tothe Necronomicon Gnosis—a system representative of not only the Necronomiconitself but also of the stories that fall under the heading of the “CthulhuMythos” and which include works by H.P. Lovecraft as well as by his friends andimitators—as a credible magical doctrine and practice. He makes numerousreferences to Lovecraft, Cthulhu, and the Necronomicon throughout his laterworks in order to substantiate and justify his position on themes as disparateas the magical methods of Austin Osman Spare, the UFO phenomenon, the visions ofCrowley, Jack Parsons, and Charles Stansfeld Jones (Frater Achad),Afro-Caribbean cults, Tantric rituals, and much, much more.What does all this mean?Thelema is a Greek word meaning “will” and was used by Crowley to refer to hisnew religion, one developed through the practice of magic (or “magick” as hepreferred to spell the word in order to differentiate it from other forms), andestablished upon the concept that the world is entering a major new phase ofspiritual evolution, a phase he called the Aeon of Horus. The previous age wasthe Aeon of Osiris: the slain and resurrected god that prefigured that of Mithraand of Jesus, among others. The age before that was the matriarchal Aeon ofIsis. The present Aeon of Horus is to be the age of the Child: the offspring ofIsis and Osiris, and thus a Magickal Child.The seminal text of this new religion is the Book of the Law—or Liber AL velLegis to give it its Latin title—received by Crowley in a series ofcommunications obtained in Cairo, Egypt in April of 1904. In order to promulgatehis new faith, Crowley enlisted the aid of a German secret society called theOrdo Templi Orientis or Order of the Eastern Temple. This Order exists today inseveral forms and on virtually every continent. It is comprised of a series ofdegrees of initiation, and its members are called Thelemites, or followers ofThelema. The Order rituals are based on the idea that the Knights Templar of theCrusader era formed a kind of alliance with a Muslim secret society from whichthey obtained initiations. Indeed, today the Islamic influence is felt not onlyin some of the Order rituals but also in the fact that the American-basedversion of the Order often is referred to as the “Caliphate”—a word that is usedin Islam to describe the legitimate successors to the Prophet Muhammad.This is not so strange as it may appear. The theme of European mystics going tothe Middle East to obtain secret knowledge is an old one and can be seen in theorigin legend of the Rosicrucians (Christian Rosenkreutz, their putativefounder, went to the Middle East in search of wisdom). The German founders ofthe Ordo Templi Orientis itself also claimed to have visited Muslim lands wherethey obtained secret initiations. It has been shown by historians that HelenaBlavatsky herself—the founder of the Theosophical Society—had links to theBrotherhood of Luxor, an Egyptian-based secret society. Thus, this is atradition among European occultists that has a long pedigree.The Necronomicon—the grimoire or magician's workbook to which Kenneth Grantrefers in his writings—also has a Middle Eastern pedigree. According to thestories created by gothic horror author H. P. Lovecraft, the book was written bya “Mad Arab” in the eighth century CE. It contains themes and invocations thatare the heirs of a Sumerian tradition: the same tradition that Crowley claimedto be rediscovering in his own magical development. Indeed, the Englishtranslation of the Necronomicon is dedicated to Crowley himself.Thus of the two basic texts to which Kenneth Grant refers in his books onThelema—The Book of the Law, and the Necronomicon—the first was received inEgypt, and the second has its origins in Mesopotamia.The Middle East is the birthplace of the three great monotheistic religions:Judaism, Christianity and Islam—sometimes called the Abrahamic religions aftertheir common ancestor, the prophet Abraham. But is also where some of theworld's oldest recorded religions were born, millenia before the birth of Moses,the founder of the Jewish faith: the Egyptian religion with its plethora of godsand goddesses ... the religions of Sumer and Akkad and Babylon ... and of someeven stranger cults, as we shall see.This insistence on ancient origins is a key factor in reading Grant. In fact,Grant is not satisfied with the antiquity of even these religions but points toan older, more distant, set of ancestors. Even ancient Egypt—the “Kamite” of thesecond quotation given earlier, is not old enough. The oldest—in Grant'schronology—is that of the Necronomicon and of its associated Sumerian Tradition.To Grant (as well as to Crowley) the tradition that is represented by Thelemahad its origins in Sumer, and from Sumer to Egypt, and from there to AleisterCrowley's stunning communications with an alien intelligence in Cairo in 1904.There is another element to Grant's thesis that is difficult to overlook, andthat is the importance he places on sexuality as a method to be employed for theevocation of these dark powers and as a means of entering the mysterious realmhe calls the “Mauve Zone.” His liberal use of Tantric terms and concepts is ahallmark of Grant's work, and his intimations that unorthodox forms of sexualcongress be employed towards magical ends is a theme that runs through hisbooks. There has been much nonsense written about “sex magic” in the literatureof the New Age; Grant's specific descriptions of the complex psycho-sexualprocesses involved should make it clear that “sex magic” does not mean normalcoitus performed while meditating or burning scented candles. The fact that theOrdo Templi Orientis itself is considered to be a repository of this type ofinformation should make one aware that a more sophisticated if not morestrenuous approach to the use of sexuality in ritual is required.That said, Kenneth Grant has been criticized by occultists and members ofvarious Orders for a number of reasons. In the first place, he once claimed tobe the head of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) upon the death of previouschief (actually the Order's treasurer) Karl Germer. This was hotly contested bythe American (Grady McMurtry) branch of the Order known as the “Caliphate.” Inthe end, Grant decided that the title wasn't worth the fight although many ofhis fans considered him to have been the rightful heir to the throne. Instead,he founded what he called the Typhonian Order: a magical group more in line withthe discoveries he and his followers were making and which was based on theidentification of Typhon2 [part0005.html#aft2]—the Dark Lord—as the operativePower of what he termed the “Mauve Zone” on the hidden side of the KabbalisticTree of Life and the place from whence all true magical power originates.In the second place, Grant was in many ways his own worst enemy when it came toexplaining his doctrines. His works are impossible to understand unless one hasa deep grounding in Kabbalah, Asian religions, Afro-Caribbean religions,Egyptology, and the rituals and grade structures of the Golden Dawn, the OrdoTempli Orientis, and the Argentum Astrum ... to name just a few. Hisgematria—the system of Kabbalistic analysis that uses numerological equivalentsfor Hebrew (and Greek) letters—is off the charts, and so internally inconsistentthat it seems more like stream of consciousness than it does numerical ornumerological evidence. To read Grant is to become aware that he is notcommunicating in a linear, methodical fashion but after the style of a JamesJoyce: magic as art, art as magic.Nevertheless, there is buried in the heavy text of Grant's hypothesis a profoundand passionate belief in what he is saying and what he has discovered. Andrightly so: for if what Grant says is in any way “true,” our entire perspectiveon human history will have to be reconsidered from a terrifying vantage point.For what Grant is saying is that all religions and especially all antinomiancults have their origin in a single cult, a single magical order, that has itsorigin not on earth but in the stars.It is this belief—this discovery—that finds itself in line with the most cynicalof Lovecraft's horror stories concerning a race of alien beings that oncecolonized our planet and which will come again to reclaim it, a race whosereligion is the mother of all cults.And it is this belief—this doctrine—that finds itself hidden within many of themost important texts of Aleister Crowley's Thelema.It is at the heart of the current fascination with “ancient aliens” and “alienarchaeology” and all those Discovery Channel and History Channel specials aboutthe theories of von Danniken and Zecharia Sitchin, for example. It is central tofears about the coming of the Antichrist, the prophecies of Nostradamus, and thechiliastic panic about the Mayan calendar and the end of the year 2012.Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups, andscholars suspected of connection with nameless bands of abhorrent elder worldhierophants. These rumors, though never proved at the time, were doubtlessstimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading ...3 [part0005.html#aft3]The purpose of this book is to deconstruct and decode the works of Kenneth Grantas much as possible, at least insofar as the Necronomicon Gnosis and theTyphonian Current are concerned. To do justice to the entire Grant ouevre wouldbe a major task outside the scope of this work. What we will do instead is tryto understand how the Necronomicon Gnosis fits in with the Thelemic Current, andhow both of these together inform Grant's Typhonian hypothesis.Before we begin, however, it is necessary to address three important points:In the first place, the author is not a member of the OTO or, indeed, of anymagical order or group and never has been. His previous membership in variouschurches of the “wandering bishop” classification is public knowledge, includingat least one church that gave apostolic succession to the Gnostic CatholicChurch: an auxiliary branch of the OTO. But that is as far as the associationgoes. Therefore nothing the author writes about here is to be consideredofficial OTO doctrine nor does it have the blessing, nihil obstat, or imprimaturof that or any Order.In the second place, there has been much drama over the Simon Necronomicon, mostof which concerns the identity of Simon himself rather than the substance of thebook. Simon has addressed these issues in his own Dead Names: The Dark Historyof the Necronomicon, and I have addressed them in various interviews over theyears. One may or may not believe in the “reality” of the Necronomicon; what isgermane to this book is the fact that Kenneth Grant—an occultist, occult author,and occult leader of no small importance—found the book essential reading andtook it very, very seriously indeed.In the third and final place, many of the issues we will discuss will beconsidered anathema or heretical by doctrinaire Thelemites—such as the works ofFrater Achad, A. O. Spare, and even Jack Parsons. While “normative” Thelema (ifby that we mean the OTO of the Grady McMurtry line) may be likened to theofficial Church, it is possible that later generations will consider thewritings of Frater Achad, Spare, and Parsons (among others, and possiblyincluding the works of Necronomicon editor Simon himself) to be “gnostic”versions of the official gospels, much the way one approaches the Nag Hammaditexts or the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is not my place to defend any of these ideason doctrinal grounds. Indeed, in that I have little or no interest. My usage ofthem in this place only reflects Grant's own incorporation of them in hisGnosis, and should be taken to reflect no agenda of my own.With these caveats in mind, then, let us proceed to an investigation of one ofthe most-neglected theses in the history of modern occultism: the nature of theTyphonian Current and its relationship to Aleister Crowley's Thelema and H. P.Lovecraft's Necronomicon.Let us approach the throne of the Dark Lord.Image [../images/00002.jpeg]The Tree of Life.

Lovecraft,had his own idea about Aeons: that they represented enormous lengths of time,and that the contemplation of them (and what life-forms may have evolved duringthem) would drive a normal person insane, as would the contemplation of the vastdistances of space between the Earth and the stars. Yet, as with Crowley, hewrote that in certain cases, and with certain Aeons, “even death may die,” orwill result, as Crowley wrote, in “the destruction of the principle of death.”This conquering of death has been a focus of virtually every major religion inthe last five or six millenia (probably beginning with the Egyptians). Thisrepresents hope for Crowley but absolute horror for Lovecraft; for if death isovercome for some, it would be overcome for all: mass murderers, serial killers,fiendish dictators ... and the anthropoid monsters of the writer's feverishimagination.Thus we should begin with a look at the concept of the Aeon. It has been afractious subject among Thelemites for one of Crowley's colleagues had proposeda different schema for the Aeons, one that would have reduced Crowley's ownstructure significantly. Also, the idea that the end of the world is near—videthe Mayan calendar, the Nostradamus prophecies, and other chiliasticconcerns—lends more significance to any discussion of the Aeons, the New Age,and the astronomical ideas they represent.Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) claimed to be the Prophet of the new age, the Aeonof Horus, and the Book of the Law its scripture. Received over the course ofthree afternoons in Cairo, Egypt in April of 1904, Crowley himself rejected itat first. Some of the language is offensive, particularly when it comes todescribing the world's great religions. The vehemence with which Christianity,Islam, Buddhism, etc are denigrated seems far from what we have come to expectof spiritual literature. However, a re-read of the first few books of the Biblewould be educational in this regard, for the God of the Jews was just asvehement in his attack on all other gods, all other religions. A re-read of theBook of Revelations (also known as the Apocalypse) would reinforce thisimpatience of the God of Christians and Jews with any and all other forms ofreligious expression. This vehemence was often backed up with military force,and the massacres of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children was thebloody result. Thus the anger and hatred for earlier faiths shown in the Book ofthe Law is consistent with Old and New Testament attitudes, if nothing else, andseems of a piece with the contemporary world's religious polarization.The structure of the Book of the Law is that of three chapters, each devoted toa different Egyptian deity or deities and each represented as the speech of thatdeity via a praeterhuman intelligence or spiritual intermediary called Aiwass, abeing that Crowley later claimed was his Holy Guardian Angel. This occurred as aseries of inspired or channeled scriptures over the course of those three daysfrom April 8 to 10, 1904. The readings began after Crowley's wife—RoseKelly—alerted Crowley to the immediacy of the contact during a visit to theBoulaq Museum in Cairo on the vernal equinox that year, at which time she drewhis attention to a stele numbered 666, now known to the faithful as the “Steleof Revealing.” This particular stele was a burial plaque for a priest of theEgyptian god Mentu. The priest's name was Ankh-ef-en-khonsu. Each session tookplace in their apartment between the hours of 12 and 1 pm. (It is possible thatthe dictations occurred at the precise hour of the mid-day call to prayer, andthat they would have heard the muezzin's cry outside their hotel room windowright before, during or after the séance.)It could be considered natural that the scripture would have an Egyptiancoloration, considering all the external circumstances. However, the characterof Crowley's own previous initiations into a British secret society known as theGolden Dawn would also have an impact on the terminology (if not the philosophy)of the text as we will see. So what we will look at first in this chapter is thenature of the “Egyptology” of the Book of the Law and its relation to theconcept of the Aeons."},{"pageContent":"EGYPTIAN TRINITIESThe three chapters are the utterances of the Egyptian gods Nuit, Hadit, andRa-Hoor-Khuit (respectively). Structurally, this seems consistent with Egyptianpractice. The Egyptian religion contains many such “trinities” of supreme godsat the head of the various pantheons. One of the oldest is that of Ptah, Sekhmetand Nefertum; another would be that of Amun, Mut and Khonsu. The most famous isperhaps that of Osiris, Isis and Horus. In each case, we are presented with amale god, a female goddess, and a child god. In other words, a nuclear family.We rarely, if ever, come across this type of configuration in the Tantricpantheons of Tibet and India, for instance, where the emphasis is usually on amale and a female deity; while there are offspring of these unions, they arerarely depicted as a family unit in the way of the Egyptian examples.However, the trinity Nuit/Hadit/Ra-Hoor-Khuit is not a typical one in Egyptiantexts. Nuit is a star goddess and the mother of Set and Nephthys.Hadit—according to the Book of the Law and to Crowley's subsequent writings—iseither a star within that empyrean or a solar disk; as the sun is a star this isnot as inconsistent as it might appear. The third god, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, has muchmore in common with forms of Horus—offspring of Isis and Osiris—rather than withany conceivable union of Nuit and the lesser-known Hadit (which is itself a formof Horus). We may venture to say that this combination is unique to Crowley andto the Book of the Law.Yet, there is another deity specifically mentioned in the scripture, and that isKhonsu. Crowley, in his role as scribe of Aiwass and of the gods, is given thetitle Ankh af-n-Khonsu after the name of the priest whose burial plaque was theStele of Revealing. The two terms ankh and Khonsu bear some furtherinvestigation.Ankh, of course, is the iconic symbol of the Egyptian idea of immortality. Theword ankh means “life” and is found on temples and tombs everywhere in Egyptwith the associated idea of immortality and life after death. Egyptian pharaohsas well as deities are often depicted holding an ankh, sometimes also called thecrux ansata or “cross with handle.”Khonsu, however, may not be as well known. It is the name of another child god,sacred to the moon. This god was usually depicted in mummified form, but withthe lock of hair on the right side of his head typical of Egyptian children ofancient times. This is used to emphasize the youth of the god with theimplication that he is pre-pubescent. His mother was Mut (not to be confusedwith Maat), a self-created mother goddess whose symbols were the vulture and thelion and whose name means “mother.” In northern Egypt, she became identifiedwith the lion goddess Sekhmet and, at various times, with the cat goddess Bast.Khonsu's father was Amun (sometimes Amen or Amoun), the mysterious self-createdgod of whom Ra was often considered to be the external image, hence thecomposite form Amun-Ra.While Khonsu was a lunar deity, and often depicted as a child, he also hadwarrior tendencies in the Egyptian religion. He was believed to be a defender ofthe king, who destroyed his enemies by removing their internal organs andpresenting them to the king for nourishment. This odd mythologem gave rise toone epithet of Khonsu as the “king's placenta” and, indeed, he later becameidentified with childbirth (just as Set would later be identified withmiscarriage and abortion).This idea of Khonsu as the king's defender shares some ideas in common withHorus, who avenged the murder of his father, Osiris. Often, Khonsu is depictedwith a hawk's head—recalling Horus explicitly—with a lunar disk and crescentabove it to identify him more carefully with the moon, as opposed to the moresolar aspect of Horus. In addition, Khonsu was also depicted in a verysuggestive way at his temple in Karnak: as “a ram-headed snake who fertilizedthe cosmic egg.”4 [part0006_split_003.html#aft4] This identification of Khonsuwith the Cosmic Egg of creation will have resonance later, as the vision of theEgg comes to play in the Amalantrah Working of Crowley and associates,5[part0006_split_003.html#aft5] as well as with the “Blue Egg of Harpocrates” inthe rituals of the Golden Dawn.But it is the presentation of Khonsu as a child that has relevance for the Bookof the Law. Khonsu is referred to in Egyptian mythology as the “Moon Child,”which would become the title of one of Aleister Crowley's novels. This sameimage—of a child god—is found in the statues and bas-reliefs of Harpocrates, aform of Horus and, indeed, this form is mentioned in the Book of the Law severaltimes.6 [part0006_split_003.html#aft6] Crowley, as a “priest of Khonsu”deliberately makes the association with a child-god who is also a martial deity,a defender of the king. In the case of Khonsu's father—Amun—we have thearchetype of the “Hidden God” that figures so prominently in the work of KennethGrant and to which we will return from time to time.The first chapter of the Book of the Law consists of the words of Nuit, thegoddess of the night sky, who is often depicted with her feet in the west, herhands in the east, and her body thus gracefully arched over the earth, anddotted with stars.The second chapter reveals the words of Hadit, the Heru-Behdeti of the Egyptianpantheon, called Haidith in Greek. Hadit was recruited by Thoth (the Egyptiangod of magic, writing, and wisdom) to assist Horus in the latter's famous battlewith Set. Hadit represents a single point of light, a single star in theempyrean of Nuit. If Nuit is visualized as a circle, then Hadit would be thepoint in the center. In the Thelemic universe Nuit and Hadit also may representdifferent forms or ideas about infinity, perhaps infinite expansion and infinitecontraction respectively.The third chapter consists of the revelation of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, or Ra-Herakhty inGreek recension. This is a deity composed of two different ideas: Ra and Horus.The translation of Ra-Herakhty is “Ra, Horus on the Horizon.” Thus there is thesense that Ra—the quintessential Sun god of the Egyptians—manifests as Horuswhen on the horizon, i.e., when the sun is rising or setting. Horus is the sonof Osiris and Isis and is the god who battled Set (in one version of the story)to avenge his father's murder. Thus, there is the implication that the identityof Horus is inextricably linked to his parentage, and that Horus's purpose asthe Avenging Son thus connects him eternally with Set: a union not of love, butof war. This “unity” of Horus with Set is an idea that Crowley embraced andwhich appears several times in his published work.7[part0006_split_003.html#aft7] Ra-Hoor-Khuit is mentioned frequently throughoutall three chapters of the Book of the Law, and is obviously the focal point ofthe scripture.It is thus Horus—and especially the form of Ra-Hoor-Khuit—who will occupy mostof the attention of Thelema, for he is the symbol of the New Aeon that replacesthe earlier Aeon of Osiris. However, there is a darker—more mysterious and tosome an extraterrestrial—aspect to the New Aeon, and it concerns theintermediary between Crowley and the gods of the Book of the Law: the entityknown variously as Aiwaz or Aiwass.Crowley himself referred to this being as Set-Aiwass or Shaitan-Aiwass in someof his writings,8 [part0006_split_003.html#aft8] thus linking it with both theEgyptian god of “Evil”—Set or Seth—and with the Middle Eastern name for God's(or humanity's) “Adversary”: Shaitan, more popularly known as Satan (but“reclaimed” by the Mesopotamian sect of the Yezidis in a rehabilitated form,about which more later). This refers to a very early, predynastic (i.e.,3500-3000 BCE), form of Egyptian religion that identified Set as a god of thedesert, of storms, and of rage. Much later, the Greeks at the time of thehistorian Herodotus (c. 484-425 BCE) identified Set with their own sea monster,Typhon. (It was this Typhon that gave its name to Kenneth Grant's new form ofThelema, the Typhonian Order, representing what he called the Typhonian/StellarCurrent.) Set was also said to reside in the Great Bear constellation, andserved to aid the souls of the dead to attain immortality by allowing them toclimb Set's “stairway to heaven.”9 [part0006_split_003.html#aft9] Like mostEgyptian deities, Set originally had both a positive and a negative nature butin the end the negative aspect of the god won out due to popular attribution. Asthe sworn enemy of Horus, Set was seen as the eternal Evil One and the murdererof Horus's father, Osiris. He was also said to have been born unnaturally,ripping himself through the belly of his mother, the sky goddess Nut or Nuit whofigures so prominently in the Crowley scriptures. Thus, he could be seen as aninitiatory force.Indeed, Set's role in the New Aeon could be described as that of the GrandInitiator of humanity. However, this type of initiation will be violent andimposed from outside, rather than the relatively serene form experienced byCrowley himself during his sojourn with the considerably more sedate GoldenDawn. We can see this type of violent and involuntary initiation prefigured inthe psychological experiments of the world's intelligence agencies beginning inthe 1950s with the phenomenon of the “Manchurian Candidate” of the Korean Warera that contributed to the creation of mind control, behavior control, andpsychological warfare programs that sought to unpack the secrets of the humanmind by using unsuspecting innocent men, women and children as test subjects andguinea pigs.10 [part0006_split_003.html#aft10]Thus we have a rather paradoxical relationship in which Set-Aiwass communicatesthe text of the Aeon of Horus (his sworn enemy) to Crowley in Cairo. Crowleyelevated the status of Set far above that which obtained in dynastic Egypt, andsaw in Set the type of force necessary to bring in the new Aeon. This may beconsidered an “initiated” view of traditional Egyptology which understands Setand Horus as implacable foes. If the myths concerning Set were little more thanlibels created by followers of the newer gods Osiris and Horus, what was thetruth? What did Set really represent, and what is Set's relationship to the Aeonof Horus?As Crowley's understanding of the Book of the Law matured, so did hisunderstanding of Aiwaz, whom he declared to be none other than his Holy GuardianAngel11 [part0006_split_003.html#aft11]: a concept developed by the Golden Dawn,the secret society that had initiated him into magic. The Holy Guardian Angel orHGA can be conceived of as one's “Higher Self” or as the apotheosis of one's ownspiritual identity; conversely, one's self is seen as a manifestation (one amongmany) of the Angel. In Crowley's case, he viewed Aiwaz to be one of the gods ofancient Sumer, thus pre-existing the Egyptian civilization and their oldestknown divinity, the desert god Set, who might then be considered an avatar oremanation of the original Sumerian archetype.In addition, Crowley proposed a composite Set-Horus “current” that wouldrepresent the combined tension of the two antagonists as a single forceemblematic of the New Aeon. This was typical of Crowley's tinkering with theknown Egyptology of the day. It did not reflect any new discoveries in thefield, but was rather informed by his occult insight into the play of spiritualforces represented by “god forms” and ideas associated with the Egyptian gods inthe consciousness of the Western mind of the early twentieth century. As we haveseen, he also combined Set, Shaitan and Aiwaz into a single concept representingnot only his own HGA but also a deity or devil from the little-knowncivilization of Sumer.12 [part0006_split_003.html#aft12] Thus, we have theEgyptian Set, the Semitic Shaitan, and a Sumerian god identified only by theword Aiwaz or Aiwass—which has no meaning in the Sumerian language—all lumpedtogether without regard for individual religious or social contexts. From thepoint of view of mainstream religious studies or anthropology—especiallypostmodern anthropology—this is a car wreck of a proportion equivalent to amajor highway pile-up.It is perhaps relevant to point out at this juncture that one cannot refer toany of Crowley's writings as representative of formal Egyptological theory orresearch. Crowley is not an academic source for this type of material. Rather,he was an interpreter of the Egyptological discoveries of his day, such as thoseby Gaston Maspero (1846-1916) and most especially of the amateur EgyptologistGerald Massey (1828-1907), whose fanciful—and esoterically-oriented—descriptionsof the ancient world were never taken seriously by mainstream archaeologists butwhich were embraced by occultists. The theories of Massey still exert animportant influence over occult authors today, regardless of the fact that theyare considered in error (at best) or wholly imaginary (at worst).Crowley's interpretations—like those of Massey—were freeform, conforming to hisown experiences as an occultist and magician. The occultism of the nineteenthand early twentieth centuries largely was indebted to universalist ideas of“common origins,” a worldview which in its extreme form took as a given theexistence of an Ur-cult or Ur-religion in the remote past that provided theinspiration and basis for all future cults. Thus, the religions of Sumer andEgypt had a source in common with those of India and China, and even the Aztecand Mayan religions of Latin America. Symbols that were discovered in severalvastly different locales—such as the Dragon—were believed to represent a single,common idea regardless of whether the Dragon symbol was carved on a stone blockin England or seen on a porcelain fragment in China. This idea—that same orsimilar symbols were evidence of a single belief or cultural phenomenon—wastaken to its logical conclusion by the Nazis who raced to find evidence of theswastika on ancient remains around the world, thus supporting their contentionthat a single, Aryan race was responsible for all of human civilization.13[part0006_split_003.html#aft13] We can see a similar trend in the present erawith all the talk of ancient aliens having “given” the human race its science,its architecture, and its religions. In a sense, this is close to Lovecraft'sidea that an ancient race from the stars once inhabited the Earth.In Crowley's day, however, this approach was exciting and encouraged a greatdeal of amateur speculation on the history of the ancient world. Whileuniversalism has been discredited by the philosophers of the Frankfurt Schooland their associated postmodern approach to theories of knowledge andinterpretation, with its fetishism of cultural differences and uniqueness, someelements of its worldview stubbornly remain. Rather than throw out theproverbial baby with the bathwater, it can be acknowledged that certain aspectsof the human condition—birth, death, sexuality—are identical among all membersof the human race, and that while different approaches may be taken to sacralizeor otherwise interpret these aspects they are nonetheless “universals” and theircomparison across ethnic, racial and environmental lines may contribute to abetter understanding of the human condition.So, when Crowley wrote—seemingly recklessly—about a “Set-Horus” current inoccultism, or identified Set with Shaitan and with a Sumerian Aiwaz, he was notreferring specifically to these ideas as they are understood by scholars or wereunderstood by the indigenous peoples who contributed them to the world's body ofknowledge. Instead, he was emphasizing certain perceived qualities that hedeemed cognate, without overmuch regard for their historical context. At thesame time, one should not infer that Crowley's “Egyptology” needs to remain atodds with normative Egyptology. On the contrary, by supplementing Crowley'swritings on the subject with recent scholarship in the field many advantagesaccrue and discoveries occur and, where necessary, corrections may be made.A further defense of Crowley's Egyptology may be made in light of the fact thatthe Egyptian religion itself went through many changes over the course of itsroughly three thousand—four thousand years of history. Gods and goddesseschanged attributes over time, changed rulerships and characteristics, and evenparentage. Their sacred sites were moved, or renamed. Their effigies defaced asnew cults emerged. Often gods were merged with other gods to form new, compositeforms. Thus one could make the argument—perhaps only slightly frivolously—thatthe Book of the Law represents a new iteration of the Egyptian religion andcontinues the developmental process begun in the pre-Dynastic era.Another factor to be taken into consideration is one that is frequently ignored,even by those who claim a certain degree of expertise in this area, and that isthe fact that Crowley had been initiated into the Golden Dawn and framed much ofhis magical and esoteric worldview within the Golden Dawn structure of ritualsand instructions. Thus, we first come across Hoor-par-kraat, Osiris, Isis, Nu,Maat and many of the other Crowleyan references in this context: in the GoldenDawn rituals themselves, the ones used to initiate Crowley, which had a profoundaffect on his consciousness and his intellectual and spiritual development. Infact, certain phrases in the Book of the Law make no sense whatsoever withoutreference to those very rituals.As an example, we can refer to the very first chapter wherein it is written:Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hathtaken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be with Isa,who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa thesufferer; Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating. (ALI:49)In his “New Comment” to the Book of the Law, Crowley himself clearly states:The general allusion is to the Equinox Ritual of the GImage[../images/00003.jpeg]DImage [../images/00003.jpeg] where the officer of theprevious six months, representing Horus, took the place of the retiringHierophant, who had represented Osiris.Thus, the replacement of Osiris by Horus—i.e., the old Aeon by the New—wasalready prefigured in the rituals with which Crowley was completely familiar,but which would have been incomprehensible to an outsider. In that ritual Horuswas represented by the officer known as the Hiereus (or “priest”). Osiris wasthe Hierophant (or “high priest”), and another of the important officers was theHegemon (“leader” or “guide”), which was the Goddess Maat, and indeed the hallof initiations in the neophyte ceremony was called the Hall of Maat. (In theverse from the Book of the Law cited above, Asar is Osiris and Isa may be Isisor Jesus.14 [part0006_split_003.html#aft14]) Thus, the gods of the Book of theLaw were speaking to Crowley in a Golden Dawn context (since the allusions makeno sense outside of the very specific Golden Dawn rituals). They were using hisinitiation as a channel through which to communicate, to make their words knownand understood.What this means is that the cultus of Thelema and the organizations that grewout of it—the AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg],Grant's Typhonian Order, etc.—have the Golden Dawn system as their base. (TheOTO does not have any connection to the Golden Dawn, either through its earliestfounders or its ritual structure.) Intellectually—if not spiritually—Thelema canbe truly understood only within that system and is thus (from a historical pointof view) a development of what began as the Golden Dawn in nineteenth centuryEngland. Crowley's own organization, the Argentum Astrum or AImage[../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg], is a “perfection” of theoriginal Golden Dawn system of grades, with the addition of the three degreesrepresenting the three spheres at the top of the Tree of Life: the ones notassigned by the Golden Dawn itself since they were believed to be outside theunderstanding of normal human beings. Crowley claimed to have attained each ofthose degrees, and then set about reforming the Golden Dawn system by makingThelemic adjustments to all of the degree rituals, and by adding Asian mysticalpractices to the curriculum: including Hatha Yoga and Buddhist meditationmethods and terminology."},{"pageContent":"EGYPTIAN AEONSEven so, Thelema was designed to be a revolutionary spiritual movement, at onceas grounded in science as in faith. It would overthrow Western ideas ofspirituality, of morality and ethics, by replacing them with a worldview verysimilar in some respects to that of Buddhism. The death of the Ego is a familiarBuddhist concept; but at the same time Crowley calls for an end to the“limitation of the Mind by Reason.” In Crowley's theology, as in some forms ofZen Buddhism, one must transcend both faith and reason in order to attain thehighest illumination. Yet, paradoxically perhaps, both faith and reason aretools in the arsenal of the Thelemic magician.How, then, is Crowley's system different from Buddhism?In terms of Aeons, there are similarities. In Buddhist cosmology, there is thegreat measurement of time, or mahakalpa, which is divided into four kalpas oraeons. Each kalpa is extraordinarily long in terms of the human measurement oftime and can take hundreds of thousands, or even millions or billions, of yearsto pass. The four basic kalpas are Vivartakalpa (the Aeon of evolution in whichcreation occurs), Vivartasthayikalpa (the Aeon of duration of evolution),Samvartakalpa (the Aeon of dissolution), and finally Samvartast-hayikalpa (theAeon of the duration of dissolution). These are similar in concept to the Hindusystem of yugas, described below, and are based on an idea that creation beginsin a perfect or pure state—“in illo tempore”—and then gradually disintegratesthrough the passage of time. But there is a judgemental aspect to both theBuddhist and Hindu concepts of the Aeons, and Crowley was not immune to thisconcept. He characterized the Aeon of Isis as considerably more pleasant thanthe Aeon of Osiris, and the Aeon of Horus as a kind of necessary correctivewhich would culminate in an Aeon of Maat that would wipe the slate clean andstart all over again.Yet while Crowley praised Hindu and Buddhist forms of meditation, yoga, andtheir corresponding methods of attainment of altered states of consciousness,and instructed his students to become proficient in all of these, he rejectedmany of the doctrines of Buddhism—as he had all previous manifestations ofreligion—as superceded by his own cultus. He had difficulty accepting the coreconcept of Buddhism, that all existence is sorrow and that sorrow proceeds fromattachment. Crowley embraced life in all its forms and could not bring himselfto refrain from tasting every flavor it offered. In this he could claim to havetranscended attachment by indulging in all forms of sensation, accepting noneand rejecting all in the process. Yet Crowley's approach to Buddhism—as it wasto all previous forms of religion, spirituality and magic—was purely mechanicaland pragmatic. The previous religions were viewed as possessing technologiesthat could be mastered, and not faiths to believe in. Certainly their theologieswere rejected as obsolete and even dangerous. As his famous couplet states:We place no reliance on virgin or pigeonOur method is science, our aim is religion.Paradoxically, however, Crowley frequently refers to Asian religious concepts inhis writings and indicates that he values what they represent. He speaks ofsamadhi, anatta, advaita, the chakras, Kundalini, lingam and yoni, and otherBuddhist and Hindu concepts with approval. He strives to attain samadhi, forinstance, and reprimands himself for clinging to attachment. One could beforgiven for seeing in Crowley's diaries, his Confessions, and his letters awestern man attempting to dominate eastern mystical practices. However, if thiswas all Crowley was—a New Age proto-hippie in search of enlightenment in thehashish parlors of Nepal or the yoga studios of midtown Manhattan—then we wouldnot be interested in him. For Crowley, these Asian systems are just that:systems. Systems to be worked. Methods to be employed. For all his attraction toAsian ways of thought and culture—perhaps starting with his friendship with AlanBennett, the Bhikhu Ananda Metteya and one of the first Englishmen to bringBuddhism to the United Kingdom—Crowley was still a western man. He did not takethe vows of a Buddhist monk, as did his close friend Bennett. He did not workunder a Hindu, Buddhist or Daoist teacher or guru. It was his mission to makethese disparate forms of religious experience—Asian, European—work for him,become elements of his own philosophy. The “double-wanded” power that he wroteabout so frequently could be construed as Crowley himself, uniting both Asianand European paths to God in a single system. This insistence on bringingtogether both hemispheres to produce a “syzygy”—to use the Valentinian Gnosticterm (see below)—is typical of Crowley's mindset. Indeed, he even insists thatHorus is really a twin: Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-par-kraat, Horus and Harpocrates,the Avenging Son and the Babe of Silence, respectively—as if unable (or simplyunwilling) to commit entirely to a single identifiable entity.The Aeon of Horus, then, is the Age of the Child. The child will try anythingonce, will test boundaries, will explore each sense to its fullest capacity. Theinfant does not believe: it has not yet reached that point where belief isnecessary as a technique of avoiding confrontation with an unpleasant reality.The infant has no ideology to restrain it, to force it to choose one path overanother. As Crowley himself writes in this regard:The child is not merely a symbol of growth, but of complete moral independenceand innocence. We may then expect the New Aeon to release mankind from itspretence of altruism, its obsession of fear and its consciousness of sin. Itwill possess no consciousness of the purpose of its own existence. It will notbe possible to persuade it that it should submit to incomprehensible standards;it will suffer from spasms of transitory passion; it will be absurdly sensitiveto pain and suffer from meaningless terror; it will be utterly conscienceless,cruel, helpless, affectionate and ambitious, without knowing why; it will beincapable of reason, yet at the same time intuitively aware of truth.15[part0006_split_003.html#aft15]But before we investigate the Aeon of Horus—and Frater Achad's Aeon of Maat—ingreater detail, we must first understand what an Aeon might be.The usual meaning of the term is that of a period of time, usually a very longperiod of time, but the precise length varies from culture to culture, fromcontext to context. It's root comes from an ancient Greek word meaning “life”and is thus conceptually related to the Egyptian ankh.In Gnosticism—the spiritual tradition embraced by many occultists of thenineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Europe and the Americas—the wordaeon refers to an emanation (or characteristic) of God. Thus, the Gnostic aeonsinclude such concepts as Arche (“the beginning”) and Proarche (“before thebeginning”), among other designations, with their associated references to Time.The term aeon can also be used to refer to the fullness of God perceived as anemanation itself.Perhaps the closest in meaning and sense to Crowley's use of the term is that ofthe Valentinians, an early (2nd century CE) Gnostic sect for whom the aeons werecreated in male/female pairs called syzygies of which there were fifteen,16[part0006_split_003.html#aft16] for a total of thirty aeons. It is important torealize that these aeons were emanations from God and therefore divinethemselves, much in the way the Jewish mystics perceived the emanations thatbecame the sephirot of the Tree of Life.As they were emanations, their existence took place in Time. Until that processof emanation took place, God was silent and creation had not yet begun. (This issimilar to the Indian tradition that the world was not created until Parvatiseduced the otherwise monastic and celibate Shiva. In this view, God has to beurged to create.)When the emanations began, Time also began. This may explain the relationshipbetween the concept of Aeon as “emanation” and Aeon as “period of time.” Theyare linked, and one presumes the other. This is what we find in Crowley's schemaof the Aeon of Isis, proceeded by the Aeon of Osiris and then to the present-dayAeon of Horus. They reflect periods of time (similar to the precession of theequinoxes that has given us the “Age of Aquarius”) but they are also personifiedperiods of time. They are periods in which the designated God or Emanationrules.Specifically with Valentinianism, the Aeon known as Sophia (“wisdom”) causedcreation as we know it to take place. Sophia is feminine, the youngest of allthe Aeons. She wished to know the Father and went on a quest to find God. Shemay be thought of as an analogous figure to that of the Shekinah in Jewishmysticism: a feminine figure removed from the Source of creation who is thenreunited with God in a mystical marriage. In the Valentinian version, she became“divided”17 [part0006_split_003.html#aft17]: one aspect of Sophia was caughtdown in the lower realms, in physical creation, separated from God. Anotheraspect—her original self—remained in the upper realms. The two aspects wereseparated by something called “the Limit,” which was a border between thefullness of God in the Pleroma and God's creation in the material world. ThisLimit18 [part0006_split_003.html#aft18] was personified by the Valentinianconcept known as Horos, which some scholars believe is the Gnosticinterpretation of the Egyptian god Horus: the same Horus who figures soprominently in the Book of the Law. Interestingly, this concept was enshrined inthe very origin of the Egyptian Horus, as described in the Coffin Texts and asexplained by Mordechai Gilula in an article published in the Journal of EgyptianArchaeology:Coffin Texts, Spell 148 narrates the birth of Horus. Having been delivered ofher son, Isis addresses him in these words: BImage [../images/00004.jpeg]ks3.Image [../images/00004.jpeg] Hr hms r·k m t3 pn n Image[../images/00004.jpeg]t·k WsImage [../images/00004.jpeg]r m rn·k pw n bImage[../images/00004.jpeg]k hr(y) znbw hwt ‘Imn-rn, “O falcon, my son Horus, dwellin this land of your father Osiris in this your name of Falcon who is on (or‘aboveor’) the battlements of the mansion of Him-whose-name-is-hidden” (CT II,221c-e). This is the actual naming of Horus who, until his birth, is referred toas BImage [../images/00005.jpeg]k (219b).19 [part0006_split_003.html#aft19]What is striking about this information is that Horus at his birth is associatedwith “the battlements of the mansion”: i.e., he rests atop the border betweenthe celestial and the earthly worlds, which is precisely what the Gnostic Horosrepresents: the Limit. In addition, the “mansion” referred to in the Coffin Textis that of “Him-whose-name-is-hidden,” in other words, the Hidden God—the DeusAbsconditus or Amun—which is the title of one of Kenneth Grant's studies of theTyphonian Current.20 [part0006_split_003.html#aft20] This “limit” may be thoughtof in terms of Victor Turner's concept of liminality21[part0006_split_003.html#aft21]: a boundary between two modes or states ofbeing, i.e. the sacred and the profane. In this sense, Horus represents aliminal figure, one who crosses over from one state to another and thus has someof the characteristics of an initiator.Further, the figure of Isis is cognate with a number of other feminine deitieswho give birth without having been impregnated in the usual way. The husband ofIsis—Osiris—had been slain by his brother Set and, according to one version ofthe legend, cut up into fourteen pieces.22 [part0006_split_003.html#aft22] Isiswent in search of those pieces and reassembled her murdered husband in order toimpregnate herself and give birth to Horus. We recall that Mary, the Mother ofJesus, was characterized as a virgin and the birth of Jesus a “virgin birth,” aparthenogenesis. Her Son became the intermediary between humanity and theinvisible, hidden God, and was executed on a cross. The symbol for the GnosticHoros was also a cross, identified astronomically as the place where theecliptic and the zodiac meet. In the Gnostic universe, the Aeon Sophia alsoattempted to give birth to a child parthenogenically, i.e., without benefit ofintercourse.In India—locus of much of Grant's attention as well as considerable study byCrowley—we have another instance of creation having been the result of abnormalconception. Shiva is portrayed as a monastic living in the wild who spends mostof his time in meditation. He is aroused by his wife, Uma (or sometimesParvati), to engage in sexual intercourse. However, Shiva has enormous staminaand the couple engage in intercourse for millenia until the gods can take thesound of it no longer and distract Shiva so that he withdraws from Uma at themoment of ejaculation. Uma takes his seed—either in her mouth, or in her handdepending on the text—and impregnates herself with it, thus conceiving thecreated world.23 [part0006_split_003.html#aft23] This sounds suspiciouslysimilar to the way in which Isis conceived Horus except that in the Egyptianversion the husband of Isis has been murdered, while in the Indian version,Shiva is still very much alive. Both Isis and Uma, however, give birth to sonswho may be considered avengers, Uma/Parvati giving birth to Skanda,24[part0006_split_003.html#aft24] commander of the Devas in battle with the demonTaraka.In India, where periods of time are inordinately huge, we are believed to beliving in the yuga—or “age”—of Kali. This is a period of hundreds of thousandsof years (according to some sources) which is said to have begun in the year3102 BCE. It is the last of four yugas or ages: Satya yuga, Dvapara yuga, Tretayuga and Kali yuga. The Kali yuga is ruled by the demon Kali (not Kali thegoddess), a symbol of strife and conflict, a fearsome creature sometimesdepicted carrying a huge sword or other weapon.Thus, even in India, an Aeon can be identified with a supernatural being. Thenames of the previous three yugas can be translated as Truth (Satya), Double(Dvapara), and Triple (Treta). These are designations that don't appear to havespecific deities attached to them by name, but the ages themselves do reflectthe actions of various deities in the relevant Indian texts, such as theMahabharata. In the Indian system, the chronological order of the yugas reflectsa degeneration of the quality of spirituality, from the perfect age in Satyayuga to the increasingly vice-ridden ages of Dvapara and Treta, to thethoroughly corrupt Kali yuga: an age in which Lord Krishna has completelywithdrawn himself from humanity. This is paralleled in the Buddhist cosmologicalsystem of the kalpas, mentioned above.Obviously, Crowley's concept of the Aeons is slightly more optimistic and a lotsimpler. There is no specific sense of an ongoing spiritual degradation ordegeneration; there are, in fact, no clear moral judgments being made at allabout the spiritual quality of each Aeon; only that the processes they representare inevitable and inescapable. Although the Aeon of Horus is identified withwarlike imagery, it also represents the flowering of individual freedom throughthe abandonment of ideas of sin and restriction. Rather than devolve from Aeonto Aeon, human potential is reawakened in different ways, leading to an ultimateperfection. Indeed, the concept of perfectibility—so crucial to understandingwestern alchemy with its processes of transformation—is central to Crowley'sinitiatory scheme. It is the Aeon of Horus that provides the avenues throughwhich the human population in general (rather than an elitist handful of adepts)attains this perfection. In this very important sense, Crowley's philosophy isat odds with Asian ideas of kalpas and yugas. While Buddhism, for example,provides the techniques for a dedicated individual to attain nirvana and defeatthe endless cycle of rebirth, it does not propose that all of humanity will—orcan—do so at once, or during a single two-thousand-year period of time, but onlythrough many millions of years with the assistance of Boddhisattvas: humanbeings who have attained all but the ultimate stage of complete enlightenmentbut who have taken a vow not to complete the initiatory path until all sentientbeings have done so first. This type of self-sacrifice is presumably anathema inThelema, a holdover from the previous Aeon of Osiris in which a god suffers forthe sake of humanity.Crowley's scheme does reflect some controversial anthropological theoriescurrent at the time, however, proposing that there was a matriarchal societythat preceded a patriarchal one. This concept was popularized in the early 20thcentury by such authors as Marija Gimbutas, Robert Graves, and by MargaretMurray in her influential—though heavily-criticized—works on the allegedEuropean witchcraft cult, The God of the Witches and The Witch-Cult in WesternEurope, and even earlier by the Swiss anthropologist J. J. Bachofen in his Myth,Religion and Mother Right (1861). Thus, Crowley posits a matriarchal Aeon ofIsis that precedes the more patriarchal Aeon of Osiris. Thismatriarchal-patriarchal chronology has been largely discredited. It should benoted that there is no real historical precedent for this as an Egyptologicalscheme, and it does not appear in any standard works by archaeologists or otherspecialists in Egyptian history and religion. It comes, instead, directly fromthe Book of the Law.As mentioned above, however, the Book of the Law owes much to the initiatorysystem that produced Aleister Crowley, that of the Golden Dawn. In this system,one of the more important and revealing initiation rituals is the very first,the Neophyte initiation ritual. Within this ritual may be discovered elements ofall the succeeding ones. It is here that Maat—as Themaist,25[part0006_split_003.html#aft25] and as Hegemon—first appears. It is also herethat one gets the first glimpse of what an Equinox of the Gods might entail, andof how the Crowleyan Aeons were conceived.The Golden Dawn rituals were published by an initiate—Francis Israel Regardie(1907-1985)—who was an intimate of Aleister Crowley (during the period1928-1932), and thus had a ring-side seat for much of what was taking place inthe western occult world at the time. Regardie joined the Stella Matutina (asuccessor to the Golden Dawn that used its rituals) in 1934 and eventually(1937-1940) published their secret rituals and other material in a four-volumehardcover set, an action for which he was heavily criticized by members of theOrder.The Equinox ritual, published in Regardie's magnum opus includes a number oftemple officers representing Egyptian gods, and the uttering of a password forthe season. The ceremony is based on the point at which the days and nights areof equal length—the “equal night” or equinox—that takes place on the first dayof spring and on the first day of autumn, the vernal and autumnal equinoxesrespectively. According to the Golden Dawn ritual, a Word is changed from oneequinox to the other with a corresponding change of Hierophant. This idea of anEquinox of the Gods, with a change of the guard as it were, and the creation orutterance of a new Word is central to the Book of the Law and to Crowley'sentire Thelemic worldview.The Book of the Law saga begins with Crowley and Rose Kelly (his first wife)visiting Cairo, Egypt in March of 1904. Sylphs appearing to the couple in theKing's Chamber of the Great Pyramid on March 16, followed by a stream of cosmicmessages to Rose during the next few days, convinced Crowley that Horus was infact addressing him directly through Rose—his first Scarlet Woman. She demandedhe “break all the rules” and helped him design an invocation of Horus that hesuccessfully performed on the Spring Equinox, March 20. Now known as the“Supreme Ritual,” this is the invocation that ushered in the New Aeon, the daywhen “the world was destroyed by fire,” the “Equinox of the Gods.” Rose'sidentification of the image of Horus (Ra-Hoor-Khuit) on the Stele of Revealing(exhibit number 666 in the Boulaq Museum!) as the communicating Intelligence wasthe final proof for Crowley. Although the Book of the Law would not be receiveduntil weeks later, from April 8 to 10, Crowley imagines that the vernal equinoxwas the real starting point of the new Aeon of Horus. Of course, it is the daywhen—according to the Golden Dawn rubric—Horus takes over from Osiris asHierophant, sitting on Osiris's throne in the East. In Crowley's case, what wasperformed ritualistically for decades within the temples of the Golden Dawn andits successors occurred in reality on March 20, 1904. If one reads the Book ofthe Law in this context, it all begins to make sense.But it also raises many other questions. Many contemporary occultists,esotericists, and New Agers by definition believe that we are on the cusp of anew phase of human existence. From the rather vague concept of an Aquarian Ageof peace and harmony to Doomsday predictions of mass extinction, what theseideas have in common is their lack of specific focus on the individual.Crowley's Cairo revelation—while similar in many respects to both the dreamy NewAge version of a renewed humanity to the Doomsday predictions of war andviolence—shifted the emphasis from general redemption and/or general holocaustto one of individual empowerment. Individual identity—and the survival of thatidentity—seems to be important in the Thelemic scheme of things. After all, asit is written in the Book of the Law: “Every man and every woman is a star.” (ALI:3) Thelemites believe they have something to do with creating or facilitatingthe New Age. This may reflect the means through which the New Age was revealedto Crowley, i.e., in the context of a secret society of magicians rather than ona mountaintop in Sinai or a cave in Saudi Arabia. It took place in a rentedapartment in the city of Cairo, and was revealed to an Englishman. There thuswas no specifically ethnic context to the revelation. It was not Moses among theJews, Jesus among the Jews, or Mohammed among the Arabs. It was not even Buddhaamong the Indians or Lao Ze among the Chinese. The revelation came out ofnowhere, to two Brits on their honeymoon in Egypt. Certainly, the deities whospoke to Crowley were Egyptian, and Crowley was in Egypt. But Crowley himselfwas not Egyptian, nor was his wife. Why was the revelation not made toindigenous Egyptians? Was it because, as Muslims or Coptic Christians, theypresumably would not have been open to such a message? The implication is thatCrowley's prior exposure to Egyptian material in the context of the Golden Dawninitiations provided the appropriate channel for the Egyptian deities tomanifest, and his presence in Cairo—in the shadow of the pyramids, the Sphinx,and the Valley of the Kings—made it that much easier. Further, the manifestationof the pre-Islamic Egyptian gods in the middle of Islamic Cairo would anticipatesome of the more controversial statements in the Book of the Law concerningJesus, Mary, and most especially Mohammed:I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men.Curse them! Curse them! Curse them!With my Hawk's head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross.I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed & blind him.With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol andDin.Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds.Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women beutterly despised among you! (AL III: 49-55)These sentiments were as revolting to Crowley at the time they were written asthey may be to us today. The vitriol with which other faiths are attacked inthese passages—in the mouth of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Avenging Son of Osiris—mayreflect the tension that exists in Egypt over the presence of so many ancient,but pagan and polytheist, monuments in a predominantly Muslim country during anera of Islamic resurgence and identity conflict. Indeed, at the time this bookis being written we are informed of certain radical Islamic groups in Egypt26[part0006_split_003.html#aft26] that want the pyramids and other ancientedifices destroyed in the name of the faith, in much the same way the Talibandestroyed the famous Buddha statues of Bamiyan, Afghanistan in early 2001. Thus,in the eyes of some radical religionists, it is time for a New Aeon of Islamwith Arab characteristics to utterly remove all traces of pre-Islamic (i.e.,non-Arab) religion anywhere they can be found—something the followers of theProphet Muhammad attempted to do to the pyramids and the Sphinx on their drivethrough Egypt in the mid-seventh century CE. On November 17, 1997 there was amassacre of foreign tourists at the Temple of Hatshepsut, coincidentally at thevery site where the Stele of Revealing was first discovered in 1858 by theFrench archaeologist François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette. The mastermind of theattack was Ayman Al-Zawahiri, at the time head of the terrorist group Al-Gama'aal-Islamiyya and presently the leader of Al-Qaeda after the death of Osama binLaden. More recently, there is the ongoing destruction of Timbuktu in Mali byIslamic radicals in that country. One should remember that one of the firstofficial acts of the Prophet Muhammad was the destruction of the pagan shrine inMecca that had housed 360 idols, a shrine that he transformed into the Ka'aba.This is a pattern of behavior that, while repugnant to liberal-minded lovers ofreligion and culture everywhere, is represented—at least philosophically, oreven ideologically—in the Book of the Law with its insistence on the destructionof the old faiths. The difference is only in the nature and character of thereligion doing the destruction, and the violence with which it is attended.While there are no Thelemites charged with the destruction of Christian orBuddhist iconography—even though the titular head of the largest and mostvisible OTO organization is referred to as the “Caliph”(!)—the appearance ofthese lines in the Book of the Law conceivably could be used to signal just sucha holocaust if Thelema and its followers ever get the upper hand in a country orregion. We have seen how similar passages in the Qur'an have been used tojustify violence against the Jews, for instance.However, Crowley's entire life and writings are devoted to a syncretic approachto religion and spirituality—making use of whatever works from whatever cultureor religion or occult practice is available—whereas the worldview of Islamicradicals is viciously opposed to such syncretism and insists on a purelyMuslim-Arab interpretation of all spirituality. It is perhaps ironic that theworld's most populous Muslim nation—Indonesia—is opposed to the monolithic,mono-cultural Arabist approach of Middle Eastern radicals and embraces its ownmulti-cultural—Hindu, Buddhist, indigenous—religious heritage as part of itsnational as well as its religious identity, demonstrating in real-time asyncretic approach that does not diminish their Islamic faith but seems insteadto strengthen it.While Crowley's scripture spoke of a new Aeon that would abrogate all previousAeons, paradoxically it came in the mouths of ancient Egyptian gods. ForCrowley, the Aeons are Egyptian. There is a certain element of culturalfetishism where ancient Egypt is concerned (especially among occultists and NewAge followers), and in the west Egyptian crazes come and go. The Americanfascination with the traveling King Tut exhibit in 1976-1977 is one example, andoccurred at the time that the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon wasbeing prepared for publication. So, while the New Aeon insists that “the ritualsof the old time are black,” (AL II:5) it appears that incorporation of elementsfrom one of the oldest of old religions is exempt from this critique.The surviving liturgies of ancient Egypt—the so-called Book of the Dead and theCoffin texts, for instance—are focused on the prime concern of the Egyptians:the survival of the individual identity after death. They are focused,therefore, on Osiris who represents the totality of that meme: a dead (murdered)and resurrected god whose example promised immortality for human beings—a clearprototype of the Christian scheme that would appear thousands of years later.Horus, while an extremely important player in these events and in his cosmicbattle with Set, is not the focus of his own rite with the same intensity ofpurpose and elaboration of ritual as his father, Osiris ... at least, not in thesurviving corpus of ancient Egyptian literature. If we characterize Aeons bytheir namesakes—the way the Gnostics did, and particularly the Valentinians withtheir Aeon of Jesus, Aeon of Sophia, etc—then it stands to reason that therewould be an Aeon of Horus. However, the rituals and form of worship are missing,if they ever existed. (Imagine a cult of Saint Peter or Saint Paul, or even ofEmperor Constantine who legitimized the worship of Jesus in the Roman Empire.)Horus was part of the cult of Osiris, was integral to it. What Crowley'sscripture seems to indicate is that Horus is by now well and truly annoyed atthis state of affairs and is intent on creating his own cultus, his ownliturgies, his own heroic narrative. Furthermore, it is one that does notnecessarily represent death and resurrection in the way we have all come tounderstand that concept but is another take on the human condition entirely. Itis a credit to the Egyptians that they were able to provide enough rawmaterial—real, imagined, or purely speculative based on bits and pieces ofmonuments, statues, and stelae—to fuel any dozen new religions, new approachesto spirituality, new techniques for becoming ... perfect.For comparison, we may reference the revelation received by Joseph Smith onanother Equinox of the Gods, the autumnal equinox of 1823 during which time hecaught a glimpse of the golden plates on which were inscribed, in “ReformedEgyptian”(!), the Book of Mormon. This scripture claimed it was the record of aJewish tribe that had escaped to North America at the time of the fall ofSolomon's Temple to the Babylonians. Joseph Smith was not Jewish and he did notpretend to be Jewish. Smith, however, was a magician, and the discovery of thegolden plates came as the result of magical ceremonies conducted at that site bySmith using essentially the same rituals and the same texts that would form partof the Golden Dawn curriculum fifty years later. The revelation came in NorthAmerica—upper New York State, to be precise—and not in Israel or in Egypt. Theparallels with Crowley's revelations could not be stronger: two Anglo-Saxonmales—one born in America, the other in England, both magicians—receivespiritual revelations that command them to form new religious movements, yetneither are of the race ( Jewish or Egyptian) from whom the revelations arereceived, and both involve Egyptian texts. In Smith's case, the golden tabletswere written in “Reformed Egyptian” (which does not exist), and in Crowley'scase the revelations began with the discovery of a stele written in Egyptianhieroglyphics (which had the obvious advantage of being written in genuineEgyptian).Prior to the Smith “discovery” there was another Egyptian discovery, this timeby the mysterious Count Cagliostro (1743-1795). Napoleon had invaded Egypt, andone of the earlier forms of the perennial Egypt craze had begun. In Cagliostro'scase, it resulted in the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. Cagliostro claimed to beable to initiate into those mysteries and created his own Masonic lodges basedon this “Egyptian” style, replete with ceremonial robes adorned withhieroglyphic embroidery. In the case of both Joseph Smith and his precursor,Cagliostro, there was safety in the fact that no one knew how to translateEgyptian hieroglyphics. The Rosetta Stone (discovered in 1799 and its code“broken” in 1822 at the earliest but not officially formalized until yearslater) had not yet yielded its treasures. People could say whatever they wishedabout the Egyptian writing and claim to be able to read and translate it.By the time Crowley appeared on the scene, however, Egyptian writing had beendecoded for eighty years and no one could claim special mystical knowledge abouttheir contents. Egyptology had become a scientific field of study involving thenew disciplines of linguistics, archaeology and anthropology, among others. Yetstill the allure of the Egyptian religion remained, perhaps even stronger thanbefore once it was revealed what all those hieroglyphics really said about gods,goddesses, rituals of embalming and promises of eternal life.“Our method,” Crowley wrote, “is science; our aim is religion.”27[part0006_split_003.html#aft27] The translations of the “Book of the Dead” by E.A. Wallis Budge (1895) and others only fueled this particular fire. Thus, whileCrowley was a magician in the style of both Cagliostro and Joseph Smith, andclaimed Masonic titles and lineages as did both of those men, he had the benefitof access to genuine information about Egypt and Egyptian religious beliefs andpractices. He was, in a sense, their apotheosis. He created a new religion—asdid Smith—and a new occult order, as did Cagliostro.Of course, it did not begin and end with Egypt alone. Along the way, Crowleyincorporated much Asian religion into his new cult and was advised—specificallyin the Book of the Law—to include Afro-Caribbean rites and practices as well.28[part0006_split_003.html#aft28] This New Aeon was to be all-inclusive and globalin intellectual and spiritual reach. Is this one reason why a young Englishmanon his honeymoon in Cairo was selected for this revelation and its newscripture, and not a native Egyptian?An aspect of the Crowleyan Aeon of Horus that has not been the focus of muchattention is the fact that Crowley's scripture and its associated ideas areessentially pagan, if by “pagan” we mean polytheist and even animist. The bruntof the attack of the Book of the Law against other religions is concentrated ontwo of the three Abrahamic faiths: Christianity and Islam. Both Jesus andMohammad are singled out for blinding. Mary “inviolate” (by which we understandthe mother of Jesus) is to be torn on a wheel. The flesh of Hindus, Buddhists,“Mongol and Din,” are to be torn out, but oddly not of their gods. (One imaginesa list of all the Hindu gods to be blinded would have taken too many pages.)Crowley assumes “Mongol” to represent Confucianism,29[part0006_split_003.html#aft29] and “Din” by an even longer stretch to representJudaism. His “New Commentary” to the Book of the Law is explicit in hisadmiration for Islam as a manly religion, devoid of what he sees as thecringing, craven quality of a religion—Christianity—that is based on acceptingthe sacrifice of someone else for one's sins. But the blinding of Mohammad is asnecessary as that of Jesus because both prophets had the wrong “perspective.” Hefurther claims that Hinduism “metaphysically and mystically comprehensive enoughto assure itself the possession of much truth, is in practice almost assuperstitious and false as Christianity, a faith of slaves, liars and dastards.The same remarks apply roughly to Buddhism.” Thus two important points are made:Hinduism and Buddhism both possess “much truth,” but their practices arecorrupt. This enables Crowley to retain Hindu and Buddhist rituals, techniques,and terminology within his Thelemic framework—essentially looting a burningbuilding. His general respect for Islam enabled him to refer in correspondenceto his successors as “Caliph,” a term—from the Arabic khalifah—that representsthe successors to the Prophet. Indeed, the initiation rituals of the OTO in thelower degrees use an Arab framework from the Crusader era as the template forthe rites, much the way the Golden Dawn used an Egyptian temple motif. Thus, theBook of the Law seems to reserve its strongest opprobrium for Christianity: thereligion in which Crowley was raised and which he despised for most of his life.Another potential conflict arises, though, when one considers that theorganization at the forefront of Thelema is the Ordo Templi Orientis, or Orderof the Eastern Temple, an order identifying itself with the Knights Templar. TheTemplars were, of course, a Roman Catholic religious and military organizationdevoted to the capture of the Holy Land from Islamic control. One might thinkthat this represents some accommodation with Christianity in a Thelemic context,but one would be mistaken. For the mythology of the Knights Templarcharacterizes it as a secret society with mystical elements that found itselfopposed to mainstream Christianity and which, indeed, was suppressed by theCatholic Church in the fourteenth century, its famous Grand Master—Jacques deMolay—burned at the stake on false charges of heresy. Thus, identifying with theTemplars does not make one a Christian in any normative sense of the word, andthis would have appealed to Crowley as well as the libel associated with theTemplars, that they engaged in deviant sexual practices as well as idol-worship.Crowley took as his Order name the word Baphomet, which was supposedly the nameof the (non-Christian) idol that the Templars worshipped. While much scholarshiprecently has thrown many of these assumptions about the Order into seriousdoubt, the association of Templarism with the mysterious Orient of the Saracens,as well as with sexual mysticism, is the idea with which Thelema most closelyidentifies.Since the Aeon of Horus is focused on individual responsibility andfreedom—where “Every man and every woman is a star”—it stands to reason that itsgreatest foe would be Christianity, at least the Christianity as understood byCrowley himself, a faith of “slaves, liars and dastards.” Indeed, as the “Beast666” Crowley set himself in firm opposition to the organized Church byidentifying with its Apocalyptic enemy and claiming as his bride the Whore ofBabylon (in Crowley's numerology renamed “Babalon”). The anti-Christianity ofCrowley is obsessive, and one wonders why he even bothered. The Book of the Lawhas an Egyptian framework and motif; it was received in Cairo, during sessionssurrounded by the cry of the muezzin from the minarets of the city's fabledmosques. Why bother bringing up Christianity at all, much less incorporatingsome of its elements into the Thelemic gestalt? Because, to Crowley's way ofthinking, Christianity represented the old and now discredited Aeon of Osirispar excellence. For such a well-traveled and intelligent man, it seems odd thathe would think that way considering that most of the world—especially the worldhe traveled in, Asia and the Middle East—was not Christian and never had beenChristian. How was the Aeon of Osiris represented in China, for instance? Or inIndia?This may seem like nit-picking to some, but it goes to the heart of an importantpoint, one that forms the essence of the Grant-Lovecraft theme that we will takeup shortly. Crowley's interpretation of the Book of the Law could be describedas—if not Eurocentric then—Occident-centric. It focuses almost exclusively onwestern ideas about religion and spirituality, and especially on resisting anyform of Christianity. It is a kind of spiritual colonialism: the ransacking ofAsian religions and practices for anything of value to a system that is almostwholly focused on defeating a western obsession with sin, restriction, and thecupidity of its priests. It is quite similar to the anxiety some in the westfeel over the prophecies of Nostradamus and the Mayan calendar, signalling theEnd of Days and an Armageddon-like final conflict. There is no such sense ofthis in the East. There is no such anxiety there. Their calendars are different,their religious context entirely dissimilar, their fear of an Anti-Christnon-existent. The end of the world that the west fears so much may be just that:the end of the western world as we know it, but not of “the world” ... not the“whole enchilada.”For the Aeon of Horus to be an Aeon for all it needs to respond to all, to theanxieties of all and to the desperation of all. It has to make as much sense inBeijing as in Boston, in Jakarta as in Jersey City, in Tokyo as in TunbridgeWells. In Chennai as in Chicago.The importance of the Kenneth Grant material, therefore, lies in his attempt tocreate a more global character for Thelema by incorporating as muchAfro-Caribbean and Asian elements in far more detail and with much greaterinsight than was available in the Crowley writings. In some cases, this meanttaking the work of former Crowley colleagues and initiates far more seriouslythan had been done previously. It also meant that Grant would delve into thedarker aspects of Thelema and of what Thelema was insinuating: that at the heartof the cultus was an acknowledgement of humanity's more sinister roots, rootsthat went back to pre-Dynastic Egypt and even further, to the oldestcivilization for which we have any texts at all: Sumer. Crowley's writingsassumed that his readers already had a strong background in comparativereligion, the rituals of the Golden Dawn, and the Kabbalah. In fact, today wehave far greater access to this material than Crowley did. We have the abilityto develop the basic themes of Thelema in much greater depth and with a widerscope. Grant was the first proponent of Thelema to recognize this, and whilemany Thelemites find his writings either obscure, or heretical, or both, hisresearch and his dedication cannot be denied.One of Grant's fixations concerns one of Crowley's most famous disciples andcritics. While Crowley believed himself to be the prophet of this new,post-patriarchal Age, the Aeon of Horus, one of his followers went on toproclaim yet another Aeon, one that began only forty-four years after the startof the Aeon of Horus.This was Charles Stansfeld Jones (1886-1950)—known as Frater Achad—and his Aeonwas proclaimed the Aeon of Maat or sometimes Ma-Ion. At first glance, this wouldseem to be an inconsistency if not an impossibility. How could a new Aeon beginwhen the last one—Crowley's Aeon of Horus—had hardly begun? Yet, as we will soondiscover, this concept does have precedents."},{"pageContent":"MA-IONAs mentioned, Jones was one of Crowley's most important disciples and followers,a man who Crowley once claimed was his “magical son,” but who nevertheless brokewith Crowley on several points of doctrine and who became a convert to RomanCatholicism, thus abandoning Thelema entirely.According to Jones—known under a variety of occult names and mottoes but mostfamously as Frater Achad (“achad” being the Hebrew word for “one”)—a new Aeonbegan on April 2, 1948 which he called the Aeon of Maat. This would be an era ofpeace and love, a kind of counterpoint to Crowley's Aeon of Horus which ischaracterized as the era of the Crowned and Conquering Child, a somewhat morewarlike image.Achad's Aeon of Maat was named after the Egyptian goddess of the Balance. Theweight of the human heart after death was measured against a single feather ofMaat's headress. If the heart weighed more than the feather, the soul was doomedto an unpleasant afterlife. Thus, Maat symbolized Justice as well asEquilibrium. One could say with some justification that Maat was a more likelyicon of the “Age of Aquarius” than a warlike Horus, but that depends on how oneviews an implacable force of Justice!The problem with the Maat proposal is that one does not know with any certaintyhow long a Crowleyan Aeon is supposed to last. If one takes the traditionalWestern view, an Aeon is roughly equivalent to an astrological Age whichcorresponds to the length of time it takes for the Sun's passage through thevernal equinoctial point in one of the zodiacal signs, a process known toastronomers as the precession of the equinoxes. The precession of the equinoxestakes a total of 25,800 years; thus, the length of time of eachAge—corresponding to one of the 12 zodiacal signs—is about 2,150 years. Thisidea that the Age corresponds to the equinoctial point is reflected in manyThelemic writings and rituals, such as the title of Crowley's own occultmagazine, The Equinox, and his commentary on Liber AL, The Equinox of the Gods.However, Crowley postulated that the Aeon of Horus began in 1904—the year hereceived the Book of the Law. The problem with this date is that it is notconsistent with the scientific calculation of some astronomers regarding the Ageof Aquarius. They declare it will not actually begin until about 2600 CE. On theother hand, many astrologers and occultists believe otherwise—proposing startdates ranging from the fifteenth century CE to a thousand years from now. Inthis cluttered field, Crowley's “Aeon of Horus” is only one among manycontenders for the title of “current Age” and as such is perhaps just as validas any other.But how long does a Crowleyan Aeon last?This is also a contentious area, for Crowley himself was not clear or consistentin his calculations. While he seemed inclined to accept the standardprecessional length of time of 2,000 to 2,150 years he was not committed to it.How could he be, when a 1904 start date was inconsistent with both astronomicaland astrological literature? In his various writings he admitted the possibilitythat an Aeon could be measured in as little as a hundred years or as many asthousands of years, stipulating that the experience of Time by the gods was notidentical to human conceptions.30 [part0006_split_003.html#aft30] Thus, whenFrater Achad proclaimed the Aeon of Maat as beginning only forty-four yearsafter the beginning of the (presumably 2,150 year long) Aeon of Horus, theretheoretically was some wiggle-room for insisting on such a shortened “Aeon.”Crowley's adoption of the precessional idea of the Aeons or Ages seems proforma, as if he accepted the 2,150 year “age” as a given rather than basing iton any specific revelation or calculation on his part, the way he accepted thematriarchal-patriarchal sequence long since abandoned by scholars. It is obviousto even the most cursory examination that two thousand years prior to 1904—i.e.the year 96 BCE—could not have been the beginning of the patriarchal Age ofOsiris. The worship of Osiris had predated this period by thousands of years;further, the two thousand years prior to 96 BCE could by no stretch of theimagination be considered a matriarchal age.31 [part0006_split_003.html#aft31]This was not Achad's only creative adjustment to the Kabbalistic system embracedby Crowley. He also went on to redesign the Tree of Life and to assign differentvariables to the spheres and to the paths on the Tree that connect the spheres.This type of tinkering could have important and far-reaching consequences forthose brought up under the Golden Dawn, AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage[../images/00003.jpeg] and OTO systems for it rendered all sorts of symboliclanguage inoperative and inoperable.The Tree of Life is the primary template for the magical system that came out ofthe Golden Dawn. The initiatory degrees are based on the spheres of the Tree,and the corresponding instructions in magic, kabbalah, astrology, Tarot, etc areall related to the paths that connect the spheres. Thus, any re-arranging ofthis scheme would be anathema and would possibly question the occult attainments(or at least their analysis and interpretation) of those who had already passedthrough the degree system to any extent. This would include Crowley himself, ofcourse. Achad was aware of this problem, and mentioned it briefly in the Prefaceto his The Egyptian Revival.One great Authority, however, while admitting that many of the ideas arebrilliant, says that he cannot accept this Reformed Order in the face of severalhundred years of the old tradition, and maintains that the previous arrangementis the correct one.While I realize that great changes in the recognized Systems of Initiation incertain Orders might be necessary if the Reformed Order of the Paths wereadopted, and while recognizing the importance of the Authority mentioned above,I still maintain that this New Arrangement is worthy of the most carefulconsideration and study.32 [part0006_split_003.html#aft32]Thus, what Achad was doing was redesigning an entire occult system that hadtaken years to produce and fine-tune, and in which hundreds of people hadalready been initiated and trained. There is nothing inherently wrong with this,of course, for the Golden Dawn system itself was a novel approach towardsuniting a great many occult ideas into one comprehensive methodology with aflexible and internally-consistent magical vocabulary. Even the idea ofassigning the twenty-two Tarot Trumps to the twenty-two paths on the Tree ofLife (corresponding to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet) was noolder than the nineteenth century, a legacy of the French occultist Eliphas Levi(of whom Crowley believed himself to be the reincarnation). The power and sheerbeauty of that system to anyone who previously had spent years poring over thegrimoires and other medieval instruction books on magic is obvious. Achad'sambition was to supplant that older framework: after all, it had been createddecades before the Book of the Law revelation and thus could be consideredinoperative in the Aeon of Horus.This extended, evidently, even to the arrangement and chronology of the Aeonsthemselves. This type of creative interpretation of Crowley's ouevre—includingvarious approaches to the Book of the Law—infuriated Crowley, and prompted himto issue a famous “Comment” on the Book of the Law in November, 1925 from histhen-current base in Tunis in which he forbade completely any open discussion ofthe Book or its contents. He demanded that he and his writings be regarded asthe sole authorities, and that each person should have recourse only to thosetwo sources and to no other. (Of course, with Crowley's death in 1947, one ofthose two sources was rendered unavailable.)So how could Achad's system be consistent in any way with that so painstakinglycreated by the Golden Dawn and developed further by Aleister Crowley, one of theGolden Dawn's most famous initiates? This question becomes more important onceone realizes that Crowley considered Achad his “magical son,” the one prophesiedin the Book of the Law.33 [part0006_split_003.html#aft33] There have been anumber of possible solutions put forward by defenders of Achad, but defendingAchad is a thankless task. Aside from Grant and his followers, there has beenvery little interest in Achad's writings and theories from mainstreamThelemites. Achad is considered a heretic in the Crowley world, but before hewent off the reservation he did make several important contributions to Thelemaincluding an important “decoding” of a significant element of the Book of theLaw, which is why he was anointed as Crowley's magical son.Obviously, the most glaring challenge to Crowley's system was the inaugurationof the Aeon of Maat in 1948, just five months after Crowley's death and twoyears before Achad's own demise. To a literal-minded observer, Achad'sinsistence on a new Aeon so soon after the birth of the previous one seemsinsane. Yet, the nature of Aeons is such that there is a precedent for Aeonsrunning concurrently and the proof of this is in the Gnostic, Hindu andKabbalistic traditions so beloved of Crowley himself.In the first place, according to Valentinian Gnostic belief, the Aeons werecreated in male/female pairs, called syzygies. Thus every male Aeon had a femalecounterpart, a consort or spouse. Again, we must be clear that we are speakingof Aeons as divine emanations and not necessarily as lengths of time. However,the Egyptian Aeons as understood by Crowley were also divine emanations. Theywere, in fact, gods. What Achad did was to include the Aeon of Maat as a kind of“sister” or “spouse” of the Aeon of Horus, according to some commentators. Whilethis seems at odds with Crowley's own writings on the subject it is nonethelessconsistent with the Gnostic Aeons. Why should this matter? Because the mainvehicle for regular Thelemic worship is something Crowley created called theGnostic Mass.Gnosticism is understood by many to be a mystical form of Christianity,incorporating many pagan and Greco-Egyptian elements. It is an “initiated” formof the religion, and Valentinian Gnosticism in particular fits this descriptionquite capably. Crowley's development of the Gnostic Mass—based, he claimed, on aDivine Liturgy he witnessed in Moscow34 [part0006_split_003.html#aft34]—and itsregular celebration by his Gnostic Catholic Church would seem to imply that heapproved of Gnosticism, at least in some forms. The theme of the Aeons iscentral to most Gnostic writings, and he would have been familiar with thecondemnations of it by the early Church Fathers (which fact alone would havemade it attractive to Crowley).In fact, the Gnostic teachings include a creation of the world through theillegitimate sexual desires of the last and youngest of the thirty Aeons,Sophia. It is this same Sophia that is called in some Gnostic texts “the Whore.”In different versions of the myth, Sophia is either without a consort—that is,not a member of a syzygy—or abandons her consort in the search for God theFather. She learns that the Unbegotten One has Himself begotten the Pleroma (therarified spiritual realm where all the Aeons reside), and she wishes to imitatehim by producing an offspring herself, without benefit of intercourse. This shedoes, but it is a monster: in some texts described as an “abortion” or as a“miscarriage.” In others as simply “the Void of Knowledge” and “the Shadow ofthe Name.” It is her illicit desire to become a God that results in the creationof Anger, Fear, Despair and other negative impulses which in turn create theworld as we know it.In another version of the story—mentioned above—Sophia falls far and fast fromgrace and is nearly out of reach of the other Aeons until she comes up againstthe Limit (horos) and is saved. The Limit stands between the Pleroma—thefullness of God—and the outer darkness. She then becomes reunited with her Aeonand the Pleroma is right again. The problem is, however, that her unholyIntention caused a tremor in the Pleroma and it together with her Passion iscast into the outer darkness, i.e., the Pleroma rejects this new creature and itbecomes the infamous “abortion” or “miscarriage” mentioned above, a “formlessentity” that requires that the Limit be erected in order to keep it away fromthe Pleroma, and to preserve the Pleroma from its polluting aspect. It is thisentity that becomes the created world.Eventually—according to the Valentinian Gnosis—the other Aeons become worriedover their newly-perceived vulnerability. In order to quiet the Aeons andrestore some sense of harmony and stability, two new Aeons are created: Christos(male) and the Holy Spirit (female). Christos has the advantage of being able tooperate on both sides of the Limit, both in the Pleroma and in the outerdarkness. Eventually, the Aeon of Jesus is formed and this Aeon functions solelyoutside of the Pleroma.It is interesting that the two qualities that cause the Limit to be erected inthe first place are precisely Intention and Passion, corollaries of Will andLove, the two determining qualities of the Thelemic system.35[part0006_split_003.html#aft35] Thus, as Kenneth Grant will later expound, thereis an ontological link between the beliefs of Thelema concerning Will and Loveon the one hand, and with the Outer Darkness on the other. And in the middle ofthem stand Sophia (the Whore) and the Limit (Horos, vide Horus).These Aeons all run simultaneously, i.e., they are divine emanations and as suchhave no beginning or end save in the mind of God. There is a chronology whichbegins with an Ogdoad (an initial group of eight Aeons) and which is thenaugmented by ten Aeons and then twelve additional Aeons for the total of thirtyoriginal Aeons, thus suggesting a kind of sequential order but with no fixedlength of time involved and, anyway, these Aeons exist in the Pleroma and areinaccessible by mere mortals. The Aeons of Christos and Jesus, however, doimpact directly on the created world—the world formed from the monstrousstillbirth of Sophia. This world, composed of negative elements from Sophia'sreckless quest for equality with God, is in need of Aeonic assistance and thatis why—according to the Valentinians—Christos, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus wereformed in order to bring order into the realm beyond the Pleroma.A complete discussion of the Gnostic Aeons is far beyond the scope of this bookand interested readers are urged to consult any of the standard works onGnosticism, perhaps starting with Hans Jonas and his The Gnostic Religion, whichcovers the Valentinian Gnosis in some detail. There has been much new work doneon the Valentinians (and other Gnostic groups) since the Jonas book was firstpublished but access to a good university library or database is usuallyrequired. There will be further discussion of the Aeons in the chapters thatfollow, but they will be based on the information already given.What we should take away from this chapter, however, is the fact that theGnostics were the first to talk about Aeons in an esoteric sense, and to do soin a very detailed and complex manner reminiscent of the later books of theJewish mystics and particularly of the Kabbalah. The Gnostics understood theAeons in both senses of a length of time that may not be measurable in humanterms, and as the emanation of a particular deity or divine characteristic. Toapply this reasoning to the Crowleyan Aeon of Horus we may say—in the spirit ofGnosticism—that such an Aeon would have the characteristics of Horus (howeverthey may be described) as well as a specific (but probably unknowable) length oftime or chronology. And, most importantly, from the best available data onrecord we know that while the Gnostic Aeons were created in a kind ofchronological order, in the end they all ran concurrently. They all existed atthe same time and not in any kind of consecutive order with one ending asanother began. This could be applied to the debate over the Aeon of Horus versusthe Aeon of Maat; there does not need to be a “versus” at all.But if that alone was not enough to allow an Aeon of Maat to run concurrentlywith the Aeon of Horus, there was yet another option.In the Indian system of yugas or great ages we are told that they sometimes“overlapped” as in this citation from the Bhagavata-purana:Suta Gosvami said: when the second yuga overlapped the third, the great sage[Vyasadeva] was born to Parasara in the womb of Satyavati, the daughter ofVasu.” (Bhagavata-purana, 1.4.14)Thus there is a precedent, even in Hinduism, for overlapping yugas so why notfor overlapping Aeons, their cognates? To be sure there are several differentcalculations for the lengths of the respective yugas; yet this implies (a) theyare not based on the precession of the equinoxes through the astrological signswhich most experts agree are of regular length and (b) that the yuga of onesystem will necessarily overlap the yuga of another, which is not a bad thing,but which gives rise to further calculations and refinements of thechronological system. And, according to the citation above, great things canhappen when yugas (or Aeons) overlap.The final approach that could be taken with respect to the Aeons is a purelyKabbalistic one, but one of which Crowley does not seem to have been aware. Thissystem is elaborated in the Sefer ha-Temunah or the “Book of the Image,” a textthat is usually dated to the thirteenth century. The “image” of the title refersto the shape of the Hebrew letters which were believed to contain certainsecrets. For our purposes, however, the other value of the book is in itsdiscussion of the shemittot (sing. shemitta) the “cosmic cycles” of the encodedTorah.Years were counted in multiples of seven, which were themselves multiplied byseven, so that a cycle consisted of 7 x 7 years or 49 years in total. The nextyear—the fiftieth year—was a “jubilee” year, a year in which the sins and errorsof the previous 49 years were erased and the slate cleaned and the cycle begunanew.36 [part0006_split_003.html#aft36] This was one cycle, or shemitta.Using this framework as a starting point, Bible and Kabbalah scholars have triedto ascertain the age of the universe. Each cycle of 7,000 (7 x 20 x 50) years isconsidered a Kabbalistic “age” and is related to one of the seven lower sefiroton the Tree of Life. The number 7,000 comes from a line in the Talmud37[part0006_split_003.html#aft37] that states the world will exist for 6,000 yearsand that for the 1,000 years thereafter it shall be “desolate.” According tosome Kabbalists we are living in the second age, that of Gevurah or “Severity.”Using the Jubilee formula, then, 7,000 years times 7 would equal 49,000 yearswhich would be the age of the universe. If we are living in the second cycle,that would imply that Adam was created somewhere around 7,000 years ago(depending on where we are in the second cycle, the beginning, middle, or theend).However, using a citation from the Midrash, “A thousand years in your sight arebut as yesterday” it is indicated that a thousand human years equals only oneDivine day, thus the ensuing calculations would reveal an age of the universe assomething closer to 15 billion years (if we are living in the last Kabbalisticage) which—coincidentally—matches the latest scientific estimates of the age ofthe universe.There are two implications pertinent to this study that can be found in theSefer ha-Temunah. The first is that Kabbalistic ages can be identified by aseries of sefirotic references. Thus, the very first year of the cycle is namedafter Chesed—the first of the seven sefirot below the Abyss on the Tree of Lifeand the only ones used for these calculations by the rabbis—which also gives itsname to the entire first cycle of 7,000 years, and that the second year would beGevurah, then Tiferet, etc. Thus, year two is the year Gevurah of the greatercycle year Chesed. But, of course, the interlocking ages do not end there andcan be continued indefinitely down to the smallest unit of time.This system is mirrored in the table of astrological hours used by ceremonialmagicians, in which the first hour of Sunday—for instance—would be the hour ofthe Sun, the first hour of Monday would be the hour of the Moon, and so on forthe seven days and the seven philosophical planets. These planetary hours areequivalent to the sefirotic attributes, for Chesed is considered the sphere ofJupiter (and hence of Thursday), Gevurah of Mars (and Tuesday), Tiferet of theSun (and Sunday), etc. One could then just as easily take the magician'sastrological hours and expand them to include years, multiples of years, etc. toarrive at corresponding planetary Aeons.The point of this exercise is that time periods have subsets, and that thesesubsets have the same qualities as the various time periods themselves albeitwith modifications. For example, the period Sun in the greater period Saturn(for instance) would not have the same quality of action as the period Saturn inthe greater period Saturn, or the period Saturn in the greater period Sun. Thissystem is actually used by Vedic (Indian) astrologers in their calculationmethod known as antardasas.Using this as a theory, could there be an Aeon of Maat within the greater Aeonof Horus, as a subset of Horus?As complicated—perhaps unnecessarily complicated—as all this sounds, we shouldbe reminded of a statement by Crowley himself, when he writes:...Aiwass, uttering the word Thelema (with all its implications), destroyscompletely the formula of the Dying God. Thelema implies not merely a newreligion, but a new cosmology, a new philosophy, a new ethics. It co-ordinatesthe disconnected discoveries of science, from physics to psychology, into acoherent and consistent system. Its scope is so vast that it is impossible evento hint at the universality of its application. But the whole of my work, fromthe moment of its utterance, illustrates some phase of its potentiality, and thestory of my life itself from this time on is no more than a record of myreactions to it.38 [part0006_split_003.html#aft38]Thus, a new cosmology is required, and it is entirely possible that this newcosmology would have at its heart a re-interpretation of all that has beenwritten concerning the Aeons: their nature, their number, their chronologicalorder, and their periods of time. One stands in awe at the scope of Crowley'sproject for this New Aeon, and at the same time one measures it against thewords of one of his contemporaries:The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed uslittle; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open upsuch terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, thatwe shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light intothe peace and safety of a new dark age.39 [part0006_split_003.html#aft39]Thus, Lovecraft himself was aware of the possibility of uniting the samesciences—Crowley's “disconnected discoveries” and Love-craft's “dissociatedknowledge”—and was terrified that it would one day occur, and that the Aeon ofHorus would become a “new dark age.”Which leads us to the second implication contained within the Sefer ha-Temunahand in the deliberations of its sages: the idea that the world has already beencreated and destroyed several times over. The seventh 1,000 year period of eachcycle is a time of “desolation” in which all life of the previous 6,000 years iswiped out. Depending on where we are in the great scheme of things—with expertsoffering opinions anywhere from the second cycle to the seventh—the world mayhave been destroyed at least once, and as many as six times already. This givesrise to the possibility that the 2,000 year cycle known to the astrologers couldbe replaced by the 7,000 year cycle known to the Kabbalists, meaning that theAeon of Osiris (which ended, according to Crowley, in 1904) actually began in5,096 BCE, and that the Aeon of Isis began in 12,096 BCE. Using these somewhatlarger values gives us the historic coordination we need, for 5,096 BCE placesus much earlier than pre-Dynastic Egypt and allows for the possibility that anAeon of Osiris began at that time, and that there was a pre-historic matriarchalage beginning in 12,096 BCE for which there is no written record but for whichcircumstantial evidence in the form of goddess statues and the like may beoffered to support it.40 [part0006_split_003.html#aft40]In any event, the Typhonian understanding of the Aeons is much closer to theGnostic concept. Each Aeon is an emanation, a manifestation of a particular God,and they all exist concurrently as separate forms of awareness, ofconsciousness. One could go to great lengths to try to “prove” Achad'ssystem—the above few paragraphs give an idea as to how much calculation andspeculation would be involved—but to Grant this is not necessary. The mere factthat we have imagined an Aeon of Maat is sufficient to claim its existence. Toadhere to the idea of the Aeon of Horus as being exclusive to this time andplace ignores the essential nature of the gods themselves as being beyond allconsiderations of space and time. If a middle-aged white man can sit in anashram in Goa and commune with Kali, or a teen-aged girl can stand naked in acircle and draw down the Moon, then it is probably safe to say that Maat can beapproached and her influence experienced in the present Age.Grant's anxiety—as expressed in Nightside of Eden and in his other works—is thatthe Earth is being infiltrated by a race of extraterrestrial beings who willcause tremendous changes to take place in our world. This statement is not to betaken quite as literally as it appears, for the “Earth” can be taken to mean ourcurrent level of conscious awareness, and extraterrestrial would mean simply“not of this current level of conscious awareness.” But the potential for dangeris there, and Grant's work—like Lovecraft's—is an attempt to warn us of theimpending (potentially dramatic) alterations in our physical, mental andemotional states due to powerful influences from “outside.” This“extraterrestrial” race has already been here, already made itself known (andhence the antiquity of the Typhonian Tradition, according to Grant), and isreturning to the planet in greater numbers than before and with an agenda thatonly the adepts would be able to divine. This concept is emphasized in theSchlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon, where it is stated:...for thou can never know the Seasons of Times of the Ancient Ones, even thoughthou can tell their Seasons upon the Earth by the rules I have alreadyinstructed thee to compute; for their Times and Seasons Outside run uneven andstrange to our minds, for are they not the Computors of All Time? Did They notset Time in its Place?41 [part0006_split_003.html#aft41]Thus, once again it can be shown that the Necronomicon, Crowley, and Grant arein agreement on certain specific points of interest concerning the advent of theNew Aeon. The idea that the human race is not the first on the planet is onethat has been picked up and developed into an entire mythos by H. P. Lovecraftand expanded upon by Kenneth Grant. It is linked to the Lovecraftian idea of theGreat Old Ones, gods—or alien creatures, or both—who came to the earth in “aeonspast” and who will return again. The recurring of the Aeon of the Great Old Onesis cognate with Crowley's recurring Aeons of the Egyptian gods. It is alsoconnected to another Lovecraftian theme, the idea that there are people on earthwho are in secret communication, usually telepathically but also through ritual,with the Great Old Ones and are preparing the way for their return.Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known.42[part0006_split_003.html#aft42]4 [part0006_split_001.html#ft4] Geraldine Pinch, Egyptian Myth: A very shortintroduction, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 52.5 [part0006_split_001.html#ft5] A ritual that was conducted between January 14to June 16, 1918 by Crowley and a number of others, but mostly including RoddieMinor, known as Soror Achitha 555. It should be noted that 555 is the numbermost closely associated with the Necronomicon, as it is the value of the word inits original Greek. Grant associates this number with the Necronomicon Current,just as 666 is identified with the Thelemic Current.6 [part0006_split_001.html#ft6] For instance, AL I:7: “Behold! it is revealed byAiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.” AL II:8, “Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraathhave worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper,” and AL III:35, “The half ofthe word of Heru-ra-ha, called Hoor-pa-kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khut.” Hoor-pa-kraatand Heru-pa-kraath are both original Egyptian forms of the later GreekHarpocrates. The name also figures prominently in the initiation rituals of theGolden Dawn.7 [part0006_split_001.html#ft7] See, for instance, Aleister Crowley, The Equinoxof the Gods, Chapter 8: “This child Horus is a twin, two in one. Horus andHarpocrates are one, and they are also one with Set or Apophis, the destroyer ofOsiris. It is by the destruction of the principle of death that they are born.”8 [part0006_split_001.html#ft8] See for instance his statement linking Aiwasswith the Shaitan of the Yezidi: “Aiwaz is not a mere formula, like many Angelicnames, but it is the true, most ancient name of the God of the Yezidi, and thusreturns to the highest antiquity. Our work is therefore historically authentic;the rediscovery of the Sumerian tradition.” In Kenneth Grant, The MagicalRevival, Friedrich Muller, London, 1972, p. 529 [part0006_split_001.html#ft9] The Great Bear constellation figures prominentlyin both the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon and in Kenneth Grant'swork. The importance of this constellation—often neglected by westernoccultists—is detailed in the author's own Stairway to Heaven: ChineseAlchemists, Jewish Kabbalists and the Art of Spiritual Transformation.10 [part0006_split_001.html#ft10] See the author's trilogy, Sinister Forces:Agrimoire of American political witchcraft (Trine Day, Walterville (OR), 2005,2011) in particular volume 3, chapter 17: “Voluntary Madness,” for a moredetailed explanation of this connection.11 [part0006_split_001.html#ft11] See, for instance, The Equinox of the Gods: “Ilay claim to be the sole authority competent to decide disputed points withregard to the Book of the Law, seeing that its Author, Aiwaz, is none other thanmine own Holy Guardian Angel, to Whose Knowledge and Conversation I haveattained, so that I have exclusive access to Him. I have duly referred everydifficulty to Him directly, and received His answer; my award is thereforeabsolute without appeal.”12 [part0006_split_001.html#ft12] “I now incline to believe that Aiwass is notonly the God or Demon or Devil once held holy in Sumer, and mine own GuardianAngel, but also a man as I am, insofar as He uses a human body to make Hismagical link with Mankind, whom He loves, and that He is thus an Ipsissimus, theHead of the AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]” Ibid.13 [part0006_split_001.html#ft13] See The Master Plan by Heather Pringle, or theauthor's own Unholy Alliance and Ratline for more details on the anthropologicalfantasies of the Nazis.14 [part0006_split_001.html#ft14] “Isa” is the Arabic form of the name “Jesus,”and thus “Isa the sufferer” is an apt description but may not be what theSpeaker intended. The Golden Dawn mudra for Isis specifically refers to her as“mourning,” and the characteristic of the Book of the Law is overwhelminglyEgyptian. While Crowley believed that Isa was a reference to Jesus, it ispossible that he is mistaken in this regard. It should also be noted that thepreferred pronounciation of “Isis” is “ee-set” or “ee-sa.”15 [part0006_split_002.html#ft15] Aleister Crowley, Confessions, p. 39916 [part0006_split_002.html#ft16] The number fifteen is suggestive. Grantunderstands it to be the number of female secretions known as kalas, which willbe discussed later. Taken as a male/female pair, however, we are at the point ofunderstanding the central secret of the OTO as well as of western esotericismgenerally.17 [part0006_split_002.html#ft17] Cf: Liber AL I:29 “For I am divided for love'ssake, for the chance of union” for a Thelemite analogue. In this case thespeaker is the goddess Nuit.18 [part0006_split_002.html#ft18] From the Greek horothetes, the “giver oflimit.” Had it been Aramaic, however, the word horos would imply “father” as inhor, horah. There is some dispute on this issue. But it becomes more interestingin light of the fact that Crowley—in at least one place—confuses the Aeon of theFather with the Son. In his Confessions, in a chapter entitled “The HistoricalConception on Which the Book of the Law is Based” he writes: “To recapitulatethe historical basis of The Book of the Law, let me say that evolution (withinhuman memory) shows three great steps: (1) the worship of the Mother,continually breeding by her own virtue; (2) the worship of the Son, reproducinghimself by virtue of voluntary death and resurrection; (3) the worship of theCrowned and Conquering Child (the Aeon announced by Aiwass and implied in HisWord, Thelema.” (Reproduced in Aleister Crowley, Magick, p. 703) In this caseCrowley has once again emphasized the now-disproven chronology ofmatriarchy-patriarchy, but more importantly he states that the Aeon of Osiriswas the Aeon of the Son (i.e., of Jesus and other slain gods; Osiris may beconsidered in the same category of dead and resurrected god, but in what way canOsiris be considered a “son”?). The concept of patriarchy would seem to havebeen replaced—in at least this single instance in Crowley's published work—by afiliarchy.19 [part0006_split_002.html#ft19] Mordechai Gilula, “An Egyptian Etymology ofthe Name of Horus” in the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, p. 259, Vol. 68.(1982), pp. 259—26520 [part0006_split_002.html#ft20] Kenneth Grant, Aleister Crowley and the HiddenGod, Friedrich Muller, London, 1973.21 [part0006_split_002.html#ft21] See Victor Turner, The Ritual Process:Structure and Anti-structure.

For a more Crowleyan context, one should refer to his notes on The ParisWorking (a series of occult rituals devoted to Jupiter which took place in thatcity from Dec 31, 1913 to Feb. 12, 1914) in which he writes: “The name of thisPhallus is Thoth, Hermes or Ma. Ma is the god who seduced the Phallus away fromthe Yoni; hence the physical Universe. All worlds are excreta; they representwasted semen.”24 [part0006_split_002.html#ft24] A word which, incidentally, means “spilledseed.”25 [part0006_split_002.html#ft25] This world has given some newcomers to Thelemaa headache, for it seems it can be found nowhere else except in Crowley's work.A tour through the usual search engines shows up nothing. However, the termThemaist appears in the Golden Dawn rituals with some associated detail, and inseveral different forms, thus illustrating once more how essential it is for anunderstanding of Thelema and Crowley's ouevre to have access to the Golden Dawnmaterial as a basis. See for instance Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, St Paul,Llewellyn, p. 339 “The Enterer of the Threshold”: “Before the Face of the Godsin the ‘Place of the Threshold' is the name of Hegemon, and She is the GoddessThma-Ae-St having the following Coptic forms: Thma-Ae-St ... Thma-aesh ...Thmaa-ett...” etc., and for the same names written in Coptic script, see p. 352Ibid. On page 375 of the same work we find four different versions of the nameThma-Est (this time) associated with the four letters of the Divine Name, YHVHwith the further clarification “In the Equinox ceremony, the Hegemon in Air,Spirit, and the principal officer. She reconciles from East to West, and fromNorth to South, and in a circular formulae.”26 [part0006_split_002.html#ft26] Leaders of Egypt's Salafi party as well assome more extreme members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who began the call afterthe election of a Muslim Brotherhood candidate to the Egyptian presidency afterthe ouster of Hosni Mubarrak in 2012.27 [part0006_split_002.html#ft27] The slogan “The Method of Science—The Aim ofReligion” appears on the title page of every volume of Crowley's occultperiodical, The Equinox.28 [part0006_split_002.html#ft28] AL I:37: “Also the mantras and spells; theobeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the sword; these heshall learn and teach.” The terms obeah and wanga refer explicitly toAfro-Caribbean religions. This is a theme that was picked up and expanded byGrant in association with Michel Bertiaux, a Chicago-based magician whodeveloped a system of magic out of elements of Haitian voudon. This will bediscussed in greater detail in the chapters that follow. Crowley had access tosome of this material through his friendship with the author and adventurerWilliam Seabrook, but seems not to have made use of it. His interpretations ofthese words as published in his New Commentary are wholly implausible and ignoretheir obvious Afro-Caribbean meanings. Why?29 [part0006_split_002.html#ft29] Confucius (551-479 BCE) was not a Mongol, buta Han Chinese of Shandong Province. “Mongol” may be a reference to the religionof the Mongolians which was an indigenous religion known as Tengriism (theworship of the Mongolian deity Tengri). One will find elements of Buddhism,shamanism, and even Islam among the Mongols at various times. But at the timethe Book of the Law was written, most Mongols were Buddhists and had been forcenturies; alongside their indigenous religion of Tengriism which was alreadydying out and would be gradually replaced by atheism, introduced by the Chineseat the time of the Communist revolution. Thus, there is no legitimate way toconnect Confucius with the term Mongol. “Din” is an even more difficultreference. Crowley attempts to connect it to Judaism—the Hebrew word din meaning“judgment”—but the attribution is unworthy of him, as “Din” in this context isclearly referring to another race, i.e., “Mongol and Din.” Another option is toassume that he heard the phrase incorrectly, and that “Mongol and Din” wasreally “Mongol ad-Din.”Ad-Din is an Arabic term for “of the faith,” and in thiscontext the entire line may be read as “With my claws I tear out the flesh ofthe Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol ad-Din” or “... the flesh of the Indian andthe Buddhist Mongol of the Faith.” As the Mongols were Buddhists, it may be areference to a specific cultus or a specific personage within the cultus. Therewere several Muslim military leaders with the surname “ad-Din” and “al-Din” whofought the Mongols during various invasions. This is, however, a fancifulsuggestion but is more logical than assuming “Din” is a reference to the Jews.Even the Islamic leader prominent in Templar lore was named Saladin, which is aEuropeanization of the name Salah ad-Din..30 [part0006_split_003.html#ft30] For instance, in the “Old Comment” to The Bookof the Law in The Equinox, volume 1 number VII: “Following him will arise theEquinox of Ma, the Goddess of Justice, it may be a hundred or ten thousand yearsfrom now; for the Computation of Time is not here as There.” He further explainsthis in his Confessions when he writes, “I may now point out that the reign ofthe Crowned and Conquering Child is limited in time by The Book of the Lawitself. We learn that Horus will be in his turn succeeded by Thmaist, theDouble-Wanded One; she who shall bring the candidates to full initiation, andthough we know little of her peculiar characteristics, we know at least that hername is justice.” p. 399. (Thmaist is a variant of Maat used by the Golden Dawnand not found elsewhere, presumably a conflation of Themis—the Greek goddess ofJustice—and Maat. Crowley explicitly identifies Thmaist with Maat, for instancein his The Book of Thoth where he identifies the ‘double-wanded one’ of ALIII:34 as “Maat, Themis, the Lady of the Balance”: Aleister Crowley, The Book ofThoth, Samuel Weiser, York (ME), 1974, p. 25)31 [part0006_split_003.html#ft31] This is a point that has been brought up by J.Daniel Gunther in his Initiation in the Aeon of the Child, where he states“These views are irreconcilable with historical evidence, and should thereforebe reconsidered. If we are truly to understand the progression of the Aeons, itmust be done by studying empirical evidence, not by static adherence totraditional interpretations. The Method of Science cannot be hamstrung by theAim of Religion.” (Gunther, p. 166.) Gunther is a member of Crowley's AImage[../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg] and is considered an experton Thelema. This same attitude should be applied to all of the Crowley material,of course.32 [part0006_split_003.html#ft32] Frater Achad, The Egyptian Revival, SamuelWeiser, NY, 197433 [part0006_split_003.html#ft33] The relevant citation is from AL I:54-56:“Change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! thou, o prophet, shaltnot behold all these mysteries hidden therein. The child of thy bowels, he shallbehold them. Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from noexpected house cometh that child. Aum!”34 [part0006_split_003.html#ft34] The author, who has long personal experienceof Eastern Orthodox liturgics and especially those of the Russian and Slavicchurches, finds this explanation suspect as Crowley's Mass has much more incommon with Roman Catholic versions of the same than with Orthodox forms. And,especially, no Orthodox clergyman or lay person would refer to the DivineLiturgy as a “Mass” which is strictly a Roman Catholic term from the Latinmissa. (The Orthodox churches do not use Latin.) However, the apostolicsuccession of the Gnostic Catholic Church owes more to renegade Orthodoxlineages than to normative Catholic ones.35 [part0006_split_003.html#ft35] As represented in the famous Thelemicgreeting, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law” and its response,“Love is the law, love under will,” both taken from the Book of the Law.36 [part0006_split_003.html#ft36] There is some debate over whether the Jubileeyear is the 49th year or the 50th year.37 [part0006_split_003.html#ft37] Sanhedrin, 97A.38 [part0006_split_003.html#ft38] Crowley, Confessions, p. 39839 [part0006_split_003.html#ft39] H.

This would have been the Maat sub-period of the greater Horusperiod. Interestingly, 1946 plus 49 years gives us the year 2001, the year wheneveryone says “the world changed.”41 [part0006_split_003.html#ft41] Simon, Necronomicon, p. 217.42 [part0006_split_003.html#ft42] AL I:10"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOGODS, THE BEAST, AND MENA church of magic does not exist.—Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, p. 43 (emphasis inoriginal)ONE HESITATES TO REFUTE or contradict the father of modern sociology, but at thetime the above classic was published—in 1912—there already was a church ofmagic. In fact, there were several. Durkheim's statement reflects hisunderstanding that magic is not amenable to rituals of group worship, since theapproach to the sacred that is undertaken by the magician is a “delicateoperation that requires precautions and a more or less complicated initiation...”43 [part0007_split_005.html#aft43] This did not stop the French magiciansJules Doinel (1842-1903) from creating (in 1890) and Papus (Gerard Encausse,1865-1916) from joining (in 1892) a “Gnostic Catholic Church”; nor did it stopCrowley from using a version of the Gnostic Catholic Church as his vehicle forThelema, writing a Gnostic Mass in 1913 (a year after Durkheim's work waspublished). Whether or not such a church is an effective tool for magic and thegoals of magic remains to be seen, however. Anyone witnessing some of thecelebrations of the Mass by members of the Gnostic Catholic Church at varioustimes over the previous five decades or so would have recognized obviousdifferences in style from those of normative Christian denominations. It may beargued that magicians are not priests by nature—they are individual, solitarypersons devoted more to their own spiritual development than to the spiritualityof a group. Further, a magician's approach to a public, communal ritual mayleave something to be desired, particularly when the magician takes as his orher template an established ritual like the Catholic Mass with nearly twothousand years of history behind it and its celebration and then proceeds toalter it considerably to suit what can only be described as an opposingtheological weltanschauung. At best, you have an imitation of the original, akind of “cover” version that may leave one yearning nostalgically for theoriginal. At worst, the results can range from the scandalous to the hilarious... to the just plain sad. Given the options, one easily prefers the scandalous.The scandalous might have been Crowley's intent in the early days of thetwentieth century but now, in the early days of the twenty-first century, whatCrowley saw as challenging and provocative hardly constitutes cause forcensorship or suppression (except perhaps by the religious Right, but they areeasily inflamed). Crowley wanted to institutionalize (and make popularlyaccessible) the religious and philosophical precepts underpinning his new faithof Thelema. He saw the Mass—and the Gnostic Catholic Church—as the vehicle fordoing this, much in the way the Catholic Mass can be seen as the vehicle forproclaiming and celebrating the doctrines and theology of Roman Catholicism. ButCrowley was a magician, first and foremost. His teachings are couched in magicallanguage and magical references. Virtually all of his writings were designed forthose belonging to one or both of his most important magical societies, theAImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg], and the OTO, neitherof which were designed with communities of worshippers in mind but which arepredicated on the idea of individual (not group) attainment.His theology is easily summed up in the familiar “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law” and “Love is the law, love under will.” It was antinomian,authoritarian, and transgressive. After one exhorts everyone to do their will,that every man and every woman is a star, there is not much else to the theologyor the doctrine. The core of Thelema is in the work itself, the Great Work ofuniting oneself with one's Holy Guardian Angel (to use the Golden Dawn andAImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg] terminology), andthat is an individual and not a group endeavor.44[part0007_split_005.html#aft44]The famous Biblical Ten Commandments—handed down to Moses from God—consists ofthree commandments concerning sins against God and seven commandmentsprohibiting sin against the community. There is no identification of sinsagainst one's self. It is as if God and community were all that matteredspiritually; that if one abides by the rules of God and family then one hasalready avoided sin against one's self. What Thelema does is question thatassumption: in other words, is it possible to sin against one's self? TheThelemic answer is a definite “yes.” If one obeys the commandments concerningGod and community to the detriment of one's self then one is sinning againstone's self. What Crowley does is turn the assumptions implicit in the Abrahamicreligions on their head by insisting that the individual matters more than thecommunity or, to be more precise, that the salvation or preservation of thecommunity is dependent upon the spiritual growth of its component individuals.This, of course, is the magical worldview and always has been, ever since thebifurcation between the needs of the individual and the state took placesometime in misty antiquity.45 [part0007_split_005.html#aft45] What Crowley hadattempted to do was to codify the magical worldview as a religious worldview,applicable to all.Thus the tension between the magical worldview and the requirements of anorganized church contributes to confusion concerning the liturgics. Crowley'sreligion has sexual mysteries at its heart, and Crowley—as a magician—wasdevoted to its prosyletizing. He understood the sacrament of the Mass—and mostespecially the rite of transubstantiation—as a Gnostic rite of transformation,and it can be argued that this is so, or certainly can be interpreted that way.The problem remains, however, how to teach this concept to the general public ifit has no background in religious studies, Gnosticism, or Tantrism, much lessKabbalah or ceremonial magic?A further difficulty is raised by the unitary form of the Catholic Mass and itssingle priest-celebrant. This dynamic was transformed by the Crowley church intoa dual priesthood of a man and a woman, a priest and a priestess. On a verybasic liturgical level this presents problems in conceptualization, but mostimportantly, in the identification of two individuals with the appropriatetransformative Power which must take place simultaneously and in harmony. Thereare other, more easily organized, rituals that involve male and femaleparticipants which could have been used instead (or simply invented), but it wasCrowley's intention to use the Catholic Mass as the basic structure, possiblywith a view towards forcing the public to understand the sexual component of arite with which they were already familiar—albeit in a different context—andthus providing a kind of legitimacy of lineage, much in the same way paganshrines in Europe were converted into Catholic holy places by the building ofchurches on the same spots.All of this, however, is predicated upon Crowley's religion and itsunderstanding of the nature of the Gods.Central to most descriptions of religions is this concept of a God or Gods.While the word “religion” is relatively new, and is in fact problematic in somecultures which do not recognize this artificial distinction between spiritualityand other areas of culture, we can assume for the sake of this essay thatreligions (popularly understood) rely upon the existence of some kind ofsupernatural Power, Creator or Cosmic Judge we call a God.One of the most bewildering aspects of Thelema to outsiders is the near-chaoticassembly of gods, goddesses and techniques from religious traditions spanningthe globe and the centuries. We have seen some of this in the previous chapter.While the Book of the Law is focused on Egyptian gods, by the time one isfinished with even a cursory look at Crowley's writings, one realizes that Egyptis not the only cultural touchstone for the movement.46[part0007_split_005.html#aft46]Crowley's own self-identification with the Beast of the Book of Revelation—andhis soror mystica as the Scarlet Woman or Whore of Babylon (Babalon, to use hisspelling)—seems at first glance to be out of synch with the rest of hisphilosophy. After all, the Beast 666 and the Whore of Babylon are charactersspecific to the Christian Bible. How does one rectify the Biblical personalitieswith ancient Egyptian or Sumerian archetypes?Crowley's early childhood was spent in the somewhat lethal embrace of aChristian sect called the Plymouth Brethren. In fact, he attended schools run bythe Brethren for most of his childhood and adolescence, only escaping thedenomination by the time he enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1895. As achild, his mother would refer to him as “the Beast” with its obvious Biblicalconnotations and it seems Crowley took the appelation to heart, particularly ashe got older and began to question Christianity. He never abandoned the Beastnomenclature, however, for he seemed to feel that this was an aspect of hisidentity—not only as a human being, as his mother's son, but—as a magician and aprophet of the New Age. Thus, in order to overthrow the Old Age he came toidentify himself with its anti-god, the Beast of Revelation. This would predateany exposure Crowley had to the rich fabric of Egyptian spirituality.It was most likely his introduction to the Golden Dawn that gave Crowley hisbackground in Egyptian religion and in the names of their gods. As we have seenin the previous chapter, he took those names to heart and they resurfaced in hisBook of the Law and in the Holy Books: names such as Hoor-paar-kraat,Ra-hoor-khuit and Thma-est (which spellings are not found in popular works onEgyptology) make their way into Crowley's religion, as well as the concept ofthe Equinox of the Gods and the associated rotation of its divine officersthroughout the year.But he also added a liberal dose of Greek and Roman concepts as well as someAsian ideas. While the Golden Dawn had a few Asian-inspired documents—such asinstructions concerning the tattwas (Indian elemental forms) and some basic yogaexercises—it was rather more focused on western esoterica than “Orientalia.”This may be due to the example of the Theosophical Society, which began as arepository ofwestern occult and hermetic ideas but which rapidly switched itsfocus to India and to Buddhism and indigenous Indian religions (normally groupedunder the rubric “Hinduism”). Blavatsky's growing obsession with India and Tibetchanged the characteristics of the Theosophical Society to such an extent thatthere was really very little room for Hermetica or western esoterica in general.Kabbalah was ignored, as was ceremonial magic. These were areas that were pickedup and developed to a greater degree by the Golden Dawn and its Masoniccreators, thus filling a void that had been created by the TheosophicalSociety's abandonment of its western esoteric roots.Crowley, therefore, represented a bridge between both societies. While hisinitiations and instruction in spirituality began with the Golden Dawn, and henever really left the embrace of its initiatic structure,47[part0007_split_005.html#aft47] he did absorb some of the Asian techniques thatwere the focus of the Theosophical Society. He advocated practices suchaspranayama (breath control), asana (yoga postures), and the attainment ofsamadhi (a higher state of consciousness reached through intensive meditation,analogous to a non-dualist state of awareness in which subject and object areone).48 [part0007_split_005.html#aft48] He recognized samadhi as an essentialelement of his own personal development and encouraged the pursuit of thisenlightened state of consciousness among his followers.49[part0007_split_005.html#aft49]But this did not mean that he was a Buddhist or a “Hindu” by any stretch of theimagination.50 [part0007_split_005.html#aft50] In fact, he broke with his goodfriend Alan Bennett (the Bhikku Ananda Metteya) over this issue. He was morethan willing to take what he could from the supermarket of religious ideas, buthe was not loyal to any one brand. In this, perhaps, he was typical of thestereotypical New Ager, who is a spiritual dilettante and who picks over ancientreligious traditions like a shopper in a fruit and vegetable stand ... but withone important and crucial difference: unlike many of today's New Age spiritualseekers, Crowley did not skim the surfaces of the traditions he investigated butdived in completely. He had to know and to experience what these traditionsoffered, and he subjected himself to strenuous physical and intellectual pursuitof this knowledge. The fact that he was at leisure for much of his early life,due to an inheritance from his father's estate, contributed to his ability towander the world and devote himself to spiritual pursuits. He would incorporatesignificant amounts of these traditions into his own occult orders and into hisreligion of Thelema, and while we may argue about his selection process orquestion the assumptions upon which some of the intellectual material is based,there can be no doubt that there was a strong element of sincerity in Crowley'sapproach.Crowley believed in his own system, in his role as a prophet, and in the Book ofthe Law. There can be no other explanation for his life's work than this. Thus,in order to comprehend the ramifications and implications ofThelema—particularly as represented in the Typhonian Tradition—we need tounderstand Crowley's concept of the Gods."},{"pageContent":"APOCALYPSE NOWAs mentioned, Crowley's first exposure to religion was in a Christianfundamentalist household, whose members belonged to the sect known as thePlymouth Brethren. Like many Protestant denominations with an extreme view ofscripture, this one placed an emphasis on the Book of Revelation, also known asthe Apocalypse. This is a controversial text, dealing with the End of Days andthe Final Judgement. It is couched in esoteric symbolism, more than any otherBiblical text, and defies easy interpretation, but it is within its pages thatwe come across such famous concepts as the “number of the Beast” which is 666,as well as the Beast himself, and the Whore of Babylon. It is a book thatforetells the fall of Rome and/or Jerusalem, and a final, cosmic battle betweenthe forces of Light and Darkness. There are dragons, trumpets, and angels galoreand it is beyond the scope of this (or most any) book to give a full andcoherent description of its contents or to analyze its meaning.51[part0007_split_005.html#aft51] Rather, we shall focus on the handful ofelements that meant most to Crowley and which surfaced so prominently in hiscultus.The Book of Revelation virtually overshadows the rest of the New Tesament due toits surreal, cinematic imagery and its prophecies of doom. Those who focus onthis text tend to neglect the message of the Gospels in favor of the moredrastic condemnations of the Church's enemies.One of these enemies is the Beast. According to many theologians, thisparticular Beast symbolizes Rome and the persecution of Christians by the Romanemperor. The number of the Beast is 666, but no further clarification of thisnumber is given in the text. Some believe it is a coded reference to the emperorNero. In any event, that number has come to be synonymous with evil incarnateand is frequently cited as a reference to the Devil itself.It is important to note that there are two beasts mentioned in Revelations. Thefirst comes out of the sea—the abyss—and the second from out of the earth. Theyare each empowered by the Dragon, to whom they evidently owe their allegiance.Thus, there is some confusion in Thelemic circles as to just what Beast Crowleywas referring to, and why. Of course, he favored the 666 designation, making himthe Beast of the Earth, known to readers of the Bible as the “False Prophet.”Crowley would adopt the number as his own, and offer pages of Kabbalistic-styleanalysis of its meaning. He was able to show that the Greek term To Mega Therionor “the Great Beast” added up to 666 when using Greek numerology, or gematria.52[part0007_split_005.html#aft52] Gematria is a system of numerology in whichletters (of the Greek or Hebrew alphabet) equal numbers. When a word has thesame numerical value as another word, then a relationship between them both isassumed to the extent that one word may clarify or justify the other. (Thisfascination with gematria has bedeviled Thelema for much of its existence todate; it became a focus of Frater Achad's symbol system and, later, of KennethGrant's analysis of Thelema which would take gematria to near ridiculouslengths. The idea that the Bible contains coded information is central toKabbalistic exegesis as well as more recent textual analysis such as The BibleCode and its heirs. It is by no means unique to Thelema.)The fact that there are two Beasts in Revelation, plus one Dragon, begs thequestion: could there be, or have there been, other contenders in Thelema forthese available designations? Was there a human Beast of the Abyss? Moreimportantly, perhaps, was there a physical/biological Dragon in a Thelemiccontext? The answers to both of these questions has to be a somewhat qualified“no.” Crowley was not taking the entire text of Revelation as a blueprint forhis own religion, but only that section of it that he believed seemed to referto himself. But one has to wonder if Crowley ever considered that there might beanother human manifestation from Revelation. This will lead us to the example ofJack Parsons, who famously identified himself with the Anti-Christ, and we willlook at that in another chapter.Why Crowley would identify himself with the Devil is an important point and onewhich will lead us directly to the concept of the Dark Lord. For Crowley, theDevil is something more ancient and more respectable than the caricature we comeacross in normative Christian imagery. The Devil represents everything theChurch wants to suppress, and this includes most especially expressions of humansexuality.Crowley's view of Satanism and Devil-worship would have been colored by theContinental obsession with the Black Mass. This ritual famously blasphemes theCatholic Mass, but in order to do so makes use of sexual elements. Thus, a womanis used in place of the altar; coitus is performed on the woman in place of thetransubstantiation of the bread and wine.53 [part0007_split_005.html#aft53]These are all the scandalous aspects of the Black Mass as it was popularlyunderstood through such vehicles as J. K. Huysmann's best-selling novel, Là-Basor “Down There.” In this context, sexuality is transgressive. It is used toattack the Church at its most delicate and important point: the sacrifice of theMass itself, the central ritual of the faith that is normally celebrated bycelibate priests. Crowley would take up this theme in his own Catholic-inspiredGnostic Mass in which the sexual elements are once again represented, albeit ina more sedate way than in the rapacious rituals of the nineteenth-century Frenchesthetes.54 [part0007_split_005.html#aft54]To Crowley, the restrictive attitudes of the Church were themselves sinful. Asit is written in the Book of the Law: “The word of Sin is Restriction” (ALI:41). This is a subtle play on words, for the exact meaning of the term“religion” is derived from the Latin religio, itself probably derived from theverb ligare which means “to bind” (as in the modern English ligature). Themeaning of the sentence to a Thelemite is clear: it is religion that is sinful,religion that “binds.” Such restriction is anathema to a doctrine whose centralaffirmation of faith is “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” ThusCrowley, by identifying with the great enemy of the Church—the Beast 666—isaligning himself with the enemy of restriction, and therefore with the freeexpression of all forms of human sexuality: the ultimate example of sin and animportant target of the Abrahamic religions. This is emphasized by the rest ofthe verse quoted above:The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! Olover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond55 [part0007_split_005.html#aft55]that can unite the divided but love: all else is a curse. Accurséd! Accurséd beit to the aeons! Hell. (AL I:41)This emphasis on love rather than law as the touchstone for human relationshipsis one element of Thelema that sets it apart from mainstream religion. When lovegoes, according to the verse, then so should the lover. This dissociates the actof love from legal considerations, whether of religion or of secular government.It is most especially—given the context—an attack on the sacrament of matrimonyand on religiously-sanctioned marriage. If marriage is subtracted from theequation, what is left? Either pure eros—sexuality as a form of humanrelationship—or something even deeper: a relationship based not only onsexuality popularly understood, but on emotional attraction and attachment theway many adolescents experience it—without a legal or a religious context,something approaching Jungian ideas of archetypes or Freudian ideas of repressederotic feelings for one's parent. As Crowley himself is known to have had bothmale and female lovers, married and unmarried, this seems consistent with hisworldview. But it is inconsistent with the mainstream religions of his time, andhe would be moved to see in the Beast a force of resistance against thestrictures of the establishment, of the status quo, because he perceived them asobstacles to a fuller knowledge of the Self. It is this tension between the Selfand Community (particularly in the sphere of sexuality and human relationships)that is the focal point of Thelema, at least as understood by some of its mostprominent apologists such as Kenneth Grant. It is also the point at whichLovecraft balks, pointing to the transgressive magician and sorcerer as thecause of the community's vulnerability to forces from Outside.By identifying himself—in a positive way—with the Beast, Crowley was performinga kind of self-therapy. He was taking the suppressed and repressed elements of apersonality that had been molded by a normative and restrictive Christian sectand liberating them by means of re-characterizing them as positive values andnot negative impulses.56 [part0007_split_005.html#aft56] It was perhaps moreimportant for Crowley to self-identify this way than it was for his followers,for whom the Beast of the Book of Revelation might have less powerful (evenconfusing) associations. It marked his independence from Christian—and henceEnglish—society and its expectations of conformity. It was dramatic, certainly,especially for the time. But was there more substance to the image than that?To answer that question we must visit another powerful image of the Book ofRevelation, the Whore of Babylon.This personality is as complex and mysterious as the Beast. It is obviously acoded reference that made a lot of sense at the time, and in the millenia sincethe Book of Revelation was written there have been numerous attempts to analyzeand identify the Whore in contemporary contexts. Where Crowley was concerned,the Whore of Babylon could only be a reference to his Consort, of whom he hadquite a series that he called “Scarlet Women.”In the Book of Revelation the Whore of Babylon is referred to as “Babylon theGreat, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth” (Revelations 17:3-6).Babylon was a reference to the alien culture that had crushed the Israelites anddestroyed Solomon's Temple, and which thus became a code word for the RomanEmpire that was the object of scorn of the writer of Revelations. Like Rome,Babylon was viewed as an “evil empire” bent on destroying God's people. At thetime the Book of Revelation was being written—about the first century CE—theland of Israel was under Roman domination. Both Christians (at the time littlemore than a Jewish sect) and Jews were being persecuted as a result of theirrefusal to obey the edicts of Emperor Domitian, who demanded that everyone inhis empire worship him as a god ... or be executed.The Whore of Babylon is depicted as wearing purple and scarlet robes, andholding a golden cup filled with “the abominations and filthiness of herfornication.” She sat on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and wasdrunk on the blood of saints and martyrs. (Purple was the color of Roman royaltyand was forbidden to the average citizen, so its inclusion here is instructive.)Crowley incorporated this personality—one is hard-pressed to refer to her as agod, at least not in her Biblical persona—into his religion as thepersonification of the female principle of the universe, as Shakti: the femalepartner to the Beast, who represents the male principle, or Shiva. The cup of“abominations” is an analogue of the commingled male and female essences thatare known as amrita in the East. And, just as in Revelation the Beast wassubordinate to the Dragon, in Crowley's theological structure the Beast issubordinate to other powers.In order to clarify these admittedly bizarre relationships it is worthwhile tohave recourse to the Thelemic Creed as offered in the liturgy of the GnosticMass, written by Crowley:I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the company ofStars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; and in oneFather of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name CHAOS, the sole viceregent ofthe Sun upon Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes.And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein allmen are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her nameBABALON.And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His nameBAPHOMET.And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love andLiberty, the Word of whose Law is THELEMA.And I believe in the communion of Saints.And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritualsubstance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle ofIncarnation.And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, and is tocome.AUMGN, AUMGN, AUMGN.Readers who were brought up Roman Catholic—like the present author—may beforgiven if they recognize what seems to be a travesty of the Apostles' Creed oftheir youth. The basic formula is the same:I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again.He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.He will come again to judge the living and the dead.I believe in the Holy Spirit,the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints,the forgiveness of sins,the resurrection of the body,and life everlasting.Amen.In both versions—Thelemic and Roman Catholic—the emphasis in the first lines ison a profession of faith in a creator God, termed a Father. That this isdifferent from the “ineffable LORD” in the Thelemic Creed seems clear from thetext. Here, the Father is the “Father of Life,” and is the vice-regent of theSun on earth. And, somewhat disconcertingly perhaps, his name is CHAOS. Chaoswas, indeed, one of the appelations of the Egyptian god Set and he is referredto as such in the Greek magical papyri.57 [part0007_split_005.html#aft57] A godwith the name Chaos would not be a reference to Osiris, or Horus, or Thoth, orRa or any of the other more popular deities. Chaos is associated, in Egypt andin the Near and Middle East of the period (first century CE at the latest), withSet and with Set-Typhon. And the Star to which the Creed refers could onlybe—for Grant and the Typhonians—the Pole Star with its seven circumpolarattendants the Big Dipper (or, as it was known in Egypt, the “Thigh of Set”).The very important statement concerning “one Star in the company of Stars ofwhose fire we are created, and to which we shall return,” implies theextra-terrestrial origins of humanity and by extension its ultimate destination.This “Star” has been identified as the Sun, of whom the Father is the solevice-regent, but I believe this is a blind (as were the seven “planets” inMithraism58 [part0007_split_005.html#aft58]) for the “real” Sun, which is theimmortal Pole Star, a sun that never rises or sets but which sits unmovingdirectly overhead.The name CHAOS has been interpreted to mean Air and Gas. The first statement ofthe Thelemic Creed ends with “Air, the nourisher of all that breathes” and isthus connected with CHAOS, the Star, and the Father.The very next doctrinal statement in the Creed identifies BABALON as “the Motherof us all” and as the Earth itself. We therefore have the Sky and the Earth—Airand Earth—CHAOS and BABALON as the first divinities enumerated in the Creed.This is followed by BAPHOMET, which was Crowley's name in the OTO.Thus, we have two Ur-gods—CHAOS and BABALON—followed by the name of the Prophetof the New Aeon, BAPHOMET or Crowley himself. This requires us to look moreclosely at BABALON since Crowley was fixated on her and on what she represented,clarifying that his succession of (female) magical partners—the ScarletWomen—were but avatars of Babalon.The three Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam—do not elevate thefemale principle to the level of divinity. For that reason they are oftenreferred to as “patriarchal” religions. From the previous chapter, we rememberthat Crowley—like some of the anthropologists of his day—believed that thepatriarchal era was preceded by a matriarchal one. While this theory has largelybeen disproved on the basis of archaeological and other evidence, it nonethelessremains a strong concept among those professing a New Age worldview. One istempted to imagine what the world would look like if matriarchal—as opposed topatriarchal—religions were the dominant force in the west.In the east, however, women—and female representations of godhead—are morecommon. In India, goddesses are of supreme importance especially among specificsects that worship Kali, Durga, Shakti, etc. In China, among the Daoists and theBuddhists, Quan Yin is an extremely important goddess and believed to be theChinese version of the Indian Avalokitesvara, the (male) God of Compassion. Evenin predominantly Muslim Indonesia, the goddesses Sri, Lara Kidul, and Durga arestill important and still reverenced.59 [part0007_split_005.html#aft59]Thelemic documents, including the Book of the Law and the Gnostic Mass, revealthe desire to reinstate awareness of the feminine aspect of divinity. Consciousthat this is an antinomian position to take, the feminine aspect that is mostidentified and cherished is that of the Whore of Babylon, perhaps the mosttransgressive female image in all of Christendom.As Gail Corrington Streete has discussed at some length60[part0007_split_005.html#aft60] the Whore of Babylon (porne megale) is but oneiteration of the “foreign woman” of the Bible, the seducer of Israel who triesto tempt men away from the True Faith. But the “foreign woman” is also the Queenof Sheba, who tempted Solomon himself with the worship of foreign gods; she isJezebel; and so many other strong yet strange women in the Bible who representnot only “woman” in general but ideas related to foreign-ness, to the alien, andthe Other. Like Set, Babalon is a foreign deity. Set may represent ideas ofmasculine or male chaos where Babalon represents the feminine or female aspectof chaos. They are the Yang and Yin, respectively, of every antinomian andunorthodox belief and practice.But there is another possible motive for this idealization of the Whore ofBabylon and it may rest in the sexual mysteries themselves, the ones thatCrowley learned from the OTO of Karl Kellner and Theodor Reuss, which placed anemphasis on the mingling of both male and female sexual excretions. This “sexmagic” at the heart of the OTO mysteries is what has been elaborated upon atgreat length by Kenneth Grant and it forms the initiatic process of theTyphonian Current. In this context, a “whore” is a sexually-promiscuous woman, awoman who has sex for money or other favors, and as such is a threat to otherwomen because of the implied devaluation of sexual intimacy between husband andwife: the characterization of sexuality as a biological function that can bebought and sold like food or water or manual labor rather than as the seal of anemotional and spiritual contract. The whore exists outside of the community ofmarried men and women, of householders, and of upholders of the government, thechurch, and even of consensus reality. The relationship with a prostitute is asecret relationship; few men boast of going to prostitutes or of having any sortof relationship with them outside of the sex act. In fact, the more establisheda man is—the more respected in his community, his government, his religion, hisbusiness—the less likely he is to admit to such a relationship in the publicforum. He may go to great lengths to conceal it, to keep it secret, hidden, andentirely personal. It is, in a sense, an “esoteric” or “occult” relationship.In the Book of Revelation, the Whore of Babylon represents not only the ultimateProstitute and sexually active Woman, but also signifies an enemy of the Church.It is in this dual role that she is important to Thelema; for even as sexualmores have changed considerably since the Victorian era when Crowley was ayouth, Church and the State are still viable targets for a religion ofliberation and freedom.There is one more aspect to the Whore of Babylon that must be considered, andthat is her stated origin: Babylon. The implication is clear: a connection,however tenuous, not to Egypt but to Sumer, Akkad and Babylon itself. The Whoreof Babalon (to use Crowley's spelling based on his rendering of the name tosatisfy a gematria of his own) is thereby a link to the most ancient of theknown western religions, the one that is the focus of Grant's work and one thatis referenced by Crowley, Parsons, and other Thelemic authors and personalities,and enshrined in the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon: the Sumeriantradition.While Crowley's fixation on the Beast and the Whore of the Christian Bible mayhave been motivated originally by a desire to be a “bad boy” and outrage theadults around him, the adolescent fantasy of transgression became enshrined in adoctrine. The Whore was lifted out of its Biblical context and re-imagined as“the Mother of us all” and as a Mesopotamian deity (as was Aiwass). It should beacknowledged, however, that this theme of transgression applies not only to theChristianity of the Book of Revelation, but—because of the destruction ofSolomon's Temple by the Babylonians—to Judaism as well. Crowley's allegedanti-Semitism has been the subject of several investigations and we won'tbelabor the point here. It may be sufficient to state that Crowley's philosophywas deliberately provocative and anti-establishment in nature to the extent thathe ridiculed most human institutions and therefore treated most people withcontempt if they were not converts to his new faith. This might not have beenthe result of deep feelings of genuine racism, sexism, etc. but was rather whatone would expect of someone who set himself up as the Prophet of a new Age, muchin the same way that Moses and his followers rained death on their enemies, orthe Church in its many inquisitorial purges and crusades, or the anti-Semiticremarks that can be found in the Qur'an and the military actions that took placeagainst non-Muslims during the Prophet's life and those of subsequentcaliphates. This is not to say one should enshrine these ill-adviseddeclarations as statements of doctrinal authority, however. They needinterpreting; yet a key point of contention in this case is that no one issupposed to interpret Crowley's writings but Crowley himself.61[part0007_split_005.html#aft61]This is one of the inherent contradictions in Thelema, for while Crowleyinsisted that he be the arbiter of all things Thelemic, his slogan was quitedifferent: “Our method is science, our aim is religion.” The “our” is understoodnot as the editorial or Papal first person plural, but as encompassing allThelemites. If the scientific method is indeed the cornerstone of Crowley'soccult praxis, then it behooves Thelemites to undertake independentexperimentation and discovery.This is precisely what the late Kenneth Grant set out to do, and in the processhe made some interesting and possibly crucial discoveries. Among these was thevalue of different sets of god-forms from different cultures, in particularthose with which Crowley himself was not as familiar. While his incorporation ofgenuine Tantric and Afro-Caribbean data makes his writings worthwhile for anyoneinterested in what an expansion of Crowley's basic themes would look like—and inparticular Crowley's magic—it is Grant's willingness to look beyond religion andspiritual techniques to other sources of information that place this Britishoccultist upon an entirely different plateau. If Crowley was committed to havinghis philosophy embraced by the masses—and used every means at his disposal toensure this, including public performances of his rites, publishing occultnovels, and attempting to influence famous celebrities—then Grant's discovery ofThelemic themes in the fictional writing of Howard Phillips Lovecraft shouldhave been welcomed by Crowley's followers enthusiastically, especially asLovecraft's imagined cultus reflects so deeply Crowley's own revealed religion."},{"pageContent":"THE BEAST IN THE CAVEIn 1907, Crowley was writing some of the works that became seminal to thedoctrines of Thelema, known as The Holy Books. These include Liber Liberi velLapidus Lazuli, Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente, and other works written betweenOctober 30 and November 1 of that year, and Liber Arcanorum and LiberCarcerorum, written between December 5th and 14th that same year. Lovecraftwould have had no knowledge of this, as he was only a seventeen-year old recluseliving at home on Angell Street in Providence, Rhode Island, dreaming of thestars. Instead, he later would write of an orgiastic ritual taking place thatyear in the bayous outside New Orleans, Louisiana, and on the very same day thatCrowley was writing the books enumerated above.The story Lovecraft wrote is entitled “The Call of Cthulhu” and is arguably hismost famous work. He wrote the story in 1926, in late August or early September,but placed the action in New Orleans in 1907 and later in Providence in 1925.How is this relevant?Lovecraft's placement of the orgiastic ritual in honor of the high priest of theGreat Old Ones, Cthulhu, and the discovery of a statue of Cthulhu by the NewOrleans police on Halloween, 1907 coincides precisely with Crowley's feveredwriting of his own gothic prose. In the Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli, forinstance, Crowley writes the word “Tutulu” for the first time. He claims not toknow what this word means, or where it came from. As the name of Lovecraft'sfictional alien god can be pronounced “Kutulu,” it seems more than coincidental,as Kenneth Grant himself noted.However, this is only the tip of an eldritch iceberg.In Crowley's Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente—or “The Book of the Heart Girt with aSerpent”—there are numerous references to the “Abyss of the Great Deep,” toTyphon, Python, and the appearance of an “old gnarled fish” with tentacles ...all descriptions that match Lovecraft's imagined Cthulhu perfectly. Notapproximately, but perfectly. Crowley's volume was written on November 1, 1907.The ritual for Cthulhu in New Orleans took place on the same day, month andyear.Here are the relevant passages:From Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli: 1. By the burning of the incense was the Word revealed, and by the distant drug. 2. O meal and honey and oil! O beautiful flag of the moon, that she hangs out in the centre of bliss! 3. These loosen the swathings of the corpse; these unbind the feet of Osiris, so that the flaming God may rage through the firmament with his fantastic spear. 4. But of pure black marble is the sorry statue, and the changeless pain of the eyes is bitter to the blind. 5. We understand the rapture of that shaken marble, torn by the throes of the crowned child, the golden rod of the golden God. 6. We know why all is hidden in the stone, within the coffin, within the mighty sepulchre, and we too answer Olalám! Imál! Tutúlu! as it is written in the ancient book. 7. Three words of that book are as life to a new æon; no god has read the whole. 8. But thou and I, O God, have written it page by page.62 [part0007_split_005.html#aft62]And in Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente:Then was the Adept glad, and lifted his arm. Lo! an earthquake, and plague, andterror on the earth!63 [part0007_split_005.html#aft63]And:Behold! the Abyss of the Great Deep. Therein is a mighty dolphin, lashing hissides with the force of the waves.64 [part0007_split_005.html#aft64]And:Thou art Sebek the crocodile against Asar; thou art Mati, the Slayer in theDeep. Thou art Typhon, the Wrath of the Elements, O Thou who transcendest theForces in their Concourse and Cohesion, in their Death and their Disruption.Thou art Python, the terrible serpent about the end of all things!65[part0007_split_005.html#aft65]And finally:I trembled at Thy coming, O my God, for Thy messenger was more terrible than theDeath-star. On the threshold stood the fulminant figure of Evil, the Horror ofemptiness, with his ghastly eyes like poisonous wells. He stood, and the chamberwas corrupt; the air stank. He was an old and gnarled fish more hideous than theshells of Abaddon. He enveloped me with his demon tentacles; yea, the eightfears took hold upon me.66 [part0007_split_005.html#aft66]Compare with relevant passages from Lovecraft's “Call of Cthulhu”:Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent,though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. Itseemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a formwhich only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhatextravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon,and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. Apulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentarywings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockinglyfrightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architecturalbackground.67 [part0007_split_005.html#aft67]And:The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close andcareful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitelyartistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline,but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly,rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrowwings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnaturalmalignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on arectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tipsof the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre,whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped thefront edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of thepedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facialfeelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher'selevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the moresubtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, andincalculable age was umistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any knowntype of art belonging to civilisation's youth—or indeed to any other time.Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy,greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striationsresembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along thebase were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation ofhalf the world's expert learning in this field, could form the least notion ofeven their remotest linguistic kinship.In Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli, Crowley refers to several of the images withwhich Lovecraft would be consumed in his stories, but especially in “The Call ofCthulhu.” Here we have a buried god that is awakened from a stone, in a coffin,in a sepulchre, and mysterious words written in an ancient book, includingTutulu. And “of pure black marble is the sorry statue” resonates with the blackstone on which the statue of Cthulhu squats.In Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente we have an expansion of this theme, beginningwith an earthquake (Lovecraft's story is centered around an actual earthquakethat took place in 1925), and extending to an Abyss of the Great Deep, theSlayer in the Deep, a Death-star, and the “fulminant figure of Evil” (astinking, fish-like creature with tentacles). This figure is a messenger of theGods and, indeed, Cthulhu is not only a god itself but a high priest of theGreat Old Ones who will return to earth when “the stars are right.” A moreparanoid observer than your author may wonder if the statement in LiberAL—“Every man and every woman is a star”—is a decoding of the famous Lovecraftquotation “when the stars are right.” It would imply that when the followers ofThelema (the “stars”) are powerful enough, or numerous enough, then the GreatOld Ones will return.This was certainly Crowley's objective, as understood by Grant and as revealedby these excerpts from Crowley's Holy Books of Thelema. Crowley believed thatthe first two books mentioned above were not his writing, but were inspiredworks dictated to him by his Holy Guardian Angel, the ancient Sumerianpersonality Aiwass, after Crowley had attained samadhi during a course ofrituals he undertook with his colleague, George Cecil Jones, in England.68[part0007_split_005.html#aft68] Even the undecipherable language of “Olalam ImalTutulu” has its counterpart in the enigmatic hieroglyphics of the Cthulhu statueand the ecstatic, glossolalia-like cries of the worshippers in the Louisianaswamps.69 [part0007_split_005.html#aft69] Both men—the American author and theEnglish magician—were dealing with the same subject matter, and indeed Lovecrafthad dated the first appearance of the Cthulhu statue to the same year, month andday that Crowley began writing these sections of the Holy Books.There is no hard evidence that either man knew of the other, although the authorbelieves that references to an English satanist in Lovecraft's “The Thing on theDoorstep” could be an allusion to Crowley. In any event, to suggest that thesetwo men cooperated or collaborated in any deliberate way would be the height (ordepth!) of conspiracy theory. It may actually be more logical to suggest—as anexplanation for some of these coincidences—that darker forces were at work. Infact, it is possible that the same forces of which Lovecraft himself writes—thetelepathic communication between followers of Cthulhu and the Great Old Ones—waswhat prompted him to write these fictional accounts of real events. EitherLovecraft was in some kind of telepathic communication with Crowley, or both menwere in telepathic communication with ... Something Else.This Dark Lord of the Holy Books is one of the gods—perhaps the most importantgod—of the Crowley pantheon. In the Crowley line of succession, this god is atthe juncture of Egyptian and Sumerian religion and is thus pre-Judaic. InLovecraft's succession, Cthulhu is a high priest of the Great Old Ones who cameto the planet from the stars aeons ago, long before humans walked the earth.Although dead and buried deep beneath the earth or under the ocean, he can riseagain once the “stars are right” and his followers assist in calling him up, inresurrecting him.This leads us to a slight detour into the Tibetan language.The word ku su lu in Tibetan70 [part0007_split_005.html#aft70] evokes for usanother coincidence, for it refers to a shaman (i.e., a kind of priest) but alsoto one who was once dead but who has come back from death.71[part0007_split_005.html#aft71] This meme—the shaman who has come back from thedead—is a perfect description of Lovecraft's Cthulhu and may provide a means ofunderstanding Crowley's Tutulu as well. According to Kenneth Grant, one possibletranslation of the word Tutulu can be “Who will attain.” These are allconsistent with the idea presented by Lovecraft of a high priest of the GreatOld Ones, dead but “dreaming,” who will resurrect from his watery grave to takecharge of the earth once more. As noted in the Schlangekraft recension of theNecronomicon, Cthulhu can be rendered in the Sumerian language as kutu lu or“the man from Kutu” or “the man from the Underworld.” Kutu—the Biblical Gudua,sometimes rendered Kutu or Kuta—was the ancient city of Cutha, sacred to Nergaland the entrance to the Underworld in Sumerian religion. It was also the city inMesopotamia with special relevance for Islam, for it was the city where theQureish were from. The Qureish are, of course, the tribe of the ProphetMuhammad, the tribe in charge of the pagan shrine in Mecca known as the Ka'abaor the Black Stone. This was the shrine containing 360 idols, probably of theMoon God Hubal, that the Prophet dismantled and replaced with a shrine sacred tohis new religion of Islam.The death and rebirth theme that is central to Siberian shamanism was also acrucial element of Sumerian and Babylonian religion. The famous narrative of thedescent of the Sumerian goddess Inanna (Ishtar) into the Underworld, and herrescue and resurrection three days later, is one of the legends that helped formthe Sumerian Gnosis. Indeed, she has sometimes been identified with the Whore ofBabylon. When she finally ascended the seven levels of the Underworld toreappear in the world, she was accompanied by a host of demons who hadpreviously been restrained in the Underworld, and who took advantage of herdefeat of death to flood out of their subterranean prison and populate theearth. This bears some resemblance to Lovecraft's fictional Cthulhu who is deadbut who will be reborn “when the stars are right” and at that time bring hisalien gods to the earth to rule it once more. In both cases—the Lovecraftscenario and the Sumerian prototype—the dead require the assistance of theliving to effect the resurrection.This complex narrative is reprised in the Christian example of Jesus who, afterhis crucifixion, “descended into hell” and rose on the third day. His descentinto hell was for the purpose of releasing from the Underworld all those noblesouls who had died before he appeared on the earth to redeem humanity fromoriginal sin. In the Christian case, the souls that were released were those ofthe righteous dead; in the Sumerian case, the souls that were released weredemonic forces. In the Lovecraft scenario, the gates are opened to hideous alienbeings from outer space. Either the Christian case is mere wishful thinking, ora deliberate gloss on the older traditions of the region, or is it somethingelse?Much has been written in the past hundred years or longer on the subject of the“dead and resurrected god,” referencing a whole category of such deities rangingfrom Osiris to Tammuz, Mithra, and others in the Middle East and North Africa.It is often characterized as evidence of an agricultural society in which seedsare planted (i.e., “buried”) in the ground and then “resurrected” in the form ofnew plants. However, this process could just as easily be the basis for any of anumber of sexually-oriented fertility cults as well, and not necessarily thebasis for a dead and resurrected god (or goddess, as in the case of Inanna).Unless, of course, there is a relation or connection between the idea of deathand resurrection on the one hand and sexual intercourse and reproduction on theother. In the Gnostic Mass as revised by Crowley, we have the template of acelebration of Christ's Last Supper and the consumption of his flesh and bloodby the faithful over which is applied the sexual components of Crowley's cultus.While the sexual aspect of the Gnostic Mass is the most obvious one and theaspect that gets all the attention, the death and resurrection foundation of theMass is still present and is in disguise. Crowley might have said that his Masswas the “reveal” of the innate sexual message of the original Mass, while theoriginal Mass can be interpreted as the “reveal” of the primary death andresurrection message hidden within the Crowley version. They can be seen asmirror images of each other, if one views them both from an angle slightlyoff-center, from—as Lovecraft would say—a “space between the spaces.”As in the Catholic Mass, the gods are present in the Gnostic Mass. They areclassified differently, of course, with a totally different emphasis. The reasonthis much time has been taken for a look at the Mass, its Credo, and itstransgressive characteristics is because it is the formula that most clearlyrepresents the coherence of the Thelemic message. That is not to say that theMass is perfectly coherent, of course (but, then, neither is the Catholic Mass).But it can be viewed as a kind of wayang kulit, a shadow play conducted behind acurtain in which the actors are flat, two-dimensional puppets standing in forthree-dimensional gods but which—in the case of the Gnostic Mass—are replaced bythree-dimensional human beings standing in for extra-dimensional entities: thosedescribed at some length by Kenneth Grant, H.P. Lovecraft, and the TyphonianTradition of magic.Like, for instance, Set."},{"pageContent":"SET-TYPHONCrowley's Liber XXXVI72 [part0007_split_005.html#aft72] contains a formula forestablishing contact with the Old Ones through the invocation of Set, son ofIsis and brother of Horus.—Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 123As must be obvious by now, Grant's focus throughout his aptly-named TyphonianTrilogy as well as in the construction and organization of his Typhonian Orderalways has been the composite figure of Set-Typhon. Set is the ancient Egyptiangod that has long been associated with chaos, with the desert, with storms, withforeigners and foreign lands (i.e., the “Other”), and with the murder of Osirisand the ongoing struggle with Horus, the son of Osiris. Typhon, on the otherhand, is a Greek god who has many of the same attributes of a god of darkness,storms and chaos. Typhon, like Set, was born unnaturally from his mother and,also like Set, was the enemy of the pantheon. Thus, it was the Greeks whoidentified Set as a version of their own Typhon and the form Set-Typhon came tobe known in the Mediterranean. There has been much speculation in academiccircles that the legends surrounding Typhon are derived from those of ancientSumer, specifically the creation epic known as Enuma Elish and the episode ofthe serpent monster, Tiamat, who is slain by Marduk in battle.73[part0007_split_005.html#aft73] As we have seen, Grant identified Set-Typhon asa form of Crowley's supramundane contact, Aiwass, as well as of the Shaitan ofthe Yezidis, and linked it all to Sumer.Oddly, however, Crowley himself did not seem to focus on Set-Typhon to theextent that his disciple would, except as a kind of twin to Horus as we haveseen.74 [part0007_split_005.html#aft74] Crowley's attention was taken by Horusin his various forms as Hoor-par-kraat and the composite Ra-hoor-kuit, amongothers. Crowley identified with what he saw as the “solar phallic” nature ofOsiris and Horus and, indeed, neither Set-Typhon nor Set himself were majorfigures in the Egyptian pantheon of the Golden Dawn—where Set appears as thepersonification of evil in the rituals associated with the idea of the Thresholdand represents the “Averse Sephiroth” and the Qlippoth.75[part0007_split_005.html#aft75] In this instance, Set would not be identified asa being to whom worship would be directed. One gets the sense that if a memberof the Golden Dawn were to construct rituals intended to invoke or evoke Setthat it would be considered an act of “black magic,” i.e., a harmful or whollynegative act.To Grant, however, the character of Set is a rich vein of cosmic importance andGrant expands on this theme considerably, to the point that Set—in Grant'sscheme of things—overtakes Horus and Osiris in relevance to the ideas embodiedby Crowley's doctrine of Thelema. Where Osiris and Horus represent the solaraspect of Egyptian religion, Set and Set-Typhon represent the stellar aspect.Osiris and Horus can be identified with the rising and setting sun—and thus withthe east and west respectively—but Set is identified with the circumpolar stars(in particular with the Great Bear or Ursa Major) and the north, the directionof the sun's nadir beneath the earth and the realm of Amenta: the Abode of theDead. The author has elsewhere shown that the asterism known to us as the BigDipper was identified with Set in the Egyptian text popularly known as the Bookof the Dead, specifically with the “thigh” of Set in the crucial Opening of theMouth ceremony.76 [part0007_split_005.html#aft76] The Big Dipper is also acritical asterism in the Necronomicon Gnosis, as the Gates between this worldand the transdimensional realm are opened “when the Great Bear hangs from itstail in the sky.”77 [part0007_split_005.html#aft77] Grant discovered the closeassociation between the Egyptian Set and the Necronomicon, which furtherreinforced his theory concerning the Tunnels of Set. These tunnels are hiddenpathways on the “nightside” of the Kabbalistic “Tree of Life”—known toKabbalists as the Sitra Ahra, or “Other Side”—that he associates with theQlippoth, the “shells” of a previous creation that was destroyed due toimbalance resulting in shattered or broken sephiroth, specifically the sephiraGevurah or “Severity.” These shards of an Elder Creation roam the cosmos as evilspirits or demonic forces, but to Grant these are value judgements made by piousmonotheists who ignore their true nature.But there is more to Set than even all of this. A close examination of Set'simportance and character in the ancient Egyptian texts reveal that there is aclose correlation between how the Egyptians understood Set and the initiatoryprocess of Crowley's OTO as well as the central thesis of Grant's ouevre.In recent years there has been much academic investigation and discourse on thenature and identity of Set. This discourse has ranged from the fields of pureEgyptology to studies of Gnosticism and the Kabbalah. Set remains an engimaticfigure, a stranger to the rest of Egyptian religion in so many ways. Indeed, theidentity of Set's “animal” (the totemic creature or zoötype with which Set isidentified in hieroglyphics and Egyptian art) remains unidentified, and even theetymology of Set's name is a source of controversy. While there is no space togo into all of this here, relevant topics will be highlighted so that the readercan appreciate the extent of the Crowley-Grant-Lovecraft concept, characterizedby Grant as the Necronomicon Gnosis."},{"pageContent":"WHO IS SET?There are two basic schools of thought concerning the origins of Set. One schoolclaims that Set represents an ancient ruler of Upper (i.e., southern) Egypt whocame into conflict with a ruler represented by Horus of Lower (i.e., northern)Egypt. It is this political and military conflict that led to the myth of thewarfare between Set and Horus.This idea has been criticized as there is no historical evidence to support it,although it is true that pharaohs considered themselves rulers of both Upper andLower Egypt, and that their double crowns were references to the union of Setand Horus.Another school has it that Set represents a foreign god, and hence a foreigntribe, race, country. This foreign deity eventually became incorporated into theoverall religion, representing all those concepts that were consideredantinomian, transgressive, and “other.” There is some support for thisinterpretation but it is by no means conclusive.The name “Set” defies translation, just as his totemic animal defiesidentification. The hieroglyphic representing the word for Set can be pronouncedin various ways, depending on the area of Egypt (Upper or Lower) and therelevant dynasty.78 [part0007_split_005.html#aft78] Variations such as “Setah,”“Sut,” “Seth,” and of course “Set” have been put forward as alternatives.79[part0007_split_005.html#aft79] The determinative form has been used in wordsdenoting storm, thunder, roaring, chaos, illness, nightmares, darkness, and ahost of other dangerous phenomena. One theory is that Set represents that whichseparates or divides. Set is the god of alien lands (alien to Egypt and thus, byextension, the “Other”) and the desert, and as such is a liminal figure, a godof the Threshold, the guardian at the Gate to the Underworld as the Golden Dawnrituals testify.This may be due to (at least in part) the identification of the Set “animal” asan ass or donkey, specifically Equus africanus or the African wild ass, aspecies that is today nearing extinction but which still survives in the desertsof Somalia and Ethiopia having once been common in the Egyptian desert as well.This species thrives in desert places and is largely identified with the serewastelands outside of the ancient Egyptian cities. (Indeed, one of the magicalspells that appear in the Papyrus London-Leiden magical manuscripts specificallyinstructs the magician to use the blood and head of a donkey in order to evokeSet-Typhon.)80 [part0007_split_005.html#aft80] It is claimed that the sound thedonkey makes—its peculiar braying—gave rise to one of the most common utterancesto be found in Crowleyan (and, indeed, most Gnostic and Greco-Roman occult)literature: Iao or Io, both of which were considered names of the Egyptian godSet in the Greco-Roman literature and serve as invocations of that god.81[part0007_split_005.html#aft81]Set has been associated with foreign countries and their inhabitants. Thus, thepeoples of Libya in the west were considered (by the Egyptians) to be followersof Set. The Semitic peoples of Mesopotamia in the east were also considered tobe Set-worshippers and their god, Baal, was identified often with Set. Crowley'sprime female deity, Babalon, also is obviously Babylonian and authors have triedto identify the famous “Whore of Babylon” of the Biblical Apocalypse as theBabylonian Ishtar (Sumerian Inanna). This would seem to justify to some extentGrant's (and Crowley's) insistence that the source of the Thelemic testament,Aiwass, was Sumerian and that he might have been a priest of an Ur-form ofSet-Typhon. If this could be supported by other evidence, then it is clear thatThelema owes a great deal of its identity to the influence of that exemplar ofthe transgressive forces of the universe ... and that Lovecraft's horror of thehigh priest of the Great Old Ones, Cthulhu or Kutulu, was at least in somemeasure justified!In addition, it is tempting to see the Semitic word satan Image[../images/00006.jpeg] as a form of the Egyptian Set. They have the consonantsounds “s” and “t” in common, and they both seem to represent evil beings.Actually, while the relationship is hypothetical at this point, the two words dohave a lot in common. Add to that the general reluctance of Egyptian scribes towrite out the name of Set phonetically82 [part0007_split_005.html#aft82]—but whoinstead chose to use his hieroglyphic signifier in texts—and you have an aptcomparison to the avoidance of pronouncing the initial consonant of Shaitan'sname by the Yezidis. Both, incidentally, begin with the same consonantal sound:the initial Image [../images/00007.jpeg] or Image [../images/00008.jpeg] soundused for the name of Set in transliterated Egyptian is believed to be identicalto the sound s in Satan and sh in Shaitan, respectively.The Hebrew word satan comes from a root meaning “adversary” or to “resist” aswell as “enemy”, “obstacle”, or “obstruction”, depending on whether the word isused as a noun or a verb. It may come from the word sut Image[../images/00009.jpeg] which means “to fall aside or away,” or the word setImage [../images/00010.jpeg] which means “one who revolts.” The final “n” in theHebrew satan indicates an emphasis on the root for the purpose ofpersonification, and thus “he who falls aside,” or “he who revolts,” or “he whoobstructs.” We remember that one of the earliest suspected pronounciations forSet is indeed Sut.If it can be shown that Semitic ideas of Satan derive from the ancient Egyptiangod Set, then Grant's hypothesis that Set-Shaitan-Typhon are one and the sametakes on increased importance. By identifying Aiwass with this signifier we mayunderstand the Book of the Law a little better, particularly its controversialthird chapter which sets the New Aeon in complete opposition to the world'sreligions in a dramatic and even violent way. The message of Liber AL thenbecomes a message consistent with the personality and objectives of Set, theDark Lord.On the other hand, there is a scene from the Book of Coming Forth by Day (morecommonly known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead) in which Set is shown at theprow of Ra's barque, fighting the serpent god Apophis. In this setting, Set isprotecting the Sun God, Ra. If Set is “evil” as is often claimed, how is it thathe also can be depicted defending the pantheon? Indeed, some pharaohs even tookthe name Set as their own or added it to their titles."},{"pageContent":"SET AS TANTRIC GODA recurrent theme in all of Grant's work is that of sexuality, especially withina ritualistic context. The OTO is said to be a repository of the sexual secretsdiscovered by its German founders a century ago, and the OTO's debt to thesacred spirituality advocated by the African-American mystic Pascal BeverlyRandolph has been detailed elsewhere.83 [part0007_split_005.html#aft83] Tantraforms the main context for Grant's elaboration of the sexual mysteries at theheart of Thelema and Thelemic magic, and indeed Grant went much further thanCrowley in his description of these mysteries and their relevance to Tantra andin particular to Vama Marg Tantra or “Tantra of the Left Hand Path” as it isoften—erroneously—characterized. Grant's Tantra is not the New Age, feel-good,Tantra of the West, but the transgressive Tantra of the Nath Siddhis, the Kaulacircles and other traditions that view the human body—male and female—as bothlaboratories and temples combined. Tantra according to this approach is atechnology of spirituality, spiritual power, and tremendously altered states ofconsciousness which has as its goal communion with supramundane beings ... inother words, precisely what Love-craft described when he depicted the orgiasticrites in the swamps outside New Orleans in his short story “The Call ofCthulhu.”While many readers will be familiar with the legend of Set murdering Osiris, andIsis giving birth to a child, Horus, who will avenge his father's death inbattle with Set, what is not so well known is the sexual component to the myth.For decades this aspect has remained somewhat hidden from the non-academic worldand buried in obscure Latin phrases and euphemisms and generally ignored. ThatSet was understood to be either homosexual or at least bi-sexual will seemstrange to those who have always believed Set to be the personification of pureevil and murder, a kind of Jungian “Shadow” archetype. But Set as representativeof “the Other” in almost everything also represents sexual transgression, theperhaps ultimate expression of “Other-ness” and a natural characteristic of thetype of Tantric sexuality that is the focus of Grant's thesis.To understand this—and its relevance to Grant's Typhonian magic—it is necessaryto know how Egypt described the origins of Set.According to one of the cosmological systems of the ancient Egyptians, thesupreme or eldest god, Atum, gave birth to the world by self-propagating his twochildren, Shu and Tefnut, who in turn gave birth to Geb the earth god and Nutthe sky goddess. These in turn gave birth to Osiris and Isis. However, they alsogave birth to Set and Nephthys, which disturbed the order of the cosmos as,until that time, the system had been established whereby one male-female pairgave birth to only one other male-female pair, essentially what the Gnosticswould refer to as syzygies. Further, it was claimed that Set was not born viathe usual method but essentially tore out of his mother's side on his ownvolition in an untimely season and violent manner. Thus it appears—though is notspecifically stated—that Set did not have a childhood per se but entered lifefully-grown. Even the word for “birth” is not used in the Egyptian texts inconnection with Set's origins. Indeed, his own mother refused him and hissister/wife Nephthys was also in horror of him. Isis, whose brother/husbandOsiris was slain by Set, lived in fear of him as well, especially during herpregnancy with Horus. It was believed that Set (due to his unnatural birth)caused abortions and that he would “open the womb” of pregnant women so thatthey would miscarry or abort. And even though each of the male-female pairs ofgods would go on to beget other male-female pairs, Set and Nephthys did not havechildren and Nephthys was characterized vulgarly as the one with the “useless”vagina. Nephthys runs to Isis in fear of Set, or to console Isis after themurder of Osiris, a situation more fit for a telenovela than the gravitas ofEgyptian religious mysteries. Thus the Set and Nephthys couple or dyad representthe disorder of the universe; evil enters into the cosmos through theirunnatural entrance into the pantheon and the carefully-crafted structure of thecreated world is ripped apart.Thus Set is the ultimate (and perhaps the original) anti-hero. His birth andearly years are models of rejection, abuse, and violence: rejected by his ownfamily, he turns to the abuse of them and their offspring and violently attacksand kills Osiris and then waits to do the same to Horus, his biological nephew.But not before sodomizing the Crowned and Conquering Child.There is little doubt today among Egyptologists that Set was characterized as ahomosexual god, and that the famous “Contendings of Horus and Set” contain anaccount of Set's attempt to sodomize his nemesis. In fact, this attempted act ofsodomy is the foundation for such an iconic Egyptian motif as the Eye of Horus.These associations were not generally known in Crowley's time outside a smallcircle of specialists. Had they been familiar to Crowley, they might haveelicited a great many more musings on such themes as sexual magic, the mysteriesof the Aeons, and the degree structure of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Theycertainly do lend support to such claims by later Crowley devotees that the NewAeon would be a “homosexual” Aeon, the males under the aegis of Typhon and thefemales under Maat.84 [part0007_split_005.html#aft84]It was the mother of Horus, Isis, who suggested to her son that he avoidpenetration by Set through the use of his fingers to cover his anus, thuscapturing Set's semen in his hand whereupon he flung the seed into a river. Setbelieved he had sodomized Horus successfully, and in a strange turnabout Horusdeposited his own semen on a leaf of lettuce (Set's favorite food). Set ate thelettuce and thereby was “penetrated” (orally, we observe) by Horus.When Set bragged to the gods that he had sodomized Horus, the semen that Horushad thrown into the river spoke out and denied Set the satisfaction of hisboast. At that time, Horus claimed that he had penetrated Set, and to prove itthe semen that Set had consumed issued forth from Set's forehead as a whitedisk.Before the enraged Set could grab the disk it was seized by Thoth, the god ofWisdom, Magic, and Writing, and placed in the sky as the Moon.85[part0007_split_005.html#aft85]While this episode certainly shows Set as an aggressive and violent being withhomosexual attributes, it is not the whole story. In other legends, Set is stillviolent sexually but in heterosexual as well as homosexual situations. It couldbe argued that Set represents desire or sexuality per se. While Isis may be asymbol of love, especially maternal love, she is not usually identified in termsof pure sexuality. Set, on the other hand, seems to embody lust unrestrained.If we understand Set to represent raw sexuality we can realize Set's place inthe Egyptian cosmos. Set is power, at its most primal and basic (“uncivilized”)human level. Unrestrained, it results in rape and pedophilia among otherdepravations. Restrained, it can be a potent source of protection and occultpower. But this power lives in a wild and uninhabited place, outside of society,a wasteland of invisible winds and unseen beasts. Society uses this power whenthe need arises; at other times, it wants it to go away, to disappear—which isas good a description of modern humanity's relationship to sexuality as any.It could be argued that our reaction to the concept of sexuality is based uponits more controversial aspects. From teen pregnancy and pedophilia to rape,adultery, abortion, pornography, prostitution, sexually-transmitted diseases,and even gay marriage ... sexuality to the modern mind (West and East) is aminefield of dangerous associations. Crowley himself has the reputation of beinga polymorphously perverse libertine who engaged in virtually every form ofsexual expression during the course of his lifetime and who had many multiplemale and female sexual partners covering the entire spectrum of human society,from street corner prostitutes to celebrities, artists's models, poets,actresses, and wealthy matrons. This was Set, the Dark Lord and God of theMidnight Sky and the circumpolar stars of True North in eternal struggle withHorus, the Lord of the Sun, the East, and the ecliptic. Crowley, like Jacobbefore him, wrestled with an Angel on the Ladder leading up to heaven, only inCrowley's case it was the Egyptian god that the Golden Dawn had taught him tofear and distrust, a god that represented the very sexuality that Crowleychampioned as being the vehicle for attaining the True Mysteries. It was the godof the Black Mass, and the witches's sabbat.It was this type of sexual expression that so horrified H. P. Lovecraft to theextent that he never actually wrote about sexuality except in terms of disgustat the “orgiastic rites” of those worshipping the Ancient Ones. Lovecraftinstinctively understood that extreme or at least non-traditional forms ofsexuality were somehow linked to magic, occult power, and contact withsupramundane entities. Lovecraft's instincts thus are linked to Crowley's magicand revelations to form Grant's Necronomicon Gnosis. Set, as the Lord of sexualtransgression—which means any sexual activity outside of lawfully-permittedreproductive sex—is a Tantric Lord as well in the broadest sense of that term.Grant claimed that Set offers access to other dimensions, and that a deepunderstanding of Tantra—coupled with western magical practice and analysis—wouldlead the magician to the dark side of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.This “Setian” Tantra would re-interpret Set's infamous sexual acts as ritualrequirements designed to plunge the operator into a dangerous realm ofconsciousness below that (or beyond that) of the waking world. These acts wouldinclude everything from solitary sexual practices to various types of hetero-and homosexual acts, including oral and anal sex. While Grant has argued thatthe enigmatic XIth degree of the Ordo Templi Orientis did not involve analpenetration—insisting instead that the per vas nefandum (the “unmentionablevessel”) requirement in Crowley's allusions to the ritual refers to the vaginaof a woman during her menstruation, rather than to the anus, giving new meaningto the term “Scarlet Woman”—there is precedence for believing that many otherforms of non-reproductive sex do have relevance for modern tantricpractitioners. Shiva copulated extensively with his wife Parvati except that hedid not impregnate her in the usual way but ejaculated either in her hand or hermouth. These (and many other) episodes from both Egyptian and Indian religionwould seem to indicate that forms of sexuality other than those intended forreproduction are being implied, and to many mainstream religions any sexual actthat does not have as its intention the reproduction of the species is, bydefinition, evil and forbidden.86 [part0007_split_005.html#aft86] Thus, what wemay call “sacred sexuality”—whether the pale and pastel mysticism of right-handTantra with its hours of silent and motionless meditation on the Shakti yantra,or the red meat rituals of the Black Mass replete with bodily fluids and loudfornications, and everything in between—is transgressive by its very nature andbelongs to the realm of the Dark Lord.This leads us into another ritual developed by Crowley and based, once again,upon the rites of the Golden Dawn into which he had been initiated and whichcontinued to influence his magical worldview his entire life. This is the Ritualof the Star Sapphire, known as Liber XXXVI (or “Book 36).First appearing in Crowley's Book of Lies, this ritual was designed to replacethe Golden Dawn's Ritual of the Hexagram. The Golden Dawn had two foundationalrituals that everyone was expected to learn and to perform: the first of thesebeing the Ritual of the Pentagram which was used to invoke or banish—dependingon the direction the pentagram was drawn—the four “Platonic” elements (earth,air, fire and water) plus “spirit.” Each of the five points of the pentagram wasassigned to one of these elements. It is the basic circle casting ritual of theGolden Dawn and versions of it have been used widely in occult groups andpractice for more than one hundred years. This includes Wiccan groups, whosemembers often are not aware of the origins of their rite which is sometimescalled invoking the Watchtowers (a direct reference to the Golden Dawn ritual,which was itself based on the Angelic Magic of Elizabethan magician John Dee andhis medium, Edward Kelly—of whom Crowley believed he was the reincarnation).The other, more complex, ceremony is known as the Ritual of the Hexagram. Inthis ritual, each of the six points of the hexagram is assigned one of the sixvisible “planets,” with the center of the hexagram representing the sun. Thus,depending on how the hexagram is drawn, one is invoking or banishing theinfluences of one of the planets.Crowley replaced both of these rituals with his own, Thelemic, versions. ThePentagram ritual was replaced by the Star Ruby ritual whose original angelicbeings—Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel—were substituted with godforms moreappropriate to Thelema: Therion (the “Beast”) Nuit, Babalon and Hadit.87[part0007_split_005.html#aft87]However, when it came to the Hexagram ritual, a fundamental change took place,one that may not be particularly obvious at first glance. This was the ritualthat attracted the attention of Theodor Reuss, one of the founders of the OTO,who visited Crowley in London and accused him of publishing the secret of theIX° of the Order in his 1912 book The Book of Lies, a situation that led toCrowley's receiving the IX° from Reuss on the spot—and the rest, as they say, ishistory. Crowley had already received the grades up to and including the VII°from Reuss, but had no idea that the higher grades consisted of the sexualsecrets that he had published. Crowley, in writing out these sexually-chargedtexts, was just being Crowley; he claimed that Star Sapphire came to him in thesame sort of heightened state of consciousness that brought forth the other HolyBooks that we have discussed, above. It was Reuss who revealed to him what hasbecome the biggest “secret” of western occultism, that the core of thepractices—from alchemy to ceremonial magic—are sexual in nature, and that theiconography of occultism (including Rosicrucianism, alchemy, mysticism andmagic) conceal sexual (or, at least, psycho-biological) secrets.Crowley went on to rewrite many of the OTO rituals, to become head of the Orderin the English-speaking countries, and eventually head of the Order itself afterthe contentious Weida Conference in Germany. Thus, this particular ritualdeserves close scrutiny as it was the catalyst that propelled Crowley to theheadship of the OTO; it is also, according to Reuss himself, the secret of theIX° in printed form. In addition, and most importantly for this study, it is aritual that puts Set—the Dark Lord—front and center.An entire book could be written on the Star Sapphire, as simple as it seems tobe, and we will not explore all its implications and ramifications here. Whatconcerns us directly is how Crowley perceived Set in his own Thelemic context.The ritual begins with the key phrase, “Let the Adept be armed with his MagickRood (and provided with his Mystic Rose).” This is the phrase the caught theattention of Theodor Reuss. A “Magick Rood” of course is a rod or wand, andspecifically refers to the cross on which Christ was crucified, the “Holy Rood.”Thus this first sentence tells the adept to be armed with a cross and a rose,which is the symbol of one of the most famous European secret societies, theRosicrucians (which name means, of course, Rose Cross or Rosey Cross). A roseand cross emblem was also the coat-of-arms of the man who ignited theReformation, Martin Luther. Thus, we can see this instruction as being, if notwholly innocent, at least bereft of any overtly sexual connotation if taken inthe context of seventeenth-century European occult societies.However, the rest of the ritual puts this initial phrase into a completelydifferent context.After giving a number of quasi-Masonic gestures—the L.V.X. signs or the N.O.X.signs both of which have their origins in the Golden Dawn—the adept is theninstructed to go to the four cardinal directions, beginning with the East andproceeding clockwise to the other quarters, uttering a series of Latin phrasesand drawing a hexagram in each direction.The Latin phrases are instructive. Translated, they are:Father and Mother, One God, ARARITA.Mother and Son, One God, ARARITA.Son and Daughter, One God, ARARITA.Daughter and Father, One God, ARARITA.Ararita is the same word that appears in the original Golden Dawn version of theHexagram ritual, and is an acronym for a Hebrew phrase that means “One is hisbeginning. One is his individuality. His permutation is One.”At the end, the adept returns to his original position in the center of thecircle thus made, and “making the sign of the Rosy Cross” he then repeats theword ARARITA three times, after which he makes:“... the Sign of Set Triumphant and of Baphomet. Also shall Set appear in thecircle. Let him drink of the Sacrament and let him communicate the same.”There are further Latin phrases after this, which translated read:“All in Two; Two in One; One in none; these are neither Four nor All nor Two norOne nor None.”Followed by:“Glory be to the Father and the Mother and the Son and the Daughter and the HolySpirit without and the Holy Spirit within which was, and is, and is to come, forever and ever, six in one through the seven in one name ARARITA.”The emphasis in these phrases seems to be the reduction of all dualities to asingularity, evidence of Crowley's fascination with the Indian concept ofadvaita or non-duality. Yet, duality is at the heart of the ritual, so it isworthwhile to pause here to contemplate its intention.In the first place, remember that Crowley himself insisted that he did notrealize that this was the IX° secret until Theodor Reuss pointed it out to him,and told him that it was the secret behind all of western occultism. Crowleywrote it as a sexual rite and expanded upon this intention in a later chapter88[part0007_split_005.html#aft88] of the Book of Lies, but was unaware of what hehad stumbled upon. It may be that Crowley felt he was simply re-interpreting therituals in sexual terms rather than discovering the real basis behind them. Butwhat does Set have to do with any of this? And why is Set “Triumphant”?If this ritual is interpreted in sexual terms, as was the intention, we are leftwith the uncomfortable realization that three of the four “pairings” areincestuous in nature: Mother and Son, Son and Daughter, Father and Daughter.Crowley was delicate enough, or pragmatic enough, not to have included “Motherand Daughter” or “Father and Son” most likely since heterosexual couplings wouldbe necessary in a ritual of the IX° in which both male and female fluids arerequired for the creation of the Sacrament. This Sacrament is to be consumed bythe operator and “communicated.” The last word comes from the Latin Mass, andindicates that the Sacrament is to be shared, so that those sharing “commune”with the spiritual force invoked. In the Latin Mass this is done with the sacredElements—the bread and wine that have been transubstantiated into the body andblood of Christ—so that all those who communicate (i.e., take Communion) sharein the experience of contact with Jesus, the slain and resurrected God.In the case of the Star Sapphire, since the ritual is patently sexual, theSacrament is composed of the male and female sexual fluids and is a form of theGnostic Mass in miniature, as it were. What Grant points out, again and again inhis Typhonian Trilogies, is that these are not simply the gross fluids in and ofthemselves, but have been transformed through correct performance of ritual.They thus contain occult qualities which normal semen and female secretions(whether menstrual blood or the secretions of the mucus membranes of thevagina—which are carriers of special essences known as kalas to Tantra and toGrant) normally do not possess. These qualities have nothing to do with theprocess of physical reproduction; they are obviously not necessary to facilitatethe conception of a human child. An essential element of this ritual (and,indeed, of all sexual magic) is contact with other forces, those beyond thephysical world, so that all the grosser physical aspects of sexual intercourse(from desire, to arousal, to intercourse, to orgasm, to the fluids that result)must be re-imagined, transformed, and transcended.As a ritual of transgressive sexuality, it would be appropriate for Set. Set is“triumphant”—according to the Egyptian texts so far deciphered—in situations ofmurder, rape, sodomy, etc. In Set's defence of Ra's solar barque, his violenceis put to good use in service of the pantheon, and he is triumphant there aswell: he destroys a serpent god, Apep or Apophis (with whom, paradoxically, heis sometimes identified). In the Star Sapphire ritual, it may be that thetransgressive powers of Set are first identified and then employed in an actdesigned to bring the adept into contact with his Holy Guardian Angel (asCrowley himself seems to suggest in Chapter 69 of the Book of Lies—where thesubject of the Hexagram is discussed in terms that are patently sexual andobvious, including an explicit reference to the sexual position known as “69” ormutual oral sex).The Golden Dawn instructions concerning the Hexagram ritual make it clear thatthis is a ritual of the macrocosm (the seven planets, seven of the ten sefiroton the Tree of Life), as opposed to the Pentagram ritual which is a rite of themicrocosm (the four elements plus spirit, or the five Indian tattvas). We maysay, then, that the Hexagram ritual (both the Golden Dawn original and Crowley'sreworking of it in the Star Sapphire) is a ritual of the heavens, the sky, andthe Pentagram ritual is of the earth.Therefore, the invocation of Set Triumphant at the climax of the rite indicatesthe unlocking of a Gate between this world and the next, a Gate that is notquite the same as that which Osiris would have unlocked. It has nothing to dowith death and resurrection, per se, but of opening a portal to the Nightside ofthe Tree of Life, to what Grant refers to as the Tunnels of Set. Here once againCrowley has demonstrated the true nature of his mythos, moreover in a ritualthat was written in a heightened state of consciousness similar to that whichgave us the Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent: the book that formed the linkbetween Crowley the magician and Lovecraft the seer. That there is theperformance of a sexual act in the center of the ceremony and the consumption ofthe “Elements” thereafter is only another piece of evidence that Grant'sunderstanding of the Thelemic praxis as representing contact with the Dark Lordis the correct one.In religion, humans are subservient to God or the Gods, especially in theAbrahamic, monotheistic religions. In Thelema, the emphasis is reversed with allthe focus on human potential. There is no religious dogma in magic, as much asit might seem to be implied. Magicians dare to do what religious, pious humanbeings do not: to actively approach the Thrones of the Gods using whatever meansare available, even the most blasphemous. The Gods may be more powerful, andeven dangerous, but the properly trained human being can navigate the heavensand the hells with impunity.Chaos and Babalon—we might say Set and Ishtar, Dumuzi and Inanna, Shiva andShakti—represent the deepest occult processes that lie beneath the play of Maya,of the Illusory World of Creation. Chaos and Babalon are also the gateways tothe Dark Side of Creation, just as human sexuality is a gateway to deeperunconscious processes that function—powerfully—below the horizon of consciousthought, calculation, and conjecture. They are irrational forces, which is thecharacteristic that alarmed Lovecraft the most: they were immune to sober,scientific understanding just as the immense vastness of deep space lies outsidethe ability of the human mind to contemplate.The other Gods—Isis, Osiris, Horus, Thoth, Anubis, the list goes on and on andnot only for Egyptian deities but also the Greek, Roman, African, Indian,Chinese and so many other pantheons—are aspects of the basic and fundamentaltwo, of Chaos and Babalon. For convenience, they can be considered refinementsof specific aspects, points of view, chemical components, psycho-biologicalqualities—but that is not to denigrate their importance or value to themagician. Any one of these deities is a potent force far in excess of any humancapacity to contain completely.The Typhonian Tradition—according to Grant's thesis—is the most ancient of allreligious and occult traditions. Its origin is in the stars, and it lies at thebase of all later cults. That would indicate that its gods are the basis for alllater gods, its rituals the purer forms of all later rituals. But that would beto deny that human beings are capable of refining those ancient rites from timeto time, of fine-tuning the original processes for reasons of self-preservation,if nothing else. For Grant is not entirely optimistic concerning the designs ofthe ultramundane, extraterrestrial forces of which he writes so eloquently. Hisworks are not only guides through the Tunnels of Set to the Dark Side of theTree of Life: they are also warnings, warnings as sincere as those of Lovecraftwere fanciful.And in order to understand those forces, it is necessary to see how they wereinvoked by a plethora of “unspeakable cults” around the world, in rituals secretand at times profane.43 [part0007_split_000.html#ft43] Durkheim (1912) p. 3944 [part0007_split_000.html#ft44] There are other attainments beyond theKnowledge and Conversation of the HGA, and they will be discussed as they comeup.45 [part0007_split_000.html#ft45] Evidence for this may be found in the SumerianMaqlu text, the “Burning” grimoire that consists of spells against “witches”which may be taken to mean independent spiritual experts who work on behalf ofindividuals—for love, money, power, etc—rather than for the group. Anabbreviated form of this text appears in the Schlangekraft recension of theNecronomicon.46 [part0007_split_000.html#ft46] Crowley's approach can be characterized asbricolage, after its use as a term of art in cultural studies and anthropology,notably by Claude Levi-Strauss (The Savage Mind, 1962). This refers to a methodof taking whatever is useful at the time from whatever source and building asystem or a philosophy out of the assembled parts. Anyone reading Crowley's vastpublished work will readily come to the conclusion that Crowley indeed was abricoleur par excellence. Of course, central to the ritual environment of theGolden Dawn—the occult society that gave Crowley his first initiations—was thedoctrine of correspondences, in which disparate religious and spiritual elementswere given equivalence through the medium of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. This,in a sense, was a systematized form of bricolage.47 [part0007_split_000.html#ft47] He used the Golden Dawn grade system as thetemplate for his own AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]Both degree systems are based on a version of the Tree of Life of theKabbalists.48 [part0007_split_000.html#ft48] Crowley's instructions to his disciples onthese techniques form the substance of his Book Four which is completely focusedon yoga and which—in Crowley's system—became an important adjunct to the morewestern ceremonial practices of the Golden Dawn. Along with Book Four were hisEight Lectures on Yoga in which he develops these ideas even more specifically.In a sense, the yogic methods were the missing element in the grimoires whichsimply gave the rituals as recipes to be followed by those already trained inyoga (or in some corresponding form of mental and physiological controlrepresented in the western, European systems by fasting, celibacy, prayer,etc.).49 [part0007_split_000.html#ft49] This may be due to the emphasis put on samadhiin The Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali, a Hindu text of which Crowley was fond andwhich he recommended to his followers. It is also an essential aspect ofBuddhist meditation, and references to it can be found in the Sikh religion aswell.50 [part0007_split_000.html#ft50] This excerpt from Crowley's Book Four isillustrative of his contempt for Buddhism: “The vulgarism and provincialism ofthe Buddhist canon is infinitely repulsive to all nice minds; and the attempt touse the terms of an ego-centric philosophy to explain the details of apsychology whose principle doctrine is the denial of the ego, was the work of amischievous idiot.” (p. 80, footnote)51 [part0007_split_001.html#ft51] One can compare the Biblical Book ofRevelation (Apocalypse) with documents discovered at Qumran, such as the Song ofthe Sabbath Sacrifice, for similar predictions of a great cosmic battle and theloss of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem.52 [part0007_split_001.html#ft52] More properly referred to as “isopsephy” whenapplied to the Greek language and alphabet.53 [part0007_split_001.html#ft53] This idea would be adopted and elaborated uponby the cult around Crowley's contemporary, Maria de Naglowska (1883-1936) inParis, as well as by the German offshoot of the original OTO, the FraternitasSaturni and even the groups around the Italian mystic and fascist ideologueJulius Evola (1898-1974). The influence of these groups on the OTO andeventually on Thelema cannot be discounted or ignored, and even may contributeto a fuller understanding of Thelema, as well as an expansion of its majorthemes. See Chapter 5.54 [part0007_split_001.html#ft54] Another French depiction of a Black Mass canbe found in the twentieth century novel by Georges Bataille, L'histoire del'oeil—“The History of the Eye”—which is concerned with sexual as well asreligious transgression. It was published in 1928, and contains scenes in whichsexual fluids are intermingled in such a way as to suggest some of the deepermysteries of the western Tantric-influenced cults.55 [part0007_split_001.html#ft55] The word “bond” in this context expands uponthe definition of religio and ligare, given above, but more importantly it mayreflect a modern iteration of Giordano Bruno's revealing text, De vinculis ingenera (“Of Bonds in General”). Here Bruno identifies the “bond” as love oreros, and especially in a magical context, thus agreeing completely with AL I:41in which “bond” is equated with “love.” Bruno was burned at the stake by theCatholic Church in the year 1600 for heresy.56 [part0007_split_001.html#ft56] In this Crowley was anticipating therevolutionary psychological theories of Deleuze and Guattari in theirAnti-Oedipus, where they argue that families and society at large conspire torepress desire and act as vehicles of neuroses which are necessary to the smoothfunctioning of capitalist society. In such a situation schizophrenia is the onlylogical outcome. See also R. D.

The prose of these books, the chief of which are Liber CordisCincti Serpente, The Book of the Heart girt with the Serpent, and Libri velLapidis Lazuli, is wholly different from anything that I have written myself. Icannot doubt that these books are the work of an intelligence independent of myown.” Aleister Crowley, Confessions, Chapter 62, p. 558.69 [part0007_split_002.html#ft69] The following year—1908—the word “Tutulu”would reappear as Crowley was involved in evoking the Aires or Aethyrs of theEnochian system in North Africa at the time. The word was heard during theinvocation of the 27th Aethyr. At that time Crowley admitted that the word wasuntranslatable. See Crowley, The Vision and the Voice.70 [part0007_split_002.html#ft70] Accessed from Rangjung Yeshe Tibetan-EnglishDharma Dictionary.71 [part0007_split_002.html#ft71] This is a theme familiar to anyone who hasstudied Siberian shamanism, and reference to this concept can be found in theworks of Mircea Eliade (especially his magnum opus Shamanism) as well as inbooks by the present author, such as his Sinister Forces trilogy. In thistradition, a shaman is one who has undergone the death and rebirth experienceafter a long period of meditation and solitary ritual in the forest. The deathand rebirth formula is also an integral part of the initiation structure of theGolden Dawn and of Aleister Crowley's AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage[../images/00003.jpeg], as well as of the third degree of Freemasonry. In thatsense one could say that anyone who has gone through these systems can be calleda “kusulu,” but there is a difference between the formalized rituals of thewestern esoteric tradition and the intense psychological experience of genuineAsian shamanistic initiation.72 [part0007_split_003.html#ft72] Liber XXXVI is also known as The StarSapphire, see below. Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, London, StarfirePublishing, 1999.73 [part0007_split_003.html#ft73] See, for instance, Jean-Pierre Vernant, TheOrigins of Greek Thought, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 110-111.74 [part0007_split_003.html#ft74] One notable exception is his Liber XXXVI orStar Sapphire, which is a reworking of the Golden Dawn Ritual of the Hexagram,to be discussed below.75 [part0007_split_003.html#ft75] This is particularly evident in the GoldenDawn's document entitled “Z.1, The Enterer of the Threshold” which is ananalysis of the Neophyte initiation ritual. Set-Typhon occupies one of theInvisible Stations in this ritual, where he is described as “Omoo-Sathan,Typhon, Apophis, Set. The Evil Persona is a composite figure of the powersarising from the Qlippoth...” The other two stations on this Path—on the MiddlePillar of the Tree of Life, the segment named Samekh after the Hebrew letter—areHathor and Harparkrat. Hathor is sometimes considered a consort of Set and apartner in his drunken revels; the presence of Harparkrat (Harpocrates orHoor-paar-krat, the child form of Horus) along with Set and Hathor is a deadgive-away as to the true nature of the Aeon of Horus.

What if his vague suppositions are dark and mysterious hints, keys tothe puzzle, to those who know?”“Bosh!” This from Kirowan. “Are you intimating that any of the nightmare cultsreferred to by Von Junzt survive to this day—if they ever existed save in thehag-ridden brain of a lunatic poet and philosopher?”“Not he alone used hidden meanings,” answered Conrad.—Robert E. Howard, “The Children of the Night” (1931)ROBERT E. HOWARD WAS ONE of the circle of fantasy authors around H. P. Lovecraftsometimes referred to as the Lovecraft Circle. He contributed to what has becomeknown as the “Cthulhu Mythos” by writing stories such as the one excerpted abovewhich referenced Lovecraft's Cthulhu, the Necronomicon, and other motifs. One ofhis contributions to the Mythos was the fictional Nameless Cults by Von Junzt,which became the awkward Unaussprechlichen Kulten89[part0008_split_004.html#aft89] in Lovecraft's German rescension and from thereinto “Unspeakable Cults.” Howard's most famous creation, however, was Conan theBarbarian, the fantasy character made even more famous by the actor ArnoldSchwarzenegger. In 1936, at the age of 30, Howard committed suicide. He was notthe only member of Lovecraft's inner circle to do so. In 1951 he would befollowed by Robert H. Barlow, the noted anthropologist of ancient Mexico, expertin the Nahuatl language, and the literary executor of Lovecraft's estate. Hecommitted suicide in Mexico at the age of 32.One of the prevailing themes in Grant's work (and especially in that ofLovecraft and his circle of fellow gothic horror writers) is of cults that areeither African, Afro-Caribbean, Middle Eastern or Asian. In other words, cultsthat could be defined as non-Western. While Crowley speaks of these cults inpassing, he does not focus on them to the extent that Grant does, and Grant doesso because he feels that the practices and beliefs of these cults hold keystowards understanding underlying themes and techniques of occultism in generaland Thelema specifically.Thelema's origins, as described in the previous two chapters, can be found inthe interpretation of Egyptian mysteries by the British organizers of the GoldenDawn, the secret society in which Crowley was initiated, and their reevaluationand re-imagination by Crowley himself. Most of the religious references in theBook of the Law are to Egyptian god forms familiar to anyone who had beenthrough the initiatory system of the Golden Dawn.But there are tantalizing references to other schemes of initiation in AL, andwhile Crowley did immerse himself for awhile in Asian methods of magic andmysticism his focus always remained on those systems that were most familiar toWesterners, and those elements of Asian systems that were already in translationin English. He had virtually no background in African or Afro-Caribbean systems.He was thus limited in his ability to draw the same inferences and conclusionsof later occultists who had access to greater resources, either in translationor through direct experience of the non-Western systems.This is beginning to be rectified, and it is largely to Grant that we owe thisexpansion of Thelemic ideas, methods, and practices into non-Western systems ofinitiation, and vice versa.However, while the intellectual composition of Thelema has been extended greatlythrough Grant's work, it is through the creative and visionary accomplishmentsof H. P. Lovecraft that we owe the emotional content, albeit in ways the horrorwriter never consciously intended.“Weird fiction seems to vie with works on witchcraft, voodoo and dark magic.”—Robert E. Howard, “The Children of the Night”It is the contention of this writer, as well as of Kenneth Grant, that Lovecraftin some way—unconsciously, probably—was in touch with, or otherwise aware of,the same spiritual material that informed Crowley's contact in Cairo in 1904. Wehave seen in the previous chapter how closely events in Lovecraft's “Call ofCthulhu” mirrored Crowley's Holy Book revelations. There are other parallels,and other synchronicities, between the two writers and as we proceed with thisinvestigation we will look at some of them. What is compelling about thesecorrespondences is that the one amplifies and explains the other. Grant's geniuslay in making those initial connections between the horror writer on the onehand and the Prophet of the New Age on the other. It was a bold contention, forit was in danger of making modern occultism look like some kind of role-playinggame, a sword-and-sorcery affair replete with scary monsters and secret books.Several of the cults most important to Lovecraft's stories are precisely thosethat intrigue both Crowley and Grant. These include the Haitian religion ofVoodoo (also spelled variously vodou, vodun, etc.) and the Mesopotamian religionof the Yezidi. “Voodoo” makes its appearance in Lovecraft's “Call of Cthulhu” aswell as throughout Grant's published work. Grant's interest in thisAfro-Caribbean religion was intensified through his relationship with MichaelBertiaux (b. 1935) of La Couleuvre Noire (the “Black Snake”), an occult orderbased on Haitian Vodou with ideas and methods derived from the Western mysterytraditions as well as Lovecraftian and Thelemic elements."},{"pageContent":"SYNCRETISMS, ORIENTALISMSBertiaux had spent some time in Haiti before embracing his own particular occultpath, and became a member of a society—the Ordo Templi Orientis Antiqua orOTOA—allegedly created by a mysterious and possibly non-existent Haitianoccultist Lucien-François Jean-Maine (1869?-1960) of whom there is very littlehard information. The OTOA was evidently a mixture of quasi-Masonic ritual andinitiation and traditional Vodun, forming a bridge between European-styleceremonial magic traditions and the Afro-Carib-bean Vodun cultus. Jean-Maine wasallegedly the inheritor of an ancient Haitian occult lineage that numbers amongits lineage-holders the venerable Ordre des Elus-Cohen which had a branch inLeogane, Haiti. This is not the place to go into the history of the Elus Cohen(or “Elect Priests”), so suffice it to say that it was a branch of theeighteenth century Martinist order and the branch most closely concerned withritual magic. Martinism began as a Masonic-type society in pre-revolutionaryFrance but its founder—Martinez de Pasqually—died in Haiti in 1774. Haiti atthat time was a French colony. Hence the suggested French Masonic-Haitian Vodunconnection.Bertiaux worked and expanded upon the system he inherited, and brought it intoline with Thelema by 1972. His Vodoun Gnostic Workbook became quite well-knownfor its imaginative combination of western esotericism, Afro-Caribbean conceptsand terminology, and sex magic. Kenneth Grant saw in Bertiaux's work averification of his belief that the Thelemic magical current had to beallinclusive if it represented a genuine change of Aeon. That meant thatanalogues had to be found in African, Latin American and Asian traditions aswell as the more familiar European and Middle Eastern practices. Not only that,but these traditions would also hold keys to the full implementation of thecurrent, based on their knowledge of occult matters and technologies stemmingfrom their own environment, culture, and history and which might be eitherignored or missing in western systems. Knowledge, to Grant, is power.As we mentioned above, Crowley's own knowledge of these practices was thin. Thisis not to criticize Crowley, for deep understanding of these mysticaltechnologies had always eluded Western observers and there were few who had therequisite background in the languages and rituals of India, Africa, and theindigenous cultures of all continents in the early twentieth century. That wouldgradually change, and by the beginning of the twenty-first century a growingnumber of religious studies and anthropology scholars have made tremendousinroads into Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, African, and Afro-Caribbean languagesand scriptures, both written and oral. Grant's contribution was to make as muchuse as possible of the growing body of esoteric literature in translation fromAsian and African sources in order to elaborate upon Thelemic themes and tocreate a more powerful ritual machinery for probing the darker side ofoccultism.Thus, not only the Haitian religious system known as Vodun but also primarysource material on Tantric practices make their way into Grant's grand design.These elements were always there in Crowley's writings and even in Liber ALitself, of course. But before Grant the focus primarily had been on theEgyptian, Kabbalistic and to some extent alchemical characteristics of Thelemicritual and concepts. Bertiaux—and the Tantric expert David Curwen—were able tocontribute to Grant's knowledge of non-European occultism in important ways.Heretofore, the occult or esoteric practices of any culture were basicallyconsistent with that culture and it's religious and magical ideas. This was thecase even when there was obvious borrowing, such as within the syncretic faiths(such as Santeria, Vodun, etc.) where there was an admixture of foreigncomponents with an indigenous belief system. The power of magic rests, however,in its antinomian nature: it lives on the outer limits of what is traditional,acceptable, “normal,” and legal. While Gnosticism, for instance, can beunderstood as a kind of Christian esotericism, it borrowed heavily from Egyptianand Platonic sources, sources that would have been anathema to orthodoxChristians.But this type of syncretism was a result of neighboring cultures meeting eachother and borrowing from the religious and esoteric practices of the other. Whatis proposed in Grant's project is nothing less than a borrowing from whateversource, wherever in the world, and whenever it existed. There is no sense ofgeographic proximity resulting in adulteration of one method or another, but ofthe deliberate search through the world's religions, esotericisms, mysticismsand magics for methods that can be adapted to the overall agenda of Thelema.While this seems to have been Crowley's original intention—as reflected, forinstance, in the tables of correspondences between the world's religions thatcan be found in Liber 777, a project begun by members of the Golden Dawn andgreatly expanded by Crowley—it would be Grant who would make this type ofdeliberate and conscious syncretism a cornerstone of his cult.Leaders of religions may quarrel with each other over beliefs and dogma;devotees of religions may fight and kill each other over their differences; butmystics understand each other, regardless of their formal affiliation. Mysticsare interested in techniques for achieving altered states of consciousness thatcan lead them to greater and deeper understanding. The attempt by some inThelemic circles to forge bonds between Tantra, Vodun, Kabbalah, ceremonialmagic, and alchemy represents this point of view. This is not—and should notbe—an attempt to find justification for one particular dogma over another, or toprop up one particular interpretation over another. It is, instead, a quest fortruth in the discovery of workable techniques. Magicians are interested only inwhat works. Like scientists from both sides during the Cold War, there iscuriosity and a willingness to learn from potential enemies as well as fromfriends.The danger in this approach lies in the facile comparisons made betweendifferent cultures as if their gods and rituals had exact equivalents amongthose in another completely different culture. There is evidence of this inLiber 777 and the tables of correspondences which demonstrate the creators wereoften too quick to make associations between deities that may or may not havemuch in common. This tendency has been called “universalism” by the post-moderncritics who instead emphasize ethnic and cultural originality and uniqueness.Both of these approaches—in their extreme manifestations—are equally erroneous,in my view.What Grant has done is to cull these different techniques and approaches inorder to discover knowledge that cultures other than his own had obtainedthrough the use of methods that might have been neglected in the West due toignorance or tabu. This is especially true when it comes to occult or esoterictechniques that are sexually-based or based upon a knowledge of human anatomyand physiology that has been put to use by those who perceived a spiritualanalogue to physical properties and functions. While a Western bias has been todowngrade the importance of the human body, or to see the human body as apotential source of sin and transgression, the Asian and African viewpointsreflect a respect for the body and an interest in examining biological functionsin terms of their spiritual potential, or their potential for attaininghigher—or simply altered—states of consciousness.Thus, sexuality and drugs became the province of non-Western esoteric practicesafter the rise of Christianity in Europe repressed and suppressed these ideas.While there is much more to Asian and African forms of spirituality andesotericism than sexuality and drugs, these represented the missing pieces inthe Western repetoire.The story of the OTO has the founders traveling to the Middle East to obtaininitiations in “sex magic” and related methods. Pascal Beverly Randolph (a majorinfluence on modern Western esotericism) also claimed Middle Easterninitiations, and Aleister Crowley himself traveled through North Africa andIndia—as well as Ceylon—in search of African and Asian wisdom.Grant, however, took a more organized approach to the subject and begancollecting previously-unknown or untranslated esoteric texts from these culturesas well as building relationships with those who had already been initiated intothose traditions. This included Michael Bertiaux and David Curwen, as we shallsee. But Grant did not stop there.Other forms of creative spirituality were not immune to Grant's all-inclusiveapproach. Art and literature represented, for Grant, additional avenues toexplore for greater understanding of the Thelemic project as well as a source ofother technologies that could become part of the magician's arsenal.Thus, the art of Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was given as much regard inGrant's cult as the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. While Lovecraft described the“hideous” practices of Asian and African cults in words, Spare canonized them inhis art and his magical system. Grotesque human forms engaged in obscure ritualare powerful images in Spare's magical worldview, just as grotesque alien beingshold blind, omnipotent sway over humans in Lovecraft's world. Even more to thepoint, Spare understood that words—Lovecraft's metier—have intrinsic magicalpower as well, and could be manipulated in such a way that the physicalrepresentation of a word or phrase could acquire occult potency. It was anattempt to use words as art forms, to reduce words to the ideas they represent:to bring them back to their original status as symbols, as hieroglyphics.Spare's system was atavistic: a going-back in time to the period when writingwas first being invented, a time when the written word held tremendous magicalpower and could be interpreted only by the initiates, the priests.In this, Spare's system was as much a reference to ancient cults as it was anidiosyncratic occult method of his own devising. This was probably whatattracted Grant in the first place, for Spare was a unique individual with anon-denominational approach to occultism. There was no formal Kabbalah inSpare's system, no nod to Jewish or Christian contexts. Instead, it was a kindof orientalist fantasy of occultism and acted as a reach beyond texts as such tothe deeper layers of consciousness where our fears and our anxieties (and oursexuality) are located ... somewhere in the limbic brain, perhaps, curled arounditself at the top of the spinal cord.One of the iconic forms of this type of “orientalist fantasy” is the emphasisgiven to the Kurdish cult of the Yezidi. Since Grant devotes an entire chapterto the Yezidi in his Outer Gateways, it behooves us to investigate this religionfurther and to try to separate the wheat from the chaff."},{"pageContent":"THE CULT OF THE PEACOCK ANGELI read of it first in the strange book of Von Junzt, the German eccentric wholived so curiously and died in such grisly and mysterious fashion.

Whilerumors of the Yezidi made their way into European travelogues and archaeologicalliterature in the nineteenth century,90 [part0008_split_004.html#aft90] itwasn't until the early days of the twentieth century that they became betterknown and the subject of one book that set the tone for so many future“revelations”: Isya Joseph's Devil Worship: The Sacred Books and Traditions ofthe Yezidiz. Published in 1919, Joseph's book contained the first Englishversions of the Black Book and the Revelation: two previously secret andunpublished texts said to be the core scriptures of the Yezidi faith and which,according to Joseph, were translated from the Arabic. These texts are referencedin Grant's books and in other occult and esoteric works that touch on the Yezidicultus.Recent scholarship, however, has shown that these two texts are most likely theresult of a hoax perpetrated by a well-known antiquities dealer and forger ofdocuments and are not actual Yezidi texts.91 [part0008_split_004.html#aft91] TheYezidi are said to possess what is largely an oral tradition, composed of manydisparate elements including—but not limited to—those of Christian, Islamic,Jewish and possibly Gnostic and Zoroastrian beliefs and practices. While they dospeak of a “Black Book” that was written in heaven, their religion is based lesson doctrine and more on the correct observance of ritual. That said, it is alsogenerally agreed that the texts of the published “Black Book” and “Book ofRevelation” do accurately reflect the basic beliefs of the main Yezidi clanseven though they are not genuine Yezidi scriptures.Grant first mentions the Yezidi at the very outset of his nine-volume series onThelemic magic, in The Magical Revival first published in 1972. It is clear fromthis book and virtually all his subsequent works that he considered the Yezidi acore influence and an important spiritual tradition with links to Thelema andspecifically to Crowley and Aiwaz. However—except for a single chapter in OuterGateways—he repeats himself on the subject without adding any new material orjustifying his concentration on the Yezidi. Much of his information is takeneither from Joseph's work or from stray remarks by Massey, etc.The basic ideas are these:First, the whole attraction of the Yezidi for both Crowley and Grant is the ideathat they are devil worshippers. If not for this, they most probably would havebeen ignored—not only by Crowley and Grant but by a number of nineteenth-centuryexplorers who mention them in travelogues on the Kurdish tribal areas. If therewas an ancient sect in the Middle East that had been worshipping the devil sincetime immemorial, it would be an important element of fin-de-siecle orientalistfantasies about the Black Mass, satanism, and witchcraft.Second, Grant has the idea—an echo of references found in Massey—that the Yezidiare descendants of the ancient Akkadian and Sumerian cultures that representsome of the oldest (if not the oldest) civilizations in the world of which wehave any written record, predating even the Egyptians. This fascination with“origins” is one of the hallmarks of the universalist approach to the study ofreligion and culture, and is also a component of ideas concerning spiritualsuccession and lineage (i.e., spiritual authority).The first of these ideas—that the Yezidi are “devil worshippers”—is connected tothe fact that Shaitan is an important element of the Yezidi belief-system.Shaitan—or “Satan”—is the Fallen Angel who rebelled against God when humans wereelevated in importance above the angels. To the Yezidi, Satan will be the firstof God's creatures to enter heaven as he will be the first to be forgiven. Thisreverence for Shaitan is reflected in the tabu associated with the sound “sh”with which the word Shaitan begins. Yezidi avoid using that sound as much aspossible because of its connection. This has led to the misunderstanding thatthe Yezidi actually worship Shaitan, or Satan. Yet, another point of view on thesubject is that the name Shaitan is so sacred—and therefore unpronounceable bythe pious—that another form of address and identification had to be created totake its place in normal conversation. While it seems likely that the Yezidi doworship (or at least reverence) Shaitan, and are aware of his demonicassociations, they do not associate Shaitan with evil. Shaitan's “sin” was inrefusing to bow down before Man, claiming that he would bend the knee to noother but God as that is what God had commanded from the beginning. So Godpunished Shaitan for disobeying his second command while honoring him for hiscommitment to obeying the first command, thus ensuring that Shaitan would be thefirst creature to be redeemed.The chief (pronounceable) object of worship among the Yezidi is known as MelekTa'us,92 [part0008_split_004.html#aft92] the so-called “Peacock Angel,” and hasbecome another focus of Grant's work—as he associates the peacock with a host ofentities and ideas that reinforce his overall concept of a Dark Lord. This is asubject we will examine shortly, but some observers have claimed that MelekTa'us and Shaitan are one and the same. Indeed, the cosmologies and creationstories of the Yezidi tend to support this idea at times, and to contradict itat others. In the absence of a written text, this confusion (at least tooutsiders) is inevitable.The second issue of importance to Grant is the idea that the Yezidi are somehowdescendants or survivors of the Sumerians. Grant's equation can be summarizedas: Sumer = Yezidi = Satan = Aiwass. In order to address this idea we have toask: who are the Yezidi, and where did they come from?This is a controversial area for ethnologists, politicians, anthropologists andhistorians of religion alike. The Yezidi themselves claim an origin variously inIndia or in Sumer; to split the difference, there is a claim that they came fromIndia to Sumer, and are descendants of the Sumerians themselves.93[part0008_split_004.html#aft93] That they are presently considered a Kurdishclan is based mostly on their language—most Yezidi speak a form of Kurdish knownas Kurmanji—and upon the fact that their tribal lands are within Kurdishterritory in northern Iraq and are often counterminous with Kurdish lands inother areas in Syria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, etc. This connection may also be dueto the fact that the Kurds in general are subject to varying degrees ofdiscrimination and outright genocide (such as under the regime of Saddam Husseinin Iraq) and the Yezidis are easily one of the most discriminated-against clansin the world.The problem of the origins of the Yezidis as well as the nature of theirreligious philosophy is compounded by the fact that their leaders seem to saydifferent things to different people, as is evidenced by the wide variety ofacademic and journalistic sources that all seem to contradict each other onessential points. The lack of a definitive written scripture only adds to theconfusion among outside observers. Combine this with the violent upheavals towhich the Yezidis have been subjected over hundreds of years and which entailedthe loss of land, documents, and the near genocide of their people on religiousand political grounds, and it is a wonder that they have survived as long asthey have and that their sacred shrine of Lalish—believed by them to be thecenter of the universe—still stands in northern Iraq, near the Turkish border.For our purposes, however, there are actually several pieces of circumstantialevidence that indicate the Yezidis are closer to Grant's concept of them thanfirst appear. In the first place, we remember from the previous chapter that theEgyptian god Set was fond of lettuce and that is how he was tricked intoconsuming the semen of Horus. Oddly, the consumption of lettuce is tabu amongthe Yezidis. The “exoteric” explanation for this is that the word for lettucesounds too similar to the name of one of their prophets. But if the name Shaitanis indeed a version of the Egyptian name Set, then the lettuce tabu makesperfect sense.Another strange coincidence lies in the fact that the Kurdish word for “God” isKhudâ or “Lord.”94 [part0008_split_004.html#aft94] We cannot help but recognizethe similarity between Khudâ and Kutu, the Sumerian word for the Biblical cityof Gudua or Cutha, which—according to the Schlangekraft recension of theNecronomicon—is the basis for the name of Lovecraft's Cthulhu or “Man of Cutha”or “Man of Kutu”: Kutulu. Cutha was ruled by the Sumerian god Nergal and wasbelieved to be the gate to the Underworld, which once again supports a Sumerianor Babylonian connection to the Yezidis who do, after all, live in a region thatwas once part of the Babylonian empire. Indeed, the ancient site of Nineveh95[part0008_split_004.html#aft95] is not far from Lalish and the modern Iraqi cityof Mosul.All that said, while there is no proof that the Yezidis are descendants of theSumerians or even from another migrating tribe from northern India or Persia,their religion and culture is distinct from Islamic, Christian, and Jewishpractices and theologies. One of their most revered leaders—Sheikh Adi—was bymost accounts a Sufi mystic. While many observers agree that the Yezidi religionis syncretistic—a combination of various elements from other religious practicesincluding most probably Persian Zoroastrianism, in some ways like Santeria andother Afro-Caribbean religions that mixed Roman Catholic iconography and ritualwith indigenous African belief systems—the Sufi element is one that probablyencouraged the incorporation of antinomian and even transgressive beliefs, suchas the idea that the Fallen Angel will be the first to be redeemed along withthe Yezidis. It was after all Sufism that was the first Islamic presence in theislands of Java and Sumatra in the fifteenth century (and earlier) and itsinfluence can be seen there today in such practices as visiting graves,reverencing saints, etc. which are also hallmarks of Yezidism but which are notaccepted Islamic practice. In fact, Grant himself seems to make the connectionbetween syncretistic forms of religion, expanded consciousness, and contact withsupramundane entities when he writes:The Amenta of the Egyptians is identical to the Agharta of the Mongols. Thelatter with their pre-Buddhistic Bön complex, and shamanistic rites with Tantricimplicits, produced a weird combination of savage grotesquery and the profoundmetaphysical adumbrations of the SÛnyâtavâda. ... It is therefore in theEskimo-shamanistic and the Bön impregnated Buddhism of Tibet, Mongolia, Java andSumatra, that the fundamental tenets of the Madhyamaka—as permeating theNyingmapa and Drukpa Cults—are relevant to the Necronomicon Gnosis.96[part0008_split_004.html#aft96]Without going into detail on the definitions of the Buddhist terms, the firstimpression one gets from that passage is that Grant is playing fast and loosewith his attributions by linking Amenta (the Egyptian land of the Dead) toAgharta, the fabled underground city believed hidden somewhere in theHimalayas.97 [part0008_split_004.html#aft97] That there may be a closeconnection between the indigenous Bön religion of Tibet and Tantric practices isbeing debated by scholars of the literature; as is the idea that Bön is asurvival of an older, shamanistic cult which certainly seems to be the case.Grant's boldness, however, lies more in making the case that Tibetan Buddhism(which is primarily Tantric) is somehow cognate with Egyptian mysteries and theNecronomicon; and that “savage grotesquery” and “profound metaphysicaladumbrations” can combine to form a new kind of spiritual methodology. But thisis Grant's forte.Modern western magic is a refusal to accept the position of post-modernism thateach culture is unique and owes nothing to other cultures, even when similarideas, symbols, and rituals are involved. As a magical operator in the modernworld, one has to embrace a kind of neo-universalism in which one recognizes theexistence of a symbol structure representing an underlying reality behind allobserved phenomena. The expert manipulation of these symbols results in changesin phenomena. The magician is thus sensitive to the power and nature ofsymbols—including symbolic action, symbolic sounds, smells, etc.—and can drawinferences across diverse cultures and times. Just as human biology is the samewhether one is a native Tibetan or African or European, etc.; and even thoughthere may be many superficial differences and variations in language, food, andso forth; the symbol systems of different cultures may reveal superficialdifferences as a result of geography, history, and even religion, but the statesof consciousness represented by these symbols are identical or nearly so. Therewould be no syncretic religions if this were not the case, for if each religionwas sui generis it would be impossible to incorporate alien gods, rites, andbeliefs. Of course, this is not the case with religious dogma whichfundamentally resists attempts at syncretism; but it is the case with religiouspraxis, which is the only form of religion that interests the magician. As notedpreviously, the magician is not a member of the congregation of any religion:the magician is a priest and an independent spiritual specialist whose interestsolely resides in effective methods (rituals) and convenient modes of analysis(symbol systems). Thus the emphasis on cults versus religions, for a cult is alaboratory of ritual and dangerous practice. It may be a matter of opinion as towhether the ritual came before the dogma or vice versa; but it has beendemonstrated in the case of religions as disparate as The Church of Jesus Christof Latter-Day Saints and Scientology that their origins are to be found inmagical—that is to say, occult—ritual. The dogmas came later.Thus when we speak of the Yezidi religion we are struck by the fact that theemphasis seems to be on correct ritual practice rather than doctrine. There iscontroversy over whether or not the Yezidi have a written sacred text; theirscripture seems to reside in the chants, songs, and prayers that are memorizedby the faithful and by their ritual specialists. There is also an emphasis ongenetic purity: a Yezidi may not marry outside the faith, and there is nopossibility of an outsider converting to Yezidism. This association of thebody—the blood, the flesh—with religious purity and acceptability is an echo ofthe occult preoccupations of many different cultures and religious affiliations.It is also a hallmark of cultic practice: the desire to cut off a group from theoutside world in order to maintain the group's physical, emotional and spiritualintegrity is (among other things) a form of distrust of the “Other” but it isalso a way to switch tables by making the mainstream group the “Other.”98[part0008_split_004.html#aft98]In the case of the Yezidi, this is taken a step further when they identifythemselves with the supreme icon of the Other in the western world: the FallenAngel, Shaitan. Their relationship to this form of the Dark Lord is complex. Onthe one hand, Shaitan is an emblem of bad luck that inspires fear. On the otherhand, he is the Lord of the Angelic Hosts and is also known as the Lord ofPower.99 [part0008_split_004.html#aft99] This rather schizoid construct is soreminiscent of the way the Egyptians considered Set as to be virtuallyidentical.To Grant, the peacock symbol is particularly important for he sees in therainbow-hued spread of feathers a reference to the kalas: the spiritual essencessecreted by the female partner in Tantric rituals. While it is possible that theYezidis have their origin in India—as has been claimed—there is no indication atthe present time that anything resembling sexual rituals or Tantra is knownamong them. Yet, the peacock itself is a curious emblem for a Kurdish clan innorthern Iraq to worship for peacocks are not native to that country while theyare more common in India.The portals that lead to the inner chambers of Yezidi shrines are usuallyadorned with carvings of snakes. The snake is shown as rising up from the groundand appears as a vertical decoration on the right-hand side of the entrance. Theappearance of a snake in this context further led observers to believe thatthere was something vaguely satanic about the Yezidis, since the serpent is asymbol of evil and of the Devil in Judaeo-Christian religions. It was theserpent who tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, leading to the fall of humanityfrom paradise. In Egypt, of course, it was identified with Apophis, the evilcreature intent on devouring the barque of Ra; but in Indian yoga and Tantra,the serpent represents the coiled energy at the base of the spine known asKundalini. The fact that the Yezidi serpent is depicted vertically alongside theentrance to the sacred shrine may be further—circumstantial—evidence of aconnection with Indian beliefs, as a vertical serpent would be an obviousreference to the raising of Kundalini which is the goal of Kundalini yoga as itis of some forms of Tantra. However, there is no evidence for the existence of a“Yezidi Tantra.”One of Aleister Crowley's associates during his sojourn in the United States in1919 was the noted author and adventurer William Seabrook (1884-1945).Fascinated by the occult and foreign locales, Seabrook had written a number ofpopular books and magazine articles on his travels in Africa, the Middle Eastand the Caribbean, and even claimed to have eaten human flesh on at least oneoccasion.100 [part0008_split_004.html#aft100] Seabrook's works have beencriticized by anthropologists who doubt his ability (or his desire) to separatereality from fantasy, but he stands at the crossroads of the topics that sofascinated Kenneth Grant: the Yezidis, witchcraft, and Vodun. In addition, as afriend of Crowley he seems to be excellently positioned as a source for thebeliefs and inspirations behind Grant's overall thesis.When it comes to the Yezidis, Seabrook claims that these “devil worshippers”maintain a network of seven towers across the Middle East, and Central and EastAsia:Stretching across Asia, from North Manchuria, through Tibet, west throughPersia, and ending in the Kurdistan, was a chain of seven towers on isolatedmountaintops; and in each one of these towers sat continuously a Priest ofSatan, who by “broadcasting” occult vibrations controlled the destinies of theworld for evil.101 [part0008_split_004.html#aft101]There is no further evidence for this claim other than Seabrook's ownstatements, and it is possible that the towers one sees at Kalish and at otherYezidi shrines were the inspiration for this idea. Yezidi sacred architecture isunique: their shrines are in the shape of fluted cones surmounted by a goldenball that is said to represent the sun. At the base of the cone is an openingthrough which one can see a fire burning. The fire is an eternal flame, tendedby the Yezidis, and is thus reminiscent of Zoroastrian practice.If the Yezidi faith truly represents a survival of Persian Zoroastrianism, thenthere is some truth to Seabrook's statement that their “towers” extend throughAsia, for the Zoroastrians themselves have survived in India and Pakistan wherethey are known as Parsis. Forced to flee Persia (Iran) rather than convert toIslam in the eighth and ninth centuries CE, the Zoroastrian community foundthemselves in Pakistan (near Karachi) and in India in the Gujarat region inMumbai, the former Bombay. There are several fire temples in the Mumbai areawhere the Zoroastrians—now known as Parsis from the word for “Persian”—havebecome pillars of the Indian community, well-known for their charitable works.They also practice a form of “sky burial” known as the Towers of Silence.Because the elements are considered sacred, the Parsis leave their dead on topof these towers as food for vultures. To bury a corpse is considered adefilement of the earth, and to burn a corpse is considered a defilement of fire(which is a sacred symbol in Zoroastrianism). In Mumbai, these towers arelocated on Malabar Hill in what is now an upscale neighborhood where they havebecome controversial due to the fact that the vulture population is decliningand the presence of certain antibiotics in the dead bodies results in thecorpses taking longer and longer to decay. It should be noted that “sky burial”is also a feature of Tibetan religious and cultural practice, where the dead areleft in the open air as food for carrion birds.It is possible that the unique tower architecture of the Yezidis was conflatedwith the Towers of Silence in Mumbai to give Seabrook the idea that there was anetwork of Yezidi towers stretching from Kurdistan to Tibet and Manchuriathrough Persia. Further, there are still Zoroastrians living in Iran, especiallyin the city of Yazd which boasts a fire temple whose flame has been burningsteadily since the fifth century CE. (The similarity in name between Yazd andthe Yezidi has been noted by several authors, but there is no consensus ofopinion as to where the name Yezid or Yezidi originated or even what it actuallymeans.) However, there is no evidence that there are “Priests of Satan” who sitatop these towers broadcasting “occult vibrations” for evil purposes.There are, however, certain sites sacred to the Yezidis which have, for Grant,occult significance. Basing his information on Isya Joseph's The DevilWorshippers (but without attribution) he mentions five cult zones, one of whichis Lalish (the center of the Yezidi religion already mentioned) and anotherwhich is called variously Weran Šahr or Goran Šahr:... meaning the ‘sunken city’, which recalls the sunken city of R'lyeh whereGreat Cthulhu waits dreaming.... We are now in a position to appreciateCrowley's claim to have continued, in and through Thelema, the major tenets ofthe Yezidic cult.102 [part0008_split_004.html#aft102]As mentioned previously, Crowley believed his supramundane contact and HolyGuardian Angel Aiwaz to have been a god of ancient Sumer.103[part0008_split_004.html#aft103] The Yezidis claim a Sumerian ancestry for theirpeople and their religion and, indeed, reverence a form of Shaitan or Set.Further, the official seal of the Yezidi clan depicts not only the peacock ofMelek Ta'us,104 [part0008_split_004.html#aft104] but also cuneiform inscriptionsplus the ancient Sumerian cuneiform symbol for “god,” the eight-pointed star,105[part0008_split_004.html#aft105] thus showing their insistence on an ancientMesopotamian origin for their faith. All of this data is consistent with whatGrant calls the “Necronomicon gnosis.”The only lengthy examination of the Yezidis in Grant's works appears as a singlechapter in Outer Gateways: “The Magical Significance of Yezidic Symbolism.” Inthat chapter, Grant associates the Yezidis with a number of other religions,cults, myths, practices, etc. with a heavy reliance upon coincidences innumerology, similar-sounding words, etc., all with a view towards demonstratingthat the Yezidis are the inheritors of an ancient magical Typhonian current thaterupted in the system of Thelema as preached by Crowley. Crowley himself impliesas much, of course, but Grant attempts to “prove” this connection and elaborateupon it. The problem with his approach is that it is based almost entirely onthe few scraps of information available on the Yezidis in a handful of outdatedand unreliable sources (such as Seabrook), which are then tied into the granddesign using the most tenuous of associations. Thus, for Grant, the peacock is aphallic symbol because the eyes on the peacock's feathers represent the “meatusof the phallus, which is why the cock was typical of Yezid”106[part0008_split_004.html#aft106] and:The eyes in the tail of the peacock, or the meatus in the phallus of Yezid areequally connoted, and are resumed in the glyph of the Eye in the Triangle whichforms part of the emblem of the O.T.O. Kaph signifies both the palm (of thehand), and the kaf ape, which typified among other things the open eye or theexposed meatus of the circumcised penis in a state of erection, thus denotingthe ever wakeful one.107 [part0008_split_004.html#aft107]One is tempted to say that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. However, we beginto realize that virtually everything in the cosmos can be interpreted sexually,or using sexual metaphor, and that this is a hallmark of the “twilight language”used by occultists, alchemists, and mystics as a kind of meta-language fordiscussing otherwise ineffable—or “unspeakable”—concepts. There is only oneprocess in the universe, and every science, every art, every religion, everyfield of occult knowledge can be discussed and investigated using the languageof that process. Thus, using sexual metaphor, one can describe ecstatic mysticalstates as well as the transmutation of lead into gold.Crowley himself makes this point when he writes:I have myself constructed numerous ceremonies where it is frankly admitted thatreligious enthusiasm is primarily sexual in character.... I have insisted thatsexual excitement is merely a degraded form of divine ecstasy.108[part0008_split_004.html#aft108]This divine ecstasy is still only a means towards an end. Ecstasy can bechemically induced, or brought about by various other means, none of which wouldnecessarily result in spiritual illumination, acquisition of occult powers, etc.Intensive meditation, of the type enjoyed by anchorites and hermits of variousdisciplines, also results in divine ecstasy, minus the overtly sexualcomponents. The magical path represented by Crowley and by his mentors in theGolden Dawn, however, sees emotional and psychological states as reflective ofspiritual qualities that may or may not be perceived as good or evil in and ofthemselves: these states are only levels of understanding, of types ofexperience that do not carry moral loads but are informational. They areinterpreted within a specific cultural context such as the Kabbalistic Tree ofLife or any other complete cosmological system that makes a space for all formsof human experience, including the divine and the demonic. In order forCrowley's system to be the complete cosmology that any magical practice demands,it must make room for what Western spiritual experience would consider demonic,satanic, etc. There are, after all, two “Keys of Solomon” in the repetoire ofthe Golden Dawn: the Greater Key, which is concerned with angelic and planetarymagic, and the Lesser Key, or Goetia, which is wholly involved with the raisingof demons. Both are necessary. And it is the peculiar characteristic ofsexuality that it can be a “Greater Key,” an expression of love, respect,fidelity, a means of reproduction and the survival of the species, a symbol ofunion with the divine ... and a “Lesser Key,” an avenue for the manifestation ofthe darkest desires of a human being, of sadism, masochism, and all the demonsof a Krafft-Ebing grimoire:Sexual feeling is really the root of all ethics, and no doubt of aestheticismand religion.The sublimest virtues, even the sacrifice of self, may spring from sexual life,which, however, on account of its sensual power, may easily degenerate into thelowest passion and basest vice.Love unbridled is a volcano that burns down and lays waste all around it; it isan abyss that devours all honour, substance and health.109[part0008_split_004.html#aft109]Thus at its core sexuality is as pure as atomic energy: it can be used forpeaceful purposes, or for creating weapons. The irony lies in the fact that itmay sometimes be necessary to have an atomic bomb, i.e., that for the species tosurvive a means of protection is often required. This is the basis of Tantra,which sees sexuality as a metaphor, as the creative process, as a means ofuniting with the divine, and as a means of acquiring occult powers. It is alsoas good a description as any of the double nature of Set in the Egyptiancontext, and why Set is associated with sexual ritual and magic by Grant.While many of the rituals of the Yezidi are largely secret to which outsidersare rarely, if ever, invited there is still no evidence that they engage insexual ceremonies or elaborate, Tantric-style magical procedures. They maysatisfy the requirements of Crowley and Grant that they represent a connectionwith ancient Sumer and with the worship of the Old God, Shaitan or Set, andwhile such may be romanticized projections by orientalist observers what is tobe respected is that they have not abandoned their faith, even under direoppression by a host of hostile entities. They maintain their ritual purity,their sacred calendar, their beliefs, and their rites in the face of Iraqi,Russian, Muslim and even Kurdish opposition. They refuse to intermarry, or toaccept outsiders into their religion, a religion that is identified not onlywith their beliefs but with their ethnicity as well. It is the mere fact oftheir existence that has intrigued and excited European and American occultists,for here is a clan whose religion is so far removed from anything else in theregion as to appear bizarre to outsiders and who claim an origin in the vanishedcivilization of Sumer ... and who worship a god that some insist is the DarkLord himself."},{"pageContent":"OBEAH AND WANGAOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a franticsummons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there,mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the gripof stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night.It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had everknown. ... There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chantsand dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people couldstand it no more.—H.P. Lovecraft, “The Call of Cthulhu”Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand andthe work of the sword; these he shall learn and teach. (AL I:37).When we discuss the Yezidis, we are faced with very little accurate and reliableinformation and a lot of speculation. When we come to the Afro-Caribbean aspectof the Necronomicon Gnosis, we are in a somewhat different position.While Haitian Vodun (commonly spelled “voodoo”) was just as vulnerable a hundredyears ago to wild speculation and hysteria as the “devil worshipping” Yezidis,we have a greater store of solid information and documentation about Vodun andother Afro-Caribbean religions due to the intense interest shown byanthropologists and historians of religion in recent years. In addition, thepresence of African-origin populations in the Caribbean and large communities ofAfro-Caribbean origin in the United States has made Western access to thesecultures easier than it is where the Yezidi clans are concerned, since thehomelands and central shrines of the latter are scattered largely through theMiddle East and Central Asia in war zones and areas hostile to outsiders.Vodun, Santeria, Palo Mayombe, and Lukumi share some elements in common with theYezidis. They do not have a written scripture, per se. They frequently have beenconfused with devil worship. And they represent a survival of ancient forms ofreligious experience, in this case from Africa: a continent that they share withEgypt.They have also been exploited to some extent by non-African occultists who seein their rituals methodologies of magical practice and the acquisition ofaltered states of consciousness that lead to greater spiritual power andabilities, especially when re-interpreted within European and American (i.e.,non-African) contexts. Probably the premier exponent of this type of synthesisis Michael Bertiaux, an important source for Grant.Bertiaux came to the attention of the broader occult community in the UnitedStates through his massive, 600+ page Voudon Gnostic Workbook (New York:Magickal Childe, 1998), but prior to the book's publication he was already asubject of Grant's Typhonian Trilogies. The first mention of Bertiaux and hisunique form of Thelemic-Gnostic-Vodun appears in two chapters of Grant's Cultsof the Shadow (1975) which explain Bertiaux's system in terms that are bothThelemic and Lovecraftian. Indeed, Bertiaux deliberately uses terminology andideas from Lovecraft in his occult work, as well as terms and concepts that areuniquely his own. But Grant's initial fascination with Bertiaux's work seems tobe the fact that both he and Bertiaux explored the “nightside” of the Tree ofLife, the realm of the Dark Lord. In Bertiaux's case, he connected the Dark Sideof the Tree with some of the Vodun cults and practices that would be considered“black magic” in contemporary parlance. This, coupled with the Crowley andLovecraft references in Bertiaux, ignited a stream of consciousness in Grantthat would heavily influence his later work. Bertiaux acknowledged theimportance of sexual ritual, including Tantra, and associated it with varioustypes of Afro-Caribbean practice, and all within a Thelemic context. This wasthe Obeah and the Wanga, the missing elements from the Thelemic arsenal ofoccult methods and systems.Obeah is a form of Afro-Caribbean magic, what is sometimes called “hoodoo” inthe South. The practice as it is known today has its origins in Jamaica andconsists mostly of casting spells as opposed to the more religious aspects ofHaitian Vodun. There is evidence that the term comes from an Ashantiword—obayifo—meaning “witch” or “wizard” or even “vampire.”110[part0008_split_004.html#aft110] Thus it has a negative connotation. Wanga(sometimes spelled ouanga) on the other hand refers specifically to a small bagused to hold charms, sometimes worn around the neck or kept in a safe place,similar to the Native American “medicine bag” except that the latter is usuallyworn or carried by the medicine man only, whereas the wanga may be prepared foranyone to wear and usually for a specific purpose, such as love, money, health,etc. and dedicated to a specific loa (lwa): one of the Afro-Caribbean gods.However, both obeah and wanga are sometimes used as terms denotingAfro-Caribbean occultism in general. Wanga is sometimes thought to referspecifically to works of “black” or negative magic.111[part0008_split_004.html#aft111]What, then, is the meaning or intent behind the exhortation in the Book of theLaw that one should “learn and teach” the “obeah and the wanga”? Why did Aiwazuse these terms and avoid using, for instance, “Voodoo and Santeria”?The two latter are religions which have internally-consistent cosmologies,pantheons, and rituals. Obeah and wanga are somewhat looser in theirdefinitions, but more importantly, do not refer to religious dogmas per se butto the practical side of religion, that is, magic. Obeah and wanga are occultmethods used by Afro-Caribbean spiritual specialists and this is what would havebeen important to the author of the Book of the Law. After all, the infamousChapter Three makes it clear that all previous religions are “black.”However, as we have seen, the consensus of opinion seems to be that both obeahand wanga are “black arts” themselves. That is, they are concerned with whatKabbalists would consider the darker, or nightside, aspect of the Tree of Lifeand may be associated with the qlippoth: the shattered shards of creation thatare tantamount to demons. And the connective tissue to all of this is the focusof both Grant and Bertiaux on the sexual aspect of these dark mysteries. This isan obvious direction for occultists who represent the most transgressive oftheir breed, for the “white” magician is usually thought of as being—if notcelibate, then—more chaste than the average person, devoting his or her time andenergy to good works, speaking with angels, and yearning for union with thedivine: leading a life that would be considered conventionally moral andblameless. There is no mixing of the sexes in this type of occultism, or ifthere is it is within the religiously sanctioned confines of matrimony.One only has to remember that the congregations in synagogues and mosques areseparated by gender; that even Vedic practice in India keeps the sexes apart asmuch as possible. Christianity can be seen as an exception to this rule, and itis worthwhile to remember that the earliest Christian rituals known to theoutside world took the form of the agape, or love-feast. These gender-mixedcongregations would meet in secret (often in catacombs or cemeteries) due totheir persecution by the state and by other religious authorities. Thus,Christianity could be considered the Satanism of its day.When the genders are brought together in magical rituals, there is always thepossibility that a sexual current will run through the group particularly in theheightened (almost romantic) atmosphere of a ceremony that is conductedsecretly, in candle-light, with billowing clouds of perfumes and incenses,specially-designed robes in appropriate colors and materials, and so forth. Oneform of transgression—occult ritual—implies every other form, including thesexual; in addition, the appropriation of spiritual power away or apart fromnormative, socially-sanctioned priesthoods can be intoxicating.In the rites of Haitian Vodun, the above conditions are exceeded through the useof a battery of drums and at times other musical instruments. In these ritualsthe focus is on the human body as the “horse” to be ridden by the gods in a formof divine possession. At such times, the individual person is no longer“present” as an ego or superego in his or her own physical form but has beenmomentarily dislodged by one of the lwa. The possessed person's body undergoes asubtle—or sometimes not so subtle—transformation as the personality of Erzulie(the goddess of love and passion) or perhaps of Baron Samedi de la Cimitiere(the god who controls access to the Underworld) or any of the many other godswho take over and cause the possessed person to walk and act in accordance withthe characteristics of the particular lwa.Oddly, these things are not discussed in the Voudon Gnostic Workbook of MichaelBertiaux. While it does treat of the many varieties of Haitian lwa it does notfocus on the rites most commonly associated with Haitian Vodun, such as therituals that take place in the peristyle and hounfort. Instead, Bertiaux treatsthe Haitian material the way that Crowley treats the Egyptian: as data to beincorporated into rituals and spiritual methodologies more familiar to WesternEuropean occult practice. In the case of Bertiaux and his Gnostic Vodun, it is asyncretism of a syncretism.From a post-modernist perspective, of course, this is hideous: an outrageagainst the original material, an exploitation of an indigenous culture'sspirituality. But that is true of all magic. Magic is, by its very nature, amethod and not a faith or a dogma. Its practices transcend the cultural becausethey are concerned with altered states of consciousness and not with adherenceto a particular Law or Tradition. This is how it was possible for Jewish mysticssuch as Shabbtai Z'vi or a Jakob Frank to “convert” to Islam and Christianity,respectively, and still maintain their following and their reputation asadvanced adepts. This is how it was possible for an Aleister Crowley toincorporate yoga and quasi-Tantric practices into his Thelema even though he wasan Englishman who had received the Book of the Law in Cairo replete withEgyptian gods doing all the talking. In this context, the creative approach tospirituality of a Michael Bertiaux is entirely consistent. There is virtually noform of occultism in the western world that does not incorporate elements of“other” religions and “other” occult practices. The very liminality of occultismimplies that “otherness” will be a constant, determining factor in itsconstruction.While Bertiaux includes material from diverse sources to amplify his version of“voodoo,” he is not alone in examining this Afro-Caribbean system through thelens of other cultures and religions. While a purist may insist on a strict“African” interpretation of Vodun—denying any syncretism involving otherreligions (such as Roman Catholicism) or other mystical or magicalsystems—twentieth-century Haitian writers on the subject frequently invokeGreek, Egyptian and even Jewish terms and concepts as a means of expanding uponthe rituals and the legends that inform it. This approach is condemned bypost-modern anthropologists and academics as inherently colonialist and racist:the projection of white, western insecurities about race, sexuality, andreligion onto a captive, “savage” population. The fact that some native Haitianauthors on the subject contribute to this approach does not make the controversyany clearer.An early author who is sometimes cited in the literature is Arthur C. Holly.Writing in French under the pseudonym Her-Ra-Ma-El, his books are a melange ofBiblical references, Christian concepts, Afro-centrism, and a minimum of actualinformation on Vodun. His Les daïmons du culte voudo112[part0008_split_004.html#aft112] is the most-referenced, but usually derisively.However, in a line often quoted, he does insist on a connection between HaitianVodun and ancient Egyptian and Assyrian religion:C'est en vain que les procédés hypocrites ou violents ont été mis en oeuvre pourenvelopper des ténèbres les phases brillants de l'évolution mentale du Nègre. Ilest hors de conteste que l'antique civilisation Ethiopio-égypto-assyrienne doitêtre inscrite à son compte.113 [part0008_split_004.html#aft113](“It is in vain that hypocritical or violent processes have been used to shroudin darkness the brilliance of the mental evolution of the Negro. It is beyonddoubt that the ancient Ethiopian-Egyptian-Assyrian civilizaton must be creditedto his account.”)andIl nous parait indiscutable que la tradition Voudo descend en ligne directe: dusacerdoce et des rites usités dans les temples d'Ethiopie et d'Egypte.114[part0008_split_004.html#aft114](“It seems to us undeniable that the Voudo tradition descends in direct linefrom the priesthood and the rites used in the temples of Ethiopia and Egypt.”)Holly called himself a “Haitian esotericist”115 [part0008_split_004.html#aft115]and this is borne out by his lengthy and sometimes incomprehensible study ofVodun through the lens of a kind of Kabbalah in which each letter of the Latinalphabet possesses mystical meanings, so that an analysis of any word (includingthe names of Vodun lwa) can yield a warehouse full of secondary and tertiarymeanings. His emphasis is on this system rather than on Vodun itself, renderinghis book of interest only to those studying early twentieth-century HaitianFrancophone occult philosophy.Indeed, Holly references all the usual suspects: Court de Gébelin, Fabred'Olivet, Eduard Schuré, and Eliphas Levi (the Abbé Louis Constant) are allcited in this work, placing it firmly in the lineage of French esotericism,Theosophy, Freemasonry, and magic. This is especially the case with Levi, ofwhom Crowley believed himself to be the reincarnation. Except, in Holly's view,Africa and Vodun were the source for all European esotericism, includingFreemasonry:Sur ce point je n'ai personnellement aucun doute. Car DAm-Bha-Lah, la MèreDivine, la Négresse universelle, le COEUR QUI VIVIFIE l'humanité, est seulecapable de réaliser la parfaite solidarité, basée sur l'Amour, entre Noirs etJaunes. Cela, parce que Dame, la Grande Négresse du Ciel, est la Patronne desuns; Lah, le Grand-Petit Mulâtre du Ciel, le Dieu panthéistique des autres. Doncla Nation haïtienne se tournera—pour l'adoration dans le plus pur sentiment defraternité—vers le Soleil Levant et son Fils Lumineux—c'est-à-dire, en termesmaçonniques, vers le GRAND-ORIENT personnifié par la Reine du Midi et son filsChiram. En effet, le Salut de la Patrie dépend plutôt de la Franc-maçonnerie quel'Eglise. Et le Voudo, c'est la Mère de la Franc-maçonnerie comme on vient de lel'entrevoir dans les pages précédentes.116 [part0008_split_004.html#aft116](On this point I personally have no doubt. For Dam-Bha-Lah, the Divine Mother,the Universal Negress, HEART THAT QUICKENS humanity, is the only one able toachieve perfect solidarity, based on Love, between the Black and Yellow [races].This is because Dame, Great Negress of Heaven, is the Patroness of each; Lah,the Grand Little Mulatto of Heaven, is the pantheistic God of the others. So theHaitian Nation will turn—or worship in the purest sense of brotherhood—towardsthe Rising Sun and his Son of Light—that is to say, in Masonic terms, towardsthe GRAND ORIENT personified by the Queen of the South and her son Hiram.Indeed, the Health of the Country depends rather on Freemasonry than the Church.And Voudo is the Mother of Freemasonry as we have just had a glimpse in thepreceding pages.)Here Holly shows us that he has an esoteric interpretation of the names of thegods of Vodun, dividing Dambhala into separate syllables, each of which has itsown meaning and relevance. This is something that Grant himself does, to similareffect, as in the following word analysis from his Ninth Arch, the last in theTyphonian Trilogies series:Frater Achad interpreted the thirteen-lettered word MANIFESTATION asconcentrating the magical formula of the Aeon of Maat whose ‘lesser cycle’ wasto manifest through her daughter, Mâ. This is correct so far as it goes, butthere is more to it. The daughter typifies the Pythoness of Maat as theunawakened (i.e. virgin) priestess in her magnetic and oracular sleep. Theessential formula may be schematized thus:Mâ = entranced medium, ‘lesser cycle’ (of the sixteen kalas)ni = Amen, the Hidden God—the Sun behind the sun (Set-Isis/Sothis).festat = Cairo, the locus of the Double Current: Aiwass/Nu-Isision = Aeon; the ‘Greater Cycle' wherein the seventeenth kala is secreted (i.e.,the ultimate and Secret-ion).117 [part0008_split_004.html#aft117]We will note that in both cases there are references to the Sun, and thePythoness of Maat may have something in common with Holly's Dambhala. WhileDambhala normally is considered to be a male deity, his symbol is also thesnake. In Holly's paragraph above-cited, however, Dambhala is female since Hollyfocuses on the first syllable of the word, Dam, and sees in it a reference tothe French word for woman, Dame. So Dambhala becomes, for him, the Divine Motherand Universal Negress, as well as the fons et origo of Freemasonry.While Holly is perhaps an unusual and suspect source for information on Vodun,we have a more professional expert in Milo Rigaud. Rigaud—born EmileRigaud—wrote a number of books on Vodun, heavily illustrated with photographs ofceremonies and diagrams of the vévés: the arcane symbols that attract the lwa tothe rituals. While his books are comprehensive treatments of his subject, healso falls victim to the type of grand theories that obsessed Holly. He linksthe practice of Vodun to Egypt and to Solomon's Temple, among other places, andhe quotes Holly approvingly in this instance, implying that he agrees with theEgyptian-Ethiopian-Assyrian roots of Vodun and their contribution to western,European esotericism and Freemasonry.118 [part0008_split_004.html#aft118]Both Holly and Rigaud are Haitian authors, men who knew their country and itsreligious culture as well as anyone, but who wrote about it from a Francophonepoint of view. Creole is the language of the people in Haiti, and French is thelanguage of the government and the intellectual elite. An educated Haitian,interested in religion and spirituality, first would seek for information inFrench which inevitably would lead to the fields of Martinism, Freemasonry, thevarious Gnostic churches, and authors like Eliphas Levi and Papus (Dr. Encausse)and many others, all of whom did, indeed, exert an influence over European andAmerican occultism both through their books and through the organizations andsecret societies they joined or founded. Holly and Rigaud would have found inthese sources confirmation of what they already believed to be true: that theirreligious culture was part of a continuum of spiritual experience that began inAfrica—everywhere in Africa, including Egypt, the Sudan, and Ethiopia—and thushad tendrils extending as far as the salons of Paris and the secret societies ofLondon, Germany, and elsewhere on the continent.It's the perceived racist attitude towards Vodun that irritates anthropologists,however. They will insist that Vodun is a religion, and while they do not denythe magical aspects of the religion they will condemn any attempt to see inVodun anything smacking of the titillating or suggestive. The approach ofBertiaux is attacked by experts who claim that he represents a colonialist andracist stereotyping of Vodun of the type we find in Lovecraft, for instance. Byassociating Vodun with sexual rituals and contact with supra-mundaneentities—what many average observers would call “black magic” in a purelypejorative way (and perhaps as a thinly-veiled racist allusion)—Bertiaux is seento be contributing to the Hollywood concept of Vodun as “voodoo” with all theweird rites and licentiousness that the term suggests.There are problems with this analysis, however. It has become fashionable toassert that any interest in indigenous religions by white observers, be theyacademics and scholars or journalists and authors of popular books on thesubject, is suspect. Edward Said implied as much in his ground-breaking book,Orientalism,119 [part0008_split_004.html#aft119] when he castigated western,European attempts at describing Asia as rooted in colonialist and racistattitudes towards Asians, attitudes that were composed of equal parts of fear,disgust and desire. While Said's thesis has been criticized recently,120[part0008_split_004.html#aft120] it is still a difficult hurdle fornon-indigenous observers to overcome for it is assumed that they are, ipsofacto, tainted by the same vulnerabilities. This is even more pronounced amongthose who go overboard in attacking other non-indigenous observers whom theybelieve to be inappropriately reverent when it comes to religions like Vodun,for they can be accused of manifesting “white guilt” or some similar desire tobe absolved of their race's historical crimes against non-white populations. Itis truly a no-win situation, but usually is apparent in academic circles wherethe near-impossibility of staying above the fray is pronounced. Among occultiststhere are no such anxieties. In the quest for greater and greater occult powerall avenues are fair game, and since occultism can be viewed (by some) aslargely psychological and emotional, the racial and sexual stereotypes of any“cult” can be mined for their connections to deeper psychological complexes inthe operator.Yet there is another problem for the mainstream apologists for Vodun, and thatis that there are secret societies in Haiti that are responsible for some of thebad press that “voodoo” gets, and which gave us the infamous “zombie powder”among other things. These societies specialize in those elements of Vodun thatcould be considered magic as differentiated from religion. Wade Davis haswritten two books121 [part0008_split_004.html#aft121] on the subject of thesesocieties which were the basis of his ethnobiological fieldwork in Haiti duringwhich time he was actually initiated into one of these groups. The vigorousattempts by some anthropologists to downplay the more sinister aspects of theHaitian religious experience fall apart in the face of this type of scholarship.Of course, a case could be made that the Haitian secret societies—such asBizango, Zobop, the Secte Rouge, etc.—bear as much relationship to traditionalVodun as the Church of Satan does to the Roman Catholic Church ... but Davisdemonstrates that there exists a much closer bond between the secret societiesand normative Vodun than one would suppose, and that these secret societiesperform much the same function as the “Illuminati” or “Freemasons” are allegedto do in European countries: they are the real “masters” of the country,operating behind the scenes and meting out punishment where necessary tomaintain order in the Haitian communities.122 [part0008_split_004.html#aft122]Therefore, for our purposes we can acknowledge that what anthropologists call“Vodoun” or “Vodun,” etc. represents an assembly of various African religionsunder one convenient (albeit misleading) umbrella and that as a religion itdeserves the same respect as any other; but we must also acknowledge that suchthings as curses, blood sacrifice, and even zombification also exist as part ofthe Haitian religious/occult experience just as antinomian secret societies and“satanic” occult groups exist within the normative white European Christian orJewish religious experience. And it is within the context of the Haitian secretsocieties, such as the Bizango, that we find the greatest correlation with theideas discussed by Bertiaux and Grant.The element of Bertiaux's unique cosmology that interests Grant is the idea thatthere are points chauds or “hot points” (or “power points”) in the universe thatact as portals into other realms of experience, as “gates” to the “underworld.”The adepts who are capable of entering these points at will are sometimesreferred to as voltigeurs (or “leapers”) in the Bertiaux vernacular. These powerpoints are located on the human body as well as at specific areas of the earthand in the cosmos, in perfect microcosm/macrocosm symmetry. It follows that ifthese points can be located simultaneously in the body as well as in the heavens(for instance) then physical manipulation or stimulation of those points isequivalent to opening the celestial gates, and a Tantric-type process can bepursued that uses the body and its hidden resources as a vehicle for celestial(and infernal) exploration. An essential characteristic of Tantra is theunderstanding that psycho-biological processes take place which alterconsciousness. In rare instances, these processes may take placeaccidentally—through some form of physical or emotional trauma—but more oftenthey are the result of careful practice and deliberate application of occultmethods such as yoga, meditation, pranayama, and other means of interfering withthe normal functions of the human body. If the body is a laboratory and a templecombined, then changing any of the body's processes such as control ofbreathing, of heartbeat, contorting the limbs into uncomfortable positions forlong periods of time, or even taking drugs that alter either the physical or themental activities of the operator will produce a variety of results that areoutside the normal range of human experience.The occultist uses the tools that are available to seek control over the body'sautonomic nervous system—the system that regulates such things as breathing,heart rate, peristalsis, etc.—as well as control over the mind's “autonomic”functions, processes that can be located in what the Freudians call theunconscious mind. This is all quite different from the way of the mystic inprayer who wants to unite with the divine through piety and good works. It is amechanistic approach to consciousness and divinity that horrifies churchmen andthe pious, offending them as much as do frank discussions of sexuality. Thepious speak of love and marriage; sex is either not mentioned or is couched ineuphemism. The magician speaks of everything in terms of the use to be made ofit, its pragmatic application to the desired goal.This is what one finds in Bertiaux as well as in Grant. It should be noted thatGrant's information concerning Vodun is purely of the Bertiaux variety. There isno attempt to offer an academic presentation of the material, no citations ofscholarly works on Afro-Caribbean religion juxtaposed with citations from theVoudon Gnostic Workbook just as there are no discussions of Roman Catholicdoctrines or excerpts from the Lutheran prayer book. There is no devotionalliterature in magic. The interest of Bertiaux, Grant and Crowley is on spiritualtechniques and esoteric technology. The cultural contexts of Vodun, Egyptianreligion, to a lesser extent the Tantras, and even the Yezidis are ignored or atleast unacknowledged in favor of the deconstruction of their respectivetechnologies—the way a gear-head takes apart an automobile engine to see how itis put together. These techniques give rise—mostly through ritual—tootherworldly experiences that they then attempt to describe and analyze for awider audience, with wildly uneven results. Grant's presentation of the alreadycomplicated and sometimes hyperbolic Bertiaux material verges on theincomprehensible, and I contend that it is not meant to be read as linear prosebut as a kind of free-association: language reduced (or elevated) to mantra andchant.Bertiaux, like Grant, is obsessed with the dark side of esotericism. TraditionalKabbalah, alchemy, Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism are all ignored in favor of themore sinister aspects of the spiritual experience, and ways are sought tocontact entities that are believed to exist in other dimensions, entities thatare nevertheless understood to be capable of interacting with our own. These arealien beings in every sense of the term: they are not beautiful in anyconventional sense: no angels with harps, no long-bearded prophets. These arethe monstrous shapes imagined by Lovecraft and other horror writers of hisgeneration; except that for Bertiaux and Grant they are not figments ofimagination and thus “not real,” but have an independent existence of their own.In the Bertiaux and Grant cosmology, Lovecraft did not invent these creatures:he saw them in his dreams, which are a time-honored method of communicating withthe unconscious mind (in a modern sense) or with the spirit world (in a moreancient context). The gods of Vodun may have begun the same way as Great Cthulhuand Nyarlathotep; and the methods of contacting the one may be used to contactthe other, and with similar—even measureable—results. What began in a dream maybe contacted in a dream, or at least in a trance. The altered states sorepresentative of spirit possession in Haiti—and recognized as such by Lovecraftin “The Call of Cthulhu”—are a way of re-dreaming the original dream, of going“back to Guinee”: to an African homeland that exists nowhere on earth, yeteverywhere on earth. The points chauds are elements of an occult Matrix, placeswhere one strand of the spider's web crosses another. Taken together, they forma membrane over the cranium of the magical operator like the touch screen on acomputer monitor. It is where Bertiaux's “voodoo” meets Grant's Tantra that theintellectual and conceptual explosion takes place that leads the Typhonian Orderinto the realm of the Dark Lord."},{"pageContent":"IN PURSUIT OF GOLDIt was most likely observing the meetings of David Curwen and Aleister Crowleythat provided Kenneth Grant with the impetus he needed to realize that IndianTantra held the key to the mysteries of the OTO as well as to all of westernoccultism itself. While Grant usually quotes discredited texts on the Yezidisand on Vodun, in the realm of Indian religion and magic he is on somewhat surerground even as he makes at times reckless use of the texts. For many westernoccultists, drawn to magic through the works of Crowley or of the othermagicians who came out of the Golden Dawn environment, Grant's books were thefirst that introduced them to Tantra and to the potentiality of this rathermessy yet strikingly powerful tradition: “messy” in the sense that no one canagree on what Tantra is; powerful because it deals with magical processes inremarkably clear language.Of all the unspeakable cults in Grant's repetoire, Tantra is where his erudition(although subject to serious criticism by actual Tantrikas) and his grasp of theterminology shines through. Grant is a knowledgeable non-initiate when it comesto Tantra, but it must be said that he makes mistakes in nomenclature,definitions, etc. which may be due more to the lack of access to publishedmaterials (and his own lack of initiation into a Tantric circle) than to anydesire to confuse or bloviate. The value in Grant's description of Tantric ritesand concepts lies in the fact that it is the first time for many westernoccultists that they have been exposed to this material and serves as aninducement to conduct their own, independent research. Further, while Tantrikasmay object to Grant's cavalier use of Tantric terms and concepts to further hisown investigations of the Dark Lord, it is entirely consistent with Bertiaux'sapproach to Vodun and Crowley's approach to Egyptology and Yezidism. That is notto absolve these magicians from a responsibility to be accurate insofar aspossible, but it does demonstrate the essential bricolage tendency of westernoccultists who strive to reach beyond a Judeao-Christian framework and intoother, foreign realms. This is the lure of Babalon, of course: the ultimate“foreigner” and seducer of spiritual aspirants since time immemorial.David Curwen (1893-1984) was an intimate of Aleister Crowley in the period1944-1947, until the latter's death in December of that year, and theymaintained a deep correspondence on magic, alchemy and especially Tantra. Curwenrecently (2006) was “outed” as the author of the very influential alchemicalwork In Pursuit of Gold (1976) written under the pseudonym Lapidus (Latin for“Stone”). In Pursuit of Gold was subtitled “Alchemy Today in Theory andPractice” which seems to echo Crowley's own Magick in Theory and Practice and toa certain extent these two volumes complement each other as modern takes onthese ancient arts.The relationship between Curwen and Crowley was not always fraternal. Crowleysoon began to realize that Curwen—who had studied Tantra in India—was moreknowledgeable than he when it came to Indian forms of occultism and, of course,in particular Tantra. Crowley's exposure to Tantra was limited to a few Englishtranslations of a handful of Tantric texts, whereas Curwen's experience was muchdeeper and more profound. When both Curwen and Crowley began to realizeCrowley's limitation in that regard, the friendship suffered a little. Crowleyhad to be the smartest man in the room, at least where occultism was concerned,and Curwen was living proof that there were other mysteries, other revelationsto which Crowley had had no previous access.At the same time, a friendship developed between Kenneth Grant and David Curwen,to the extent that Curwen encouraged Grant to explore Tantra more deeply. Thiswould set Grant on the path for which he would become most famous: theexploration of Thelema and the core secret of the OTO as delineated in the textsand practices of the Tantric adepts of India.The subject of Tantra is vast, and I have introduced the subject elsewhere,123[part0008_split_004.html#aft123] but for the purposes of this investigation wewill focus on the type of Tantric groups that are of interest to Grant, the“unspeakable cults” of India.The first such group is the Sri Vidya sect.Image [../images/00011.jpeg]rImage [../images/00012.jpeg] VidyImage[../images/00013.jpeg] (“Holy Knowledge”) can actually be broken down into fourseparate, but linked, manifestations. Basically, it is form of Goddess worshipthat has as its goal advaita, or non-duality. Therefore it is a Shakta tradition(as differentiated from a Shaivite tradition) in which the source of power, ofshakti, is imagined in the Goddess. The particular goddess in the case of SriVidya is known as LalitImage [../images/00013.jpeg] TripurasundarImage[../images/00012.jpeg]. Tripura Sundari means “Beautiful Goddess of the ThreeCities,” the three cities in this case referring to three different aspects ofthe goddess as physical, subtle, and supreme. She is usually depicted as asixteen-year-old girl, and for that reason is sometimes called Image[../images/00014.jpeg]oImage [../images/00015.jpeg]aImage [../images/00016.jpeg]or “Sixteen” and Lalitã or “she who plays.” It should be noted that the numbersixteen figures prominently in Grant's number system as the designation for thesixteenth kala, the ultimate of the kalas or secretions of the priestess. Hermantra also contains sixteen letters.The foremost symbol of the Sri Vidya sect is the Sri Meru Cakra, which is athree-dimensional version of the Sri Yantra, usually made of special metals in asacred alloy that allows the blessings of the Goddess to flow more powerfully.The Sri Yantra is a two-dimensional magical drawing of nine interlockingtriangles that represents the unity of male and female—Shiva and Shakti—forcesand could thus be seen as a depiction of the essential philosophy of both Tantraand Thelema.The form of worship known as Samayachara takes place in the mind, as even therituals—puja—themselves can be performed mentally if the appropriate ritualobjects are not to hand. In this case the Goddess is visualized and the entireritual is much more personal and interiorized.In increasing complexity, we then arrive at the form of Sri Vidya known asDakshinachara in which an external form of the Goddess is required: either anidol or the Sri Meru Cakra ... or even a female devotee. It should be noted thatin this practice there is no intimate contact between the worshipper and thewoman—the suvasini—who represents the Goddess although she is a focus for theritual.The Kaulachara is the one that gets most of the attention, for the externalobject of devotion is a living woman or a man, or a male and female couple. Thefamous ritual of the “Five M's”—the panchamakara—is part of the Kaulachararepetoire, although not practiced as often or as widely as believed. Since thegoal of Sri Vidya is essentially advaita and the negation of all duality, therituals themselves emphasize that there is no difference between the worshipperand the worshipped: that, in effect, everyone and everything is the Goddess.Eventually all sense of self—self as a separate entity, apart from the rest ofthe cosmos—disappears. The use of nudity and sexuality in these rituals, whichcan be as physical or as virtual as the leader determines, is designed to removeall sense of “otherness” by conquering shame, fear, and carnal desire.The final, and most controversial, form of Sri Vidya is the Vamachara practice.The devotees of Vamachara are the groups that meet in cemeteries and crematorygrounds, and which see the Goddess in her terrible and frightening aspect. Theidea is to transcend even the grossest, most loathesome aspects of creation, ofhumanity, of reality. To see the Goddess in the corpses of the cremation ground,to smell Her perfume in the stench of burning flesh, and to hear Her voice inthe hideous sounds of an Indian cemetery in the night is the height of spiritualpiety. And when the Vamachara circle goes to the extent—as some of them do—toperform panchatattva or panchamakara (the ritual of the Five M's that includesmaithuna or sexual contact) in the intimate, overwhelming presence of corpses isto conquer death and to bring all of creation back to a single point: death andthe act of conception taking place in the same location, decay and desireobliterating the boundary between this world and the next.It is no wonder then that Grant would have been fascinated by these practices.He would have seen—as glimpsed through a scrim, at an angle, in shadow—thesecrets of the Gnostic Mass and the Star Sapphire ritual exposed and expandedthrough the intense ceremonies of the Kaulachara and Vamachara sects. TheTantric texts and rituals would have revealed to Grant the secrets behind thesecrets. Shiva and Shakti on thrones in the center of the Kaula circle areanalogues of Chaos and Babalon, of what Jung perhaps would call the Shadow andthe Anima, and the consumption of the fluids in the Gnostic Mass and the StarSapphire rituals are perfectly comprehensible within the context of the SriVidya tradition. In fact, the reasons behind the secrets of the OTO's VIIIth andIXth degrees would be explained and amplified through consulting the Tantrictexts, not only of the Sri Vidya sect but also of a number of other groups fromthe Kashmiri Shaivites to the Nath Siddhis and, of course, of the TibetanTantric tradition with its famous Kalachakra Tantra and the associated scheme ofinitiations.Grant would focus on two aspects of the Tantras that he felt were crucial to anunderstanding of Thelema. The first was the idea of non-duality and thedestruction of the ego. This also concerned Crowley, of course, as we havementioned above, in his pursuit of samImage [../images/00013.jpeg]dhi or thestate of actually experiencing non-duality through the identification of subjectwith object during meditation. Crowley, who was familiar with the Yoga Sutras ofPatanjali (an English translation of which had appeared in 1914), knew thatsamadhi was the highest possible state of consciousness that could be achievedwhile still alive, the only possible higher state being that of the mahasamImage[../images/00013.jpeg]dhi or “great samadhi” that occurs at the time of death.The second was the concept of the kImage [../images/00013.jpeg]la.The best blood is of the moon, monthly ... (AL III:24)Grant would have been the first western occultist to write openly about thissubject, at least the first to enjoy a wide audience among those interested inceremonial magic and the western occult tradition. The kalas are explained asvaginal secretions, not limited to menstrual blood, which occur during theentire menstrual cycle and which have different occult properties depending onthe day they occur. These are not to be understood as the grosser physical formof mucoid secretions or blood, but as their subtler counterparts imbued withqualities that are analogous to the alchemical elements that are involved in theprocess of spiritual transformation.The subject of kalas is a complex one, for the production of the kalas dependson the occult capability of the priestess as well as on their manipulation bythe priest. There are astrological and astronomical considerations and ritualrequirements to ensure the proper condensation of these essences at the righttime so that they may be employed for magical ends.Basically, the word kImage [../images/00013.jpeg]la indicates a unit of time,most specifically a lunar “digit” or day. Different authorities offer differentdefinitions and identifications of this lunar day. In some cases, it refers toabout one-day-and-a-half in solar days, or about 36 hours. In other cases, theauthorities insist that each lunar day is equivalent in length to a solar day,only calculated from dusk to dusk rather than from dawn to dawn, etc. Thosefamiliar with Vedic astrology are familiar with this term and with a relatedterm tithi, which means the same thing but which is used more often in astrologythan in the Tantras.The important thing to remember here is that the lunar cycle is really theresult of the interplay between the moon, the earth and the sun. If we considerthe earth to be a vessel for the mingled essences of the sun and moon—atraditional Tantric concept—then the importance of the kala becomes apparent. Ondifferent days of the lunar cycle, as the moon gradually waxes from a New Moonto a Full Moon, and then begins to wane again, the quality of moonlight (it'sbrightness) changes from night to night. The Indian astrologers and Tantrikasimagine this to be the Sun giving the precious Soma to the Moon, drop by drop,until the Moon is full, at which point it begins returning the Soma to the Sun,also drop by drop, until it is depleted; and then the whole cycle begins again.Each lunar day has a specific quality associated with it, as well as a specificdeity. It is this concept that is related to the Tantric idea of kalas thatGrant writes about so frequently. Each lunar digit or kala has a differentquality. When this quality is combined with the individual menstrual cycle ofthe priestess, then you have a different “tincture” or essence.Central to Indian religion and especially to Tantra is the concept of amrita.Amrita is the combination of the male and female potencies that ensuresimmortality, and the power to cure illness. It is the source of western ideasabout the elixir vitae and the Philosopher's Stone. It is the result of aninternal process of meditation, yoga, and ritual but also involves alignmentwith the priest or priestess as well as with the lunar phases themselves. It isan interlocking of the microcosm with the macrocosm—the human body with thestars—in a way that transcends how this is understood by the newcomer toceremonial magic and alchemy. The sensitivity of the female partner to hermenstrual cycle and the corresponding sensitivity of the male partner to thefemale partner—coupled with: (1) the awareness of both to the external “cycle”of the sun and moon, and (2) the proper performance of rituals that areundertaken with a great deal of personal preparation (particularly in thepsycho-biological processes which are subsumed under the control of theautonomic nervous system: in particular breathing, heart rate, etc.)—provides avehicle for spiritual transformation that would be difficult to surpass. As oneidentifies oneself with the Goddess through the normal stages of the Sri Vidyapuja, but with these other considerations honored, then the goal of advaita ornon-duality is obtained through identification of the Goddess with the universe,the universe with the Goddess, and eventually identification of the Self withNo-Self: the transcending of opposites and the attainment of samadhi.In the earlier stages of the process—which can take many years to perfect—theamrita is cultivated, taking care that it does not become a poison instead of amedicine. The Tantras are full of instructions towards this end, although theymay at times seem incomprehensible as they are written in the “twilightlanguage” common to all the deeper forms of esotericism both in Asia and in theWest. The amrita is the combined essences of the male and female practitioner,as has been described, with the caveat that it is not the grosser elements thatare important, for they are only the vehicle for the subtle powers theyrepresent. Only accomplished Tantrikas—or, in the Western context, magicians—arecapable of generating these subtle essences. As can be seen, the Gnostic Masswould be capable of this function in only the most advanced case, as well as theStar Sapphire ritual which makes use of the same ideas. But is there really aconnection between the Tantras that Grant praises so highly and Thelema? Asidefrom the obvious similarities, there is other evidence to show that there mightbe a stronger connection than previously understood.As Tantric scholar David Gordon White describes in his The Alchemical Body:Siddha Traditions in Medieval India:In the royal consumption origin myth ... the moon was revived and replenished inits bright fortnight through the offering of a soma sacrifice. Soma is the fluidessence of the moon, which, in the sacrificial context, must be bought. Withwhat does King Moon buy back his vital fluids? With a red cow, whose name,rohinImage [../images/00012.jpeg], is the same as that of the starry woman whowas the original cause of his woes.124 [part0008_split_004.html#aft124]This is a rich vein of symbolism that could be mined by any Kabbalist with greatbenefit. As scholar of Judaism Rafael Patai and Kabbalah scholar Moshe Idel haveboth indicated in their writings, Tantra may very well have been the unseeninfluence behind European and Middle Eastern forms of alchemy and Kabbalah. Inthis single myth, we have an indication that there was some cross-fertilizationbetween Jewish mysticism and Tantric alchemy in startling ways.As Jewish scholars know, a red cow (sometimes called a red heifer, a parahadumah Image [../images/00017.jpeg] in Hebrew) is required for the purificationof anyone who came into contact with a corpse (Numbers, 19:2–19). The cow had tobe unblemished, completely red, and had never been yoked or used to perform anywork. It would be sacrificed and burned, its ashes placed in a ritual vesselthat contains pure “living” water, i.e. from a spring as opposed to collectedrain water. Along with the ashes of the red cow, cedar and hyssop are alsoburned along with the cow, as well as wool that has been dyed red. The resultingwater is then sprinkled on a contaminated person using a branch of hyssop.It is a requirement to have the ashes of a red cow available in the Temple, andfor that reason the building of a Third Temple in Jerusalem could not take placeuntil such a red cow had been found that would be a suitable candidate for thisritual requirement. There is no logical argument for this requirement, noreference to other sources that would provide a context for this rather bizarreritual, and for that reason Talmudic scholars consider it to be a divinemandate. But the connection between a red cow, ritual purity, and living waterseems to have a precedent in ancient India and the above citation offers a waytowards understanding this rather arcane stipulation.The word rohinImage [../images/00012.jpeg] is the key. It does not mean “redcow” specifically but simply “the red one.” It is the name of a Goddess, the“starry woman” of the citation, and is assigned to one of the nakshatras—therohini nakshatra—which is the star Aldebaran,125[part0008_split_004.html#aft125] found in the constellation Taurus, or the Bull.Rohini is the wife of Chandra, a lunar deity who is identified with Soma. Thesymbols for Rohini/Aldebaran are the Temple and the Chariot.Thus we have a Red Goddess, a Red Cow, the waters of purification and Soma, andthe Temple. The Moon must buy a red cow and offer it in exchange for Soma, whichseems to be a myth cognate to the idea of a red cow being burned and its ashesused to create purifying water. Add to that the symbolic connection to Aldebaranand the Temple and you seem to have a perfect explanation for the Jewishrequirement.Further, the fact that the symbol of the Chariot is also included takes us intoanother, deeper realm entirely. The “descent to the Chariot” is a practice knownin the Jewish mystical practice of the Merkavah Image [../images/00018.jpeg](“chariot”) also known as Hekhalot Image [../images/00019.jpeg] (“palace”)mysticism. The aim of the practice is to ascend seven levels, or chariots, orpalaces, to finally appear before the Throne of God. I have made the caseelsewhere that this ancient mystical practice was the inspiration for the degreerituals of the Golden Dawn, which then became the basis for Aleister Crowley'sAImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg] degree structure.126[part0008_split_004.html#aft126]There is more evidence that this may be correct. In that in various worldmythologies Aldebaran is usually connected to the constellation of the Pleiades,the “Seven Sisters,” in the same way that the asterism of the Big Dipperconsists of seven stars that are called “the Chariot” in Middle Eastern (andChinese) cultures. They surround the Pole Star which forms the Throne of God inthis system, because it is unmoving and eternal, the axis around which the worldturns.This entire complex of ideas is reprised in the Thelemic idea of the ScarletWoman, Babalon, as the partner of Therion and whose relationship with the Beastprovides the Soma, the life-giving elixir.To continue the astronomical theme one step further, the brightest supernovaexplosion ever recorded in human history took place in the year 1006 CE. Itoccurred on April 30 of that year, which is—as the Necronomicon tells us—the“day the Great Bear hangs from its tail in the sky,” i.e., the day the Gatebetween this world and the next is opened. On the same day, the volcaniceruption of Mount Merapi on the Indonesian island of Java destroyed an entirecivilization and buried the spectacular monument Borobudur. It lay undervolcanic ash and vegetation for centuries before being rediscovered andeventually reconsecrated by the Dalai Lama—recognized as a temple of Vajrayana,i.e. Tantric, Buddhism.The supernova occurred in a constellation known to the ancients as Therion. TheBeast.These ancient cults—of the Yezidi, of the Afro-Caribbean religions and theirsecret societies, and of the Tantrikas—are carriers of specific information thatmodern cultists find indispensable for an understanding of their own traditions,rites, and practices. But these practices are dangerous. They involvetrafficking with the contents of the unconscious mind through manipulation ofpsycho-biological processes that are still little-understood and recognized evenless. To writers like Grant and Lovecraft, they are analogous to traffickingwith supramundane entities ... not “analogous” in the way the word is normallyused, but perhaps better understood in the sense of “analogue” as opposed to“digital.” To Grant and Lovecraft, plumbing the depths of the unconscious mindis not metaphorically similar to plumbing the depths of deep space, they aredifferent ways of expressing the same thing. The practices may be analogues ofeach other to the non-initiate, but they meet in the rituals and practices ofthe adept, of the initiate.The most ancient mysteries were of a physical, not a metaphysical nature. Therewas an esoteric and an exoteric version of them, corresponding to the writtenand the oral Law of the Jews. But, contrary to what is usually supposed, themetaphysical was the exoteric version, not vice versa.... The secret, oral, orhidden wisdom embodied in the gloss [to the seventeenth chapter of the EgyptianBook of the Dead], refers to the physical origins of the abstract concepts whichappear in the text; spiritual matters are experienced in terms of physical, moreprecisely of physiological, phenomena.127 [part0008_split_004.html#aft127]89 [part0008_split_000.html#ft89] Should probably read Unaussprechliche Kulte.90 [part0008_split_002.html#ft90] One of the earliest sources was the famousBritish archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in his Nineveh and Its Remains,London, John Murray, 1849. Articles on the Yezidi had appeared in French a fewyears earlier by M. Boré in his “De la vie religieuse chez les Chaldéens” in twoparts, July and August 1843, in the Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne. IsyaJoseph published some preliminary articles on the Yezidi in the American Journalof Semitic Languages and Literatures, in January and April, 1909 in a two-partseries entitled “Yezidi Texts.” These would be followed by his book DevilWorship in 1919. Another book-length treatment of the subject was The Cult ofthe Peacock Angel by R.H.W. Empson, London, Witherby, 1928, appearing a yearafter Crowley associate William Seabrook's Adventures in Arabia: Among theBedouins, Druses, Whirling Dervishes, and Yezidee Devil Worshippers, 1927; NewYork, Blue Ribbon, 1930. For a more recent and scholarly source, see John Guest,The Yezidis: A Study in Survival, London, Routledge, Kegan and Paul, 1987, andGiulia Sfameni Gasparro, “I Miti Cosmogonici Degli Yezidi” in Numen, Vol. XXI,Fasc. 3, pp. 197-227, and Vol. XXII, Fasc. 1, pp. 24-41, Leiden, Brill, 1974. Itshould be noted that Crowley's identification with Sumer predates the appearanceof popular books on the subject by at least ten years.91 [part0008_split_002.html#ft91] See for instance J.F. Coakley, “Manuscriptsfor sale: Urmia. 1890-2” in Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, Vol. 20, no.2,2006 where the trade of one Jeremiah Shamir in Mosul was cited as a source fordocuments of dubious provenance. See the Encyclopedia Iranica, online edition,New York, 1996- entry, “Jelwa, Ketab Al-” for the reasons (mostly linguistic)behind this claim. Also see the above cited book by John Guest for moreinformation on Shamir.92 [part0008_split_002.html#ft92] One author has suggested that the word Ta'uscomes from Ta'uz, a form of the ancient Babylonian god Tammuz. Empson, op.cit.,p. 184. If so, this would further bolster at least a Babylonian (if notSumerian) connection to the Yezidis.93 [part0008_split_002.html#ft93] The theory that the ancient Sumerians mighthave come to Mesopotamia from India is one of the options being seriouslyconsidered by linguists and physical anthropologists. That they were non-Semiticseems to be generally accepted. That their origins are mysterious and shroudedin the eldritch tendrils of the mists of antiquity is also accepted. See forinstance Arkadiusz Sohysiak, “Physical anthropology and the ‘Sumerian problem,'”in Studies in Historical Anthropology, vol. 4:2004 [2006], pp 145-158 for anoverview of the prevailing theories. At any rate, this new theory is consistentwith what the Yezidi say about themselves. It is also implied in theSchlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon when it is attested that the symbolof the Sumerian “race” is the Ar with “Aryan” as cognate.94 [part0008_split_002.html#ft94] See, for instance, Empson, op. cit., p.174-175.95 [part0008_split_002.html#ft95] Nineveh, discovered by the archaeologistLayard who also wrote of his meeting with the Yezidis, was an ancient cityfamously cursed by the Biblical prophet Nahum, who called it a “harlot that wasbeautiful and agreeable and that made use of witchcraft ...” (Nahum 3:4), asgood a Biblical description of Crowley's Babalon as any. Nineveh was also thecity where Jonah was sent to preach, and from where he subsequently fled to thesea, only to find himself swallowed by a whale. There is today a shrine to Jonahat Nineveh, believed to be his tomb.96 [part0008_split_002.html#ft96] Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 9297 [part0008_split_002.html#ft97] Agharta is frequently confused with Shambhala.Shambhala is a well-known Tibetan Buddhist concept, which became the“Shangri-La” of Hollywood fame. The origin of the word Agharta and the mythologyconnected with it is ambiguous and possibly a fictional creation of Europeantravelers and mystics. The Theosophists believe it is a kind of polar oppositeto Shambhala and the domain of demonic forces.98 [part0008_split_002.html#ft98] As may be observed in the beliefs andpractices of the Qumran sect that gave us the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Qumranitesset themselves up as the true Jews in opposition to the Jerusalem Temple Jews.99 [part0008_split_002.html#ft99] Empson, op. cit., p. 183.100 [part0008_split_002.html#ft100] William B.

In his Cephaloedium Working (1920), he is quite clearin the statement that lists his titles: “... whose Holy Angel his Guardian isAiwaz 93, the God first dawning upon Man in the land of Sumer....”104 [part0008_split_002.html#ft104] Indeed, as one Yezidi leader said to ajournalist at the time of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2002, Melek Ta'us means“the ancient one.” (Patrick Graham, “Iraq's ‘Devil Worshippers'” in the CanadianNational Post, December 17, 2002.) This fits perfectly with the terminology usedin the Necronomicon Gnosis.105 [part0008_split_002.html#ft105] A symbol that also appears in theSchlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon many times on the various seals ofthe planetary forces as well as prominently on the Crown of Anu (p. 112).106 [part0008_split_002.html#ft106] Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 103. Acording toGrant the word Yezid signifies one of the three persons in one “god” of theYezidi, the other two being Melek Ta'us and Sheikh Adi, the latter of whom manyscholars assume was the real creator of the Yezidi clan although this is stillhotly contested. Grant's theology here is suspect.107 [part0008_split_002.html#ft107] Ibid., p. 104.108 [part0008_split_002.html#ft108] Aleister Crowley, Confessions, Chapter 61,p. 554.109 [part0008_split_002.html#ft109] R. v.

This secret religion, stealthily handed down amongstpeasants for thousands of years despite the outward reign of the Druidic,Graeco-Roman, and Christian faiths in the regions involved, was marked by wild“Witches' Sabbaths” in lonely woods and atop distant hills or Walpurgis-Nightand Hallowe'en ...—H.

Lovecraft129 [part0009_split_002.html#aft129]HIDEOUS CULT, NOCTURNAL WORSHIPPERS, revolting fertility rites ... doublemeanings. It is this last that gives us pause because it so eloquently revealsboth Lovecraft's own timidity when it comes to sexuality and religion as well asthe basis for the Thelemic, Necro-nomicon and Egyptian currents upon which Grantexpounds throughout all nine volumes of his Typhonian Trilogies.Fertility rites.One could make the case that Tantra is essentially the survival of some moreancient fertility cult operative throughout the sub-continent, perhaps beforethe Aryan invasions, and that our concepts of lingam and yoni, amrita, and Shivaand Shakti all derive from this practice “of immemorial antiquity.” After all,some Tantric practitioners do indeed meet “nocturnally” in remote places tocarry out their “fertility rites.”It is this type of public relations effort, carried out not only by Lovecraftbut by the Western media in general, that made Tantra and its associated beliefsand practices seem so exotic and forbidden, pretty much substantiating EdwardSaid's insistence that virtually all Western approaches to Asia were racist andcondescending.However, in the case of Tantra in particular it was not only the whitecolonialist class that was appalled by these practices but members of theestablished Brahmin classes of India as well. Nothing disturbs a member of thesocial and religious elite quite so much as discovering groups of men and women,together, at night, in a cremation ground, worshipping the gods and possiblyeven having sex in a ritual setting. The very concept would make a Vedic (and aCatholic) priest's head explode. (There is also, of course, the implied threatto the social order and specifically to the orthodox priesthood represented byindependent religious practitioners communicating directly with the gods in anunapproved manner.)Sexuality is such a central feature of human life everywhere on the planet thatto describe any social group or organization that is in any way non-traditionalor antinomian is to suggest that it's sexual practices are also bizarre, orstrange, or unorthodox. It would be difficult to make the case for an Americansatanic organization, for instance, that practiced the Black Mass as the coreritual of their faith—and whose members were all celibate (by choice or bydoctrine) or scrupulously faithful to their spouses. We associate anti-religionswith liberation,130 [part0009_split_002.html#aft130] because we identifyreligion with restraint, with rules, with doctrines involving the human passionsand the attempt to corral them into socially-acceptable channels. Thus anyanti-church worth its salt would incorporate sexual liberation or even sexual“depravity” as part of its repertoire.Image [../images/00020.jpeg]The Necronomicon Sigil is a compsite of the three signs of ARRA (the Sign of ourRace), AGGA (the Elder Sign), and BANDAR (the Sigil of the Watcher).But Lovecraft went a step further. Since he did not identify any of the existingreligions and their gods as the “hideous cults” of which he writes (except froma few choice asides to the Yezidi in the short story “The Horror at Red Hook”),he invented another religious entity entirely. He wanted a cult that was olderthan anything on earth, older than any historically-verifiable religion,something so old that it would have appeared ancient to the pre-dynasticEgyptians and the Sumerians (arguably the oldest civilization on record). Itwould be the Ur-cult, the original religion, and its origins would be asmysterious and murky as the origins of the human race itself: the stars.At the same time, Lovecraft understood that the occult rituals of the West andthe East—in particular ceremonial magic for the former and shamanism for thelatter—could be employed as means of making contact with these forces: forcesthat he claimed were still interested in returning to the earth, but who hadbeen prevented from doing so because of certain spells that had been cast thatclosed the Gate between this world and theirs, and which kept their chiefpriest—the dread Cthulhu—”dead but dreaming” in his sunken city of R'lyeh ...waiting for the moment when “the stars are right” and his devotees on earthchant the right chants and raise him from his grave to invoke the Old Ones oncemore. The satanic cults of the world—the devil-worshipping, secretive,murderous, or otherwise unorthodox and antinomian—were survivals of thisoriginal cult and were keeping its blasphemous memory alive.Lovecraft's theme is not as internally consistent as the above paragraph wouldsuggest. Lovecraft himself tinkered with it in his stories, and othercontributors added to the legends in their own tales, creating what has beencalled the Cthulhu Mythos. We will not attempt to delineate all the moving partsof the Mythos here, but only focus on those elements that concern what Grantcalls the Necronomicon Mythos, which he sees as one manifestation of theunderground current that supplies the fuel for Thelema. This is the mostcontentious aspect of the Thelema gestalt—for many members of the OTO and alliedgroups are vehemently opposed to Grant's concept of Thelema, and especially toany addition of elements from the stories of H. P. Lovecraft, which they feelare “fictional” and “imaginary” and thus have no place in their religion.(Atheists will find this attitude rather ironic, no doubt.)Grant's response to this has been to emphasize the importance of the artistic inreligion, and especially in Thelema. There were artists, writers, musicians,dancers, and actors surrounding Crowley for most of his life, becoming involvedin Thelema to greater or lesser degrees and contributing to the culture of hismovement. Imagination, creativity, and vision are essential aspects of theartistic arsenal, which are elements of the magical environment as well.Inasmuch as Thelema's origins are patently magical, the close association of artand Thelema cannot be denied. Crowley considered himself to be the greatestliving poet in the world, among other things. He also painted, organizedtheatrical troupes such as the Ragged Ragtime Girls, and conducted the Rites ofEleusis as public performance in a theater, the last an indication that heunderstood the role of ritual as drama and of drama as ritual. He also wroteshort stories and novels, such as the revealing Moonchild, which incorporateselements of the Golden Dawn, the AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage[../images/00003.jpeg], ceremonial magic in general, Asian religions, etc. allwrapped up in a Thelemic context but with allusions to world events (thusembroidering upon the paranoid fantasy that all world events are orchestrated bya secret society of satanic magicians). Moonchild is a roman-a-clef, with manyof Crowley's friends and enemies portrayed in ways that would amuse only Crowleyand anyone else in on the joke. But the occult and magical aspects of Moonchildare the most valuable aspect of the novel. Crowley used the novel as a mediumfor transmitting occult information. Why, then, would we deny Lovecraft the samecapability if not the intention?Lovecraft's understanding was quite similar. His most influential work, theshort story “The Call of Cthulhu,” is specific in its depiction of artists asthe first people on the planet to become aware that something cosmic was takingplace involving the race from the stars and the sinister, slumbering highpriest, Cthulhu. Some of this awareness is communicated through dreams, anddream control is a key element of the Grant technique.Take for example these quotes first from Lovecraft and then from Grant:It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I knowthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes.... Theseresponses from esthetes told a disturbing tale. From February 28 to April 2 alarge proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of thedreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor'sdelirium.... and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the giganticnameless thing visible towards the last.131 [part0009_split_002.html#aft131]Certain fugitive elements appear occasionally in the works of poets, painters,mystics, and occultists which may be regarded as genuine magical manifestationsin that they demonstrate the power and ability of the artist to evoke elementsof an extradimensional and alien universe that may be captured only by the mostsensitive and delicately adjusted antennae of human consciousness.132[part0009_split_002.html#aft132]The sculptor referred to in the first quotation is young Wilcox, who has beenhaving strange dreams and visions the result of which is art that seems tosuggest the existence of alien beings. It is the sculpture left behind by Wilcoxthat instigates the investigation of the Cthulhu Cult, a search that ranges fromProvidence, Rhode Island to New Orleans, Louisiana to the South Pacific—withside trips to parts of Asia. At the same time that Wilcox is having hisunearthly experience artists from around the world are reporting the same typeof experience, sometimes with deadly results as some go insane, or killthemselves.In the second quotation, Grant shows that he is agreeing with Lovecraft'sanalysis and explains the phenomenon as representing “genuine magicalmanifestations.” This is a key statement, one that Grant uses to justify his useof the Lovecraft material in his Typhonian mythos. One either agrees at thispoint, or does not. If one disagrees with Grant, then the rest of the Typhonianmaterial makes no sense at all, and can be considered the ramblings of aparanoid schizophrenic or a visionary artist fallen on hard times ... or harddrugs. But then, if one disagrees with Grant, one is tempted to review all ofthe Thelemic material in the same light, for Crowley received the Book of theLaw under very arcane (if not actually suspicious) circumstances. Crowleyinsisted that his revelations were true, and so his followers take them as truthwhile the rest of the world dismisses them as fiction. Lovecraft insisted thathis stories were fiction, and so his fans take them as fiction ... even as Grantand his followers believe that the Lovecraft short stories are genuinetransmissions of Thelemic knowledge.It is important to understand that Grant places a great deal of importance onwhat he calls “dream control” and devotes a chapter to it in his Outer Gateways:Dream actions are a clue to the magical condition of the subliminal self. ...The dream is all we may know, normally, of the fourth dimension while we areembodied three-dimensionally. But we are not so embodied while dreaming. We arethen already a step ahead, even although we are still viewing the scene fromanother dimension, an inner dimension, which differs from dreamless sleep inthat it is not totally formless and void. This extra dimension is the MauveZone. Surrealists, futurists, cubists, abstractionists, were groping towards itsexpression.133 [part0009_split_002.html#aft133]Here we have the connection between dream control, the Mauve Zone (the nameGrant gives for the Abyss or for a belt of dark power encircling the Abyss), andthe artist, which is basically a description of what was taking place inLovecraft's story. By “artist” here Grant is not indicating the painter ofstill-lifes or portraits, of course, but the avant-garde practitioner ofSurrealism and the other movements that came out of the first World War.Surrealism in particular is important to the study of magic and esotericismbecause it used psychology, automatic writing, the Tarot and other forms of“discarded religion” in an effort to create works of art that would act asinitiatory powers in their own right, through shocking an audience or causingthem to view the world in a way that was not comfortable or “normal.” Byjuxtaposing unrelated elements in a poem, a drawing, or other artform, adream-like state was experienced in our dimension as if an urgent message wasbeing received from Grant's Mauve Zone.Thus Grant was able to see in Lovecraft's stories—particularly those of theCthulhu Mythos—a message from the stars as important (or, at least, as relevant)as that received by Crowley. Possibly Lovecraft resisted the message because heloathed the messenger: the creepy, hideous beings that Grant calls “TyphonianTeratomas”134 [part0009_split_002.html#aft134]: monstrous offspring created bythe intercourse between humans and alien forms of life and the source ofLovecraft's vision of “revolting fertility rites of immemorial antiquity.” Instories like “The Dunwich Horror,” Lovecraft suggests the possibility thathumans and alien beings could mate and produce children who would then behideously ugly and possessed of strange abilities. The idea that humans couldsomehow mate with gods, demons, and other beings is a staple of much Europeanand Middle Eastern religion and legend. The Greek and Roman myths are full ofsuch tales, and in the Babylonian Talmud and in various Kabbalistic and othertexts we have references to Lilith, the Queen of the Night, sometimes as thefirst spouse of Adam and the demons as her children with the evil spiritSamael.135 [part0009_split_002.html#aft135] Most famously in the West, the storyof the sons of God and the “daughters of men” (Genesis 6:4) seems to tell asimilar story of unholy intercourse between two different beings, one human andone not-quite-human.Lovecraft was a lover of science and an atheist; he claimed more than once inhis voluminous correspondence that his stories were pure fantasy, with norelationship to anything real, but perhaps motivated by his intellectual horrorof the vast expanses of space that seem to dwarf all human aspiration andpotential. He also had a definite fear and loathing of other races, races he sawas degenerate forms of human life, monstrous throwbacks or deviations along theevolutionary path. While we can regard his native racism with pity or contempt,we can also see beyond it to realize that it is consistent with his fiction. InLovecraft's tales nothing good can come of the mating of humans with the OldOnes. The genetic anomalies that result would throw the world open to theravages of these uncaring, oblivious, and insane beings from planets so far fromours that they would be invisible to even the strongest of telescopes.Mating with the gods, in other words, opens the Gate.“The thing has gone for ever,” Armitage said. “It has been split up into what itwas originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in anormal world. Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know. Itwas like its father—and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm ofdimension outside our material universe; some vague abyss out of which only themost accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a momenton the hills. ...You needn't ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn'tcall it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than hedid.”136 [part0009_split_002.html#aft136]In the above quotation from Lovecraft, we learn of the magician Wilbur Whateleyand his dark rites conducted on an altar in a circle of standing stones, and thesummoning forth of a murderous entity from “some vague abyss,” i.e., analogousto Grant's Mauve Zone. Wilbur and the monster were twins, because their humanmother—Lavinia Whateley, “a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of35”—had mated with a mysterious, unknown supramundane entity, their father.Lavinia's own father was a wizard of some repute, which explains how she cameinto contact with the alien being in the first place. And Wilbur Whately, herson? He was born on February 2, 1913, the date known as Candlemas to theChristian world and as Imbolc or Oimelc to the pagan world: one of thecross-quarter days that are so important to the pre-Christian calendar, comingas they do halfway between the quarter days (i.e., the solstices and equinoxesthat are sacred to the solar cult because they represent stages in the sun'sprogress through the zodiac). The cross-quarter days are the places “between,”and it is this “inbetweenness” that attracts the attention of both Lovecraft andGrant.Further, the choice of February 2 is illustrative of another aspect toLovecraft's work: his deliberate use of symbols. To the pagan, pre-Christianworld that day was called Imbolc, an Old Irish word that means “in the belly,” areference to pregnancy. It is a suggestive date to use for the birthing of amonster, sired by a pre-Christian ancient God or Devil.As an aside we should note that Lovecraft is always careful to use precise datesin his stories. There is no poetic ambiguity there, no referencing of the monthbut not the year as one finds in most stories and novels. Lovecraft alwaysinsists on specificity in his chronologies, and it is this aspect of his workthat makes it so valuable to those looking for connections to real-world eventsespecially as it seems Lovecraft is deliberately trying to tell us something.Because of this characteristic we were able to identify Crowley's feveredwriting of some of the Thelemic Holy Books at a time when Lovecraft claimedthere were orgiastic rites to Cthulhu taking place in New Orleans ... inspiredby an Unholy Book: the Necronomicon.The month of February, 1913 was an important one in the art world for itsignalled the public appearance in New York City of Surrealist works by MarcelDuchamp. Surrealism is singled out by Grant to be one of the artforms mostinfluenced by occult or magical currents. Only a few days earlier, in January of1913, Kafka would put down the pen on his unfinished novel Amerika forever. Butit was during 1913 that Crowley would write the Gnostic Mass, which we havediscussed previously, as well as his famous Hymn to Pan.The previous year was when Theodor Reuss visited Crowley in London and accusedhim of printing the IXth degree secret of the OTO in his Book of Lies,specifically the chapter devoted to the Star Sapphire ritual. He then admittedCrowley to the IXth degree of the OTO, as mentioned previously, and then Crowleywas put in charge of the OTO operations in the British Isles.So, when “Wilbur Whateley” was born, Crowley was embarking on the game-changingactions that would make him the leader of one of the most famous Western secretsocieties of the twentieth century. As we have seen above, Crowley believed thatthe Egyptian gods Horus and Set were “twins”: that they personified the doublewand of power, as they represented the union of Lower and Upper Egyptrespectively. Horus was the “good” god, and Set was the Evil One. Thus, perhapsWilbur Whateley was the “good” twin and his brother—the monstrous thing they hadto destroy—was the Evil One, the Set to Wilbur's Horus.While these associations may seem fanciful, we need only remember how definitivewere Lovecraft's stories when matched against corresponding dates and events inThelema. In order to understand the Necronomicon Gnosis it is necessary to graspsome of the essential elements as transcribed by Lovecraft (and those of hiscircle) and then to “port” them over to Thelemic elements and note theircorrespondence. If Lovecraft received many of his ideas through his dreams, ashe often admitted in writing to friends, then his process was consistent withGrant's dream control theory and practice. What is startling is that the dreamsof Lovecraft would so neatly correspond to the inspirations received by Crowley.They were both dreaming the same dream.The reader will remember that the frenzied orgy taking place in the swampsoutside New Orleans in Lovecraft's “The Call of Cthulhu” occurred on the sameday that Crowley was writing several of what would be known as the “Holy Books.”However, there are other coincidences that bear inspection.For instance, in “The Call of Cthulhu” the young sculptor Wilcox visitsProfessor George Angell during the period February 28 to April 2, 1925. This isthe time when other artists, mediums and sensitives are experiencing similarvisions around the world. Lovecraft has selected this period with care, forthere was an earthquake on February 28, 1925 that affected the northeasternUnited States and Canada. This same earthquake is used by Lovecraft as a devicethat enables a sunken city beneath the waves of the Pacific Ocean to rise to thesurface. While the earthquake in question did not occur in the Pacific, it wasobviously the inspiration for the earthquake in the story.It is compelling to realize that this is a phenomenon that actually has occurredand within recent history. The famous earthquake and tsunami of December 26,2004, that took more than 200,000 lives in Asia from Indonesia and Thailand toIndia, also had the effect of raising an entire undersea temple off the easterncoast of India.This was the fabled Mahabalipuram Temple of the Seven Pagodas, built in the 8thcentury CE. Only one of the seven “pagodas” had survived into the modern age,the so-called “Shore Temple” believed to be one of the original seven. Justbefore the tsunami struck, local residents saw the ocean pull away from thecoastline as if being inhaled by something far out to sea. As the ocean rolledaway, the sunken temple complex was revealed, showing the missing pagodas, onlyto be swallowed again when the roiling sea water returned. It was as if thesunken city of R'lyeh had materialized out of nowhere as an homage to Lovecraft.That it was an Indian temple seemed to indicate a resonance between theNecronomicon Gnosis and the Tantric interpretation by Kenneth Grant.The period of general weirdness, insanity and troubled dreams depicted in “TheCall of Cthulhu” as beginning with the earthquake of February 28 ends on April2, 1925 which is the day that an important meeting of the Surrealists took placein Paris, a meeting that would decide how the artistic movement would becomepolitically active, and which produced the Memorandum of the SurrealistRevolution. Lovecraft never refers to this meeting, of course, and it isdoubtful whether or not he would have been aware of it at all. However, thebookending of an earthquake on one side and the Surrealist Memorandum on theother is perfectly consistent with Lovecraft's storyline. The shattering effectof the earthquake that shakes the sunken city where Cthulhu lies dead butdreaming, causing him to awaken from his ancient slumber, and the “certain stateof fury”137 [part0009_split_002.html#aft137] that informed the Surrealistmovement as these avant-garde artists struggled with altered states ofconsciousness and altered political states ... all of this becomes part of theLove-craftian Zeitgeist. The earthquake awakens Cthulhu, and the artists—themost avant-garde, the most sensitive to occultism, depth psychology, andautomatic writing—assemble in a “certain state of fury” to decide how artistictransgression and political transgression can work together to cause thedestruction of civilization as they knew it. The dreams of the Surrealists bledover into the dreams of the Communists, and these dreams were seeded by the highpriest of the Old Ones who needs social unrest and dislocation to give hisfollowers the space to perform the orgia necessary to open the channels, theGates, to the Underworld.Kenneth Grant may be characterized as the analyst interpreting these dreams, notfor the sake of the dreamers but for those of us who struggle to understand thedream content and how it may be relevant to a study of magic and religion in the21st century. Grant reveals how the Lovecraft material expands upon the datareceived by Crowley with virtually no reference to the Golden Dawn-typeatmosphere of the latter. Lovecraft is seeing what Crowley sees, only he sees itfrom the perspective of an outsider, someone for whom the symbol-set of thefin-de-siecle British secret society has no meaning and provides no context; andfor whom the initiatory structure of the Golden Dawn is not available to protecthim from the experience. Instead, Lovecraft sees it raw, unfiltered. And that iswhat frightens him.The basic features of the Necronomicon Gnosis may be reduced to a few convenientelements. The first is Cthulhu himself.Lovecraft refers to Cthulhu as the high priest of the Old Ones and thus may notbe an Old One himself. At least, he is not one of the ancient Gods but is apriest of those Gods. The physical description of Cthulhu shows that he is nothuman by any stretch of the imagination, with his octopus-like head replete withtentacles. One is reminded of the Egyptian gods who are often depicted as beingswith humanoid bodies but with animal heads. What Lovecraft is implying in hisstories is that those are the actual physical characteristics of the gods andnot some sophisticated symbolic interpretation. Conversely, we could say that—ifapplying the Egyptian standards to Lovecraft's Cthulhu—that Cthulhu does notreally have an octopus head but that it is Lovecraft's way of implyingoctopus-like characteristics.The Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon—i.e., the“Simonomicon”—translates the name Cthulhu as Kutulu: a Sumerian neologismmeaning “Man of the Underworld.” He is, according to this interpretation, apsychopomp, a guide to the Other World, to the Mauve Zone. He is a liminalfigure standing at the crossroads of this world and the next. The word kutu hasa double meaning: it refers not only to the Underworld but to a specific city inancient Sumer, Cutha or Gudua. The city itself was considered to be the locationof an entrance to the Underworld and, as mentioned previously, it was the homecity of the Qureish, the tribe to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged and whichwas in charge of the Ka'aba when it was a pagan shrine to the Moon God, Hubal.There is a thus a rich vein of symbolism to be mined in the word Cthulhu. As theeditor of the Necronomicon, Simon, points out the word may also be a subtle playon the term cthonic, a word used in anthropology and religious studies to mean“underground” or “under the earth” when referencing gods and spirits that arebelieved to dwell below the surface of the earth. The pronounciation of the wordcthonic in the Oxford English Dictionary is precisely “ka-tonic” and may havealso given Lovecraft the pun necessary for his famous Miskatonic University: thefictional location where the dreaded Necronomicon itself is kept under lock andkey in the rare book room.At some point in the far distant past the Old Ones were in control of thisplanet. When they left, Cthulhu remained behind as their lone contact and highpriest but he was defeated in some manner and entombed—either beneath the earthor beneath the waves, in the sunken city of R'lyeh—and remains in that stateuntil he can be awakened by his human followers on earth, when the “stars areright.” In his present state he is “dead but dreaming,” like a vampire in thecoffin; except a vampire may come alive at the setting of the sun, every day,but Cthulhu can only come alive when the stars are right, i.e., when theconstellations themselves are aligned in such a way as to provide a channel forthe Old Ones to return. There is assumed to be a sort of ritual mechanism inwhich human followers of the Old Ones can perform an appropriate ceremony at anappropriate time and this will serve to awaken Cthulhu so he can begin hisritual for summoning the Old Ones back to earth. The right ceremony at the righttime opens the Gate between this world and the next.While it seems melodramatic and outlandish in Lovecraft's stories, this isexactly what the medieval European magicians believed. The timing of the ritualwas extremely important in order for the angels and demons to be properlyevoked. In Grant's own system, timing is just as important for thesexually-based rituals of his modified Tantra. The kalas—a word that suggeststhe Sanskrit term for “time” as in Kalacakra or “Wheel of Time”—are essencessecreted by a woman on different days of her menstrual cycle. It was most likelythe lunar phases in the heavens and the menstrual cycle on earth that firstsuggested the measurement of time and periodicity to pre-historic civilizations.The alignment of the lunar cycle with the menstrual cycle is an essentialelement of Grant's Tantra; alignments of the planetary cycles are themselvesessential to the successful practice of ceremonial magic.To Lovecraft, the proper alignment of the stars is never described fully. It isa secret science, known only to the worshippers of Cthulhu and the Old Ones.They alone possess the knowledge of how the stars would appear when they were“right.” Again, there is precedence in Western and Asian astrology.To most people in the West, astrology is essentially solar astrology. It isbased on the passage of the Sun through the zodiacal belt. In India, however,astrology is sidereal: it is based on the actual positions of the planets whenviewed against the stars of the zodiac rather than on a constant (solar)calendar date. Thus, people who believe themselves to be a Libran in the Westmay very well discover to their shock that in India they are said to beVirgoans. This is due to the precession of the equinoxes that was mentionedpreviously. Thus, when the “stars are right” in Europe they may not be right inIndia.Add to this confusion the plethora of indigenous calendars around the world,none of which are exact matches for the others, and you have time-keepingsystems that are unique to each culture. Java, for instance, has at least fivecalendars in use. Their diviners use all five in determining personalcharacteristics of the newborn, the best days for starting an enterprise,planting crops, etc.The European magicians had complex tables showing the rulership of each day andeach hour within the day, rulerships that changed with the day of the week.Previous to the rather arbitrary assigment of planets to days and hours,however, were the Babylonian systems of astrology that included not only planetsand zodiacal constellations but also a whole host of fixed stars as well ascomets and other astronomical phenomena. The Babylonian astrologers actuallywatched the heavens on a constant, unending basis (something which many of ourcontemporary astrologers would be uinin-terested or incapable of doing, spoiledas they are by computerized calculations and real-time simulations of theheavens). They did not view the astral positions as purely symbolic but kept aneye on the skies alert to any new message, any new prediction. Thus, an Ur-cultsuch as the one we have been suggesting would use an “astrology” that was rathermore astronomy than astrology, although partaking of elements of each.That this Ur-astrology is also concerned with biological functions is one of themissing links in the Lovecraftian ouevre. He hints at it, talks around it withhis references to “orgies” and his discussion of poor Lavinia Whately and herdemonic offspring. When the stars are right, it's not only the time when Cthulhucan be roused from his subterranean slumber but it's also the time when35-year-old albino women can be impregnated by invisible alien monsters as longas the correct rituals are performed. An essential aspect of the Cthulhu Mythosis that a knowledeable cult of experienced sorcerers are indispensable to theopening (and especially the closing) of the Gate. Lavinia did not conceive amonstrous creature by accident, after some adolescent fumbling in a hayloft atthe Whateley farm. She conceived during a ritual that enabled her father, oldWizard Whateley, to charge the essences (the kalas) appropriately so that—as theGate opened at the proper time—Lavinia's ovum would have been subtly altered toenable the alien seed to take root.138 [part0009_split_002.html#aft138]None of this is described as such in “The Dunwich Horror,” of course. It takes alittle reading between the lines. Knowing what we know now of how theseTyphonian Teratomas are created it is a simple task to go back and re-readLovecraft with greater understanding of the process and of what was said andmost important what was not said or described, but implied. That human sexualityis a means of breaching the boundaries between this world and the next is astaple of Tantra. It was virtually unknown in the West until comparativelyrecently with the publication of some translated Tantric texts in the nineteenthcentury. But this was common knowledge to the cultists around Cthulhu inLovecraft's stories.Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key andguardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. Heknows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall breakthrough again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where Theystill tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Dunwich Horror”It was Yog-Sothoth who impregnated Lavinia Whateley, who then gave birth toWilbur Whateley and his monstrous, unnamed twin brother. Yog-Sothoth as the Gateis thus perfectly understandable in the context we have been examining. It isthrough this unnatural intercourse and its subsequent conception that a Gate hasbeen opened between this world and the next, and a Magical Child created wholives in both.Grant illuminates this concept when he writes of the assumption of god-forms, apractice that is essential to Thelemic ritual in general. His approach alsohelps us to understand the nature of Cthulhu, the octopus-headed beast of thestatue we discover in “The Call of Cthulhu.”He writes:The magical theories which underlie the formula of the assumption of god-formsare of vital importance to an understanding of Crowley's later refinement andrehabilitation of them. The masquerading as animal-headed deities ... was donewith intent to assimilate the superhuman powers possessed by certain animals.This formula, which was used by sorcerers of the ancient world, had a profoundeffect upon the psychology of the operator. Because man evolved from the beasts,he possesses—deeply buried in his subconscious—the memories of superhuman powershe once possessed. ... Any required atavism could be evoked by assumption of theappropriate god-form. ... Crowley interprets the formula as a magicalunification of larval consciousness, characteristic of pre-human phases of life,with the ultimate product of an exalted and illumined human will ... through theinstrumentality of psycho-sexual magic. The Sphinx is the most celebrated imageof this concept. ... the meeting of beast and god through the mediumship ofman.139 [part0009_split_002.html#aft139]In Lovecraft's stories, these are always considered hideous creations. The OldOnes are gods in their own right, otherwise why do they need a HighPriest—Cthulhu—and bands of clandestine worshippers throughout the world toworship and summon them? The offspring of Lavinia Whately then is just such a“meeting of beast and god through the mediumship of man.” And, of course, it wasaccompanied by “psycho-sexual rites” performed by her wizard father on hertortured mind, her virgin flesh: the incestuous element of the Star Sapphireritual taken to its heinous, albeit logical, conclusion.The same process is used—can be used—for widely different ends and by operatorsof widely different capabilities; but it should be obvious that if such a thingas the Sphinx (for instance) actually existed as a living thing, it would beshunned as an abomination, the ancient Egyptian version of a “TyphonianTeratoma.” Is Cthulhu, then, the product of just such a union? The“animal-headed” masks used by magicians to connect to their atavisms representstages of human evolution, as per Grant. If so, then the cephalopod-headedcreature known as Cthulhu represents a much earlier stage, something predatingthe arrival of quadripeds and mammals in general. Cthulhu represents that stagein evolution when life was still in its relative infancy: slime-dwelling,ooze-feasting creatures from the ocean's depths. To connect with Cthulhu, then,is to approach the oldest part of the human brain: the reptilian or serpentbrain, sitting atop the spinal column, that controls basic “fight or flight”responses as well as ritual, and which is in charge of our sexual responses aswell. This has nothing to do with the higher states of love and affection, or ofromance and seduction. Rather, this is pure reproductive imperative, pure lust,the seat of the “darkest” passions, those that we—as social beings—attempt(often vainly and with horrendous consequences) to repress, suppress, or flatlydeny. It is the realm of what Swiss psychiatrist Carl G. Jung called “theShadow,” an unconscious element of the personality that is linked to the sameanimal instincts we have described,140 [part0009_split_002.html#aft140] andwhich is the repository of a person's darkest desires as well as the source ofhuman creativity141 [part0009_split_002.html#aft141].If that abyss and what it held were real, there is no hope. Then, all too truly,there lies upon this world of man a mocking and incredible shadow out oftime.142 [part0009_split_002.html#aft142]It is unnameable, by virtue of the fact that this area of human consciousnessexisted before there were “individuals”: it is the aspect of consciousness thatbecomes most pronounced in mob violence, gang rape, and mass hysteria.Violence carried to the pitch of frenzy, either masochistic or the reverse. Thisunseals primal atavisms, the resurgence of which leads directly to the mostancient (i.e. the original) state of consciousness which, being pure, is cosmic,unlimited.143 [part0009_split_002.html#aft143]It is the basic building block of survival (fight or flight) and as such itexisted before the ego, before the super-ego, before humans became conscious ofthemselves as separate, individual entities with their own souls, their ownspirituality, their own potentialities as kings and queens. The physical aspectof the Shadow—the reptilian brain—is believed to be at least 500 million yearsold144 [part0009_split_002.html#aft144]: certainly a Lovecraftian time span.145[part0009_split_002.html#aft145] There is nothing thoughtful or intellectualabout this characteristic. There is no reasoning with it. There can only becontrol ... or lack of control. And since logic and reason have no place in the“serpent brain,” until the advent of depth psychology the only means availablefor controlling its desires and managing its appetites (other than prison ordrugs) were in the realm of ritual in which these unholy or unlawful needs founda safe and manageable channel for expression. Otherwise the world would havelong since been filled with Typhonian Teratomas as inbreeding and incest wouldhave degenerated the gene pool and resulted in widespread physical and mentaldeformities.This part of the brain also controls the autonomic functions, such asheart-rate, breath-rate, peristalis, etc. which are not normally controlled bythe conscious mind but which occur automatically, even while we sleep. It is thetarget of such practices as yoga and Chinese alchemy which seek to exert controlover the unconscious mind through manipulation of the autonomic functions. Thuspranayama—one of Crowley's required practices—is the conscious control ofbreathing, which in turn is the gateway to conscious control of the heart-beatand from there to all the other autonomic functions. It is, of course, anextremely dangerous practice for those who have not been initiated into itssecrets by someone who knows what they are doing.The Necronomicon Gnosis involves the deliberate investigation of this dark realmin its entirety, the realm where death and sexuality (the Freudian “deathinstinct” and “pleasure principle”) are so inextricably intertwined that it isimpossible (from the outside) to tell them apart, but which provides the enginefor all successful Thelemic ritual. For Thelema is a doctrine that rejectsrepression in all its forms and provides outlets—some socially-acceptable, somenot—for the exploration and expression of this “dark matter.”It should be emphasized, however, that Thelema does not provide an excuse forindulging in these antinomian practices willy-nilly, like some kind ofoccult-oriented swingers club. The only way in which to (productively) accessthis darker realm, the “Nightside” of Eden, is through the exercise of the Will.The individual—the result of millenia of human evolution—must be in consciouscontrol of its own serpent brain. This is the meeting of beast and god throughthe mediumship of man spoken of above, the antipodes of human consciousness. Thepurpose is to assimilate the darker and forbidden aspects of one's consciousnessinto the higher form of experience, of evolution, so that it may serve as thepower-house for greater attainments. In order to do this, the rituals themselvesmust be accurately timed. There is no better method of controlling the darkerimpulses than by refusing to allow them expression until “the stars are right.”"},{"pageContent":"WHEN THE STARS ARE RIGHTThe Pennacook myths, which were the most consistent and picturesque, taught thatthe Winged Ones came from the Great Bear in the sky, and had mines in ourearthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any otherworld. They did not live here, said the myths, but merely maintained outpostsand flew back with vast cargoes of stone to their own stars in the north.—H. P. Lovecraft146 [part0009_split_002.html#aft146]One of the critical pieces of information concerning the correct position of the“stars”—i.e., when they are “right”—has to do with the Great Bear constellation,referenced above in Lovecraft's story “The Whisperer in the Darkness.” A furthernote is at the end of that same paragraph when “their own stars in the north”are referenced. Simon has made much of this in his Gates of the Necronomicon,and I have focused on the Great Bear constellation myself in Stairway to Heavenin an attempt to demonstrate its universality among mystery cults in differentparts of the world, including shamanism, Mithraism and even some ceremonialforms of Daoism. I believe that this constellation is a key to understanding theancient cults of which Lovecraft writes and in this it seems Kenneth Grantconcurs.All Circle-craft is based either upon the original (stellar) circle of the GreatBear, Goddess of the Seven Stars; or the Moon and her thirteenfold annual cycle;or on the later and final solar circle of the Twelve Celestial houses of the sun(zodiac).147 [part0009_split_002.html#aft147]The Great Bear is a circumpolar constellation: that is, it never sets below thehorizon but rotates endlessly about a point in the absolute north above theearth, represented in our time by the Pole Star. In other words, these are the“stars in the north” to which Lovecraft alludes in his story. Navigators haveused the position of the Great Bear constellation—or its smaller asterism, theBig Dipper—to tell time and direction when no landmarks or other astronomicalphenomena are available or visible, such as in the middle of the ocean at night.Remembering how critical time and the measurement of time is to the correctperformance of rituals intended to evoke planetary and other forces, we canbegin to appreciate the relevance of this constellation to mystery religions theworld over. Grant associates the Great Bear with the Goddess of the Seven Stars,i.e. with Babalon herself. In the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon,it specifically states that the Gate may be opened when “the Great Bear hangsfrom its tail in the sky.” Of course, the Great Bear hangs from its tail in thesky once every day as it rotates around the Pole Star (it is actually the earthdoing the rotating, as every schoolchild knows). But at night, when theconstellation may be visible, it hangs from its tail (making a straight linefrom the Pole Star) at midnight on April 30.148 [part0009_split_002.html#aft148]As we have noted before, this is a date with great relevance, for it is anotherof the cross-quarter days mentioned above. Known as Walpurgisnacht to readers ofBram Stoker's Dracula, it is also known as Beltane or even just as May Eve topagans and Wiccans. The European equivalent of the American Halloween, it is aday when witches gather for their Great Sabbat atop mountain peaks and communewith the Devil ... with the Dark Lord.It also has some uncanny correspondences with American and world history. Forinstance, April 30, 1492 was the day Christopher Columbus received hiscommission to set sail for the East Indies, a voyage that culminated in the“discovery” of America on October 12, 1492—coincidentally Aleister Crowley'sbirthday.April 30, 1789 was the day George Washington took the oath of office ofPresident of the United States, on Wall Street in New York City. The monumentthat bears his name in Washington, D.C. is precisely 555 feet high: 555 is thenumber of the word Necro-nomicon.April 30, 1945 is the day when it was alleged that Adolf Hitler committedsuicide in the Berlin bunker.April 30, 1975 is the day when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese army,signalling the end of the Vietnam War.April 30, 1978 is the day the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was proclaimed,with disastrous consequences.And on and on.Into the north window of my chamber glows the Pole Star with uncanny light ...The Pole Star, evil and monstrous, leers down from the black vault, winkinghideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strangemessage, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey.—H. P. Lovecraft, “Polaris” (1918)Lovecraft's conscious employment of the Great Bear and Polaris in his storiesmay be an indication that he was aware of the role these astronomical entitiesplay in the cults he describes with such terror. Frater Achad—whose strangeinsistence on a contemporaneous Aeon of Maat we have already described—had thisto say about the same constellation:The first boy and his mother were called Sut-Typhon.Sut means “The Opener,” and this may be taken in the physiological as well asthe astrological sense. The Child was the opener in the sense of being born ofthe un-mated Mother. The Sun is the Opener of the Day, while Sut as the Star-godwas considered the Opener of the Year with the rising of Sothis, and on hisrising was the Great Bear cycle founded.149 [part0009_split_002.html#aft149]While Achad links the Great Bear with Set in his writings, Grant does the samein the Typhonian trilogies:Celestial, not terrestrial, lineage was the matter of contention. In the courseof ages, the ancestors of the Terrestrial Typhonians came to be typified by theGreat Bear constellation connected with vastly ancient myths inspired by dimmemories of the earliest colonisers of earth, and descended from Typhonian starsystems.150 [part0009_split_002.html#aft150]Thus we can see that Grant believes that the earliest colonizers of earth camefrom a region we identify with the Great Bear constellation which is consistentwith the Lovecraft short story referenced above, “The Whisperer in theDarkness,” in which alien beings from the Great Bear constellation began comingto earth in aeons past and concerned themselves with mining a specific ore fromour planet. Grant is referring in this work to the idea that the type of“lineage” typified by such popular authors as Dan Brown in his DaVinci Code andin other works—fiction and non-fiction—that have come out of the Holy Blood,Holy Grail genre does not refer to an earthly bloodline but to a celestial one(not necessarily a “heavenly” or “divine” bloodline, but one that comes fromoff-planet). This is a type of lineage that transcends genetics as we understandit and manifests as occult currents through the ages, much in the way thatapostolic succession is a “lineage” within the Catholic and Orthodox churchesexcept that, in this case, the lineage to which Grant refers has its origins noton earth or within earthly organizations but in the stars. It is this type oflineage that makes itself known in the works of both Crowley and Lovecraft as wehave seen: works produced by these two men, unknown to each other, yetdisplaying an uncanny pattern of coincidence and agreement. It is what promptedGrant to speak of a Thelemic current as well as a Necronomicon and an Egyptiancurrent, and to identify them as three separate strands of the same lineage.The Lovecraftian idea that these ancient, extraterrestrial beings came to theearth in order to mine a specific stone has deep resonance with a whole host ofconcepts connected with alchemy, sexuality, and Tantra, and it is a theme thatLovecraft has explored in more than one short story.Aside from the oeuvre published under his own name, Love-craft is known to havehelped other authors with their stories, in some cases rewriting them entirelybut permitting them to be published as original works by the same authors. Oneparticular story reinforces the Grant thesis that Crowley's mysterious “Tulu”and Lovecraft's Cthulhu are one and the same.This is the story entitled “The Mound” and attributed as the work of ZealiaBishop. It was written in the period 1929-1930 and appears in the collection ofLovecraft's “other” works, The Horror in the Museum, edited by Lovecraft scholarS. T. Joshi. In this story we have references to “ingots of magneticTulu-metal”151 [part0009_split_002.html#aft151] and the “sacred and magneticTulu-metal.”152 [part0009_split_002.html#aft152] This story also has a referenceto a sunken city, referred to in a Mexican dialect as Relex. Anyone familiarwith how the Spanish “x” is pronounced will immediately realize that this wordis pronounced “Rel-eh” with a hard “h,” thus giving us a form of R'lyeh.In this story we have again the theme of mining specific metals, in this caseTulu metal, which is magnetic and therefore of a north-south polarity consistentwith the Necronomicon Gnosis and its emphasis on the north-south axis versus thesolar east-west axis. It should be pointed out once again that the word “Tulu”is specific to both Lovecraft and to Crowley: it is a point of tangence betweenthe two authors that reflects a deeper connection than we normally attribute tothe horror writer and the prophet of the New Age.Mircea Eliade, the famous historian of religion at the University of Chicago,wrote concerning sacred stones in his The Forge and the Crucible:It is not very long since the kings of Malaya kept a sacred block of iron whichwas part of their regalia and surrounded it with an extraordinary venerationmingled with superstitious terror. ...It was not a question of fetishism or ofthe worship of an object in itself or for its own sake; it was not a matter ofsuperstition but a sacred respect for a strange object outside their ownfamiliar world, an object coming from elsewhere and hence a sign or token of the‘beyond,’ a near-image of the transcendental.153[part0009_split_002.html#aft153]Eliade equates the practice of mining with a whole host of concepts related toalchemical transformation. The miner was an initiate of the dark mysteries: byworking in the caves and hidden places of the earth he was in constant contactwith the spirits that dwelled in the underworld. He was also privvy to thesecret processes whereby a stone could become gold. He knew where objects wereburied and hidden. His day turned into night as he descended into the bowels ofthe earth, below any visible horizon and thus out of reach of the sun and thestars.The cult of Mithra conducted its mysterious initiations in caves, in the placeof mines and buried treasure, away from the light of the sun. For this reason(and several others), I believe that the Mithraists were not worshipping the Sungod and that the sacred Bull that was slain by Mithra was not an emblem of thezodiacal sign Taurus but of the constellation known as the Great Bear. I developthis theory more carefully in Stairway to Heaven, but basically I identifynocturnal worship with stellar worship, especially in the case of cults andreligions that had no other reason to meet in secret since they were not beingsuppressed or engaging in antinomian practices.There was an ancient understanding that there was an analogue between the bowelsof the earth and the embryonic stages of gestation. The earth gave birth to goldand other precious metals through a long process of metallurgical gestation. Thealchemist understood these processes and knew how to hurry them along, to“induce labor” one might say so that the earth gave up its treasures morequickly. The natural process of human evolution may, one day, result in a beingof higher intelligence and spiritual illumination; but it is the work of themagician to “induce labor” in the initiate, to hurry along the natural processof spiritual evolution so that it takes place (at least for the individual) in asingle lifetime.This has relevance for the discussion of the reptilian brain, above; for just ashuman beings evolved over the long term from watery creatures to amphibiousmammals to mammals and finally to homo sapiens, so the human embryo goes througha similar process of living in an aqueous solution until it “crawls out onto dryland,” i.e., is born into the world as an air-breathing creature, crawling onall fours and eventually walking upright. In this sense, every magician andevery alchemist is an embryo going through the same process as the human embryo,as the metals in the earth, as the entire human race itself. But it must beginby probing the reptilian brain and discovering its contents and neutralizingthem, making them servants of the Will. And what better representative of thereptilian brain and the danger and loathesomeness that it conceals than thehideous form of the High Priest of the Great Old Ones, Cthulhu himself?The Necronomicon Gnosis recognizes that some of the steps along the way wereevolutionary dead-ends, at least from the point of view of homo sapiens. Whilesome creatures did not survive and became extinct on our world, the Gnosisinsists that not all of them died out permanently but that their scars remain onour DNA, dormant, “dead but dreaming” of the day when they will be “turned on”by environmental or other factors and rise with a roar from the bowels of ourown, individual R'lyehs."},{"pageContent":"THE SUNKEN CITYIn his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.—H. P. LovecraftUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you willcall it fate.—C. G. JungLovecraft's core story, “The Call of Cthulhu,” is the repository of all thebasic themes and motifs that appear in his later tales. It reflects his basicpreoccupations with ancient races, mysterious cults, non-Euclidean geometry, andthe power of dreams. It also introduces us to Cthulhu, the high priest of theGreat Old Ones, and the sunken city of R'lyeh where Cthulhu lies dead, butdreaming.The idea of a sunken or buried civilization is something that has been with usfor thousands of years. Plato famously referred to the vanished civilization ofAtlantis; and rumors of a Lemuria and a Mu—more sunken civilizations—becameprevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Then there wasthe Hollow Earth theory and the claim that Admiral Byrd had seen the entrance tothis “inner earth” through a hole in the vicinity of the North Pole. So thesunken city meme has been a staple of fantasy history for quite some time.Lovecraft's genius lay in reinterpreting these stories from a darker point ofview. Lovecraft's sunken city of R'lyeh is where the Great Old Ones weredefeated by some quirk of space or time, and where Cthulhu lies buried in hishouse-like tomb beneath the waves. This ancient city is older than Atlantis orany of its other mythical counterparts. It was built—using geometry that was all“wrong”—by the race from the stars, a race that used to own the planet Earth inaeons past and which is on the verge of returning when the “stars are right.”If we analyze this story from the point of view of depth psychology, we can seea certain level of consistency with modern ideas concerning the unconscious andthe danger of repressing unconscious feelings and especially the knowledge thatlies buried in the deep, forgotten corners of the human mind. In this approach,R'lyeh becomes the unconscious itself, and Cthulhu is the Shadow that waits tobe discovered: the potentially dangerous, violent, evil aspect of human nature.An aspect that communicates with us the same way Cthulhu communicates with hisfollowers: in dreams.Freud famously claimed that dreams were the “royal road to the unconscious,” andLovecraft might have agreed. To the gothic horror writer, dreams were certainlythe royal road to R'lyeh, to the dead but dreaming High Priest, Cthulhu. Hewrites that Cthulhu is in communication with his human followers through a kindof telepathy that manifests in their dreams. This is what triggered the creationof the Cthulhu sculpture by young Wilcox and which sets in motion “The Call ofCthulhu.” We learn that this “call” is indeed the dream-stream sent by Cthulhufrom deep within the sunken city, from deep within what Jung called the“collective unconscious.”It may be a truism that what demands to be known in our dreams is not somebeautiful image of heaven or some pleasing, loving memory—but something moresinister, something uglier that needed to be “put down,” that needed to besuppressed in order that the rest of the personality could survive in the realworld. The only persons who deliberately evoked those nightmares to visibleappearance were the mystics, the magicians, and the shamans. I have written atsome length in other works about the shamanistic initiations, and of courseMircea Eliade has discussed this at some length in his seminal work on thesubject, Shamanism. This type of initiation involves a direct confrontation withthe suppressed psychic material that involves the death, dismemberment, andre-integration of the individual psyche. For someone who has come through thistype of experience the dread Cthulhu could hold no fears.It may also be a truism that this suppressed material is connected with sexualissues. It may involve sexual trauma of the individual at a very young age, orphysical or emotional abuse of some kind by an older person. While the exactidentity and nature of the trauma will be different from person to person, theMinotaur in the Labyrinth is the same: the different types of abuse reflectdifferent pathways in the Labyrinth, but they all lead to the same Monster atthe center. Lovecraft called this Monster by a name he heard or invented ordreamed: Cthulhu.As described in the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon, the ancientSumerians had just such a sunken city in their myth cycles. The gate to thisunderworld palace was through the city of Gudua, the city that became Cutha andKutu. Cthulhu is Kutu-lu, the Man of the Underworld. He is a hybrid creature, asenvisioned by Lovecraft, something crustacean or squid-like. As a High Priest ofthe Old Ones, he is the liminal figure between humanity and the ancient racefrom the stars. He lives in the Underworld, in R'lyeh, and can be summoned bythose who hear his call through their fevered dreams.In “The Call of Cthulhu” Lovecraft reveals that the rituals required to summonthe Great Old Ones involve orgies by people who are of mixed races, theimplication being that they are not white Europeans but Arabs, Africans, andAsians ... all races of which Lovecraft was deeply suspicious and fearful. Thisconflation of unbridled sexuality and exotic races and ethnicities is a commontheme in colonialist literature and was a feature in the castigation of thepractice of Tantra in India by the British colonizers. Again, Lovecraft hastouched on a deep current of occult tradition and methodology in his fantasies,understanding that contact may be made with the darker aspects of the human mindthrough avenues provided by sexuality. He was not alone in this, of course. TheFrench Decadent poets and authors also made that connection, and the stories ofthe Black Mass with its worship of Satan combined with sexual orgies arerepresentative of this idea. It was Lovecraft, however, who extended thisconcept even further by associating the sexual orgies with the worship—not ofSatan, or of any human-created or human-inspired boogeyman—but of the mostancient, primordial and non-human race that once controlled the planet and whichwas on the verge of returning again to reclaim it. Lovecraft wanted to godeeper, darker, into more dangerous territory. He understood that there werelevels to human consciousness that could not be plumbed by spiritualdilettantes, and that the rituals employed by sorcerers and magicians hadimplications far beyond what these individuals believed to be possible ... ordesirable. To evoke Cthulhu or any of the Great Old Ones was to invite disaster(from the original meaning of the word, dis-aster or “evil star”) anddestruction for the entire planet. It was to cause a mental or nervous breakdownfor the entire human race.At the center of this complex of ideas rests the unholy book itself, theNecronomicon. To Lovecraft, this book contains the spells used by members of theCthulhu cult and instructions on how to keep the Gate between Us and Them—theultimate “liminality”—closed forever. The spells are in a language that isunknown, containing diagrams that seem meaningless yet somehow unnerving intheir weird geometry. It is a repository of bits and pieces of ancientknowledge—like our dreams, like our own unconscious—and to read it is to becomeentranced, to enter a dream state while awake, to fear oneself going insane. Itis a book of Death, as its name implies, a collection of antique ceremonies andsmatterings of images from our collective past. It offers a symbol set thatspeaks directly to the unconscious, to Cthulhu, in the language Cthulhu uses forcommunicating to us in our dreams. Instead of Freud's famous Interpretation ofDreams it is a book of dreams that interprets us. It is our collectivedreamworld as humans, fragmentary and filled with lacunae as it may be, asatanic semiotics that offers a two-lane pathway to our darkest memories as arace of humans and of our contact—at some distant, immemorial past—with anotherrace of being, a contact that was perhaps not quite so pleasant as we may wishto believe. It enables us to interpret and decipher our dreams (the messagesfrom Cthulhu) but also provides a means for communicating back. As Grantunderstood, the Necronomicon is also a manual not only of dream interpretation(a la Freud) but of dream control.It's how we communicate with the denizens of the sunken city, whether we call itR'lyeh or the collective unconscious. And it uses the fiber optic cable of theserpent brain to transfer its bits and ... “bites.”128 [part0009_split_000.html#ft128] H.P.

The intense magical operations which Crowleyperformed (especially those which occurred between 1920 and 1924) could, andprobably did, engender strange and “unearthly” children.156[part0010_split_005.html#aft156]THE SUBJECT OF THIS CHAPTER concerns the most controversial and perhaps mosttitillating aspect of the Grant ouevre: his focus on sexuality within thecontext of magic. We have touched on it briefly here and there in the pages thatprecede this one, but the author would like to dwell a bit more deeply on thisissue since it is so critical towards an understanding of Grant's TyphonianTradition and many readers possibly would find it difficult to reconcile suchmaterial with Lovecraft's known reluctance to discuss sexuality at all in hisown work.In order to do justice to this difficult subject, we will be reverting from timeto time to Gnostic texts and interpretations since it may come as a surprise tosome readers that the early Gnostics were very concerned with human sexualityand its place in the universe. There were probably as many different versions of“spiritual sexuality” among the Gnostics as there were Gnostic sects. Oursources for this material are unfortunately restricted to Christian commentatorswho were notoriously hostile to Gnosticism and whose data is thus suspect, aswell as the surviving Gnostic fragments themselves such as the Nag Hammadiscrolls. What we will find in this discussion is a justification for much ofwhat passes for “sacred sexuality” in the Thelemic framework, but also anelaboration of Lovecraft's own fears—perhaps unconscious—concerning thepotential disasters of “liberated” sexuality and especially ofintercourse—carnal and otherwise—with discarnate entities, gods, demons, and ...others.We will also have recourse to Tantra, as Grant relies more heavily on Tantrathan on Gnosticism for an understanding of the inner workings of magic and therelevance of sexual practices to Thelema. Like the Gnostics before them,Thelemites are concerned with sexuality as a form of worship and/or magicalpower. In this they are no different from the Tantrikas of India, Nepal andTibet and indeed they share many ideas and concepts in common. To Grant, thiswas a genuine revelation and he saw a broader context for Thelema in the occultpractices of Asia and Africa as well as within the framework of the NecronomiconGnosis which is not bashful about confronting the nastier bits of occult praxis."},{"pageContent":"THE CELIBATE AND THE HEDONISTOne of the antipodes in this study concerns the weird polarity of H. P.Lovecraft and Aleister Crowley. The former was notoriously sexually ambivalent,virtually asexual. He lived most of his life as a celibate, married for only twoyears and even then did not live with his wife for much of that time. The latterwas notorious in an entirely different way: Crowley had sex with anyone and itseems anything within reach. Male or female, young or old, of whatever race,whatever degree of physical health or actual physical deformity (like poorLavinia Whateley, above, who would have made a perfect partner for the Englishmagician, but who had to settle for her “half-insane” wizard of a father).Their approach to magic was similarly opposite. Crowley enthusiastically engagedin sexual magic for the purpose of creating spiritual offspring who would carryout his various tasks. Lovecraft found such behavior revolting, but in hisstories there is a tacit acknowledgement that the system worked, just not in theway Crowley would have anticipated. To Lovecraft, human sexual intercourse withgods, aliens, demons, etc. could only result in hideous monsters out to destroyall of humanity. To Crowley, such intercourse would produce servants who wouldbe more capable than the human version, “You can't get good help nowadays” beingthe operative principle.In Lovecraft's stories there are no “good” magicians except for those who becomebattlefield trained in order to undo some other magician's work, to close theGate and to send Wilbur Whateley's twin back to where it came, etc. To Lovecraftthe person, magic was superstition and at least one cause of humanity'sdistress, so his position was relatively consistent: no matter how you looked atit, either as a believer or as an atheist, magic was bad. At best it was a wasteof time, at worst it was an unholy practice designed to enslave humanity.Thus, in Lovecraft and Crowley we have two oppposing points of view and two verydifferent personalities. We especially have two very different approaches tosexuality, as well. Then how were these two men somehow “picking up” someidentical information?We can say that Lovecraft was a natural sensitive—as are many true artists—andthat regardless of his ideology he was nevertheless in tune with the occultcurrents of the day. In this he was different from Crowley in that Crowley's artwas always in service to his ideology; his novels are occult romans-a-clef hispoetry is designed to be used as keys to his magical worldview. Crowley used hisnovel Moonchild to attack and ridicule those he despised, such as Arthur EdwardWaite and MacGregor Mathers. Lovecraft used his stories to praise and recognizehis friends, such as Clark Ashton Smith.In fact, Lovecraft had friends: a wide circle of friends with whom he prettymuch stayed in contact for most of his life, usually through his voluminouscorrespondence but also in visits out of the State of Rhode Island where helived to New York City, Florida, and other parts of the country. Crowley, on theother hand, alienated many of his friends over time and those who stuck by himwere few and far between. It's hard to be chummy with the Prophet of a New Age.So for all of Lovecraft's sexual timidity he had more consistent social contactsthan the man who would engage in any form of sexual intercourse with just aboutanyone. They were opposite poles, indeed, and their common interests kept themon the same axis. Both Lovecraft and Crowley wrote of contact with extra-mundaneforces, of ancient races, lost temples, bizarre occult practices, and strange,devil-worshipping cults. It is in the tension between their two,diametrically-opposed, points of view that we find the most valuable informationand inspired insights.Lovecraft's most notable discussion of how magic might be used to create hideousbeings when coupled with sexual practices is in his famous short story “TheDunwich Horror” which was made into a film back in 1970. It concerns the“half-insane” old wizard Whateley and the unnameable rites he performed on hisdeformed, albino daughter Lavinia. There were two genetic Whateley lines, thedecayed and the undecayed lines according to Lovecraft and, of course, OldWhateley belonged to the decayed line. Thus there was the implication that thisparticular genetic strain was already tainted and the pattern of abnormal birthswas an indication either that something was amiss with the wizardry since longago, or that the genetic abnormalities were somehow necessary to theeffectiveness of the rites.Wanted: Dwarfs, Hunchbacks, Tattooed Women, Harrison Fisher Girls, Freaks of allsorts, Coloured women, only if exceptionally ugly or deformed, to pose forartist.

He was also not averse to having homosexual relations, andoften as the “bottom” or receiving partner in acts of anal sex. There is noindication that Crowley received much in the way of sexual satisfaction fromthese acts, and his Confessions and other writings tend to support the view thathe approached virtually all sexuality from a magical standpoint which wasinextricable from a psychological one. As it is almost certain that Lovecraftdid not enjoy sexuality (at least, not enough to seek out sexual opportunitieswith any degree of passion or determination) we might say that these two menshared a common approach. Neither Crowley nor Lovecraft engaged in sexualactivity with the primary intention of obtaining sexual satisfaction orgratification. For Crowley, sexual activity was subordinate to the demands ofthe Great Work: it was ritual and a pragmatic utilization of hispsycho-biological apparatus, a method to be used to plumb the depths of hispsyche as well as to make contact with other forces in the universe. ForLovecraft it just wasn't an issue at all. For both men, it could be claimed thatsexuality was not about physical satisfaction or even need. It was aboutsomething else entirely."},{"pageContent":"HIDEOUS MARRIAGEThe conflicts now raging in the world are due to the birth-pangs of the Aeon ofHorus. Sexual methods of establishing contact with entities more evolved thanman will be perfected and there are already signs of their development.158[part0010_split_005.html#aft158]As mentioned previously, there are several similarities that can be notedbetween the sexual mysticism of Thelema and the Gnostic conception of sexualityand marriage as represented by the Valentinians. We have already seen that theAeons of Valentinian Gnosticism have their parallels to the Thelemic Aeons. Inthe case of human sexuality, there are even deeper connections and they can beused as a prism through which to understand Grant's preoccupation with Tantra asa means of reinterpreting Thelemic magic.The Christian commentator Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-c. 215 CE) wroteextensively on Gnosticism in order to refute it. The Valentinians, alone amongthe various Gnostic sects, attract his approval because of their positive viewtowards marriage as the attempt to bring down the divine emanations. TheValentinians—according to Clement—saw human marriage as the earthlyrepresentation of the syzygies: the male-female pairs that were the firstemanations of the Father and which eventually resulted in the Creation as weknow it.But some of Clement's objections to other Gnostic groups are very revealing.Clement contrasts the Valentinians with the Carpocrations, who he thinksparticipated in licentious sexual acts because they believed that by doing sothey were imitating the primordial powers who had intercourse with one anotherin order to create the universe.159 [part0010_split_005.html#aft159]This is as good a brief explanation of Tantra as any.Instead, as Gnostic scholar April D. DeConick tells us, Clement was interestedin a specific form of human sexual expression that would result in divineoffspring:Human marriage was procreative, but one form of it produced more perfectoffspring than the other. The higher form of marriage included some sort ofconsciousness-raising during sexual relations to insure that the children wouldresemble God. Physical intercourse was not driven by lust, but was a matter ofthe will or intention.160 [part0010_split_005.html#aft160]In other words, the Crowleyan imperative “love under will.” To make this pointmore precisely, Clement writes that Christians should:... do nothing from lust (epithumia). Our will is to be directed towards thatwhich is necessary. For we are children not of lust but of will (thelematos).161[part0010_split_005.html#aft161]Thus, Clement of Alexandria insists that Christians are children of Thelema!According to Clement, human sexual intercourse that was not directed towards thedivine—sexual relations that were the result of the lustful feelings of thepartners—produced “defective” offspring.162 [part0010_split_005.html#aft162]Lovecraft would take this idea much further, for he raises the possibility ofsexual relations between humans and non-human creatures that result in“defective” offspring, to say the least. Lovecraft also identifies what he seesas defective races, ethnicities and bloodlines representing genetic groups thatare more prone to worship or summon the dark forces from beyond the stars. Thisis obvious in such stories as “The Horror At Red Hook,” and “The DunwichHorror,” and certainly is implied in “The Call of Cthulhu.”But the Valentinian Gnostics—according to Clement and amplified byDeConick—believed in spiritual intercourse:Through contemplative sexual practices, the Valentinians hoped to conceivechildren whose souls would contain an elect or morally-inclined “seed” of theSpirit. Sacred marriage was essential for giving birth to such children, who inturn would bring about the redemption of the fallen Sophia and the psyche.163[part0010_split_005.html#aft163]This belief is quite similar to that of the Kabbalists of the Middle Ages whoheld that it was the duty of pious Jews to engage in sexual intercourse on theSabbath in order to help the “shards”—the broken pieces of the sephirot, theresult of an oddly-failed attempt at the Creation—reunite and redeem themselvesand by extension the whole world so that the Shekinah herself can reunite withher Bridegroom. These shards are known as the qlippot, and Crowley devoted onerather strange document to their study, Liber 231. It attracted the attention ofKenneth Grant in the Typhonian Trilogies because it seemed to offer a kind ofblueprint to the Tunnels of Set: the darkside of the Kabbalistic Tree of Lifeand the pathways that connect its various power zones, a subject to which wewill return in the next chapter.While sacred marriage is a staple of alchemical literature and appears in thetheological adumbrations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints(Mormons), it is not as emphasized in traditional ceremonial magic. The iconicfigure of the ceremonial magician is of a man who either works alone, or withseveral (male) assistants. This is evidenced by the grimoires themselves, whichcontain formulas for evoking the right spirits or demons to make a woman fall inlove, or to seduce a woman, etc.—thus leading one to speculate that the averageceremonial magician was probably the medieval version of a geek: lacking insocial graces and silently lusting after the girl next door. Probably the bestexample of this meme is that of Goethe's Faust the magician who similarly lustsafter a woman, the beloved Gretchen, and who uses the Devil's powers to obtainher.This was not Crowley's problem, obviously. By the time Crowley had appeared onthe scene the field of ceremonial magic had undergone quite an overhaul.Beginning with the romantic notions of Eliphas Levi and extending to the GoldenDawn, magic was being redefined as a spiritual practice equivalent to a Westernversion of yoga and Tantra, with a complex and internally-consistent worldview.Crowley extended this impulse to make of magic an all-encompassing spiritualmovement, fueled by the revelations contained in the Book of the Law.In addition, such intellectual luminaries as Carl G. Jung would elevate thestudy of alchemy to a serious field of psychological importance, and GershomScholem would bring Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism into the mainstream ofacademic research and analysis. Mircea Eliade introduced the world to shamanism,and his brilliant student Ioan Couliano would focus his knowledge of manylanguages both ancient and modern on medieval spiritual texts and ascentliterature. The influence of these academic writers on the field of magic cannotbe over-emphasized, even as they criticized occult authors such as A. E. Waiteand Aleister Crowley by name.164 [part0010_split_005.html#aft164]The theory and practice of magic was undergoing a sea-change, buffeted by forcesboth within and without, a process that continues to this day (especially withthe outstanding work on Western esotericism coming out of the Amsterdam schoolled by Wouter Hanegraaf, and that of the late and much-lamented NicholasGoodrick-Clarke of England). But the aspect of modern magic that received themost attention—and the most confusion—was the constant references to sex as anelement of the process. This began with Crowley, as far as can be determined.While the African-American mystic Paschal Beverly Randolph was undoubtedly amajor influence where the sexual aspect of occultism and spirituality wasconcerned, through his writings and his connections to the Hermetic Brotherhoodof Light and eventually to the Ordo Templi Orientis, sacred sexuality was stillvery much a dark little secret among the Western occultists until Crowley beganpublicizing it rather openly. The Golden Dawn had its rituals based on theRosicrucian allegories, and used both male and female participants in itsceremonies (unusual for a secret society at the time), but Crowley took thewhole thing much further. As we have noted previously, the Golden Dawn providedmuch of the theoretical and ritual framework for Crowley's system and, indeed,his AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage [../images/00003.jpeg] is a refinementof the Golden Dawn degree structure with the additional three degrees at the topof the Tree of Life. Thus it would seem that a mystique of sexuality had no realplace in a system that was so perfectly symmetrical to begin with but the OTOchanged all of that for Crowley.There is no doubt that the Book of the Law contains many passionate verses andlusty exhortations, written long before Crowley made the acquaintance of theOTO. This rather startling text might have made Crowley more receptive to thelater instructions on sexual magic received from that German order. HoweverCrowley's approach was not informed by a specific program of theory andpractice; instead, he tried to incorporate sexual techniques within the contextof the Golden Dawn system of magic he inherited and this was not alwaysfruitful. He used various forms of sexual experimentation for every kind ofpurpose, from charging talismans to attract money or knowledge to using sexualintercourse to attain altered states of consciousness. He was aware that sexualfluids were important, but had to invent ways to use them.By the time he met David Curwen, who had considerably more knowledge in thisarea than he, Crowley was already quite old and only a few years from death.Kenneth Grant, however, did not let the opportunity pass to learn from someonemore knowledgeable in Tantra and began to understand the realm of possibilitiesthat this new data represented. It is the combination of ceremonial magic,Crowley's own Thelemic denomination, Tantra, Afro-Caribbean magic, the art ofAustin Osman Spare and the Surrealists, and the over-arching worldview of H. P.Lovecraft that informs the entire Typhonian Tradition. These quanta seemunrelated and arbitrarily chosen, but in Grant's hands they become indispensableelements of a symphony of occult praxis. The deeper one looks into any of thesedisparate traditions the more one finds important commonalities.The Valentinian Gnostics believed that they could create divine offspringthrough some process of “consciousness-raising” as DeConick puts it. Obviouslythe reverse would also be true: by a different form of “consciousness-raising”one could create demon children. By fine-tuning the process, one could alsocreate “offspring” that would have whatever characteristics were specified bythe ritual. This means that the act of sexual intercourse would take placewithin a magical context. Clement of Alexandria believed that sex acts thatresulted from pure lust would produce children that were somehow “defective”;how much more so children that were produced from acts of sexual intercoursethat were specifically designed to attract demonic or otherworldly forces.The Gnostic marriage was undoubtedly a spiritual one, the act of intercourseelevated to a higher plane; but it was nevertheless a ritual act. It was notmotivated by pure lust or emotional or sexual attraction between partners.Oddly, this is the same approach that needs to be taken regardless of whether ornot the purpose is to create divine offspring or demonic ones: the concentrationof the sexual partners must be focused on the spiritual or magical goal and noton the satisfaction of sexual desire. This is a requirement that effectivelyeliminates most dilettantes who become involved in the practice of magic becausethey seek excitement or arcane thrills.The sexual rituals described by Grant in his Typhonian Trilogies are neverexplained in full, but there is enough detail to enable the educated ordedicated reader to fill in the blanks. The Gnostic Marriage example of a HighPriest or King mating with a High Priestess or Queen becomes the template ontowhich a series of variations is mapped. In order to deconstruct the Tantricrituals employed by Grant and by the members of his Nu-Isis Lodge it becomesnecessary to deconstruct the sex act itself, to reduce it to its variouspsycho-biological components. The grosser physical aspects of the sex act—thebodily fluids especially—are understood to be place-holders for their moreethereal counterparts.None of this is helpful, however, if the individual participants are notthemselves completely prepared for the ritual. This means that the operatorsmust be demonstrably well-trained in various yogic-type exercises, frompranayama and asana and the basic forms of yogic meditation up to and includingthe ability to raise Kundalini. While it is not necessary for the participantsto be adepts at Kundalini yoga, it is required that they have some basic abilityin this regard otherwise the rituals are empty gestures with no force behindthem. The ability to meld mental concentration with physical, psycho-sexualresponse is the key towards successful completion of this type of ritual. It isa balancing act between the body's normal processes and reactions and theexertion of mental control over the same processes, made more difficult becausethe same requirement is demanded of the partner. In the case of a male andfemale operator both must be capable of at least the basic level of mental andphysical control; it is not useful that only one member of the couple have thisability unless the goal of the ritual is to “vampirize” the power of theless-advanced partner.As mentioned earlier, one of the essential aspects of the type of trainingrequired for Tantric-type operations is the ability to take conscious control ofthe autonomic nervous system, represented by the reptilian or serpent brain. InTantric terms, however, this is considered raising the serpent from the base ofthe spine—the Goddess Kundalini—until it reaches the brain where it meets theLord Shiva and the alchemical wedding or Gnostic marriage takes place. There areinherent dangers in this type of practice, whether you use Western or Asianterminology to describe it, and the image of the serpent—one of the mostvenomous creatures on earth but also the one that sheds its skin and becomes asymbol of transformation—is instructive in this regard. It was the serpent whotold Eve to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree, to become “as gods.” Yet itwas the Gnostics who believed that the serpent in the Garden of Eden wasactually the True God, and that the Creator of the world was a demi-urge, alesser being who intended to enslave Adam and Eve for his own purposes. In thiscomplicated mixture of images and myths we can discern the outlines of sublimetruths.Human sexuality has always been the touchstone for a whole host of tabus invirtually every culture. Society—whether as secular or sacred government orboth—has arrogated to itself control over the sexual impulses of its members.Certain types of sexual activity are approved, others are condemned. This is astrue in preliterate societies as in literate and so-called “advanced”civilizations. As in all things, the magician takes back this control—albeitusually secretly—and denies himself or herself nothing in the pursuit ofknowledge and personal perfection. In other words, in this scenario, societybecomes the demi-urge and the magician is Eve listening to the Serpent. If it isever discovered that the magicians have listened to the Serpent, society wouldbanish them from its borders: arrested, imprisoned, burned at the stake orhanged. Traffic with the Devil—the Serpent, the Dark Lord—includes not onlyrituals and beliefs that are contrary to that of the Church or State, but whichalso involves sexual activity that has been proscribed. This is as true inmedieval India with the rise of Tantric sects (in particular the Kaula circlesand the practices of Vama Marg Tantra) as it was in the Europe of the MiddleAges.Control of the human body and its products—especially its offspring—has been afocus of modern societies. Sexuality that does not result in the conception ofchildren often has been banned, such as homosexuality, masturbation, sodomy,etc. Further, the children must be conceived within a legally-acceptableenvironment, i.e., the parents of the children in question must be legally boundin the eyes of the State so that the children are legal inheritors of anyproperty. Bloodlines and real estate are inextricably linked in this way, andmarriage is just a means of providing the right documentation to ensure a smoothtransition from one property owner (the parent) to the next (the child).In the degree structure of the OTO, however, sexual practices are givenspiritual analogues. It has been popularly—and somewhat erroneously—understoodthat the VIIIth degree of the OTO concerns auto-erotic practices (what thecynics refer to as “magical masturbation”), the IXth degree refers toheterosexual intercourse, and the Xlth degree concerns homosexual intercourse.Thus the VIIIth degree and the XIth degree would automatically be consideredtabu by the established Church and State for the reasons mentioned above. Theyrepresent the intentions of the magicians to ignore the strictures of society inorder to grasp more fully the potentiality of sexuality in general, and toextend the knowledge and power of the individual magician through anunderstanding of the capabilities of the human body and the human psyche.The IXth degree represents more specifically what we have been referring to asthe Gnostic Marriage or the Alchemical Wedding. While it is nominally a degreeconcerned with heterosexual intercourse (if viewed purely clinically) it hasramifications far beyond what New Age Tantra practitioners would imagine.As Grant claims:The obloquy attached to the Yezidi as devil worshippers arose from the notion ofcongress between human and non-human entities; the angelic Being is the issue ofa hideous marriage.165 [part0010_split_005.html#aft165]And not only among the Yezidi. The union of male and female Tantrikas in therites of the Kaula circle, for instance, is not a union of human partners. Theunion cannot take place until each of the two participants has become identifiedwith a god and goddess, respectively. That means that the individual male mustbe consciously united with his deity, and at that point see the female partneras a goddess; the same is true for the female partner who must be in the samestate of exalted trance, identifying herself with the deity perceived by themale and perceiving the male as a god. Thus the two individuals performing themaithuna—the sexual embrace, if the physical act is required by the ritual or bythe guru in charge—are no longer human, and the “hideous marriage” may result inangelic offspring.Ideas about the mating of humans with non-humans are quite ancient and we findexamples of this concept in Sumerian and Babylonian religion (specifically inthe case of the lillitu), in Greek and Roman mythology, and more recently in thefears associated with succubi and incubi in the Middle Ages. According to SaintThomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologica, succubi and incubi were male and femaledemons respectively (or a single, genderless demon who could take on eithergender depending on the circumstances), who stole semen from a sleeping male andthen impregnated a sleeping female with it. Nocturnal emissions were believed tobe evidence of the activities of the succubus; unmarried women who becamepregnant were believed to be victims of the incubus.Gods could also assume human or animal form and have sexual relations withhumans, as in the tales from Greek mythology involving Zeus and his manyincarnations for the purpose of seducing women. The offspring from these unionswere always remarkable, and became gods, goddesses and semi-divine beings intheir own right. All things being equal, it would be logical to assume that theoffspring of any such union between human and non-human (whether divine ordemonic or simply extra-terrestrial) would be remarkable and would partake ofcharacteristics of both parents.Like Wilbur Whateley:The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusiveelement wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did notreside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguelylinked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spokensounds. ... He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance ofbrilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thicklips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongatedears.166 [part0010_split_005.html#aft166](This was the human twin. The other twin was somewhat ... less attractive.)A look at the illustrations in most grimoires and books on demonology willreveal that the horrific images to be found therein seem to be those of whatappear to be deformed human beings: humans with extended limbs, heads ofanimals, crooked or misshapen arms, legs, torsos. It was as if demons wereassociated with genetic abnormalities, evolutionary dead ends. But according toGrant—and, to a certain extent, Lovecraft—these “dead ends” are, like Cthulhuhimself, merely dreaming. They represent sections of human DNA that have laindormant for millions of years, no longer required for human survival, but whichmay be switched on in the future as the human environment changes. They may bepotentialities, which is why they have not disappeared from the genetic code andare often overlooked as “junk” DNA, a designation that has been challenged oflate. According to Grant, cited below, these genetic anomalies may already bemanifesting and may have been switched on through the rituals of Crowley, JackParsons, and others beginning in the early-to-mid twentieth century."},{"pageContent":"DANGEROUS LIAISONSThere are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar tobeasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield theother.

Thebeasts indicated, also, another line of evolution which did not have itsbeginnings on earth.168 [part0010_split_005.html#aft168]It's necessary to understand Grant's insistence that the type of hideouscreatures of which Lovecraft writes so hauntingly only appear that way to theuninitiated “modern” eye. It follows that the methods employed to create thesehybrids would also seem “monstrous” to modern eyes, involving non-traditionalforms of sexual intercourse with non-traditional sexual partners innon-traditional contexts.The practices assumed under the umbrella designation of Tantra represent muchthat is non-traditional, and much that involves intercourse with non-humanbeings. I have written at length about Tantra elsewhere,169[part0010_split_005.html#aft169] but for now we can concentrate on those ritualsand concepts that preoccupy Grant in the Typhonian Trilogies, for these are therituals that have attracted so much interest and criticism.Throughout the Trilogies, Grant makes constant reference to Vama Marg or “lefthand” Tantric rituals, to the bodily fluids excreted by both the male and femalepractitioners, and to the importance of the menstrual cycle to the correctperformance of the rituals. He hints that these sexual rituals open gates toother dimensions, other pathways on the Tree of Life. He also emphasizes theneed for the participants to be adepts of a certain level: mastery of thepractices required by Crowley in his AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage[../images/00003.jpeg] is essential, such as pranayama and the other yogictechniques. Otherwise, instead of a ritual capable of causing changes to occurin the environment of the ritual operators all that is left is play-acting.Additionally, we may add the importance of timing.Traditionally, any type of ritual in Asian countries takes into account thecalendar and the astrological conditions, Auspicious times are chosen for eitherthe beginning of a ritual or for the central act of the ritual. This is the samein Western traditions as well, but the calendar used is normally an arbitraryone that does not take into consideration actual astronomical conditions. At thevery least, a lunar calendar is employed by the type of Tantric cults of whichGrant writes. As in the Necronomicon, stellar positioning is not a mere gesturebut is critical to the success of the operation. This is not astrology per se;the heavens are a vast clockwork when viewed from the earth, and the planetshave greater and lesser distances from the earth depending on their locations asseen against the backdrop of the Zodiac. The stars themselves rise and set atcertain times and the circumpolar stars (which never rise or set) revolve aroundthe Pole Star and occupy different positions relative to an observer on theearth according to the day, hour and season. Sensitivity to these issuesinvolves the magician in the macrocosm: it forces the magician to be aware ofhis or her role and position within the larger universe (a breathing and livingorganism from the point of view of magic, with obvious parallels and analoguesto the human organism; to the Tantrika, the universe is the body of theGoddess). This sensitivity is translated back into the microcosm as the ritualprogresses, in accord with the ancient Hermetic axiom: “As above, so below.”As Grant writes:It is therefore possible to equate the force-fields (the Kundalini in thechakras) with planetary and stellar powers.... It is possible to draw offstellar or transmundane energy by using the human organism as a condenser. Thisis achieved by tapping the appropriate power-zone, after Kundalini has animatedand magnetized it.170 [part0010_split_005.html#aft170]With this in mind, let us take a look at the form of the central rite in Grant'swork."},{"pageContent":"TANTRA IN THEORY AND PRACTICEThe coven of thirteen represents the true chakra or Kaula Circle.171[part0010_split_005.html#aft171]The Kaula Circle is legendary among afficionadoes of Tantric traditions. It isthe one most referenced when the more exotic forms of Tantra are mentioned, suchas worshipping in cemeteries or having ritual sexual intercourse in a group. Infact, the word kaula means a “group” or a “family” or a “clan,” and it refers tothe group of initiates who are led by a guru or teacher. When Lovecraft writesabout groups of people having orgies in the swamps outside New Orleans as partof a religious ritual in “The Call of Cthulhu,” he could as easily have beenreferring to popular notions concerning the Kaulas.The approach of the Kaulas—and related Tantric groups such as the NathSiddhis—towards the human body, sexuality, and even bodily excretions of alltypes is a positive one: to the Kaula Tantrika, nothing is disgusting or obscenein-and-of-itself. It is the level of awareness in an unadvanced Tantrika thatcategorizes something as hideous or ugly. In this type of Tantra, nothing can beconsidered filthy; it is only our attitude towards certain objects or ideas thatmakes them seem filthy. Thus, nothing is forbidden: no action, no idea, nosubstance. However, that does not mean that the Kaula initiate may act freely.The authority of a guru is necessary for the Kaula circle to function, for theguru has the technical knowledge as well as the experience and the disciplinenecessary to lead the group. While nothing is ugly or forbidden among theKaulas, the individual members must go through training and preparation beforethe most infamous of the Tantric rituals—the pancatattva or ritual of the fivesubstances—can be performed.The Pancatattva is also known as the “ritual of the five M's.” One importantaspect of the rite is the breaking of the Vedic tabus, one by one, whichinvolves eating and drinking various forbidden substances (such as wine) whichall begin with the letter “M” in Sanskrit, leading up to the fifth M whichstands for maithuna or the “embrace,” a euphemism for sexual intercourse.The Kaula circle may have only one male-female couple engage in maithuna as partof the ritual: two people who have gone through sufficient initiations andritual preparation to enable them to embody the deities, Shiva and Shakti, orthere may be multiple couples depending on the circle and its guru. Shiva andShakti are the archetypal deities of Tantra, and there are Shiva Tantras andShakti Tantras depending on whether the focus is on the male aspect—Shiva—or thefemale aspect—Shakti. Shakti represents power, and the word is sometimes used asa synonym for the feminine aspect of power such as when a particular god is saidto “have his Shakti” or is “provided with his Shakti.” The female partner in aKaula circle will represent Shakti just as the male will represent Shiva. Shivacould be said to represent potential energy and Shakti, kinetic energy or theenergy of motion.The Goddess Kundalini, said to reside at the base of the human spine, may alsobe referred to as Shakti. When Kundalini is raised correctly it will reach thecranial vault where Shiva is believed to reside in solitude. WhenKundalini/Shakti meets Shiva in this “chamber” they are said to be in maritalembrace. This can be viewed as the Tantric version of the Alchemical Wedding orthe Gnostic Marriage. It even has analogues with the concept of the Shekinahreaching upwards from Malkuth to attain union with the Divine in Kether and thusredeem all of Creation.But before Kundalini can reach her Beloved Shiva she must pass through sevengates or power-zones kmown as chakras, or wheels. (The Kaula Circle is calledKaula chakra.) These are found in the body, ranging from the base of the spineor the muladhara chakra, to the groin, the stomach, the heart, the neck, thehead (at a spot between and behind the eyes) and finally to the last and seventhchakra which is the “thousand-petalled lotus” at the very top of the head which,when opened, rains down the elixir of life—the amrita (a Sanskrit word thatmeans “deathless”)—into the body. It would be a mistake to localize thesechakras as actual bundles of nerves or other physical attributes, for they arebelieved to reside in the ethereal, or subtle, body. If one imagines there is akind of electromagnetic field surrounding the body, then the chakras would befound there rather than in the body itself. However, the result of awakeningthese chakras is a physical as well as an emotional or psychological sensation.This idea of the chakras and their individual awakenings is central to therituals described by Kenneth Grant. He places great emphasis on the necessityfor the magician to manipulate the energy passing through the chakras of thepriestess, for instance. Each of the seven chakras possesses a different set ofatttributes and siddhis, or occult powers, and it is up to the Thelemic magicianto understand these powers and to be able to “switch on” those required by anyspecific ritual.According to Grant's understanding of the ritual, as the chakra in the femalemagician has been “activated” her entire body undergoes a subtle change. It isthought that the excitation of a specific chakra will trigger the release intothe bloodstream of a specific hormone from one of the glands associated withthat chakra. This will, in turn, affect the characteristics of her bodilysecretions, which are then collected by the magician for use in this—oranother—ritual.How this is done, and the steps to be taken to effect these changes, is thesubject addressed in the following pages. While Grant utilizes many Sanskrit andother terms in his descriptions of the magical rituals he and his group employedin London in the 1950s and 1960s, some of what he describes may be unfamiliar tothose already schooled in Tantra, even of the Kaula or Nath variety. It is to beunderstood that Tantric rituals and concepts were incorporated by Grant into aWestern-style ceremonial magic system already developed by Kabbalists and thoseinterested in Egyptian religion, etc. He never claimed to be a Tantric adepthimself, and he shamelessly used whatever Tantric techniques and ideas came hisway in his own form of bricolage. Then, as his group progressed even further,Lovecraftian concepts were added to the mix: a step which would, of course, bewholly objectionable to orthodox Tantrikas. Thus, just as Crowley cannot be usedas a source for Egyptian religion, Kenneth Grant cannot be referenced as asource for Tantra. However, his contribution to the field of Western magic andparticularly Thelema is not appreciated until one realizes that Grant did moreto explain Tantric principles and rituals than any other Western occultist tothat point, and to show how important they were towards a deeper understandingof Thelema. Today, we have an embarrassment of riches where translations ofTantric texts are concerned, and many knowledgeable scholars in the field whoare excellent sources for more solid information. Grant, however, gives usTantra within the context of Thelema and Western ceremonial magic—something theacademics are not, as yet, able to do with any degree of authority.One further note on the chakras:The alert reader will have noticed that there are seven chakras (traditionally;some texts and practitioners claim fewer or greater as the case may be). Theseseven are approached, one by one, in an ascent up the human body from the baseof the spine to the top of the head. This is obviously analogous to the“stairway to heaven” as represented in the Egyptian Pyramid Texts, Sumerian andBabylonian religion, the ascent literature of Jewish mysticism, shamanisticascents, the “Walking” ritual of the Necronomicon, etc. It is also analogous tothe Chinese system of “walking” on the seven stars of the Big Dipper (part ofthe Great Bear constellation). These are all cognate ideas that representsomething basic and central to the human condition where spiritual evolution andthe quest for immortality is concerned. What the concept of Kundalini—and theGrant systems of magic associated with it—offers us is the ability tore-interpret these magical and mystical systems as taking place within theconfines of our own, individual bodies.The seven stars of the Dipper are thus within us as the seven chakras, just asthe seven “planets” are present as the chakras, and the seven chariots inmerkavah mysticism. The genius of Crowley (and later Grant) was in identifyingthese analogues and realizing that they represented something tangible and real:secret knowledge and a workable technique for attaining that knowledge. Andwhile traditional Kundalini yoga is an internal practice, Crowley and Grantexternalized the process so that it became possible to engage in the practice ingroups such as the OTO and other occult cells or—as Grant callsthem—“power-zones” of dedicated adepts scattered across the earth (like chakrasin the body of the priestess). The Gnostic Mass, for instance, is just such anexternalization of the process of Kundalini yoga and in the hands of genuineadepts can become a powerful engine of spiritual transformation or, as Lovecraftwould have it, a terrible device for summoning hideous creatures to visibleappearance.Only when mind and body are thus in accord, and when the mind concentrates theimage or “child” that the body is to bear, is an act of magical creationpossible. This child is rarely a human child, but it is physical in the sensethat it influences the material plane.172 [part0010_split_005.html#aft172]In Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God—only the second of the nine volumes thatcomprise the Typhonian Trilogies—Grant lays out the general program of theritual, in the chapter entitled “Dream Control by Sexual Magick.” While manyvariations on this ritual appear in his later works, the basic format is the oneto be found here.He first introduces three states of consciousness, the dream state, thedreamless state, and the waking state. Later, he will identify the dream stateas being analogous to the Mauve Zone: an intermediary state between that ofwaking and deep, dreamless sleep. Grant claims that all activity has its originin the dream state, whether the activity is conscious and willed or instinctualand reactive. The dream state is the plane on which both mental and astralactivity takes place. It is also, remember, the state in which—according toLovecraft—the High Priest Cthulhu communicates with his followers. In the Grantsystem, this is not a purely fictional device.Grant credits the German occultist Eugen Grosche (“Frater Saturnus”) with havingdiscovered part of the secret of using sexual ritual to induce a trance thatwould provide an entrance to the same state as that experienced in dreams, withthe obvious advantage that one can then control the dream. This is done by themale magician—in this case—making the equivalent of mesmeric passes over afemale priestess in a state of sexual excitement with the goal of accumulatingand then collecting her heavily charged secretions.173[part0010_split_005.html#aft173] Grant expanded on this technique considerably,aided by his receipt of important Tantric texts from mysterious sources andthrough his own study and practice leading the Nu-Isis Lodge.There are a few Tantric terms it would be wise to introduce at this point sincethey will come up frequently in discussions of Grant's sexual magic.The first is prana. This means “breath” and is the basis for the term pranayama,which is a form of breath control. As mentioned previously, breathing is one ofthe bodily functions that occurs automatically: we don't have to remember tobreathe, and can breathe in our sleep. But conscious control of breathing iseasy, and it is the gateway to control over other the autonomic functions whichthen gives us a degree of control over the reptilian brain, the part ofourselves that is easily more than 500 million years old and which is thephysical pathway to the unconscious mind.The second important term is kala. In Grant's usage the kalas are units of timeand refer specifically to the days of the menstrual cycle and to the “essences”that are secreted on each of those days. Each day of the lunar (and menstrual)fortnight has its own kala, and each kala is different from every other incertain ways. There are fourteen or fifteen kalas, depending on how they aredefined and divided. The fifteenth kala is sometimes considered the day when themenstrual flow begins, or the day of the heaviest menstrual flow. Theassociation of the lunar calendar with the menstrual cycle and, in particular.with the onset of the menstrual flow gave rise to the concept of the GoddessFifteen, which is one way of referring to Kali, the Bloody Goddess who is oftenthought of as an avatar of Shakti. The Goddess Fifteen is also analogous to theScarlet Woman, for obvious reasons.However, one form of the word kala symbolically represents the number sixteen,and the sixteenth kala is considered a great secret and the sum total of thevalues of the other fifteen. Sixteen is also the number of vowels (known as thematrikas or “little mothers”) in the Sanskrit alphabet and they are used alongwith the consonants to form the all-important Sri Cakra (a diagram of manyinterlocking triangles, very popular in Indian religion and Tantra) to whichGrant also refers—as it is a map of the power-zones with which he is mostconcerned. (See page 259.)There is a lot of confusion over the word kala, for depending on how it iswritten, it may refer to a unit of time (as we have seen) but also the numbersixteen, and is related to ideas about the goddess Kali and even the demon Kali.In a system of transliteration used by many scholars today, the word kAla means“black” and also “death,” while the word kalA means “menstrual discharge,” andthe word kala means “semen.” KalA also means one-sixteenth of the moon'sdiameter which thus gives us the kalas as understood by Grant, and kAla gives usthe planet Saturn. While a Sanskrit scholar will be aware of these differencesand not confuse or conflate them, Grant uses the phonetic similarities betweenthese words the same way he uses gematria and other word-play in his writings,to show deeper connections where a scholar would most likely object. (Imagineequating the words “week” and “weak” because of their homophony, or “feet” and“feat.” To an English-speaking person, such an equivalence is ridiculous, yetthere is evidence of this type of cavalier approach in many of Grant's works, ofwhich equating kAla and kalA are just one example. To give him credit, he doesadmit that this is more in the line of stream-of-consciousness analysis than aliteral Kabbalistic approach.) Yet, even in this short list of possible meaningsfor the phoneme “kala” we have ideas that are related in Grant's thesis: black,death, menstrual discharge, semen, a unit of time, and a sixteenth of the moon'sdiameter, as well as Saturn (planetary representative of the Dark Lord) itself.The appearance of Saturn in this list is interesting because the Greek word forSaturn is Chronos, from which we get the word for “time” such as in“chronology.” Thus Saturn and time are linked in English, and Saturn and timeare linked in Sanskrit as well. Whether this is reason enough to use Grant'smethod is debatable, however.There are many variations in the kalas (as vaginal discharges) depending on therelationship between the actual lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle of thepriestess. In addition, the secretion of specific hormones from specific glandsduring the ritual will influence the quality of the kalas. Thus, the body of thepriestess is a kind of laboratory and when the priestess has herself attainedmore advanced levels of initiation then she becomes both a laboratory and atemple: the biological functions have psycho-spiritual analogues which are under(conscious or unconscious) control of the priestess during the rituals; i.e.,the priestess may be in a trance at the time of the ritual, and utteringoracular statements all the while, but her training and initiation have givenher the ability to respond appropriately—even instinctively—to the magician orpriest who is performing it. We will return to the concept of the kalas as weexamine the ritual itself.The next term which comes up frequently in Grant's work is ojas. In Sanskrit itmeans vigor, strength, power, energy, light, and related ideas.174[part0010_split_005.html#aft174] Grant uses it in the sense of magical energy,and ojas may be thought of as the natural result of properly charging the kalasduring the ritual. The kalas by themselves are considered magically inert untilthey have been subjected to the ritual attention of the priest. Once they havebeen successfully charged, they are then carriers of the ojas, or magicalenergy. The normal menstrual cycle (i.e., the kalas in their normal physicalstate) is linked to normal human reproduction, but when the kalas have beencharged then the possibility of super-human reproduction has been attained.The term mudra is also important in yoga and in Tantra. Mudra means “seal” andis a gesture, a sign made with the hands and fingers in different positions(similar to asanas, which are positions involving the entire body). Thesegestures “seal” openings in the subtle body, as well as transmit information toothers. Each mudra has a specific characteristic attributed to it, a powerinherent in the positioning of the fingers and the palm. We are familiar withWestern forms of the mudra, such as holding one's hand with the palm out,signifying “stop,” or with both hands held up with empty palms signifying“surrender.” In yoga, the mudras have similar associations but all on thespiritual level rather than the secular one. One mudra may mean the union ofmale and female, for instance, while another mudra indicates the outpouring ofblessings. And while the positioning of hands in Western culture carriesinformation only, in yoga and in Tantra the mudras are themselves not onlycarriers of data but are also carriers of magical power. A mudra performed theright way can be imbued with force by the Tantrika so that it functions much asthe magical gestures of fictional sorcerers and magicians. A mudra also forcesthe practitioner to be acutely aware of the force being generated as the awkwardpositions of the hands communicate a level of stress back to the initiate whichreinforces the original intent. In Grant's work, the Mahamudra—or “GreatMudra”—is represented by the Stele of Revealing: the Goddess Nuit arched overthe earth which he sees as the Thelemic counterpart to the Kailasha Prastara, orthe sexual position in which the woman is over the man.175[part0010_split_005.html#aft175] This position is analogous to that usuallyshown in icons of the Goddess Kali who stands upon the corpse-like body ofShiva; this is the depiction of Shakti—of feminine Power—in its most blatant andextreme form, and is also a warning to those who desire to practice the rite weare discussing without being fully prepared, for the Shakti can becomeunmanageable and wild in inexpert hands. This is also the position mosteffective for the collection of the kalas from the genital outlet of thepriestess, a topic to which we will return shortly.The asana is a yogic position which places a degree of stress on the human body,again forcing concentration but also manipulating the body in such a way as toactivate certain of its subtle centers, its chakras. Asanas are used inmeditation, and are also used in such practices as Kundalini yoga or hatha yogain which the body is contorted through different levels of difficulty whichresults in the yogin becoming aware of the inner workings of the body and theinterrelationships that exist between different parts of the outer and innercorpus. They also impact the autonomic nervous system, especially when pairedwith pranayama exercises and the recitation of mantras, and facilitate higherstates of spiritual and psycho-sexual awareness.Prana as already mentioned is usually translated as “breath” but in Tantra thereare multiple pranas. Normally when speaking of bodily functions the Tantrika isnot referring to those with which we are familiar, the visible emblems of thesefunctions, but with their subtler aspects. Thus, prana is not simply “breath”the way we understand it, but subtler aspects of the same. There are at leastfive “breaths” or five pranas recognized in yoga and Tantra: prana is the breathof inhalation, the breath that nourishes life, and enters through the nostrils;udana is the exhalation, most noticeable in the act of speech; samana is thebreath that aids digestion; apana is the breath involved in peristalsis andexcretion; and finally vyana is the breath that moves internally through thebody and which stimulates motion and movement of the body through space.Mantras are syllables or words that have specific associations with deities orspiritual qualities. They can be as short as a single syllable (a bija or seedmantra) or as long as a sentence or a verse. Their value lies in themanipulation of sound.Sound is vibration, and different mantras—because of different combinations ofvowels and consonants—vibrate at different rates when spoken, and these levelscan be adjusted through the use of volume and pitch. They also help to quiet themind by replacing chaotic inner voices and random thoughts with a string ofseemingly meaningless syllables, thus essentially short-circuiting the languagecenters of the brain.Mantras, asanas and mudras, and pranayama all are designed to counteract thenormal functions of the mind and the body. Obviously, occultism is not aboutreinforcing our basic instincts for survival, but in violating them as much aspossible without actually damaging either the mind or the body, stretching thecapabilities of both in ways that are initially uncomfortable and unnatural butwhich in the end open the doors of perception.We have presented the basic Sanskrit terms and concepts that are used quitefreely by Grant in virtually every volume of the Trilogies. There are many more,as well as references to specific Tantric texts, but we will not list them allhere. Rather, as we come to a relevant citation we will pause to ensure that thereader is completely informed ... or as informed as possible under thecircumstances. In order to read Crowley, one should have a good generaleducation in Kabbalah, Egyptian religion, and the Golden Dawn system ofinitiation; to read Grant, one needs all of that plus a deep background inIndian religion, especially Tantra, some Afro-Caribbean concepts and terms, andof course the basic reading in Lovecraft's ouevre. It is a daunting task for thegeneral reader, to be sure, and it is hoped that this study will facilitategreater understanding of the writings of this important occult author as well asencourage wider reading in the topics covered."},{"pageContent":"THE COLLECTION OF THE KALASIt should be noted that Grant's preoccupation is with the magical aspect ofTantra. Even though he does acknowledge its basic theological premises and theHindu and Buddhist formulas for withdrawing from the world of illusion to attainthe ultimate level of enlightenment, he is still quite distracted by thepractical uses to which Tantric principles may be applied. This is due at leastpartly to his Thelemic allegiance, otherwise why not simply become a Tantrikaand abandon Thelema (and by extension Western occultism) entirely? Tantrarepresents a collection of texts, practices, and a peculiar worldview; Thelemaon the other hand pretends to be a global spiritual movement with the aim ofliberating all peoples in the New Aeon. The pursuit of Tantra is a highlyindividual one, even though small groups may be involved. The pursuit ofThelema, on the other hand, requires a broader social perspective. Grant, asmuch as he admires Tantra, still sees it as a tool—among many in the Thelemicworkshop. He interprets much of Thelema in Tantric terms and this may be becauseat times he sees Thelema as a “Tantra for the West,” and at other times hesenses that both disciplines are discussing the same basic principles and hecannot resist pursuing those links and associations as deeply as possiblebecause the one may help explain the other ... or enrich the other through theadditional correspondences. In other words, he must find Tantra lacking insomething, a something that Thelema can provide.It is certain that Tantra is Indo-centric. All the terminology and referencesare to Indian religion, culture and language and require a knowledge of what ispopularly known as Hinduism, and Buddhism. This would be ideologicallyunpalatable to a follower of Thelema who may recognize—intellectually—thecontributions of the sub-continent to world religions but who would reject Hinduand Buddhist belief systems.Thus, Grant's project is to strip away as much of the Indian component of Tantraas he is able and to replace it with Western occult and magical references. (Itis a re-interpretation of Tantra, which is why it would be rejected by Tantrikasin Asia and most likely by Tantra scholars in the West.) In order to accomplishthis, Grant needs to look at the technology of Tantra—the rituals themselves—andpeel away the objectionable theology as much as possible. What he is left withshould be a system of universal applicability, interpreted within the Thelemiccontext. And this, of course, is feasible.In recent years this approach has been made somewhat easier by the works ofscholars in Jewish mysticism and alchemy who have speculated that Tantra mayvery well be the fons et origo of the Sepher ha-Zohar, for instance, and who useTantric references to help expand upon Kabbalistic and alchemical themes.In addition, Tantra has always been a controversial field and even thedefinition of Tantra eludes most scholars, Asian and Western, so an eccentricBritish magician's point of view may be as legitimate as anyone else's.That said, we will now look at how Grant understands the intensely sexualrituals he describes in the Trilogies. We will take as our starting point andtemplate the brief description of those rituals he provides in Aleister Crowleyand the Hidden God.This basic form can be characterized as an initiated version of Crowley'sGnostic Mass. It involves a priest and priestess, or a magician and a “witch”(in the popular, not the Wiccan, sense). There may be others in attendance, butthe prime operators are a male and a female couple.The goal of the ritual is the collection of kalas, the magically-charged vaginalsecretions of the female partner before they become ojas. We will ignore for themoment the timing issue, as it is a bit complex, but will return to it later on.There is also a appended to this volume a list of the kalas—as lunar digits—andtheir associated characteristics (probably the first time this has beenpresented to a Western, occult-oriented readership).The priestess should be an initiate capable of raising Kundalini. That does notmean that she should be able to raise it perfectly through all six chakras toreside in the seventh, but she should be capable of stimulating the rise ofKundalini to a certain level. The priest may assist in helping her raise it tohigher and higher chakras during the ritual, but only as long as there is nodanger to the priestess.The intention of the ritual must be clear from the outset, plainly stated sothat all participants are in agreement. This must reflect an act of will fromall parties, otherwise the ritual degenerates into a form of “vampirism” withthe magician using the priestess for his own ends, or vice versa.In the Thelemic context we have been discussing, the ritual space must becreated according to the understanding of the magician, perhaps using the StarSapphire or Star Ruby rituals to cast a circle: a sacred space, a chakra. Thedesign of the altar and the space may be purely Thelemic, or it may alsoincorporate Tantric elements such as the Sri Chakra which representsinterlocking power-zones based on triangles, the letters of the Sanskritalphabet, etc. and is a form of the yoni—or vulva—of the Goddess.Perfumes should be chosen with care, to reflect the nature of the ritual.Lighting should also be carefully designed before hand. It is common in Westernceremonial magic to use candles of a certain number, a certain color, etc. andthis may be employed. Or oil lamps may be used instead.The altar should be provided with a mat or some soft covering for that is wherethe priestess will be located during the most intense portions of the ritual.The altar should face the north, or the head of the priestess should be in thenorth, for that is from where the amrita will descend. This is especially so ifthe ritual is being performed at midnight on the night of the Full Moon, for atthat time the Moon is directly overhead (i.e. in the south) and the Sun will bedirectly opposite, in the north. In the case of Tantra, and the collection ofamrita, the Moon is male and the Full Moon is full of the nectar of immortality(the semen of the God Chandra), and the Sun is female, red and pulsing with heatand fire. If it is desired to incorporate Lovecraftian elements in the ritual(as Grant's cultus was known to do) then the appropriate times may be chosenaccording to the position of the Big Dipper, but always with further referenceto the position and the quarter of the Moon.The deities should be invoked into the priest and priestess, so that theyidentify with their respective godforms. They may partake of alcohol at thistime, both in homage to the original pancatattva ritual of the Kaula Circles butalso because this was a method Crowley also used in order to release inhibitionsin his assistants. Naturally, only a sip of alcohol should be employed.The central part of the ritual now takes place, which involves the priestessraising Kundalini. According to Grant, this transpires as she is being sexuallyaroused by the magician who is performing certain mudras over her body, notnecessarily touching her but making passes directly over her erogenous zones(with a wand or with his hands) and raising her to a fever pitch. The goal ofthis process is to activate Kundalini, to raise it gradually to the higherchakras so that they may be “burned” by the power of the Serpent Goddess andthus release their potencies into the bloodstream of the priestess. Thesechakras should have been previously opened by the priestess through Kundaliniyoga or some other technique, otherwise opening them for the first time this waycan be dangerous to her. The magician should bring the priestess to the point oforgasm, but stop just before orgasm is reached. The magician may have sexualintercourse with the priestess if it is considered necessary to bring thepriestess to the desired pitch of excitement, but neither priest not priestessshould achieve orgasm at this point because it is premature to “ground” or“earth” the energy before it has been fully utilized. (This is incontradistinction to much normative Tantra which requires the orgasms of bothparties and even the ejaculation of the male in order for the rite to be“perfect.”) It is necessary that there is a flow of secretions from the femalegenital outlet. These kalas will be collected by the magician—either orally, asin cunnilingus, if the intention is to increase the occult power of the magicianor to bring him into contact with supramundane forces, etc.; or on a speciallyconstructed talisman of metal or parchment, or on the leaf of a sacred plant, orsome other way if the intention is to store it for future use. The magician willthen energize them magically so that they become ojas.In an operation described in Beyond the Mauve Zone, the magician can also usedisks of some metal, placed ove the chakras of the priestess in order to becomemagnetically charged by the ritual. This occurs as an operation of what Grantcalls “stellar magic” and involves the sixth, or ajna, chakra. The idea is tocharge this chakra—what Grant calls the “sixth power-zone”—so that itmagnetically attracts the Fire Snake, causing it to rise from the muladharachakra up the sushumna (the “middle pillar” of the body) to reach the ajnachakra. The metal disks collect the ojas that are generated this way and arethen kept in a closed jar for later use, when they may be drenched in the kalasof the priestess to activate them further.What is the goal of this type of magical ritual? A predictably Lovecraftian one:In due course is born a being that is adapted perfectly to existence on a chosenstar.176 [part0010_split_005.html#aft176]This is an extremely delicate operation. If either the priest or the priestessbecomes distracted by lust and by the need to satisfy themselves in orgasm aheadof time then concentration has been lost and the rite loses all its efficacy.The kalas become “earthed” in their usual way, and all that is left is twopersons having sexual intercourse. That both participants remain in a heightenedstate of concentration and focus is critical to the success of the ritual. Fromthe magical point of view, there is nothing particularly powerful in semen andvaginal secretions if they have not been charged previous to being released. Theobject is not to create a human child (most people can manage that), butsomething else entirely (as the above quotation from Grant illustrates).As we have seen, the Valentinians concentrated on the Divine during sex so thatthey would produce Divine offspring. The method seems strangely similar. OldWhateley was concentrating on incarnating one of the Old Ones on earth.Crowley's quasi-fictional magicians in his most famous novel were pretending tocreate a Moonchild. Magic is the creation of forms, of illusions, of whole newrealities. In Tibetan shamanism, this is known as creating tulpas: homunculidesigned for specific purposes, as was most famously recounted by AlexandraDavid-Neel. And in Jewish mysticism, we have the Golem.Thus, what is needed is not two sexually-active people who will have intercoursesurrounded by weird diagrams and sandalwood incense. Instead, we need twointelligent and mature—and dedicated—magicians who will push the envelope ofsensation as far as it will go, realizing that their sexual energy is more thana metaphor for the primal act of creation—and that it contains power of anincredible nature if taken beyond the normal methods required for humanreproduction.This brings us to the question of initiation. In the Shakta tradition, thefemale is the more important partner and the emphasis is placed on hersecretions. Tantra in this tradition is a very refined, very highly-articulatedform of Goddess worship. Women can initiate men into this tradition, which isthe reverse of what even Crowley would approve. At the same time, the selectionof the appropriate partner was an all-consuming endeavor for Crowley and he wentthrough many women in his quest for the perfect soror mystica, or “sister of themysteries,” probably due to his reluctance to take women seriously as advancedadepts. To many Tantrikas, the female kalas are the focus of the rites and theyoni—the vulva—is the object of veneration.The reverse is obviously true for those who favor the Shaivite tradition whichelevates the male principle above the female. However, the solution to thisproblem—as Grant rightly points out177 [part0010_split_005.html#aft177]—is thefact that Crowley's New Aeon is the Aeon of the Child: the offspring of the twoprinciples of male and female, of Shiva and Shakti. The Child partakes of thecombined essences and natures of each and represents a new focus, a newparadigm, for not only magic but for the social order in general. It is, infact, this Magickal Childe that troubles Lovecraft so much that he castigatesthe concept as the deformed and dangerous creature conceived by poor LaviniaWhateley, but it is nevertheless the focus (expressed or implied) of all NewAeon magical ritual.Thus, in this case, the kalas are not the only important secretion as theseminal fluid of the magician is also required to effect the “magical birth.”This substance is to be charged just as carefully as the kalas in order to beeffective, which requires the magician to practice a form of seminal retentionand “recirculation.” Like the priestess, he must postpone or completely avoidorgasm in order not to “earth” the fluid before it has been charged. He mustpractice raising Kundalini and sealing the chakras in the same manner as thepriestess. In many Tantric traditions it is completely unnecessary (and moreoverundesirable) for the male practitioner to achieve orgasm, and especiallyforbidden for him to ejaculate and thus waste the seminal fluid and itsassociated subtle essence. Such methods as that known as karezza were employedto keep the male Tantrika in a constant state of sexual excitement and arousalduring the ritual. If ejaculation did take place, there were methods forlimiting the damage.One to which Grant refers is the practice known as the vajroli mudra, which is away of halting ejaculation in pre- or mid-ejaculation. This involves a greatdeal of preliminary work in contracting the urethral sphincter (a practice whichis also beneficial in curing premature ejaculation). Advanced practitioners aresaid to be able to use this method to “vacuum” ejaculated semen from the vaginaback into the penis where its subtle essence can be drawn up the spine and tothe cranial vault as the Kundalini rises. The Shiva Samhita—a venerable Tantrictext which discusses the vajroli mudra—claims that the loss of semen leads todeath and that the Tantrika should never lose his semen under any circumstances.Other Tantric texts are more lenient, but insist that it takes at least afortnight to replace the semen expended in an act of sexual intercourse andenormous quantities of food to produce even a single gram of the substance. Themention of a fortnight in this regard is due to the lunar association onceagain, for the Moon is restored—i.e., the semen of the Moon is replaced—over afourteen-day period from New Moon to Full Moon.As David Gordon White points out:... semen is the raw material and fuel of every psychochemical transformationthe yogin, alchemist, or Tantric practitioner undergoes, transformations throughwhich a new, superhuman and immortal body is “conceived” out of the husk of themortal, conditioned, biological body.178 [part0010_split_005.html#aft178]To Crowley and his system, the semen is just as important to the creation of theElixir—the amrita or nectar of immortality—as the female kalas. Indeed, it isthe combination of the two that is required and this would seem to be consistentwith European alchemical traditions as well. Obviously, in order to produce themagical offspring we have been discussing at length there must be a contributionfrom both partners, either in the “earthed” physical sense or in the occult,astral sense. As the emphasis in the New Aeon is said to have switched from thepure male-female (Shiva-Shakti) polarity of the old Aeons to their product as adivine offspring, this would seem to make sense and would require the use ofsuch new “grimoires” as the Crowleyan Book of the Law as well as some of thereceived texts published in Grant's works.To the magician, the priestess is no longer the priestess. She is a goddess, aScarlet Woman, a Shakti. To the priestess, the magician is no longer someone sheknows in the “real” world, but a god, a Beast, a Shiva. They are drawing downthe powers that existed since the Creation—the aptly-named Big Bang—byidentifying themselves with the forces that started it all (like Clement'slust-crazed Carpocrations). They are traveling along the 500 million years oftheir reptilian brains to enter a space and time that is otherwise unknowable byliving, breathing human beings ... and they are going further and farther thanthat.And as they do so, their physical bodies undergo transformative changes. Thesechanges begin with the secretion of glandular substances into the bloodstream sothat their breath, their saliva, their perspiration, their seminal and vaginalfluids vibrate with this new life, this new potency.At the same time, visions are obtained. One of the effects of this type ofritual is that such intensive concentration during a time of sexual arousalleads to a tremendous amount of psychic stress. The body is used to releasingitself in orgasm and ejaculation. If this normal pathway isblocked—“sealed”—through mental control and focus, then the body reacts in sucha way that it seeks alternate pathways, thus opening a Gate that is normallyclosed.A slight shift of focus will result in a shift of vision, of waking trance. Ifthe goal was to open a Gate, and the focus of both parties is maintained on thisgoal, then a Gate will open. The power of the unreleased sexual energy will seeto it; and the kalas that are secreted at this time will enable the operators tomore easily open the Gate at a future time.It is to increase the psycho-sexual tension that the Necronomicon itself states:Know that thou must keep purified for the space of one moon for the Entrance tothe first Step, one moon between the First and the Second Step, and againbetween the Second and the Third, and so on in like manner. Thou must abstainfrom spilling thy seed in any manner for like period of time, but thou mayestworship at the Temple of ISHTAR, provided thou lose not thine Essence. And thisis a great secret.179 [part0010_split_005.html#aft179]The reference to the Temple of Ishtar may be an allusion to temple prostitution,and the provision that one not lose their Essence should be self-explanatory bynow. Prostitutes are not anathema to the Tantrika; far from it. As we alreadyknow, Crowley's soror mystica was known as the Scarlet Woman or the Whore ofBabalon. To the Tantrika, nothing is ugly or hideous or forbidden, thusprostitutes (proscribed by society even as they are secretly tolerated) are asmuch representatives of the Goddess as any other woman.The lunar periods are important here, just as they are in Tantric practice. Theapplication is different, of course. The basic theme of the Necronomicon systemknown as “the Walking” is celestial ascent; at the same time, there is a levelof paranoia concerning evil spirits and the evil cults that worship them.Opening the celestial Gates during the Walking is a core element of the processand it shares much in common with the Chinese magical system known as the Paceof Yü which involves proceeding up the seven stars of the Big Dipper, “opening”each of these astral gates along the way. The Walking can be interpreted fromthe point of view of raising Kundalini up the path of the chakras ... and ofcourse the Tantric process can be interpreted in terms of the Walking. It shouldbe remembered that these seemingly different systems are analogues of eachother; that the language used to describe one system is essentially the same asthe language used to describe the other.The goal of celestial ascent traditions as well as the raising of Kundalini inyoga and Tantric traditions is the same: to approach a secret or hidden chamberfrom which immortality can be attained. In celestial ascent literature this isnormally viewed as a temple or palace at the top of a ladder of lights—stars orplanets—in which God dwells. In the type of ritual traditions we have beendiscussing this chamber has a physical, microcosmic analogue: the cranial vault.Within the brain there is a space that is often referred to as the “bridalchamber.” It is in the region of the hypothalamus (the Greek word thalamos means“bed chamber”) located somewhat between—and behind—the eyes, what is popularlyknown as the “Third Eye.” This is the realm of Shiva in Indian tradition: it iswhere this iconic recluse and hermit waits in silent meditation until he isroused by his wife Parvati or Uma to take part in an extended session ofintercourse. It is at the culmination of this sexual embrace that Shiva's semenrains down as amrita: the elixir of immortality. This is sometimes described asthe crescent Moon overturning and spilling down the seed as a gentle butrejuvenating rain. In Kundalini terms, the Serpent Goddess is raised through thesix preliminary chakras to mate with Shiva in an embrace that triggers theopening of the seventh chakra at the crown of the head. In either case, theresult is the same: the flow of life-giving nectar begins at the top of the headand continues down through all the subtle pathways—the nadis—of the human body.This is the Alchemical Wedding and its result, the nectar of immortality andelixir vitae, is the Sixteenth Kala.While the sexual rite above described seems to focus exclusively on the male asthe active partner, this is not really or always the case. The priestess cancontrol the outcome of the ritual through her own powers of concentration andcontrol over the psycho-biological processes taking place in her body. As themagician manipulates her sexual response so that she is near orgasm, she canduplicate what the male Tantrika is able to do in similar circumstances:transfer the complex of sensations (visualized as Kundalini) from the groinlevel to the brain, i.e., from the muladhara chakra to the ajna chakra at thelevel of the Third Eye. This can be done in real physical terms—the way it istaught in Kundalini yoga—or it can be accomplished through visualization alone,which is the safer (although somewhat less powerful) route. The end-result ofthe ritual—whatever it may be—is visualized as taking place in the cranialvault, in the ajna chakra or the thalamus, the “bed chamber,” and it is therethat the Magickal Childe is conceived. The term Magickal Childe is used here torefer to the desired result of the operation—to charge a talisman, to obtainsecret information, etc. etc.—visualized as the offspring of the ritual. CertainChinese adepts use the same processes to create an immortal body, visualizedfirst in embryonic form extending from the crown of the head (and thus theseventh chakra) and then gradually becoming mature.180[part0010_split_005.html#aft180]Crowley was aware of the possibility of opening the spatial gateways and ofadmitting an extraterrestrial Current into the human life-wave. In Moonchild theincarnation was effected in and through the normal sexual formula, and althoughthe full impact of the moonchild's advent is not described, the reader is leftwith the impression that, whatever it may have been, it was some sort of amonster in human form endowed with superhuman powers. But no entity incarnatingvia the usual channels of sex, no physical intrusion of another dimension intothe ambience of humanity could possibly exercise power in any but a terrestrialsense. This is because the “power” has been earthed or enfleshed.181[part0010_split_005.html#aft181]The above statement by Grant eloquently sets forth the parameters of thesexo-magical rite, even to the extent of introducing the possibility that amonster with superhuman powers could be incarnated using these techniques. Healso reminds us that the usual channels of sex are not capable of introducingthe extraterrestrial Current into our own dimension. Control of the body'sautomatic sexual responses begins with control of the reptilian, or serpent,brain until the entire organism is an instrument to be played by the initiatedmagician. Once this occurs, according to Grant, the Gates may be opened and therealms beyond the visible, tangible, illusory world can be explored.And, as Lovecraft warns us, these same Gates, once opened, allow traffic in bothdirections.154 [part0010_split_000.html#ft154] April D.

And there a great tower of Black Basalt was raised, that was part of acastle whose further battlements reeled over the gulf of stars.—Jack Parsons, The Book of AntichristThen, presently, from the blind land behind the mountain, comes one heavy groan,then the sound of a fall, made vile by a titter of malignant tinkling laughter.There follow ghoulish wailings.The mystery, the evil darkness of these incoherent cries, sets my teeth on edgewith horror. And yet I cannot give up the hope which thrilled me at the Voice.But so keen, so desolate, so deadly, is the pain of my spirit that blankdarkness overwhelms me altogether.—Aleister Crowley, The Heart of the MasterIt seemed plain to us ... that there were ancient and elaborate alliancesbetween the hidden outer creatures and certain members of the human race. ...There seemed to be an awful, immemorial linkage in several definite stagesbetwixt man and nameless infinity. The blasphemies which appeared on earth, itwas hinted, came from the dark planet Yuggoth, at the rim of the solar system;but this was itself merely the populous outpost of a frightful interstellar racewhose ultimate source must lie far outside even the Einsteinian space-timecontinuum or greatest known cosmos.—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Whisperer in Darkness”Does this mean that those from Outside will actually put in an appearance onearth? If so, then the secret rites hinted at in grimoires such as theNecronomicon, and the Books of Thoth, of Dzyan, of Enoch, contain the keys totheir summoning and we have for long aeons been blind to their usage.—Kenneth Grant, Outside the Circles of TimeIN THE LATER VOLUMES OF the Typhonian Trilogies, Grant reprises the sexo-magicalrituals we have already described and demonstrates how they can be used topenetrate the veils that conceal from our sight the vast reaches of deep spaceand deep time. In fact, he cites other magicians who—he claims—have alreadypenetrated those veils and opened a hole in the earth's protective atmosphereallowing the entry of the Old Ones. In other words, they have opened a Gate.This dangerous process certainly was begun by Crowley, but later was amplifiedby his American follower Jack Parsons. Grant claims that the atomic explosionsof 1945 disturbed the delicate psychic membrane covering our planet to theextent that other forces began massing at the rent in the veil and by 1947 beganpouring through in greater and greater numbers. This, of course, was the UFOphenomenon which Grant links directly to the type of magical operations begun byCrowley and continued by his followers. This is a scenario straight out of H. P.Lovecraft and especially, “The Call of Cthulhu.”As always throughout this study, we have to remember that events that take placein the “real” world are mirrors of events that transpire in the inner,invisible, or secret world and that these two worlds influence each other inways that are not obvious to any but the most dedicated adept ... or mostparanoid conspiracy theorist. There is, in fact, little difference between theworld view of the occultist and the nagging fears of the conspiracy theorist;except that the occultist has a more positive approach to the same material,seeing in the activities of the sinister forces that influence world events (aswell as personal ones) the possibility of reversing the process through an actof will coupled with a knowledge of technique.It is this realm of the invisible world that occupies us in this chapter, for itis the backdrop against which all of the theory and practice takes place. In asense, we can call this world R'lyeh, to use Lovecraft's designation for thesecret city below the ocean waves where Cthulhu waits, dead but dreaming.But to Kenneth Grant, it is the Mauve Zone."},{"pageContent":"THE SRI CHAKRA... the Sri Chakra conceals in its symbolism more than the possibility of aliencontact, it conceals the keys to doors Outside.182[part0011_split_002.html#aft182]Grant's main focus where Tantra is concerned is the group of beliefs andpractices that come under the general rubric of Sri Vidya, with itsall-important Sri Chakra mandala. Grant claims that there is a surviving cult ofthe original Typhonian Tradition known as the Anuttara Amnaya, which justhappens to have the same initials as the secret society founded by AleisterCrowley, the Astrum Argenteum, or AImage [../images/00003.jpeg]AImage[../images/00003.jpeg] The Anuttara Amnaya is the repository, again according toGrant, of the true practices of the Sri Vidya cult which links it to the ancientand all-but-forgotten mysteries of the Great Old Ones.Before we go too deeply into the weeds of this concept, it is perhaps beneficialif we pull back a little and briefly describe the Sri Vidya cultus and identifythe Anuttara Amnaya as best we can.The word vidya has the same root as Veda, and means “knowledge.” The word Sri isused to mean “divine” or “sacred,” so Sri Vidya means, literally, the sacredknowledge. It is an early form of Tantra, one which several groups (includingthe Kaula sect) claim as their own lineage.Sri Vidya is also identified as the worship of Sri Devi, the great MotherGoddess, who in this system manifests as Lakshmi Tripura Sundari, or Lakshmi(“the Playful”) of the Three Cities. (The identity of the “three cities” issubject to controversy but may be identified assat-cit-ananda—Existence-Consciousness-Bliss—and in Grant's schema Consciousnessis identified as having three states: waking, sleeping and dreaming.) LakshmiTripura Sundari is usually depicted as a Red Goddess, a young girl of sixteenyears of age dressed completely in red and sitting on a red lotus throne,adorned by a single lunar digit, or kala. In this mode she is called Shodashi(“sixteen” as in “sixteen years old” but also clearly a reference to theSixteenth Kala) or even simply Bala (“young girl”). Her power is the power ofConsciousness itself, or Cit-Shakti. It is Lakshmi Tripura Sundari who isworshipped via the Sri Vidya cult's most famous emblem, the Sri Cakra which isher symbol and which represents the entire cosmos.The Anuttara Amnaya is one of six “subsidiary” vidyas of the Sri Vidyatradition. The word amnaya is related to agama, a word that can mean “religion”or a type of special knowledge that is handed down from generation togeneration, such as a “sacred tradition.” It is often used as a reference tosacred texts in general and to Tantra itself. The word anuttara is usuallytranslated as “highest” or “absolute.”183 [part0011_split_002.html#aft183] Thus,Anuttara Amnaya is the Highest Tradition or the Supreme Tantra. It does notrefer to a specific group of devotees or sect, but is usually used to identify aspecific set of Vidyas within the Sri Vidya tradition, a school of Tantra withits own mandala, teachings, etc. Followers of the Sri Vidya tradition may beinitiated (diksha) into one or all of the six amnayas, so that the AnuttaraAmnaya is really a school within the greater Sri Vidya tradition. Yet, AnuttaraAmnaya is also referred to as the “seat” of the Goddess Lakshmi Tripura Sundari:subtle, difficult of access, but a path above and beyond all others.Image [../images/00021.jpeg]The Sri Yantra or Sri Chakra is an ancient geometric depiction of the body ofthe Goddess.There is, however, a darker aspect to all of this and it involves Shiva in hisincarnation as Hatakeswara or Hatakeshvara. In this incarnation, Shiva is theruler of one of the seven infernal hells or Patala of Indian religion,specifically Vitala. The hells of Patala are inhabited by the Nagas (or serpentgods) as well as by the various Indian demons, such as the Yakshas. Yet, oddly,it is precisely Shiva in his form of Hatakeswara who rules Anuttara Amnaya andguarantees immediate enlightenment to its practitioners. According to theHatakeswara Stotra (a hymn to Hatakeswara), the Lords of Hell pour forth fromthe mouth of Shiva-Hatakeswara. Thus, in this manifestation, Shiva is nothingother than the Dark Lord himself and the ruler of Kenneth Grant's AnuttaraAmnaya cult ... and the Goddess of the Sri Vidya tradition is a form of theScarlet Woman, the Goddess Sixteen.Now for the weeds."},{"pageContent":"MARMAS, SANDHIS ... AND QLIPPOTThe Sri Chakra is a map similar in nature—if not design—to the Kabbalistic Treeof Life and perhaps related more closely to the Enochian Tablets as employed bythe Golden Dawn. It consists of nine large triangles—four pointing up, fivedown—superimposed on each other and thus making a total of 43 triangles and theintersection points (the marmas and sandhis) between them.184[part0011_split_002.html#aft184] Around these triangles are an eight-petaledlotus, a sixteen-petaled lotus, and three concentric circles around them. Aroundthat is often drawn a diagram representing four Gates in the four cardinaldirections. The Sri Chakra is an entire cosmological system but it is also thebody of the Goddess in schematic form. Although it is a two-dimensional figure—adrawing—it also has been made in three-dimensions: the only one of all theIndian chakras permitted to be constructed this way.The characterization of the Sri Chakra as the body of the Goddess is not an idleone. The marmas—the intersection points where triangles overlap—have theiranalogues in marmas in the human body: similar, in fact, to acupuncture pointsin Chinese medicine. Ayurvedic medicine is concerned with applying pressure,through massage, to the appropriate marmas in order to promote healing. There iseven an Indian martial arts technique called marma adi, which is a method ofkilling or disabling a human being by the correct application of pressure—astrike—at one of the twelve “death marmas” on the body (there are 96 healingmarmas, and 12 “death” marmas, for a total of 108 marmas in the human body).To Grant, the marmas on the Sri Chakra and the marmas on the body arereflections of each other. During the ritual we described in the last chapter,the magician is to make passes (or mudras) over the body of the priestess inorder to stimulate the activity of specific marmas which in turn affect thechakras. Grant believes that the kalas are brought down from the Mauve Zone intothe body of the priestess during the ritual and that the stimulation of theappropriate marmas helps to accomplish this. Then the Kundalini—which Grant hasbegun calling the Fire Snake—is encouraged to rise through the body of thepriestess, sealing the chakras as it proceeds to the cranial vault.According to Grant in “mystical” Tantra (if such a thing truly exists), theraising of the Fire Snake to the cranial vault is the ultimate goal, for whenthe Goddess Kundalini and the God Shiva meet the hierogamos or sacred marriageis complete. The Tantrika eventually achieves union with the Absolute andattains advaita, or non-duality. But in the Kaula Circles that are the primarychannel for Sri Vidya, the power that has been raised is drawn back down to themuladhara chakra where it is collected by the magician. This is the “magical”approach to Tantra rather than a mystical one and Grant is not bashful aboutthis. He implies that the acquisition of siddhis—magical powers—is the goal ofhis system. He equates the first type of Tantra with the elixir vitae of thealchemists (the amrita), and the second form of Tantra with the Stone of theWise, the Philosopher's Stone. To a Tantrika, this is an unenlightened approachand one that is usually condemned as unworthy; moreover it is factuallyincorrect. The Tantras do indeed prescribe the oral consumption of the kalasdirectly from the genital outlet, the yoni, of the priestess and in fact alsogenerally insist that the elixir is obtained by the mixture of both thekalas—the menstrual discharges—and the semen of the male operator, what is knownin the Gnostic Mass as the “cakes of light.” The only deviations from this ruleconcern the ability of the male Tantrika to achieve orgasm without ejaculation,in which the absence of semen is acceptable, or when the male Tantrika isengaged in maithuna—the sexual embrace—with a married woman not his wife, inwhich case (and according to some Tantras) it is preferable that the Tantrikanot ejaculate or not ejaculate in the yoni of his partner. (The Tantras are allover the place where ritual requirements are concerned, and what is and is notdesirable or permissable.) What Grant discusses is perfectly comprehensible interms of the Western magical tradition, with its conscious manipulation andexploitation of mind and body, and that is perhaps where he parts company withnormative Tantra. His focus on the raw technology of the system rather than onthe philosophy behind it—the Hindu and Buddhist ethical and spiritualtraditions—alienates Tantric scholars and Tantrikas. However, it satisfies theneed of Western occultists who are not interested in the ethos of the system(who see such considerations as purely theological and thus ideological) but inthe psycho-biological apparatus of the human body itself, and how altered statesof consciousness and experiences of other realities can be attained throughmanipulating its inner processes.In addition, Grant's claim that the kalas are brought down from Beyond to thebody of the priestess implies that there is a strong stellar or astral componentto what appears to be a psycho-sexual or bio-chemical process. Of course, whenthe full details of the rite are considered—which includes the lunar phases andother astrological considerations—it becomes obvious that what Grant claims has,in fact, validity. Imagine a solar panel in a land where there is no sun: itdoesn't matter that the panel is created perfectly and all its parts are inworking order; if there is no sun, there is no power. In the case of what Grantbegins to call the Ritual of the Fire Snake, the body of the priestess is thesolar panel; the ritual must be timed so that the “sun” is present in the rightplace at the right time for the panel to provide energy.This is true of all ceremonial magic, as any glance at the medieval grimoireswould certainly reveal. Magical rituals depend as much on correct timing as theydo on the preparation of the magician and the occult implements to be employed.It is this emphasis on timing—in Tantra, in Daoist magic, in alchemy, and inWestern magic—that reveals the deeper character of occultism in its dependenceon the interrelationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm. What casualobservers may not realize, however, is that the macrocosm can be just asdangerous as the microcosm. After all, Cthulhu can be summoned only “when thestars are right.”This leads to another element of Grant's thesis: that these marmas or entrypoints into the Mauve Zone exist in space, exist in the human body, and exist onthe earth. Here they are power-zones on the body of the planet, exploited bycults or groups of adepts who are sensitive to their use and initiated intotheir mysteries. Such marmas represent, as the blurb on the first edition ofGrant's Outside the Circles of Time states:... a network more complex than was ever imagined: a network not unlike H. P.Lovecraft's dark vision of sinister forces lurking at the rim of the universe.The Sri Chakra, like any perfect cosmological system, must take into account theexistence of what the non-initiate may term “evil.” Some of the marmas andsandhis provide means of entering areas of existence that are inimical orhostile to normal human consciousness: the realms of the demons, or Nagas. Itis, in fact, precisely these regions that most attract the attention of KennethGrant.One of the schemes that can introduce the Western occultist to this concept isthat of Liber 231, a small treatise by Crowley that is concerned entirely withthe realm of the Shells, the qlippot. In order to appreciate this text it isnecessary to understand that the Tree of Life of the Kabbalists—consisting often spheres or sefirot joined by twenty-two paths representing the twenty-twoletters of the Hebrew alphabet—also has a “dark side.”According to the Golden Dawn system of interpreting the Tree of Life, there is a“space between” the lower seven sefirot and the upper three. This “spacebetween” is referred to as the Abyss. It is sometimes believed to be the realmof another sefirah, Daath. In diagrams of the Tree this sphere is often shownwith a dotted instead of a solid circle to signify that it is not a “true”sefirah in the scheme of things but a “shadow sphere.”In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Daath was the subject of muchspeculation and it was Jacob Frank—a messianic figure of the eighteenth centurywho combined Jewish, Islamic and Christian concepts in his movement—whoemphasized the importance of Daath to his own system. To Grant, Daath is the“Outer Gateway” to the Mauve Zone. It is a kind of “anti-sefirah.”In addition to Daath, there are the qlippot which are described in Crowley'sLiber 231. These are the shells of a shattered sphere from the first Creation(according to one tradition) and they occupy twenty-two “anti-paths” on the Treeof Life. The marmas and sandhis on the Sri Chakra are points, or bindus, on thediagram that are the intersections of lines; the qlippot are paths between thespheres on the Tree of Life, so they more resemble lines than points. But thisis a superficial difference. In practice, the qlippot are as much gateways tothe Other Side as specific marmas or sandhis.Liber 231 is one of the Holy Books, which was received, along with the others wehave already discussed earlier, that were written by Crowley during a white heatof inspiration at the same time that Lovecraft decided the Rites of Cthulhu weretaking place in New Orleans. Crowley does not give any instructions for how themysterious tables of the 22 qlippot—the 22 “scales of the serpent”—should beused. It was eventually up to Grant and his Lodge to explore the possibilitiesand to use the tables as a map for penetrating the Mauve Zone. These 22“demonic” or “qlippothic” paths are the Tunnels of Set that Grant opines liesbetween the realm of dreams and the realm of dreamless sleep (which latter isitself analogous to the state of non-duality). They are reflexes of the 22 pathson the Tree of Life, shadows of those paths, forming a Shadow Tree of whichDaath is the central Gate. His New Isis Lodge worked extensively with theqlippot and specifically with Liber 231 in an attempt to map its potentialities.Grant goes further, attempting to link the 22 qlippot with an equal number ofkalas. The number of kalas seem to multiply with the systems applied, and thisequating of them with the Tunnels of Set may be ill-advised. (A similar problemexists with Crowley's attribution of the I Jing trigrams with the sefirot on theTree of Life; the number systems do not equate and it is a violence to try toforce them to fit. There are other, better solutions.) While the kalas arevaginal secretions that can be used as elixirs it is not certain whether thesesecretions can or should be equated with the qlippot on a one-to-one basis. Ifthe qlippot are pathways—the Tunnels of Set, as Grant calls them—then the kalasmay very well be the fuel that enables one to travel them, or the keys toopening their gates.Grant employs both systems—Tantra and Kabbalah—in his lengthy digressions on thenature of the Mauve Zone and the realm of Darkness where the Old Ones dwell. Andit is through ceremonial technologies such as the Ritual of the Fire Snake thatcontact can be made with this realm by using specific gateways. The Kabbalistswould employ the qlippot system and the sphere of the Abyss, Daath, in theirapproach to what Grant calls the “Nightside of Eden.” And the practitioners ofthe Kaula Circles or the Anuttara Amnaya would employ appropriate marmas andsandhis of the Sri Chakra, in combination with the kalas and the ojas. In eithercase, a psycho-sexual technique is employed: either the sexual magic of AleisterCrowley, the OTO, or the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, or the Tantric ritualsof the Kaula Circles. Kenneth Grant was able to combine both of theseapproaches, largely through identifying cognate ideas and methods and by“porting” one system over to the other, incorporating Tantric techniques withina Western, ceremonial framework.While this approach may seem wholly arbitrary to some, the infusion of genuineTantric methods within the Thelemic rituale produced a spark of new life intothe latter. As we can see from Grant's published work the new insights that wereobtained by using Tantric techniques in a Western ceremonial setting wereremarkable. And the rush of prose out of Grant's pen due to this combustible mixis alone evidence of how the secret rites of the Nu-Isis Lodge were able to fuelnine non-fiction works on the subject, as well as much fiction and poetry, notcounting the contributions of other members of the Grant circle.And this is as it should be, according to Grant, for it is the Mauve Zone thatis the source of all human creativity, imagination, fascination, and obsession.It is represented in the microcosm by a zone that exists between the dream stateand the deeper, dreamless state, and is the source of artistic impulses andcontact with divine and demonic forces. But these are its positivecharacteristics. There are negative ones as well, and they are the forces thatchallenge the magician on an individual basis just as they confront society ingeneral. These are the demonic forces that so frighten the protagonists of theLovecraft ouevre. And summoning them—or any aspect of the Mauve Zone—can havedisastrous consequences.The French poet Artur Rimbaud famously declared that it was necessary, in orderto become a Seer, to engage the complete “derangement of the senses.” Our normalsensory state is designed to cope with the visible world, in order to ensure thesurvival of the body; only the shamans, initiates, magicians and alchemists lookbeyond maintaining the integrity of the physical body and extendingconsciousness beyond that of the visible, tangible universe. In order to dothis, risks are taken.The methods used to “derange the senses” or alter perception may include drugs,alcohol, fasting, or other tools that are potentially dangerous to the humanorganism and counter-intuitive when it comes to discussing the health andsurvival of the body. It is as if the body's normal systems and processes mustbe challenged in order that a space be made for the new experiences. This isbecause our minds and bodies are part of an integrated “psychosomatic” system,and an effect on one will have an impact on the other. This is what Grant callsthe “retroversion” of the body's normal processes. Retroversion is a method heidentifies specifically with Set, the Dark Lord—as Set represents “evil” in thecosmic scheme, or those things that challenge the status quo.We have already seen this in our discussion of the necessity of consciouscontrol over the body's autonomic nervous system and the reptilian brain. Inorder to experience altered states of the mind it is therefore necessary toalter the state of the body.In the Afro-Caribbean tradition, this altering of the body's autonomic systemscan be effected through the use of drums. Drums exert a control over theheartbeat of the devotees, which is one of the autonomic processes. In thissituation, the drummers control the psycho-biological response of an entiregroup of devotees, and it is within this highly-charged environment that thephenomenon of possession by the gods takes place, often in multiple devotees.The type of drums used and the rhythms employed will change the results,invoking specific deities. But the drumming still takes place within the greatercontext of the ritual itself, which is under the control of the priest. Thesemethods—while they can cause change to occur in and of themselves—must be usedwithin the ritual structure in order to be effective. Anyone can take drugs oralcohol, for instance, but although the senses may be deranged as a result, thelong-term effects will not be conducive to the attainment of spiritualillumination or occult capabilities. As we have already indicated, sexualactivity by itself is not capable of producing the type of spiritualbreakthroughs of which the writings of Grant, Crowley, and the entire field ofthe Tantras are an indication. What is necessary is the deliberate structure ofthe ritual, for that is where the effect of the Will will be felt and that iswhat will provide the channel for the energy raised. As the Crowleyan imperativehas it, “love under will.”There is no guarantee that the experience will be pleasant or productive. Theritual structure will provide a certain level of operational security if theritual participants have been prepared carefully beforehand. This preparation isnot only in terms of yogic-type practices, meditation, etc. but alsointellectual study so that the various moving parts of the ritual are understoodand made part of the psyches of the participants. In other words, the varioustechniques used to insure protection must be internalized so that they aresecond-nature. The instinctual response of the individuals to perceived dangeris what will protect them, since there is no physical weapon that can be used todefeat what is essentially an ethereal or at least non-corporeal threat. Themind will be forced to locate the appropriate defense mechanism—for instance,during a confrontation with an entity from the Mauve Zone that appears hostileor somehow dangerous—and the only weapons at its disposal will be those learnedin the preliminary phase of the training.Even then, however, the effects of such intense ritual workings may be felt fordays, weeks, or even years after the fact as the experience is digested andconnections to other—unconscious—material is strengthened. That is why such anexperienced occultist as Francis Israel Regardie—a one-time secretary toAleister Crowley and a Golden Dawn and Rosicrucian initiate—strongly recommendedthat those interested in entering onto a path of occult practice first gothrough several years of psychological analysis in order to identify as much aspossible any deeply hidden problems that would be inadvertently triggered orexacerbated by occult practice.To Grant, who experienced most of the twentieth century and the first decade ofthe twenty-first, the enormous changes that took place during that time were anindication that something had gone terribly wrong with the cosmos. Grantbelieved that the type of changes a magician effects on his own psyche as aresult of his occult practice can have an impact on the world at large. This is,after all, the whole basis of magic as a system for manipulating reality and theexperience of reality. Grant's thesis is that the present state of affairs isthe result of an accumulation of occult operations on the one hand (acting onthe ethereal plane, perhaps), and scientific, social, and technologicaloperations on the other operating in the “real” world.Today we hear of sights and sounds experienced outside the body, in the skies,in the oceans, and deep within the earth. It is as if a cosmic Fire Snakeactivated the terrestrial power-zones, or reflected into space the chakrasawakened by sub-atomic radiations. ... the Earth is beginning to exhibit thecatastrophic effects of such artificial stimulations of the Fire Snake.185[part0011_split_002.html#aft185]When Grant writes “as if” he is being coy, for it is clear that he believes thisis precisely what happened. One must read Grant carefully with a view towardsextrapolating some of the broader statements from the minutiae of sexual ritualsand Hebrew, Greek and even English gematria. His clearest paragraphs are thosethat reveal his certainty that the stories of H. P. Lovecraft, the art of theSurrealists and of Austin Osman Spare, and the modern phenomena of UFOs andabductees, are all in a sense reflections of a real universe beyond our own. Hisincorporation of Tantra, Kabbalah, magic, and all the rest can be seen as anattempt to reconcile his deeper, inner belief in the reality of the horrorfantasies of Lovecraft with a comprehensive worldview that could explain them insome kind of internally-consistent way.Grant clearly believed that the world was undergoing an invasion from some otherdimension or from somewhere Beyond. This invasion was being experienced as theUFO phenomenon, among other things. The eruption of interest in occultism,horror films, alternative religions, etc. indicated to Grant that something wasalready working its way into our world and that the only ones who couldinterpret this event were the sensitives. Not limited to magicians oroccultists, sensitives include artists, writers, and other people who dealextensively with imagination and creativity: qualities that are associated withthe Mauve Zone. In this Grant takes his cue from Lovecraft, of course, but thatdoesn't make his conclusions any less reasonable.In present times, with the massive reawakening in man of the subtle facultiesconnected with the Ajna-Vishuddha complex of chakras, a more sinister elementpervades the picture. Man is no longer subject only to his innate tendencies,his organism has undergone changes which render him increasingly susceptible toinfluences from Outside. ... Whatever ‘it’ is, or whatever its provenance, itposes serious problems for the magician. Alien intelligence is intimatelyinvolved with the movements of the Fire Snake, the energies of which are knownto be interactive with the denizens of other dimensions.186[part0011_split_002.html#aft186]At the same time, there are occultists who are deliberately attempting to makecontact with these beings from other dimensions, other worlds, through themedium of the Mauve Zone, and they included the membership of his own occultlodge in London. These contacts did not stop when his lodge ceased activity inthe 1960s, however, for he writes:... there are today magicians who are forging links with power-zones inunfathomable space and with voids beyond time.187[part0011_split_002.html#aft187]Again, we can clearly recognize the Lovecraftian influence in Grant's vision.Grant specifically links Cthulhu with the Fire Snake, i.e. with Kundalini, as itis asleep in the waters of the deep (which Grant links to the two lowestchakras, the muladhara and svadisthana chakras)188[part0011_split_002.html#aft188] and can be raised by the right evocations andwhen the “stars are right.” To support this, he also quotes frequently from theSchlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon.It is quite possible that the famous Lovecraftian description of Cthulhu as“dead but dreaming” indicates Kundalini which is asleep until it is awakened,but also refers to Grant's three forms of consciousness: awake, dreaming, anddreamless sleep. Cthulhu, as “dead but dreaming” seems to refer to a realmbetween “death”—dreamless sleep—and dreams: in other words, the Mauve Zone.Kundalini is also a Serpent, an amphibious creature that could be linked withCthulhu. A Serpent in her cave beneath the earth; Cthulhu in his house beneaththe sea. Both raised by magicians and occult practice and, when they do, theychange our world forever.This is the point at which Grant makes a rather astonishing claim, among manyastonishing claims. He begins a story that sounds like something out of afantasy magazine yet later insists that it is not metaphor but an account of areal event that occurred “recently” (Beyond the Mauve Zone was published in1999). It contains much that is only comprehensible if the previous material wehave discussed is understood.In this tale, Grant references an Order that exists in the present Indian stateof Assam. This Order is Tantric and initiates into the type of Tantra we havebeen discussing. He links this Order to “stray references” found in theNecronomicon, among other places, and says it represents an oral traditionspanning generations. The Order at some point created or contacted or somehowincarnated an Entity from the realm of what Grant calls “transplutonic Isis”: astar not necessarily in our dimension, but one from which Grant's Nu-Isis or NewIsis Lodge obtained its heritage and legacy.The Entity dwelled on the Earth during which time “more and more women gavebirth to offspring imbued with the ‘child's’ alien propensities. ... Manyearth-dwellers experience strange dreams and horrendous nightmares in which theyglimpse the fantastic force of their own terror.”189[part0011_split_002.html#aft189] Eventually, our planet became a “far-flungoutpost of Nu-Isis.”190 [part0011_split_002.html#aft190]But that is not the end of the story. Eventually, the Entity spends “many yearsin Assam studying with a Tantric Adept” after which they both disappear, only to“surface” in a network of tunnels underneath Kamrup which Grant calls “theterrestrial power-zone of the Fire Snake.” The Entity then assumes the identityof an eccentric scientist—I am not making this up—who has an image of Nu-Isis ina cabinet before which burns an eternal flame. The image was of a woman, “suave,metallic, her body cast in vitrified ojas ...” and at a particular time theimage comes to life and the scientist “cohabited regularly” with this “alienembodiment of the Fire Snake” until an explosion destroyed the scientist'slaboratory and “the surrounding terrain was violently upheaved by the impact ofa series of elemental disasters.”191 [part0011_split_002.html#aft191] However,all was not lost for a daughter had been born out of the cohabiting of thescientist with the statue—although she seems somewhat unpleasant.After this, Grant writes that it is not a magical allegory but an account of the“recent astral history of the earth.”192 [part0011_split_002.html#aft192]Let us take a moment to deconstruct the narrative, for it will yield somefascinating fruits.In the first place, Assam is considered by some historians to have been thebirthplace of Tantra. It is located on the far north-eastern end of Indiaconnected to the rest of the sub-continent by a narrow pass throught themountains. Its ancient name was Kamrup, and it represented an independentkingdom bordering on Tibet. Grant identifies Kamrup as the ancient capital ofAssam, but that is not technically true as Kamrup was the name of the entirekingdom (now a district of Assam).It is the story of the eccentric and reclusive scientist, however, that isintriguing for a number of reasons.In the 1930s H. P. Lovecraft went to Florida to visit Robert Barlow, a young manwho was an aspiring writer. They had developed a friendship throughcorrespondence, and Barlow was thrilled to have his idol come down from RhodeIsland to see him in the Sunshine State. After visiting Barlow in De Land,Volusia County, Lovecraft went down to Key West. This first visit was inMay—June of 1931. There were several other trips to Florida thereafter.However, this visit to Key West opens up a number of intriguing possibilities.At that time, there was a strange, eccentric and reclusive scientist living inKey West, moreover someone who had been involved in the occult back in hisnative Germany, and who had spent time in India studying with gurus beforeeventually winding up in Australia at the beginning of the First World War.Significantly, he befriended a Sri Lankan monk who was a friend of Crowley'smentor, Alan Bennett.His story was one of the most bizarre episodes in Florida (or any state's)history. The man was known variously as Count Carl von Cosel, or Carl Tanzler,or Georg Karl Tänzler (1877-1952).Tanzler was born in Dresden, Germany, and according to a lengthy article he hadwritten for Fantastic Adventures magazine, he had paranormal experiences sincehe was a young man living in his family's castle. He had recurring visions of alovely woman—a famous ancestor—and another vision of a woman whom he called byvarious names, including Ayesha. But these were incorporeal women anddisappeared as soon as he was aware of them. Fearing he was being haunted, hecontacted several important paranormal experts in the region around Dresden.These included names that are perhaps not as well known today, but were famousin their time. In the list were Carl du Prel (1839-1899), J. K. F. Zöllner(1834-1882) and Carl Kiesewetter (1854-1895) among many others. The problem withTanzler's list is that most of these men would have been dead by the time he washaving his experiences. In fact, du Prel died at the age of sixty and would havebeen alive at the time Tanzler was having his strange visions, but Zöllner wouldhave died when Tanzler when was only five years old, and Kiesewetter would havedied when Tanzler was only eighteen. According to Tanzler's own account he was20 years old when he asked these venerable gentlemen to assist him in hisconfusion. So it seems Tanzler was not being completely honest in compiling thislist in an article published in September, 1947.Eventually he left Germany for a tour to Asia, stopping first in Italy where hehad another strong vision of this ethereal woman, Ayesha. Then at some pointbefore the outset of World War One Tanzler found himself in India.In that country, where he claimed he was studying Indian religion, he woke upone day to find himself in a morgue. Evidently something had gone wrong with oneof his meditations and the local people thought he had died.From India, he went to Australia where he was interned during the War eventhough he had become a naturalized British citizen. While he was in theinternment camp, he made the acquaintance of a Sri Lanken monk named NyanatilokaThera. This particular monk was a friend of Crowley's mentor Alan Bennett whenthe latter was known as the Bhikku Ananda Metteya. The two monks lived in thesame ashram for a period of time.From there, Tanzler went back to Germany after the end of the war and wasencouraged by his family to emigrate to the United States. He stayed in Germanyfrom 1920-1925, the period that saw the collapse of German society due to theirloss of the war, the Depression, and the rise of Nazism with the famous BeerHall Putsch of 1923. In April, 1926 he arrived in the United States and movedfirst to Zephyrhills, Florida and then to Key West where he found work as aradiologist in 1927.On April 22, 1930 he met a young woman, a tuberculosis patient by the name ofMaria Elena Milagro de Hoyos. She was a twenty-one-year-old Cuban-American womanand a local beauty. Tanzler recognized her as the woman in the visions he hadbeen having all his life, and fell in love with her. He courted her even thoughthey were both married to other people. He tried various means to cure her ofher illness, and claimed to have made good progress. But her family intervened.They did not want her seeing this self-professed medical man, but insteadinsisted that she return to the hospital and do whatever the regular doctorstold her to do.Maria Hoyos died on October 25, 1931. That should have been the end of thestory, but things became increasingly strange after that.Tanzler built her an elaborate mausoleum in the local cemetery, one to which healone would have the key. While visiting her constantly he began a series ofbizarre medical procedures designed first to keep her from decomposing, and thento raise her from the dead. In fact, as far as Tanzler was concerned, she wasnot really dead at all.The story of how he attended to her is told in great detail in the FantasticAdventures article, but suffice it to say that he claimed his ministrations weresuccessful. Maria Elena was able to open her eyes, move her limbs, and speak.Tanzler kept several IVs pumping fluids into her body and removing other fluidsand fighting a constant battle with maggots, but in the end he was certain thathe was successful in bringing her back to life.It was only a hurricane—Grant's “elemental disasters”—that disrupted Tanzler'soperation. He was forced to take Maria Elena's body out of the mausoleum in thedead of night and bring it to his home—where he built a special cabinet for her(in the shape of an aircraft ... Tanzler had been making preparations to flythem both out of Florida as soon as she was “well enough” to make the trip).Eventually, however, he was discovered by members of the young woman's family.This was in October, 1940. That means almost ten years after her death. Tanzlerhad been living with the corpse in his house and—according to someaccounts—“cohabiting” with it—all that time.He was arrested but the charges were dropped due to the expiration of thestatute of limitations for corpse-tampering. Maria Elena's body was buried in anunmarked grave and Tanzler, who could no longer stay in Key West due to thenotoriety, moved back to the Zephyrhills area and then eventually wrote thestory that appeared in Fantastic Adventures.We have one certain indication, other than Tanzler's own insistence, that he wasinvolved with the occult long these events transpired. He wrote an article abouthis experience in the Australian internment camp for none other than theRosicrucian Digest, published in March, 1939. This was before his arrest, butyears after the death of Maria Elena Milagro (“miracle”) de Hoyos. When hefinally died in 1952, he was found with a life-size effigy of Ms. de Hoyos.Some dreams never die.There are so many coincidences between this story and the one told by Grant inBeyond the Mauve Zone that we are forced to consider the possibility that theyare one and the same. Add to this the idea that Lovecraft almost certainly knewof this story—it would have appealed to him immensely—and one wonders if itcould have inspired his famous story “Herbet West—Re-Animator” (1921-1922)except this tale was written ten years before the events in question, whileTanzler was still in Germany. Another case of Lovecraft seeing into the future?Tanzler does not refer to any German or American occult orders or initiations inhis few autobiographical writings. He seems to have belonged to AMORC—thepublisher of the Rosicrucian Digest—and he claims to have lived for awhile inIndia (somewhere in the period from about 1912-1914 or so) and studied yoga andIndian mysticism. His close friendship with one of Alan Bennett's fellow monksis also intriguing, but in the end we do not have much more information thanthat.Was Tanzler a member of any occult lodge or secret society? We can't answer thatfor sure, but his account of how he tended to the corpse of his beloved MariaElena has all the hallmarks of an occult operation and seems to fit some of thedetails given by Grant—who may have heard the story from someone else. Theinteresting detail given in Grant and not in Tanzler is the existence of a“child,” a daughter (presumably non-human) born out of this unholy wedlock.Depending on how Tanzler was “cohabiting” with her corpse—if there were Tantricelements involved—Grant could have been revealing some privileged knowledgeabout the case.The woman that Tanzler kept seeing he identified at one point as a priestessnamed Ayesha. Ayesha then materialized in the form of Maria Elena, who then diedfrom tuberculosis before they could be married. Tuberculosis, of course, is theillness most associated with popular ideas about vampirism: the condition of acorpse who has died of TB bears resemblance to ideas about vampires, and assomeone wastes away from the disease they exhibit all the symptoms popularlyassociated with having their blood sucked from their bodies.There is much to work with here, indeed, and perhaps one day we will come alittle closer to understanding what really motivated Tanzler—an otherwiseresponsible, scientific-minded German, a world-traveler, a man of at least threenationalities (his native German, plus his naturalized British then hisnaturalized American citizenships), friend of monks and practitioner of Asianmysticism, and even member of a Rosicrucian group.But what brings it all together is sexual magic.Sexuality is the key that opens the Gate to the Mauve Zone. That does notnecessarily mean that sexual intercourse within a ritual setting is the only waythis can be done. Instead, other methods of awakening the Fire Snake may beemployed, including purely passive methods such as meditation and yoga, as wellas the other means of “deranging the senses” that are available, from drugs todrumming. Systems that involve the autonomic nervous system directly are theeasiest—i.e., fastest—way to accomplish this goal, but they are also (obviously)the most dangerous. Tantric experts insist that no self-initiation in Tantra ispossible; that one should always seek the help and training of a qualified guru.The problem with this advice, as good as it is, is that so many gurus have beenexposed as dangerous themselves, or at least as unreliable and corrupt. Thus,many seekers have fallen back on self-initiation as the only possible way, notrealizing that this path may be at least as dangerous as following a falseteacher.The sorcerers that populate Lovecraft's works often work in groups. There wasthe orgiastic cult in “The Call of Cthulhu,” and the devil-worshippers in “TheThing on the Doorstep,” as well as the Starry Wisdom cult, and the Dagonworshippers in “The Shadow Over Innsmouth.” But there were also solitarypractitioners, such as Old Whateley in “The Dunwich Horror.” What connected allof these disparate characters was the Tradition itself.Lovecraft's Weltanschauung is fairly consistent. There was an ancient race frombeyond the stars who visited or populated the Earth at some vastly distant time,but whose devotees still exist in the world, usually intent on bringing back theOld Ones to rule the Earth again. Alternatively, there are ancient texts foundby independent sorcerers—texts like the Necronomicon—that provide formulas forevoking these seemingly unpleasant creatures from their extra-dimensional,supramundane homes for reasons that are hard to fathom. No one really knows whyOld Whateley wanted to bring down one of these creatures to impregnate his owndaughter. No one really explains why these cults in the swamps outside NewOrleans would want Cthulhu to awaken from his million-years-slumber. It seems tobe understood, if unspoken, that there exists in some human beings a deep desireto experience what is on the other side of the great divide that separates usfrom true knowledge; that the experience of the occult is addictive; and thatcontact with beings from “other worlds” may be scientifically impossible orunproveable, but nonetheless real to those who have had that contact—for itchanges their lives forever.Many people have experiences that can be described as paranormal orotherworldly. No matter how much scientific minds try to explain theseexperiences away using perfectly rational arguments, the emotional content ofthese experiences remain stronger than the best common-sense explanation. Theoccultist makes a deliberate attempt to have as many of these experiences aspossible, in a controlled environment and under repeatable circumstances. Theapproach to these paranormal or otherworldly experiences is acarefully-constructed one. It often has as its purpose the attainment ofsuperior knowledge and ability, or the acquisition of paranormal powers. Thishas the potential to derange the average person.The human psycho-biological organism has been trained for survival. Every actionmust be understood as somehow promoting that need. When actions do not makesense as survival strategies—such as ritual magic, and other processes deemed“retroversions” of the survival instinct—then the organism is stressed. It findsitself forced to come up with a rationale for these actions. If the occultist isnot well-trained, then the psyche is vulnerable to the effects of deep-seatedpsychoses and the mind can find itself obsessed or even a bit more deranged thaneven Rimbaud would be comfortable experiencing.While this can occur in an individual—and it does, with more regularity than onemight believe—the effects have wider consequences. When an occult ritual goesawry with even the most competent magician—with side effects that Kenneth Grantrefers to as “tangential tantrums”193 [part0011_split_002.html#aft193]—then theresults can be felt in the immediate environment. Strange phenomena occur, somebanal, others weirdly compelling, experienced by non-occultists as well as thosewith a vested interest in the outcome of the ritual.This is the Mauve Zone making itself felt through a rent in the veil thatseparates it from the “real world,” something about which the Schlangekraftrecension of the Necronomicon warns us when it insists that we close the Gatelest something creep through when we are unaware. This is also consistent withmedieval attitudes towards demonic conjuration, when the correct construction ofthe magic circle is required and its physical integrity insisted upon. Thecircle is the Gate the magician uses to venture into the Mauve Zone; it is alsothe wall that he erects between himself and the entities that live there.One of the requirements of both Tantra and magic is that one's partners in therituals be selected carefully beforehand. There are numerous examples given inthe Tantras of the correct type of priestess; the grimoires of magic are ratherless clear on the subject, but it is nevertheless an important factor. One cancontrol one's own actions during the ritual; it is much more difficult to dothat and to control the actions and reactions of others, whether the priestessin a rite of maithuna, or assistants in a ritual of ceremonial magic.It was quite likely this particular problem led to one of the most famous—andinfluential—rituals of modern times. It involved one of Crowley's most brilliantdisciples, a man who was literally a rocket scientist. It ended in thedestruction of the magician on the one hand and the creation of a new cult onthe other.No discussion of the Mauve Zone would be complete without reference to theexample of John Whiteside Parsons (1914-1952): an example of how an occult lifecan go terribly wrong and yet still contribute so much.We are used to the example of famous artists and writers being car wrecks ashuman beings. Edgar Allan Poe is one example, a brilliant author and poet whowas an alcoholic and who died in a gutter. Vincent Van Gogh is another, as areany number of modern rock stars. Hemingway committed suicide.Some of Lovecraft's inner circle can be included, such as the creator of Conan,the Barbarian: Robert E. Howard who committed suicide at a young age. AndLovecraft's own literary executor, the brilliant scholar Robert Barlow,committed suicide in Mexico on January 2, 1951 when he was still a young man inhis thirties.The artistic life can have that effect on people. Too close contact with theMauve Zone, over too long and extended a period of time, is poisonous if it isnot controlled. Once that Gate is opened it must be constantly policed, andclosed if the threat level rises.Therefore, in the occult world there are similar lists.One of the most important names on that list is Jack Parsons.His story has been told in several places and we won't go into too much detailhere. He was a rocket scientist who made an important contribution to the wareffort in the 1940s, and was a founding member of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Most famously, he has a crater on the Moon named after him: a fact that shouldbe of some importance to those who follow the Kaula path, for Parsons was also amagician and a follower of Aleister Crowley. For a time he ran the only activeOTO lodge in the United States, in Pasadena, California. It was probably due tothis, and to several unlucky friendships, that he eventually lost hisall-important security clearance and subsequently had a hard time finding work.It was the Cold War, and paranoia about crazy California occultists ran about ashigh as it did for crazy California communists.In June of 1952, at the age of thirty-eight, Parsons blew himself up in a garageoutside his home. Opinions differ as to whether it was an accident, a suicide,or a murder. There is room for all three versions.But it was in 1946 that everything changed.Parsons had met a science-fiction author and Naval officer named L. Ron Hubbardas the war came to a close. Parsons had run a kind of salon out of his home forwriters and for people interested in the occult. Hubbard had heard of it, andbegan frequenting the home, meeting Parsons and developing a close relationshipwith him. Hubbard's background was sketchy. Declassified FBI files on Hubbardtell a story that is somewhat at odds with the official version promoted byHubbard's creature, the “religion” known as Scientology.Regardless, from January to March, 1946, Parsons enlisted the assistance ofHubbard in a series of ambitious magical rituals known as the Babalon Working.The goal was to summon or incarnate the Scarlet Woman herself with a viewtowards creating a “magical child.” The inspiration for this manouver wasevidently Crowley's novel, Moonchild, which we have already referenced. Themethod was consistent with Crowleyan sex-magical techniques, such as we havebeen discussing at length in these pages, and the result—at least, according toGrant—was predictable.At the completion of the first part of the ritual, a red-headed woman—MarjorieCameron—appeared at Parsons's home, waiting for him as he returned from theritual in the desert. Parsons took this to be a sign that the ritual had beensuccessful, for the Scarlet Woman is famously a red-head. They soon formed arelationship and married. The next phase of the ritual was to use IXth degreeOTO sex magic rituals in order to incarnate a magical child who would be theThelemic messiah.A study of this event is instructive for anyone who has managed to follow thisreport thus far. Everything we have been discussing comes together in the storyof Parsons and Hubbard and the Babalon Working, from Thelema to the OTO, sexmagic, Babalon, creating magical offspring ... and opening a Gate that perhapsshould never have been opened.Hubbard's agenda in all of this is a mystery, except that in the end he made offwith a great deal of Parsons's money in a venture called Allied Enterprises.Hubbard absconded with the funds to Florida (and Parsons's former girlfriendSara Northrup) where he bought a boat and tried to escape. According to thestory as it has been told many times, Parsons chased Hubbard to Florida and whenhe saw that his former partner making for open waters, he conjured a spirit toraise a tempest and force the ship back to shore ... and that is exactly whathappened. Hubbard was detained by the Coast Guard and told by the court to repaythe money he had stolen from Parsons.Within a few short years, Hubbard would write Dianetics—the book for which he isbest known—and began the creation of what would become Scientology. In the earlyyears of the movement he would often claim to have met Aleister Crowley and topraise him in speeches and talks he gave to his followers. Later, he would dropall references to Crowley and downplay his involvement with the Parsons lodge ofthe OTO.One thing, however, seems to be agreed upon by those who study the case, andthat is that the rituals performed by Parsons, Hubbard and Marjorie Cameron wereeffective, but in ways no one had expected or planned. The common analysis hasit that the rituals “blew a hole in the space-time continuum” through which ...something ... came in.The rituals took place from January to March, 1946. Parsons wrote the text thathe claimed was the “fourth chapter” of the Book of the Law, The Book of Babalon.By June, 1947, the UFO phenomenon had begun with the Kenneth Arnold “flyingsaucer” sightings, and the Roswell incident the following month. The Dead SeaScrolls were discovered that year, and the CIA was founded in the Fall.And on December 1, 1947, the Great Beast himself, Therion, Aleister Crowley theProphet of the New Aeon, died at his home in England.Kenneth Grant, who had been studying with Crowley in 1945, was at the Beast'sfuneral and later worked closely with John Symonds, one of Crowley's literaryexecutors. He became involved with the OTO and by 1955 his Nu Isis Lodge beganthe intense workings that became the basis for his Typhonian Trilogies. He wouldfocus on sex magic, and on the concept that a Gate could be opened between thisworld and the next by the experienced or capable magician.His group worked with fiction—short stories and novels—as magical environments,which was an inspired strategy. What difference is there, after all, between thenarrative we find in fiction and that which we find in the myths and legendsthat make up scriptures and Tantras? If a story works—if it conveys a truth,elicits an emotional response, tells us something we did not know before andallows us to own that something—then it has much the same function as ascriptural text. The first dramas were religious in nature; the first theatricalperformances were rituals. It was through this direct experience of working withfiction to provide ritual elements that Grant and his lodge came to realize thatinspired fiction was as legitimate a source of occult knowledge and technique assacred texts.Science fiction authors have made contributions to science, such as Arthur C.Clarke and his invention of the geosynchronous satellite, among other ideas.Fantasy and horror authors make (unconscious) contributions to occultism andmagic by identifying information at deep levels of the human psyche. By focusingon fear and horror, these authors directly address our most hidden nature, whichis another way of saying that they open a Gate into the Mauve Zone.182 [part0011_split_001.html#ft182] Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 57.183 [part0011_split_001.html#ft183] Technically speaking, the prefix “an-” wouldseem to indicate that anuttara (an-uttara) is a negative or comparative term,most likely indicating “not surpassed” or “unsurpassable” rather than a positiveterm such as “absolute” or “highest,” but the sense is more or less the same.184 [part0011_split_002.html#ft184] A marma is the point where three linesintersect on the Sri Chakra. There are traditionally 28 marmas, but someauthorities insist on variously 37, 38, 39, 40 or 41 such marmas depending onhow they are calculated. The sandhis are the points where two lines intersect.There are traditionally 24 sandhis in the Sri Chakra. The sum of thesenumbers—28 + 24—gives us the 52 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet and thus a kindof Kabbalistic format that could be used to create (or analyze, or diagram)mantras.185 [part0011_split_002.html#ft185] Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 70.186 [part0011_split_002.html#ft186] Ibid., p. 60.187 [part0011_split_002.html#ft187] Ibid., p. 80.188 [part0011_split_002.html#ft188] Ibid., p. 58.189 [part0011_split_002.html#ft189] Ibid., p. 133-134.190 [part0011_split_002.html#ft190] Ibid., p. 134.191 [part0011_split_002.html#ft191] Ibid., p. 134-135.192 [part0011_split_002.html#ft192] Ibid., p. 135193 [part0011_split_002.html#ft193] Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 77and in Grant's Hecate's Fountain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE DARK LORD... when the world was destroyed by fire on 21st March, 1904, one's attentionwas inevitably called to the similarity of this card to the Stele of Revealing....

This had tobe witnessed by other initiates in order to pass the test.Contact with non-human entities is one of the inescapable requirements of magic.There is no magic without this type of supramundane communication. And the mostintense form of this contact is sexual.Those who have been inadvertently or unwillingly involved in this type ofencounter speak of it in sexual terms. The UFO abductee experience seems toinclude various types of (often uncomfortable) sexual encounter with alienbeings. In the Middle Ages average men and women complained about incubi andsuccubi. The Witches' Sabbat is portrayed as a kind of orgy. Lovecraft'saversion to sexuality may be a reflection of this unconscious understandingthat, somehow, sexuality and contact with alien forces are linked.This is the basis for what we have learned of the Typhonian Tradition.In a Typhonian Order newsletter published in Miami, Florida in the 1990s we findthe bold statement:The central concern of Magick is communion with discarnate or extraterrestrialIntelligences.194 [part0012_split_001.html#aft194]This is characterized by Grant as the “occult policy of the OTO”195[part0012_split_001.html#aft195] and it more or less throws down the gauntlet.There is no insistence on lofty spiritual goals or an Asian-inspired quest fornon-duality or nirvana. While these are certainly present in Grant's works theyare there almost as after-thoughts. After all we have read—and it has been onlya drop in the Typhonian bucket—we know that this “policy” of communion withdiscarnate and extraterrestrial Intelligences involves some form of sexual magicor Tantra.Why is this specifically Typhonian, then? After all, Crowley's Thelema alsoinvolves sexual techniques and is not characterized as Typhonian. Grant is clearon the difference between the two approaches. Grant's magic is stellar-based,while the mainstream of Thelema is solar-based. His emphasis is not so much onHorus as it is on Set, and he is willing to accept input from sources as diverseas Jack Parsons, Frater Achad, and even H. P. Lovecraft. He is reaching for agreater scope for Thelema and believes that this is achievable through theoperations of ceremonial magic with sexual or Tantric enhancements conducted asa series of experiments to gather more, and deeper, information about the natureof our universe. This universe is not perceived as the visible solar system andthe star systems outside of it alone, but as that universe plus otherdimensions, other realities beyond the ones we see or measure with our consciousminds.Tantra deals with enormous lengths of time, elaborate cosmological systems, andan intense intellectual component—but viewed from within a worldview that statesthe cosmos was created by means of a sexual act between the gods, and thattherefore the entire created universe reflects that sexual polarity. The powerthat fuels the universe has its analogue in sexual energy. Our bodies containthe source of this energy, the Fire Snake—dead but dreaming—at the base of ourspines; and as individual as this seems it is also universal. The Kundalinicoiled at the base of my spine is identical to that at the base of yours, andthey are both identical to that at the base of the spine of the Universe (thebody of the Mother Goddess), which is identical to that at the base of thespines of the gods themselves. It is a machine, a technology, that bridges thegap between science and religion, between mind and body, between reality and theOther.Sexuality is an ancient metaphor for this power. It crosses cultural, racial andreligious lines. Sexual spirituality can be seen in the occult practices ofChina, India, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, andEurope. Fertility rites have been observed among pre-literate societies theworld over, and painted on cave walls dating back thousands of years. This isthe “apostolic succession” of the Typhonian Tradition.Using sources as diverse as de Santillana and von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill, aswell as the more fanciful projects of Zecharia Sitchin and Erich von Danniken,we can see that a stellar—rather than a solar—tradition is the oldest form ofoccult theory and practice. Reference to the famous Dogon tribe of Mali, inAfrica, reveals to us a sacred tradition that is based on stellar, and notsolar, considerations and computations that take place in the wilderness. Thevenerable astrological system of India—Vedic or Jyotish astrology—issidereal-based and not solar-based. There is a definite Current that involvesthis tradition, and with it we can begin to re-evaluate some of the history wethink we know about such groups as the cult of Mithra—which this author insistswas an astral and not a solar cult.Truly, it is written that “Every man and every woman is a star,” not a sun oreven a moon. Much of what Crowley wrote is intelligble from a stellar or astralperspective as opposed to a purely “solar-phallic” one. Some of Grant'scriticisms of Crowley's approach to magic are legitimate; that does not meanthat Crowley's Thelema has been somehow devalued in the process. It can onlybenefit from constructive ideas and the expansion of its theory and practiceinto new, uncharted territories. Yet, any criticism of Crowley is consideredanathema in some quarters, and those with lesser initiations feel unequal to thetask of questioning either Crowley himself or his (appointed or unappointed)heirs.So what is needed is the Dark Lord.Set is the Opponent, the Adversary (like his Christian avatar, Satan). It is therole of Set to set himself up in opposition to the status quo, to the consensusviewpoint, to traditional beliefs and practices. He is the Other, and as suchrepresents alien concepts and methods. Just as the Elixir Vitae is formed ofboth the male and female elements, and just as the Aeon of Horus is the Aeon ofthe Magical Child—the offspring of those elements—so too Set is the polarityrequired by Horus to balance the new religion and bring it into greaterrecognition.... And to contribute to the birth of new—non-human—offspring.In the Catholic Church, there is the role of the Devil's Advocate. Thisindividual is there to question every aspect of the life of a person beingconsidered for canonization as a Saint. While he works for the Church, his jobis to try as hard as he can to challenge and defeat those who would support thecanonization. Set's role is similar, but much more far-reaching.Set is the avatar of all such Devil's Advocates. He is, in fact, the Devilhimself according to some traditions. He is the Dark Lord, the “dark” at the endof the Tunnels of Set. He represents all that humanity has suppressed,repressed, and oppressed since time immemorial. There is no Aeon of Set, for Setis not relegated to a solar period, an equinoctial precession, or any kind ofcalendar. He cannot be contained that way. Set's position in the heavens is asthe Pole Star or, at least, as the circumpolar asterism we know as the BigDipper, but which the ancient Egyptians recognized as the Thigh of Set: theall-important device made of magnetic iron—Lovecraft's “Tutulu metal”—that“opened the mouth” of the mummy, of the corpse, of the re-animated God.Set is polymorphously perverse. He'll have sex with anything. He'd do his motherif he could. He is the symbol of unbridled lust, which is characterized as evil,vulgar, rapacious, etc. by his parents. Sexuality is the first thing societiescontrol and legislate. It is the one power that, if unchecked, can topplegovernments, impeach presidents, destroy careers. Sex must be tied, like Set, tothe prow of the Ship of State or the Ship of Saint Peter ... or just the Ship ofFools.Set and Shiva hang out. Both are wild men, living in the wilderness. Shiva isthe Lord of Destruction, with Brahma (Lord of Creation) and Vishnu (Lord ofPreservation) forming a holy Sanskrit Trinity. Set spilled his seed, and so didShiva.Set comes from the stars. He is not from around here. Even his token Egyptiananimal is unidentifiable. He is an Alien, in every sense of that word. And thatmeans his natural consort is the alien woman, the Strange Woman of the Bible:the Scarlet Woman, the Red-Headed Goddess of the Red Lotus throne.Set is the Beast. He is Therion. Set is that supernova that exploded on April30, 1006, when his asterism “hung from its tail in the sky” and destroyed acivilization, and buried one of the largest temples in the world under amountain of volcanic ash not to be seen again for more than eight hundred years.Set is the reptilian brain. The serpent brain. That ancient legacy from theGreat Old Ones, from five hundred million years ago. Fight or flight, it's allthe same to Set, but my money's on fight.Set is the Lord of the Underworld. He is cthonic. He is Kutu-lu. Cthulhu. HighPriest of the Great Old Ones. In his underground, underworld, undersea JamesBond villain-villa. They feared him in Egypt. They were terrified of him inSumer. They searched everywhere for him among the Cathars, the Albigensians, theTemplars, the Witches ... and finally found him in the mirrored plates of theirown armor.Set is the key to understanding human existence. He is the key because he is theone Lord we fear the most, and don't know why. He is the Ghost in the Machine,the Father of Lies, the King of Demons, the Lord of the Flies. He pub-crawledwith Job. He wrestled with Jacob. He hit on Eve while she was naked and Adamwasn't home, the Dog.He walked up to Jesus and offered him the world.Like he cared.Set is the Master of Deception and Dissimulation, but not of Classification. Setdoes not work for governments and has no desire to serve and protect.Governments have never been very kind to Set, so besides being the Master ofDeception he is also the Lord of Leaks.Set is the Force of Retroversion. He reverses the flow of energy in theuniverse, the onward march of time, the linear measurement of space. He's the upof the down, the down of the up. The backwards glance. The lateral pass. He'stricky that way.Most importantly, however, Set has his throne in the deepest, darkest recessesof the human unconscious. And the human unconscious is the gateway to all theother zones of reality that comprise the magician's neighborhood. He's in deep,but that's because we've put him there. If human beings are social animals, andneed society to feel safe and comfortable and to sleep their way throughexistence, then Set needs to be suppressed. And when Set is suppressed, theneverything connected to Set is suppressed. And that's how most of us live.It's not a very magical approach to life.But it's safe.Let's look at the 24th Tunnel of Set, that known as Niantiel.Kenneth Grant describes what was seen on a tour of this Tunnel, this scary backalley on the Tree of Life. And it's not pretty.It's about a Death Cult whose members “became addicted to necrophilia.” Theritual involves sex with a “ritually slain woman dedicated to the deity withwhom contact was sought.” As we have learned, the occult policy of Grant'sTyphonian Order is contact with discarnate Intelligences, and in this case, boththe Intelligence and the Vehicle are discarnate. According to Grant, virginswere kept especially “sequestered” for these rituals. Once slain, sex with thecorpse was almost immediate as the astral form of the slain woman was sent to arealm between earthly and “post-mortem consciousness.” All of this was to enablethe magicians to use the freshly-liberated spirit of the victim to travel to thedesired realm and communicate what she saw back to the cult.196[part0012_split_001.html#aft196]This is a form of necromancy, and versions of it exist in many cultures. Contactwith the dead is tabu in many religions and sexual congress with a corpse isespecially heinous.197 [part0012_split_001.html#aft197] However, the Tantricrites that take place in cremation grounds in India come pretty close to thisexample. Sexual congress—maithuna—can take place in the presence of a corpse,and not necessarily one that has died recently. To a true Tantrika there wouldbe nothing inherently objectionable about having sex with a corpse as nothing ishideous to the truly enlightened. There are many Tantric ikons that depict Kali,for instance, dripping in blood and skulls, standing on the corpse of Shiva.Foul substances are no longer foul in the realm of the Dark Lord:The mediaeval Alchemist perhaps came nearest to the pure doctrine with hisanalysis of substances popularly considered unclean. He knew that dross was theouter form of the Hidden God...198 [part0012_split_001.html#aft198]AndThat which repels, that which disgusts, must thou assimilate in this Way ofWholeness.199 [part0012_split_001.html#aft199]Even Austin Osman Spare, the visionary artist and natural magician, weighed inon the subject:Perversion is used merely to overcome moral prejudice or conformity. Bypersistence, the mind and desire become amoral, focused, and made entirelyacceptive, so the life-force of the Id is free of inhibitions prior to finalcontrol.200 [part0012_split_001.html#aft200]In the rituals of the Kalachakra Tantra—the form of Vajrayana Buddhism practicedin Tibet by the Dalai Lama into which he has initiated thousands of people allaround the world—there are instructions for the preservation of urine and faecesin special jars at various points of the Mandala, as well as those for blood andsemen. (I have already discussed this in Tantric Temples.) The motivation isprobably the same: to demonstrate that there are no “bad” substances, no“ugliness” in the world, but that all is a manifestation of the Goddess, andthere is no purpose in prefering one substance over any other.After all, even the Bible tells us that “the Stone the builders rejected was thecornerstone.” (Psalm 118:22; Acts 4:11)This ugly substance, this forbidden act, this rejected Stone ... all can beunderstood as relics of the Dark Lord.The problem with the scene depicted as having taken place in the Tunnel of Setknown as Niantiel is that a woman was slain for the purpose of contacting theOld Ones. Everything else would be permissible to a Tantric Adept, in our world,except murder and human sacrifice.Except ... except ... it has been known to occur. Human sacrifice was notunknown to the various Tantric sects of India, Tibet, and even Southeast Asia.Tantra is about power, about shakti, and there have been Tantric kings whocoveted the power represented by the Goddess Kundali and who applied that arcaneknowledge to the world of politics and government. Kings have never beensqueamish about killing people; add a religious or occult justification and itjust makes it easier.The kapala—the human skulls used as sacrificial vessels in the more shamanisticof the Tibetan Buddhist rituals—were sometimes selected from appropriate victimswhile they were still alive and using them. The requirements for these skullsare complex and specific; there was no way one came across an appropriate skullby accident. It had to be by design. The same for the skulls to be used for thedamaru, the ritual drums. And the care and preservation of these skulls was alsoa matter of some concern. The best way to keep the skulls from drying out was torub them with fat; the best fat was that obtained from the cremation grounds.201[part0012_split_001.html#aft201]We know that human sacrifice, sometimes on a large scale, did exist in variousparts of the world. The Aztecs were famous for massive sacrificial events. Whilewe consider ourselves too advanced and civilized today to engage in this type ofbarbaric behavior, the possibility still exists.We are entranced by tales of serial killers and we have romanticized them to thepoint that we have made of them the new Dracula: urbane, intelligent,sophisticated, like Hannibal Lecter. But the reality of serial killers is quitedifferent, just as the original vampires were believed to be little more thananimated corpses.Don't be seduced by the Dark Lord. His power rests in the things we have hiddenfrom ourselves; and, yes, sexuality is one path that brings us before his thronein the sunken city. But he must be approached with care, and with caution.Otherwise the Dark Lord will fuck you up.The Typhonian Tradition is ancient, according to Grant. This is not sounbelievable as it appears. As Ioan Couliano tells us:... witchcraft was still practiced in certain zones of eastern Europe at the endof the nineteenth century as a direct derivative of shamanism. Beliefs recordedin Paleosiberian caves around 1000 BCE were still valid less than a hundredyears ago. How can we explain such amazing continuity? ... a simple set of ruleswould generate similar results in the minds of human beings for a virtuallyinfinite period of time.202 [part0012_split_001.html#aft202]This perfectly accords with the writings of Grant who does not insist that hisdiscoveries came from a long line of initiates stretching unbroken back to theStone Age or beyond. What he does say is that the Typhonian Tradition itself isancient, and that there have been bodies of adepts at various times in variousplaces who have either kept the Tradition alive, or who have rediscovered it andbreathed new life into it. The “simple set of rules” is what counts, and thoseof the Typhonian Tradition are straightforward and reflect a preoccupation withdarkness, danger, and the systematic and deliberate transgression of social andreligious tabus.But that is a psychological and anthropological perspective on the Tradition,which may satisfy some but which does not tell the whole story. Eventually,psychological and anthropological ideas go out of fashion and change with thetimes. New ideologies, new trends in intellectual pursuits mean that we keeplooking at the same material from the point of view of where we are standing atthe time.The serious pursuit of magic—as of shamanism, of Tantra—requires that your pointof view shift to that of the source of the knowledge. It requires that youabandon your safe place. Otherwise you are only standing at the edge of theAbyss and taking quick glances over the side. There is no information in thatpose, no initiation possible in a state of suspended animation. You must enter aplace where all the cool academic theories no longer obtain, where thecomforting “it's all in your head” platitudes and attitudes have nomeaning—because your head, your body, your soul and spirit are all fully engagedin ways they never have been before, and it is not what you expected when youbought the ticket.The above is true about magic in general, but in the case of the TyphonianTradition it is especially important to understand these challenges. Because itis not a solar tradition but a stellar one that reaches back into the veryorigins of the human race, the Typhonian magician is working without a net. Asin the case with the Necronomicon, normal modes of protection may not obtain.The entities one meets in the Tunnels of Set—as per Grant's trilogies—are notthose that were bound by the Seal of Solomon; they are older than Solomon, olderthan dynastic Egypt, older than Babylon. The only reasonable description we haveof the realm and its denizens is what we come across in Lovecraft.The Typhonian Order focuses on the Lovecraftian entities, especially those ofthe Cthulhu Mythos. The standard demons and evil spirits of the Judaeo-Christiantradition are unequal to the task of representing the deeper archetypes that areencountered in this high-intensity approach to the magic.More than that, however, is the stated goal of the Order which is to makecontact with discarnate and extraterrestrial Intelligences. This is perfectly inaccord with the Lovecraftian tales which are concerned almost exclusively withthis type of contact. In fact, by using terms like “discarnate” and“extraterrestrial” the Order is changing the parameters within which traditionalceremonial magic functions.Magic's nineteenth and twentieth century European and American manifestationswere still concerned with the medieval grimoires and their lists of demons andangels. It was a purely sectarian approach that was based on a Judaeo-Christianworldview. Groups like the Golden Dawn reinforced that approach but addedEgyptian and other traditions to the mix, thus expanding their reach somewhat.But the Typhonian Order grew up in the post-World War II era, in the age ofatomic weapons, the Cold War, the space race, and UFO sightings. The idea ofcontact with entities other than human took on different meanings andimplications. Magic was no longer limited to a traditional religiousenvironment, but in the mid-late twentieth century took on more contemporarydress. There has been more technological development in the seventy years sincethe end of World War II than there has been in the previous thousand years, andthis has affected the awareness of occultists in the West. What had seemedmagical a hundred years ago—communication over vast distances in an instant,machines that can talk and answer questions, images transmitted through spacewithout the use of wires, flying through space across the entire world, etc.—arenow commonplace. The siddhis—the magic powers that are the result, or the sideeffect, of Tantric and magical practice—were now within the reach of everyone onthe planet. Magic, then, had to reach further and farther to identify the sourceof its power and its utility, leading some to ask: Is magic useful? What does itcontribute?The art and science of psychology began to encroach on some aspects of theinitiatory process. Add to that the use of hallucinogenic drugs and anothersecret chamber of esotericism had been breached by technicians and tinkerers andgovernment grants.Why do magic, then, when you can drop acid? Or undergo a few years of depthanalysis? Or go into a trance watching television or listening to your iPod?There was only one thing left and it was the hallmark of ceremonial magic.Communication with the Unseen. Traffic with extraterrestrial beings. Dinnerdates with the discarnate. As early as the 1950s, Kenneth Grant and his circlerealized that the only thing separating magic from science was the ultimateambition: contact with the Otherworldly. Rather than sitting passively on acouch and recounting one's dreams, Grant said let us become active participantsin our dreams. Let us study and employ dream control. Let us revert the normalprocesses of mind and body until we pass through the Gate into another mode ofbeing entirely.Let us take back our souls before the scientists and the shrinks wash, rinse,and spin-dry our brains. Let us boldly go where no man, woman, computer nerd, orintelligence officer has gone before. The people running our massive,space-based telescopes are probing the universe in ways never before thoughtpossible; they are looking at the beginning of the universe in the seconds afterthe Big Bang, and taking snapshots of it to show their kids.The only alternative left to the magician is to (a) posit the existence of auniverse invisible to human eyes (aided or unaided) and (b) go there.It may be true that one day science will be so advanced that it will beindistinguishable from magic, but that's not the point of orders like theTyphonian which put the human being back in the center of the cosmos. The worldhas become so enamored of its toys that it sits and waits patiently for the nextnew development, the next smartphone, the next flat screen TV. The toys havebecome the center of the universe; the tools are replacing the mind, and as theydo they replace the spirit. Technology is replacing pure science.But magic can be done on the cheap. All it takes is determination, discipline,and practice. It is not for the couch potato or anyone looking for a quick fix.And that is why it is safe from the sweaty palms of the technocrats. For now.Grant's thesis is the same as Lovecraft's to a certain extent. They bothconcentrate on contact with extraterrestrial, supermundane creatures. Lovecraftfantasized about it; Grant tried to figure out how it could be done. ButLovecraft was a scientist and an atheist. The concept of sex with aliensfrightened and disgusted him. Grant was a magician, and the possibilities of sexwith aliens was like something out of Star Trek: weird, maybe, but notnecessarily a bad thing. Orgiastic rites in the jungles to summon Cthulhu? “Igot that,” says Grant.But this is all much more important than that, more important than the author'sglib references. It comes down to more than how far magic or science can takethe human race. It is about who owns the process.One of the author's favorite thinkers is Michel Foucault. Now Foucault was awild man himself. Check out his photographs. Read his books. He was French, butdon't hold that against him. Foucault knew that a central focus of the State wascontrol of the human body. Humans are viewed as expendable assets by the State(and, as we know, by the corporations as well). Human beings are to becontrolled, manipulated, exploited, but never respected or elevated. Humans areforce-fed bad food, bad religion, bad politics, bad economics. They are sent bythe millions to fight and die in inexplicable conflicts. They are told what toeat, what to wear, how to behave.And for the most part, humans do behave. They are desensitized by media,threatened by governments, kept on subsistence diets, and generally lied to byeveryone.But Set, the Dark Lord, is not about behaving.Thelema was brought to the earth as a means of spiritual liberation, as anannouncement that big changes were taking place. It claims to empower theindividual, to introduce that individual to his or her true potential to becomekings and queens in their own kingdoms. But to some, the solar aspect of the NewAeon looked a little too much like more of the same: hierarchies handing downencyclicals, governing the Minervals, deciding what is and is not kosher.Kissing up to the Ninth Degrees. Nodding sagely when outrageous claims ofadvanced spiritual attainments were made. The same old song and dance, to some.Not what they signed on for.Crowley became nervous when disciples started to take his message of spiritualindependence seriously and acted on it. Goodbye, Frater Achad. Goodbye, JackParsons.Control of the apparatus became more important as each decade went by. That isthe way of all groups, all religious movements. It's what happened toChristianity, which today bears little or no resemblance to the original. Twoentire branches of the Church—the Catholics, and the Eastern Orthodox—split overa single word in the Creed and have remained separate for the last thousandyears. Oh, sure, there was politics involved, too. What's your point?What Grant envisioned was a far-flung network of Thelemic cells—power-zones ashe calls them—each investigating their own aspects of the Mauve Zone on theirown but getting whatever help or support the home office can provide. As aninternational businessman in the last decades of the twentieth century, theauthor had a far-flung network of power-zones himself: they were calledrepresentative offices and they were established in countries around the world.They were largely autonomous, but had to report to me on a regular basis so Icould help them to achieve their goals. It's a system that works, rather thanhaving all the sales and marketing people sitting on their collective muladharachakras in the home office, using the phone and trying to look busy. You needpeople in the field.Grant knew this, and he put people in the field. It's just that the field inGrant's case was the Tunnels of Set.The information these cells came back with was unintelligible for the most part,as one might expect. While in the Tunnels, everything seemed consistent and theexperiences were genuine, and the synchronicties multiplied. Out of the Tunnelsand trying to make sense of the experiences, the data often was baffling and theimport uncertain. It would take years of attention to the minutiae of theexperiences to render them at all useful to others involved in the same project.That is where Grant's feverish, extreme form of Kabbalistic analysis came toplay.The words, phrases, numbers, and associations jumble, struggle, leap, andslither from Grant's mind like the rantings of a schizophrenic on the subway.One wonders at times if the pages of the Typhonian Trilogies were written incrayon on the backs of flea market flyers. But Grant was sane. He was a lucid,functioning, and dedicated individual trying desperately to tell us somethingand realizing—as do all mystics—that normal human language is not equal to thetask. So, sure, a lot of his gematria is suspect but then he knew that going in:There can be no association of ideas, no correspondences of any kind, betweennumbers or the ideas which they represent, except in the consciousness of theirsubject, because no thing exists as an objective reality, ... Numbers can meanto the qabalist precisely what he wishes them to mean within the framework ofhis magical universe. ... This is the basis of the science of numbers, and therationale of numerology as a creative art distinct from a merely interpretativegauge of phenomenal probabilities.203 [part0012_split_001.html#aft203]Grant calls this “creative gematria.” It's the point at which this author hasthe hardest time with his works, for it implies a breezy lack of concern withany kind of consistency, and is thus relatively useless for demonstratingconnections and associations to others. While his philosophical reasoning may besound from the point of view of advaita or non-dualist thinking in which everynumber is the same as any other number, it is not useful for paying the bills.It may work well on a subjective level as the magician makes his way throughunfamiliar psychic territory and uses these number games as a way of leavingbreadcrumbs along the trail so he can find his way back, but when it comes timeto try to convince the rest of us that these connections exist, then we are backto the crayons and the schizophrenic in the subway car. Reading Grant is oftenan exercise in stripping away the gematria—the pages and pages of it—in order toget to the straight prose, for it is in the straight prose that he makes hismost astonishing claims, his most ambitious statements. The creative gematriaadds little to the experience and, in fact, can be quite distracting.There can be no Typhonian Tradition without Lovecraft, and I will tell you why.The stories of H. P. Lovecraft provide the narrative for this form of Thelema.The protagonists and antagonists one finds in his stories can be identifiedamong the initiates of the Orders and their bewildering experiences in theTunnels of Set. Lovecraft is all about Darkness, and so is the TyphonianTradition.But even more to the point, the very name “Typhonian” in Grant's usage impliesan ancient Tradition, one that goes back to before “monumental Egypt” as hecalls it, before the days of the pyramids and the Sphinx—when Egypt was stillreally an African country with the combination of African religion and magicthat would be distilled in later centuries into the Egyptian forms we knowtoday. Grant's project is to go back to the pre-literate, pre-historic timesbecause there is where the money is buried. He wants to take us back to theancient civilizations that he opines once existed on the earth, like Atlantisand Lemuria. And he wants us, at the same time, to go to the stars.And that is Lovecraft's project, as well. Lovecraft wrote about nothing elsesave this Tradition. The Great Old Ones, the entombed High Priest Cthulhu, andall the other creatures that populate his stories with horror and gore, are allatavisms of those times, and they share one thing in common: they came from thegreat Vastness of deep space and deep time. None of this penny-ante foolingaround with the planetary spirits for Lovecraft (or Grant). Oh, no. That's forthe tyros. “Planets?” you can hear Grant saying. “We don't need your stinkingplanets! We've got the stars, baby!”This was the original magic, the Ur-magic, the magic that was reserved for theinitiates. Any fool can watch the sun and the moon and come up with a ritualform based on the year, the seasons, the rising of the Nile. But it takes time,patience, dedication and an uncommon intelligence to watch the stars at night,every night, for years and years, and build star charts, maps, tables ofdeclination and right ascension, and to measure the distances between thesevastly-distant points of light in tiny incremental fractions of numbers. Andthen to realize that something important is going on up there, something“monumental,” and it has a direct effect on what goes on here, on the earth, onthe place They visited countless Aeons ago. And to which They might one dayreturn.The Typhonians.The very word we use in the modern age for referring to otherworldly ideas,planes, levels is “astral,” which means “starry.” It is the Starry Wisdom cultof Lovecraft's story “The Haunter of the Dark.” We hear talk of the “astralplane” and the “astral body” and rarely stop to consider what that means. It isthe astral self that is indestructible, that is capable of doing the kind oftime and space traveling that both Grant and Lovecraft describe. And entirecults were built around its cultivation and use.One of Grant's power-zones, the K'rla Cell, was designed with just that idea inmind. He describes it in Beyond the Mauve Zone, and tells of the intention ofits members to contact Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth, both Lovecraftian entities, andto use “psychosexual dynamics concealed in the Necronomicon.”204[part0012_split_001.html#aft204] This group eventually identified the starBetelgeuse as the home of the Elder Gods, and a black hole somewhere in theconstellation Sagittarius as the home of the Great Old Ones.It is this kind of magical practice that allows Grant to write seeminglyoutrageous statements (for a serious occultist) as the following:Yog-Sothoth is the zenith of which Tutulu is the nadir, As solstitial pointsthey are balanced by their equinoctial counterparts East and West, representedin the Necronomicon cycle by Hastur and Shub Niggurath. The full complexformulates the Great Cross which typifies the crossing over from matter tospirit. This is represented on the Tree of Life by Daäth, and by Death in theVoodoo imagery of Baron Samedhi.205 [part0012_split_001.html#aft205]Well, you wanted us to take seriously stories about talking snakes, burningbushes, and Sodom and Gomorrah as the basis for a religious current that haslasted more than five thousand years; why not replace all of that with the GreatOld Ones and Shub Niggurath, the “Goat with a Thousand Young”? Grant is sayingwe need a new narrative, because the old one is not working. The old one is notup to the challenges we will soon face as resources become limited, fanatics getthe Bomb, and governments go all Emperor Nero on our ass. At least, with theNecronomicon Gnosis, we look the danger straight in the Eye. We grapple with theunpleasantness, the threats, the tension and stress of knowing that there issome spectacularly ugly catastrophe lurking at the edges of our consciousness asthe alien forces of which Grant writes so eloquently mass at the rent in theveil, waiting for the Gate to open ... or are already pouring in.The Book of Revelation, of Apocalypse, where we first encountered the ScarletWoman and the Beast was written at a time when it seemed civilization was comingto an end, much like the present age. Empires were at stake. Nations were beingswallowed whole. The Jewish revolt had failed, and that failure would haveconsequences for the next two thousand years. And in 33 CE, “God so loved theworld that he gave his only-begotten Son.”Well, guess what? It's two thousand years later, and God has changed his mind."},{"pageContent":"THE ENDWho knows the end?

Much of Grant's workinvolved identifying these forces, trying to understand them, to place themsomewhere within a context with which we are already familiar—but not inreducing them to a simple equation of Cthulhu = Set. He knew there was much moreto it than that. Yet, such shorthand coding is useful in the beginning for itsets the parameters of the problem in a creative way. When we start with Cthulhu= Set we will eventually wonder in which ways are they the same, and in whichways are they different. What can Set tell us about Cthulhu, and vice versa? Whyis Set “real” and Cthulhu is not? And is that statement true?The Typhonian Tradition works at that very point where human imagination andcreativity have provided the world with its great religions and its great art.They are all, in a sense, works of imagination. They all come from the sameplace. The direct experience of the Divine can be horrifying and potentiallydeadly; the Bible is full of such stories. So is Lovecraft. So is Grant.Magicians don't try to build ethical structures around their experiences and tryto tell other people how to live their lives. Well ... they shouldn't, anyway.Crowley's dictum, quoted towards the beginning of this study, may very well bewrong. The aim of magic should not be religion, at least not as we understandit. Magic is an artform, and you don't create religions based on a painting or apop song. You just create more magic.Magic is the “science and art of causing change to occur in conformity withwill” according to Crowley. That doesn't sound much like religion. Whenmagicians stop doing magic, they create religions. The context of magicalsystems that arose out of the Judaeo-Christian tradition was linear: there was abeginning, the Creation, and an end, the Apocalypse. Everyone's eye was on thefinish line. Thus there was a beginning and an end to magic, as well.But the Typhonian Tradition says that there was no beginning—just ancientdays—and no end, because the universe is eternal and the yugas and the kalpasrepeat themselves endlessly. Time is not linear. What goes around ... well, youknow.The magic of the Typhonian Tradition, therefore, is an ongoing project with noend in sight, which basically means no religion in the foreseable future. Andthat's probably a good thing. The Dark Lord represents chaos, not stability, notestablished institutions like churches and states. As humans, we crave stabilitybut we need to get our heads around the chaos first. Because chaos is what'shappening. We need to come to terms with the Dark Lord.In the Necronomicon, the initiatory program is important. The rising on theseven levels of initiation is a requirement before one goes sailing off intodeep space. One must be psychologically prepared for what will follow. Theseseven stages have their analogues in Chinese alchemy and in European alchemy.They are phases of purification and reification (and here purification is meantin a purely technical sense and not in a moral one). In India, one rises onechakra at a time, and it can take years to accomplish the entire program.But once that is done, it's open season on trafficking with discarnate entities.The Necronomicon Gnosis is perfectly consistent with both the Egyptian and theThelemic currents, as Grant insists. The literature of each helps to explain theother; the practices of each amplify and extend the other. The psycho-sexualtechniques of Tantra can be employed in rituals of the Necronomicon as well aswithin the Egyptian context, breathing new life into each. Just imagine for amoment equating Cthulhu with Kundalini, which is precisely what Grant suggested.Or equating both with the Egyptian deity Set. That was Grant's intention and itis obvious from his work that he (and his followers) was dedicated to just that.The Dark Lord, like Kundalini and Cthulhu, lies dead but dreaming. Inpsycho-sexual terms, at the base of the spine waiting to be “evoked” through the“orgiastic rites” of the followers of Cthulhu. In magical terms, simultaneouslydeep within the bowels of the earth and at some unimaginable distance in deepspace.Thank God for quantum theory and non-locality.We have seen that Crowley wrote a series of texts in 1907 that he called theHoly Books, and that these were “received” texts, much like the Book of the Lawitself. These writings are the most clearly Lovecraftian of all the pre-GrantThelemic material, with the possible exception of Jack Parsons and his Book ofthe Antichrist, written in 1948 and a year after the Roswell incident and theKenneth Arnold UFO sighting ... and a year after the death of Crowley himself.I believe it is fair to say that Crowley did not understand completely theimport of the Holy Books. (It has been demonstrated that it took Theodor Reussto alert him to the fact that one of his rituals, Liber XXXVI or the StarSapphire ritual, was an encoded form of the IXth degree ritual of the OTO.) TheHoly Books in general are rather dark, and the language is pure Gothic horror.These are, the author contends, works that more properly belong to theNecronomicon Gnosis aspect of Thelema. Read in that light, their meanings becomeclearer.The same can be said of the work of Jack Parsons. He was intent on incarnatingthe Red Goddess, and equally intent on incarnating the Anti-Christ. He wasfocused on bringing about the End of Days so that the New Aeon could dawn. Yet,there is something faintly disturbing about the Book of Antichrist that recallssome of the accounts we have of alien abductions. In this brief text, he writesof being called by Babalon to continue the work he began with Hubbard in 1946,two years earlier. He then proceeds to describe a strange scene in which heapproaches “cyclopean ruins” and a tower of Black Basalt. A robed figure showshim four of his previous lives, one as Simon Magus, then as Gilles de Raiz, EarlBothwell, and Cagliostro. Then, in a line that almost prefigures what abducteeswould say, he writes:And thereafter I was taken within and saluted the Prince of that place, andthereafter things were done to me of which I may not write ...The brief account of his “Black Pilgrimmage” ends with him taking the Oath ofthe Abyss, filled with terror and foreboding, after being told, “It is notcertain that you will survive ...” It is then that he assumes the identity ofthe Antichrist.He would die in an explosion less than four years later. He was 38 years old.His mother committed suicide a few hours later upon learning of the death of herson.This is a Lovecraftian scenario, straight out of “The Dunwich Horror” or anynumber of his other stories: the magician who is also a scientist, summoningspirits, trafficking with discarnate entities, taking mysterious oaths in fearand trembling, proclaiming himself the Anti-Christ, and then dying in aspectacular ball of fire.And at some point we have to accept that this is what is happening: that thebizarre themes we find in the purple prose of Gothic fiction have become theoperating principle of our world.Lovecraft wrote that the artists and the sensitives are the first to notice theincoming forces of the Great Old Ones. He could have added magicians to thatlist and, indeed, there were occultists among those who, in “The Call ofCthulhu,” responded to the Call. What he failed to realize—as an atheist—is thatthe occultists can push back.Those who “push back” in his stories are not occultists, but academics,scholars, intelligent third parties who find the unholy books, figure out theforbidden formulae, and then send the Old Ones back to where they came byclosing and sealing the Gate. The Typhonian Tradition, however, is composed ofthe very type of people Lovecraft's stories demonize: the magicians themselves.They have the unholy books, they know the forbidden formulae. And it is true,they do open the Gate.That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secretpriests would take the great Cthulhu from His tomb and revive His subjects andresume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind wouldhave become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, withlaws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling injoy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill andrevel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust ofecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alivethe memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.—H. P.

For someone who wants to dig deeper into this system, this isa glaring hole in the data. There are some good reasons for this, and one ofthem is that this is a subject fraught with complexity and a bewildering numberof Sanskrit terms and Vedic references, not all of which agree with each other.Another reason might be the advisability of using Vedic astrology in conjunctionwith the Ritual of the Fire Snake. And Vedic astrology is not well-known in theWest (aside from a few popular books on the subject) and it is virtually ignoredamong the Thelemic magicians of the author's acquaintance (admittedly, veryfew!). To become reasonably expert in Vedic astrology would require a goodknowledge of Sanskrit and tremendous patience with the rather disorganized andconfusing array of books on the subject, and this is somewhat lacking amongoccultists in the West.So what the author offers here is a list of the kalas with their associationsand a discussion of the kalas and the tithis: the phases of the Moon which arethe same in number as the kalas and which can afford us a better understandingof the whole subject. In addition, the Nityas will also be listed: these are thedeities associated with the individual phases, or tithis. In this way, it ishoped that the new generation of Typhonian magicians (and those simplyinterested in the subject) will have access to a more profound understanding ofthe praxis.As a side note, there will often be those who object to bringing in Asianconcepts and practices into a seemingly purely Western or European discipline.The objection may be from an academic, anti-universalist point of view or simplymay be a matter of taste. But the Typhonian Tradition, as the author understandsit, is concerned with the pre-dynastic Egyptian traditions and those that aremuch older even than Sumer or Mohenjo Daro. Ifwe recognize that control over theserpent brain is a key feature of this type of magic, then we also mustrecognize that this part of the human anatomy developed before the races hadbecome differentiated from each other. What we share is the basicpsycho-biological structure of our anatomy. The practices that work in Indiawill also work in Mexico, in Europe, and everywhere else once linguistic andcultural differences have been addressed. It's just that they have been codifiedbetter in India and China, which—as many academics now seem to agree—was thesource for the Western alchemical tradition, even though they were patentlybiological (and not strictly or exclusively) mineral.The Typhonian Tradition, it should be obvious by now, rejects nothing andaccepts whatever works."},{"pageContent":"THE KALASQuite often, the kalas are identified with the tithis, or the phases of theMoon. However, the phases of the Moon have their own nomenclature (really littlemore than numbers) while the kalas have more descriptive names.There are sixteen kalas, of which only fifteen are considered visible. Theirnames are as follows:Image [../images/00022.jpeg]Image [../images/00023.jpeg]In the above list, the last kala—Amrita—is the invisible one. Readers willrecall that amrita is the word signifying the elixir vitae, the soma thatdescends from the cranial vault (or from a space a little above it) down throughthe body once union between Kundalini and Shiva has been attained. For thisreason, the kala named Amrita is ruled by a Nitya (in this case, a kind ofGoddess of the kala) called the Maha Tripura Sundari, i.e., the Goddess of theSri Chakra. The other Nityas are as follows:"},{"pageContent":"NITYASImage [../images/00024.jpeg]Image [../images/00025.jpeg]Thus, as we have said, the last Nitya—Maha Tripura Sundari, also known as theGoddess Sixteen—is not visible, and is associated with the kala Amrita."},{"pageContent":"TITHISAs mentioned, the names of the tithis are really just numbers in Sanskrit, butsince one will come across the names again and again in the Tantric and Jyotishliterature, the full list is given here: 1. Pratipada 2. Dwitiya (i.e., “second”) 3. Tritiya (i.e., “third” etc.) 4. Chaturthi 5. Panchami 6. Shashthi 7. Saptami 8. Ashtami (this is the Half Moon phase) 9. Navami 10. Dashami 11. Ekadashi 12. Dwadashi 13. Trayodashi 14. Chaturdashi 15. Purnima (for the Full Moon) or Amavasya (for the New Moon).Now, to complicate things a little further, we must take the waning and waxingperiods of the Moon into consideration. There are thus a total of 30 kalas ortithis to make a complete lunar cycle. In Indian astrology these are dividedinto the Shukla Paksha (the waxing Moon) and the Krishna Paksha (the waningMoon). Thus, we can be more specific in our enumeration of the tithis, asfollows: 1. Shukla Pratipada 2. Shukla Dwitiya 3. Shukla Tritiya 4. Shukla Chaturthi 5. Shukla Panchami 6. Shukla Shashthi 7. Shukla Saptami 8. Shukla Ashtami 9. Shukla Navami 10. Shukla Dashami 11. Shukla Ekadasi 12. Shukla Dwadashi 13. Shukla Trayodashi 14. Shukla Chaturdashi 15. Purnima (Full Moon) 16. Krishna Pratipada 17. Krishna Dwitiya 18. Krishna Tritiya 19. Krishna Chaturthi 20. Krishna Panchami 21. Krishna Shashthi 22. Krishna Saptami 23. Krishna Ashtami 24. Krishna Navami 25. Krishna Dashami 26. Krishna Ekadasi 27. Krishna Dwadashi 28. Krishna Trayodashi 29. Krishna Chaturdashi 30. Amavasya (New Moon)The first tithi—Shukla Pratipat—is 12 degrees of the Moon away from union withthe Sun. The second tithi—Shukla Dwitiya—is thus 24 degrees of separation fromthe Sun, etc. This concept is quite important because the relationship betweenthe Moon and the Sun is central to Indian astrology which computes everythingfrom the Moon rather than the Sun. As we mentioned before, Indian astrology isnot solar-based. The positions of the planets are computed from the Moon, andthe houses of the astrological chart are similarly constructed. In addition, theactual positions of the planets against the sidereal zodiac are employed, andthe conventional dates of the zodiacal signs are not used. One's birthday,therefore, is calculated every year by reference to the original positions ofboth the Sun and the Moon on the day of birth. Thus, if one were born with theSun in Libra and the Moon in the fifth tithi, one's birthday is not celebrateduntil both of those positions repeat themselves. So a birthday in Indianastrology is both solar return and lunar return. The exact degrees will not berepeated each year, of course, but to some Vedic astrologers the emphasis willbe on the lunar phase (the tithi) being the same with the solar degree remainingthe variable. When a Vedic astrologer computes an annual transit horoscope, forinstance, it is calculated from the tithi (the same one that occurred on the dayof birth) rather than from the solar return position. Both are taken intoconsideration, of course, because the angle between the Sun and the Moon—the twoluminaries, but also representing the two essences that gave life to theindividual, the kala and the bindu, the “blood” and the semen, the red and thewhite—is of utmost importance. It has been a defect of Western astrology thatthe emphasis is on the solar aspects of the cosmos rather than the mingling ofthe essences of Shiva and Shakti, of the Moon and the Sun.Each of the phases of the moon—the tithis—have yantras (magic diagrams) andmantras associated with them. Each of the Nityas has her own yantra, mantra, andshakti as well. They also represent the sixteen vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet.According to several of the Tantras, the fifteen Nityas are to be visualized asoccupying spaces around the central, downward-pointing, triangle of the SriCakra. This inner triangle represents the yoni of the Goddess. In the verycenter of this triangle is the bindu, the dot, that represents the SixteenthKala and therefore the Goddess Sixteen herself.Recourse to a book on Indian astrology would be helpful to the reader who wishesto understand this concept better, especially with regard to the kalas, thetithis and their ruling Nityas. Inclusion of the appropriate mantras and yantrasas part of the Ritual of the Fire Snake as offered by Grant may be helpful aswell, at least in the beginning, in order to orient oneself with regard to thechakras, the kalas, the phases of the Moon, etc.While this information concerns the vaginal secretions, the male secretion isnot ignored entirely. It is believed by yogins, Ayurvedic physicians, and Indianalchemists that it takes fourteen days to replenish the semen after anejaculation; this is roughly equivalent to one paksha—i.e., either the waning orthe waxing period of the Moon—so it may be safe to say that they are connected.Remember that as the Moon waxes, amrita is being poured into it (according tothe Tantras); i.e., it is being stored in the lunar vessel. The day after theFull Moon, the amrita begins pouring back to the Sun until the Moon iscompletely empty. It is the Tantrika who interrupts this process by drawing theamrita down into his or her own body. A relevant image would be the Tarot Trumpknown as Temperance in the old decks, which depicts a blonde Angel in robes andwings pouring liquid from one cup to another. The Tarot trump known as the Stardepicts a naked woman pouring the liquid onto the earth; above her head areseven stars, surrounding a larger star in the central axis.Thus, a word to the Wise is sufficient."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARY(E) indicates an Egyptian word(G) indicates a word from Greek(H) indicates a Hebrew word(Ha) indicates a word from Haitian Creole(J) indicates a Javanese word(L) indicates a Lovecraftian term(P) indicates a Pali term(S) indicates a word from Sanskrit(Su) indicates Sumerian(T) indicates a word peculiarly Thelemic(Ti) indicates a Tibetan wordAdvaita (S) Non-duality; a mystical state in which Subject and Object are one.Aeon (G) Gnosticism: an emanation from God, personified or identified as aparticular Being or Characteristic.
