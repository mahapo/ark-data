The very idea that> mythology is something one invents suggests an unpardonable arrogance, as if> myth were at our beck and call. Rather, it is we, the will of each and every> one of us, that are at the beck and call of myth.— Roberto Calasso1> ... one may regard the myth as a projection of an existential reality which> seeks its own truth in a total view of things ...— Hans Jonas2> I came to this study many years ago. In 1968, the University Press of New York> published an edition of A. E. Waite's 1919 The Works of Thomas Vaughan: Mystic> and Alchemist along with a new Foreword by “Father of the Beats” Kenneth> Rexroth (1905–1982). I had been studying another of Waite's works, The Book of> Ceremonial Magic, as well as Aleister Crowley's Magick In Theory and Practice,> along with a copy of the Dao De Jing in English translation. I was still in> high school in the Bronx and, well, it was the Sixties.> The very first article I wrote for my high school magazine (and thus the very> first article I wrote about anything) was about alchemy. It concerned the> famous case of the seventeenth century scientist Jan Baptist van Helmont> (1579–1644) and a demonstration of the transmutation of base metal into gold> in his presence, affirmed in his own writings. It was the Foreword by Rexroth> in the Waite book, though, that captivated me at the time and which still> resonates all these decades later.3 Rexroth set out the curriculum that I was> to follow—from alchemy to Chinese and Indian alchemy, yoga, and Tantra—in> order to understand what Thomas and Rebecca Vaughan were up to in the> seventeenth century. In fact, it was Rexroth's allusion to Chinese alchemy> that inspired me to begin a study of written Chinese so that I would be able> to locate and translate alchemical texts that had so far not been made> available in English. It was that study which developed into a serious> interest in Mandarin, that eventually—in 1984—found me fully involved in China> trade and which set me on a course that would see me spending the better part> of three decades in Asia.> All this because of a collection of writings by a seventeenth century Welsh> alchemist and a foreword by a twentieth century American poet. Yet, I am not> the only one to have been affected this way by Vaughan's work.> His reputation was revived in a work by Mary Anne Atwood (1817–1910) entitled> A Suggestive Inquiry into Hermetic Philosophy. Originally published in 1850> and almost immediately pulled from circulation, most copies destroyed, this> erudite and penetrating look at alchemy was the result of Atwood's study of> the subject while she still lived at home with her occultist father. It was> her father who suggested to her that she write what was essentially the prose> version of a long, hermetic poem he was composing. She did so, and her father> had the 600-page book published, but without first reading it himself. When he> finally did, he was shocked at the way his daughter had revealed so many> alchemical secrets. He bought all the copies he could find and he and his> daughter burned them in the garden outside their home, along with the only> draft of his poem. A few copies of her book escaped the holocaust, however,> which is how we are able to read it today.> She never wrote another book again even though she lived for sixty more years.> There is much food here for speculation and wonder, and not a little sadness,> but we will restrain ourselves to the matter at hand, which is Atwood's> appraisal of the work of Thomas Vaughan. She writes, “... the one Art and> medium of vital perfectibility is more clearly shown in his writings than in> those of any other English author.”4 She also mentions his strange and> controversial death, by saying it was due to “an overdose of the elixir.”5> It was this reference to Vaughan that excited A. E. Waite himself and moved> him along a path of esoteric study.6 This path eventually led him to the> Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and to the authorship of dozens of heavy> tomes on virtually every occult science and discipline known at the time: from> works on Kabbalah to alchemy, ceremonial magic, secret societies, the Tarot,> the Holy Grail, and the like.> And it was due to Waite's fascination with Vaughan that this writer developed> his own lifelong interest, wound up in China, visited Daoist temples in> Beijing and Shanghai, found himself running a sales and marketing operation> from a base in Kuala Lumpur, photographing Indian temples in Java, hunting> Nazis in South America, and a host of other strange occupations ... all> because of Thomas Vaughan, A. E. Waite, and Kenneth Rexroth.> And especially because of alchemy.> IN MY CAREER I HAVE PUBLISHED some dozen books or more, several of which have> been translated into numerous languages, and I have written many more than I> have actually published. Over the course of the past forty years or so people> have asked me to diverge from my usual position of uncommitted observer and> reporter on such things as religion, politics, cults, and esoterica in order> to write or speak more frankly on what it is that I believe to be true.> Normally, I leave that to readers to decide for themselves; I don't like it> when someone who is supposed to be a historian or investigative journalist> intrudes too much into the story being told. I like to make up my own mind> about things: just give me the data, the facts as they are known, and I will> take it from there. At the same time, I am very aware of the criticism> levelled at historians and journalists that there is no way to extricate> oneself or one's point of view from the story being told. There is no absolute> standard of truth; every history is a narrative, a story being told from a> specific point of view no matter how hard we try to be objective. Indeed, my> own research over the past decades has shown me that most of what we believe> to be history is actually carefully crafted fiction.> In the case of such subjects as alchemy and Tantra this characteristic is even> more pronounced. All works on both subjects (written by the practitioners> themselves) are essentially works of fiction: they use a contrived language,> replete with metaphor and allegory, disinformation and misdirection. The> actual personalities and events described within these texts are surreal,> impossible, and beyond ordinary human experience. Yet the texts do reveal even> as they conceal. Like many spiritual texts, they refer to otherworldly events> and circumstances which the literal-minded would refer to as fantasies,> delusions, etc. These texts fall within a twilight zone of literature: they> purport to be about real events and circumstances, but even a casual glance at> them shows that this claim is difficult to defend, at least from a modern> perspective in the aftermath of the scientific revolution. If they are not> real—or describe real events— then what are they about? They are obviously not> meant to entertain: the language, while fantastical, often is difficult,> turgid, even lugubrious. There is no perceivable story line, no narrative> voice. This, taken with the insistence that what is being discussed is not> what is being discussed, and you have an impossible text that defies any> attempt at interpretation. Perhaps for this very reason there is a cottage> industry in alchemical texts as well as in books claiming to be Tantric or to> reveal Tantrism. After all, in the absence of any real information about> either, one can pretty much say anything one wants by way of “revealing” the> “truth” about alchemy or Tantra and who is there to contradict?> Astute readers will know that I have contributed to this literature myself, at> least insofar as Tantra is concerned. But in my defense, I prefaced that work7> with a discussion of how difficult it is to authoritatively describe Tantra,> when Tantra itself resists all attempts at a clinical, unimpeachable,> description. For my evidence, I used the existing temples found all over the> Indonesian archipelago as a way of showing—through architecture and> statuary—what Tantrism meant to the people who lived there in the past and to> those who still use these temples today. It was while researching that book> that I came to the gradual understanding that what I was seeing before my eyes> was nothing less than an alchemical literature written in stone, the Asian> equivalent perhaps of Fulcanelli's Gothic cathedrals. The obsessive focus on> am[images/00053.jpg]ta—the Elixir Vitae of the alchemists—in the Javanese> temples was one key to this discovery; the focus on the lingam and yoni (the> male and female symbols, respectively) in Javanese temple architecture was> another. I had also spent considerable time among the Chinese texts on Daoism,> particularly a form of Daoism that has the most similarity with Western> alchemy, to see if there was any kind of a continuum of knowledge bridging> Chinese, Indian and European forms of alchemy, and if one could use the terms> of one discipline to decode the other.> Of course, one can take these similarities too far and be accused of the sin> of universalism; no one is more sensitive to this critique than I. Thus, I> decided to go back and review not only Tantric literature—both primary and> secondary sources—but also Western, European alchemical literature. I wanted> to see if I could “read” an alchemical text while using Tantric metaphor and> allegory as my decryption keys.> The result is this book.> I have left the work of demonstrating historical connections and influences to> those academics who have a head start on me in these areas, focusing instead> on the actual process of alchemy and how one could conceivably translate a> work of alchemy into a Tantric text, and vice versa. I hope to show that> Western alchemy is nothing less than Indian Tantra and Chinese Daoism in> European dress. There are other scholars who have approached this comparison> gingerly and with an eye to protecting their tenures. There are still others> who—more secure in their professions—have come forward with statements that> are supportive of this point of view, such as Moshe Idel, Raphael Patai, and> others. The influence of Asian forms of alchemy on European forms probably> made its way along the Silk Route from Central Asia, and from there to Arab> and Islamic scholars and practitioners, before they surfaced in the European> texts. It is also possible that this was two-way traffic, and that discoveries> made by European alchemists began to influence, in turn, their Asian> counterparts. Eventually someone will sort all this out but in the meantime> life is short and the purpose of this book is to jump-start the dialogue.> THERE IS A CONTINUUM OF SORTS in my own life. My earlier focus on Javanese> Tantrism led me to the discovery that the iconic form of Tantra represented by> Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism—the Kālacakra Tantra—has its origins in Java. In> other words, the Dalai Lama in his many initiations worldwide in the> Kalachakra tradition represents a Javanese Buddhist and Javanese Tantric> lineage; of which the Dalai Lama's consecration of Borobudur in Java is but> one acknowledgment. My own work on the Kalachakra Tantra (begun in 2007)> proceeds apace, but in the meantime what I offer here is an approach to both> Tantra and alchemy that attempts to clarify some of the central issues of> both. My thesis has ramifications for the study of Kabbalah and Jewish> mysticism, as well, as it becomes increasingly difficult to study any of these> disciplines in a vacuum. Kabbalah—particularly the Zohar—has many elements in> common with Tantra and some Kabbalistic ideas are represented in the works of> European alchemists. What we have here is nothing less than the rudiments of> the “secret tradition” that has been hinted at or claimed by various societies> and guilds over the centuries. It requires only a different perspective in> order to see the outlines of this tradition come into sharper focus.> I hasten to add—as I have before, in other places—that I am not the recipient> of any esoteric lineage or occult initiation, so I am not breaking any vows.> What I discover, I do so on my own. Therefore any mistakes I make are also my> own. True, I have spent considerable time studying various spiritual and> religious disciplines up close and personal (rather than solely from the> comfort of a library or computer screen), and these include the Black Crown> initiation from the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa when he visited New York City in> 19768; learning how to pray in various mosques around the world; making> offerings and meditating in Chinese Buddhist temples in New York, Singapore,> Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Melaka, and elsewhere; attending Afro-Caribbean> rituals in various places around the world; and, of course, my youthful> episode among the Eastern Orthodox churches and their “wandering” versions,> through which I obtained ordination, elevation, and consecration over a period> of several years. As a teenager, I belonged to the American Society for> Psychical Research (ASPR) during the time that Dr. Karlis Osis was its> president, and was privileged to attend a presentation he gave in New York on> his ingestion of LSD. I have also been on intimate terms with the Wiccan> movement (since about 1973 or so) as well as various occult societies such as> the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and a European iteration of the A∴A∴ based> in Germany. However I was never initiated into any of these Orders (as their> leaderships will be eager to acknowledge!) regardless of some of the baseless> claims made by others. My Eastern Orthodox lineage does include a line going> back to Archbishop Theodotus De Witow who was also head of the Societas> Rosicruciana In America (S∴R∴I∴A∴) but that is pretty much as far as it goes.> Over the years persons have asked me why I have not joined this or that Order> or Society, to which I usually offer the famous rejoinder by Groucho Marx that> “I would not join any club that would have me as a member.” More seriously,> there has been so much abuse of status (real or imagined) by spiritual leaders> (both mainstream and fringe) in the past fifty years that joining any> spiritual organization and taking an oath to be obedient to it and to accept> its leadership as somehow spiritually elevated seems like a kind of moral> suicide. As someone who spent considerable time among the “wandering” bishops,> I can attest that it is only too easy to claim exalted ranks, degrees, and> grades for which one has no real justification, either in this world or some> Other. It is for this reason that Israel Regardie published his massive work> on the rituals of the Golden Dawn: to allow, even encourage, independent> esoteric work. Aleister Crowley himself published the grade system and> requirements of his A∴A∴, and even the rituals of the O.T.O. were once in> print. That does not mean, of course, that the secrets of these Orders have> been revealed: only the mechanisms by which one could attain them.> Therefore, what one reads here is the fruit of my peripatetic background and> some academic training,9 as well as close personal association with many> practitioners in the United States and abroad; but does not reflect the point> of view of any particular body of initiates or would-be initiates. This is as> it should be, since most Western alchemists were independent operators—unlike> the Tantrikas who belonged to one or another Circle in India, or the Chinese> practitioners who were members of one or another Daoist circle. I do believe,> however, that I am making a contribution to the field of Western alchemical> studies by bringing it back to its theoretical roots in the processes of> Creation: a mystery that has attracted the undivided attention of alchemist> and Tantrika, Kabbalist and Daoist, alike. Moreover, it is a mystery that is> not opposed to science or scientific discoveries or principles but instead> amplifies them in ways we might never expect.> What we will discover here is that alchemy describes a Process, indeed the> very same Process set in motion nearly fourteen billion years ago. It is a> Process involving light, and matter, and the relationship between the two, and> the exceptional role of human beings as constituent parts of that Process. It> rests at the heart of the conflict between those who believe that the world> was created seven thousand years ago and those who believe that it is the> result of the Big Bang.> It concerns the role of spirituality in a scientific age.> ONE OF THE REALIZATIONS that came to me during the course of my research was> the nature of alchemy itself. Those who have a passing interest in the subject> may believe that it concerns the transmutation of metals: something that> modern science—chemistry, physics—denies can occur, at least not in the way> the alchemists worked and not without a particle accelerator using tremendous> amounts of energy. Then, there are those who believe—along with the Swiss> psychiatrist and father of depth psychology, carl Gustav Jung—that alchemy is> concerned with psychological wholeness, with what Jung called “individuation,”> i.e., that alchemy is more of a spiritual science than an actual, mundane> affair involving crucibles and retorts.> More recently, there are those who—like Julius Evola, P. B. Randolph, and> Aleister Crowley—understood alchemy as having much more in common with> sexuality and eros on the one hand and Hermetism on the other.> And there are still others—mostly scientists and historians of science—who> characterize alchemy as a kind of proto-chemistry: a false start in the> scientific revolution.> They are all correct.> ONE OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING these various points of view is the undeniable> focus of the alchemists on Creation. The agenda of the alchemist is first to> understand the process of Creation and then to duplicate the elements of it as> closely as possible to achieve a similar result—but on a microcosmic (as> opposed to macrocosmic) scale. This could not be done within a purely> theoretical framework: theory and practice had to work hand-in-hand. The> theory was tested using actual elements under controlled conditions; the> alchemical laboratory therefore is not a chemical laboratory alone but a> laboratory of all of Nature.> It is extremely difficult to describe this practice because there is nothing> remotely like it in the rest of human experience. It is only when involved in> these procedures that the system itself becomes obvious, but in a way that> defies rational explanation. The reason for this is as simple as it is> incredible: alchemy is not an art, not a science, not in ways that we take for> granted. In order to understand what alchemy is, and does, one has to stand> outside Creation for a brief moment and realize that Creation itself is> ongoing.> If the physicists are correct the universe as we know it “began” nearly> fourteen billion years ago with something called the Big Bang. There was an> explosion—so goes the theory—and the universe expanded from that initial> “bang” and still is expanding at a tremendous rate of speed in all directions.> What this means is: all we are, all we see, all we experience, is part of this> expansion from that initial explosion. The desk where I write, the clothes I> wear, the sounds I hear, the food I eat, the people walking outside, the> raccoons raiding the garbage bins, even reality TV ... everything in human> experience is an artifact of this expansion, of the high-speed motion of> Creation itself.> We are used to thinking that Creation happened at a finite moment (the six> days of Creation in Genesis, for instance), stopped, and that everything since> then occurs separately; that Creation is the ground of everything that has> happened since. We are used to thinking that everything has been relatively> static since then. We are born, we live, we die. It all takes place along a> linear timeline, to be sure, but our lives are finite. Creation happened a> long time ago; we are here on Earth enjoying the aftermath.> But this is not so. Creation is still taking place. The universe has not> stopped expanding, which means that we are still in flux. Alchemy is the means> of understanding this simple fact, of realizing it, and then taking an active,> conscious role in the process.> Because that is what alchemy is: it's not an art, not a science, it's a> process. It is the process of Creation itself. That is why we say that alchemy> can be understood as chemistry, as physics, as spirituality, as psychology, as> biology, as sexuality, etc. For all of these sciences and arts proceed> directly from the moment of Creation—from the Big Bang—and thus share> essential qualities in common. The language of chemistry can be used just as> easily to describe alchemical processes as the language of biology or> psychology, etc. All of these fields of learning proceed from the same,> original source.> To coin a phrase, we may say that alchemy is not a noun, it's a verb.> AS IF IN VERIFICATION OF THIS CONCEPT the alchemical literature of ancient> China, ancient India, and medieval Europe are virtually identical in this> respect. The various texts share much of the same terminology, use the same> world-view, and have the same goals. The bizarre identification of chemical> processes with biological processes that we find in everything from the> manuscripts of Shangqing Daoist alchemy to Indian Tantric scriptures are the> most blatant evidence of this fact: alchemists all talk about the same> process.> And since it's a process, with elements that are relative to each other,> alchemical texts and illustrations can seem to contradict each other> considerably when viewed from a purely rational perspective. In some texts,> Sulfur is male and Mercury is female (for instance); in others, these gender> identities are reversed. This seems confusing, until you realize that all that> matters in the equation is that one is male and the other female. It is like> an algebraic equation in which x + y = z. X can be Sulfur, y can be Mercury,> and z can be Salt. Or x may be Mercury, and y may be Sulfur. In mathematical> terms, it doesn't matter. X + y will always equal z, whether or not x is> Mercury, sulfur, an elephant, or a ham sandwich. It is the equation that is> important and specifically the relation between the elements of the equation.> Add to this the fact that alchemical literature is written in a kind of code,> seemingly impossible to decipher rationally, and you have elevated this> process beyond the reach of those whose focus is narrowly limited to what can> be seen, and touched, and rationalized. The process of alchemy involves the> whole person—not only the rational mind, but the irrational, imaginative,> creative, emotional and psychological mind—in a practice that is designed to> reveal the inner workings of reality which is, of course, composed of all of> these elements.> For this reason, the practice of alchemy is considered dangerous. That is> because it involves the whole person and nothing else in life is the equal of> it. Thus, one cannot hold alchemy at arm's length. Imagine a scenario in which> you discover that your best friend, with whom you have grown up since birth,> has been working as a spy for another country. Has another name. Another> personal history. Other allegiances. Is someone else completely. Your sense of> reality will be shaken to its core; you will look back over the years you> spent together to see if there were clues that you missed, and to question> everything your friend has ever told you. In questioning all of this, you will> wind up questioning yourself. Your sense of the world around you would shift> so that you were no longer living in the same reality.> Alchemy reveals the mysteries hidden in Creation, mysteries that are hiding in> plain sight. Once seen, once experienced, they cannot be unseen,> unexperienced. They enable the alchemist to live in a world different from the> one into which he or she was born but which is, paradoxically, the same. A> world of dreams permeating the waking world.> But that is not the only danger.> The process involves the use of physical artifacts, the building blocks of> Creation, the invisible systems that propel us through the cosmos. Whether we> are using chemicals in a metallurgical approach, or our own biologies, or our> own psyches, we risk explosions, strokes, insanity. The sexual act that lead> to your conception is an artifact, an extension, of that moment fourteen> billion years ago; it shares elements in common with the instant of Creation,> and by looking at that moment you look back along the arc of time to where the> mysteries of life are revealed.> Alchemy is the science of associating yourself with the ‘movements’ of Time.10— Robert Kelly> The writings of Thomas Vaughan are luminous, but they require interpretation.> In order to interpret, to “decode,” Vaughan it is necessary to incorporate> elements from other disciplines, as Rexroth pointed out. In this study we will> fold in Tantric and Daoist texts and practices, as well as references to> Gnosticism and Hermeticism. Alchemy, more than any other area of study in the> field of religion or spirituality, is culturally transcendent—with adepts from> various parts of the world and from widely separated times and eras agreeing> on the essentials of something most of us cannot begin to grasp. In this way> it is similar to science and mathematics which are empirical in nature: a> scientific theory obtains in China as much as it does in America, regardless> of political posturing.> We will use specific texts from the tradition of nei dan, or “inner alchemy,”> as it was practiced in China more than a thousand years before Vaughan. This> type of alchemy is focused on developing the elixir vitae, the universal> medicine. We will also investigate Indian (and Tibetan) alchemy, a field that> has been illuminated most recently in the work of David Gordon White and Hugh> Urban, among others. Gnostic, Kabbalistic, and hermetic texts will also be> referenced as they are in closest proximity (in terms of space and time) to> the work of Vaughan, and influenced his teachers—from Marsilio Ficino and> Cornelius Agrippa to Michael Sendivogius, Johannes Reuchlin, and Raymond Lull.> In so doing, we will address ourselves to some of the most familiar concepts> in Vaughan's work and in Western alchemy in general, from the Philosopher's> Stone to the elixir vitae, the trinity of Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt, to the> prima materia, and the process of alchemical transmutation. We will examine> the instruments of the alchemical laboratory and describe their analogues in> the human body via the Asian alchemical traditions.> First, we will address the history of alchemy (briefly, and as it affects our> study of Vaughan) as well as the nature of the language used by alchemists to> describe their work: what has sometimes been called the “green language” or,> in India, the “twilight language.” Understanding the use of language and coded> illustrations and texts is crucial to an appreciation of the alchemical> environment. Even though Vaughan is perhaps the clearest of all writers on the> subject of alchemy, there is still much that defies rational analysis if we> use common definitions for the language and terms in his works.> Alchemy, as noted above, is about the moment of Creation: revisiting it,> dissecting it, reliving it. It is, like Tantra, a means of collapsing time.> This perspective is not unique to alchemy; the Kabbalists focused much of> their attention on the first book of the Torah, the book of Genesis which is> about that same moment of Creation. The Sefer Yetzirah—arguably the oldest> Kabbalistic work—is about Creation and the emanation of that First Cause> through the cosmos. All of these disciplines involve a going backwards along> the linear timeline, back to the First Moment, and then a corresponding motion> forwards, an acceleration of the outward expansion of the cosmos in order to> achieve—in this lifetime—a state of being that can only be compared to an> apotheosis. In Tantric circles, this is sometimes accomplished by rituals of> sexual polarity and conception taking place in a charnel ground: bringing> birth and death together in one place, one moment.

The first, of course, is Alchemy. We need to have at least a> working definition of what alchemy is, and that is not as easy as it may seem.> The second is Tantra, a field that is equally resistant to easy definition.> And then there is Thomas Vaughan himself, a bridge between the two. Trying to> discuss Vaughan's importance in any serious examination of Western alchemy> without knowing at least a little about him and his work may seem pointless,> but we must realize that there is not much about him that we do know and even> less about the most important relationship in his life, that of his wife and> alchemical partner, his soror mystica, Rebecca Vaughan. What we can know we> discover through extrapolating from Vaughan's own work and from some> contemporary accounts (many from his detractors).> At the heart of all of these elements is the very issue of knowledge itself,> and of how we communicate knowledge. This leads us to another core problem> that besets both alchemy and tantra: secrecy. How is it that we have enormous> communication resources at our disposal—from handwritten manuscripts to> printed books to electronic media—and yet find that some areas of human> endeavor resist all (or almost all) attempts at definition, elaboration, and> revelation? Especially in the case of alchemy there is what seems to be a> gross inconsistency at work here: why write about something and then within> that writing say that you will not reveal what it is you are writing about?> What's the point? If something is secret, and you wish to continue to protect> that secrecy ... why commit anything concerning it to writing? At best it> seems childish or confused; at worst, it seems manipulative and sly.> We are reminded of Kierkegaard, who wrote:> There is nothing, perhaps, which enobles a human being so much as keeping a> secret. It gives a man's whole life a meaning which of course it has for> himself only. It saves him from every vain regard for his environment ...2> [index_split_010.html#filepos84549]> The publication of hints of this secret then would mean that the holder of the> secret needs some kind of affirmation from others, even the relatively> anonymous “others” of the reading public. It indicates, maybe, that the> meaning of his life contained within that secret is not enough if it is “for> himself only.” He needs validation. He needs an audience, that “environment”> for which he claims he has only a “vain regard.” This may explain the motives> of some occultists and esotericists who feel the need to write books that> speak of secrets that they, paradoxically, cannot reveal—enlarging their own> importance at very little cost to themselves, especially if there is no secret> to conceal or reveal. But it does not explain the serious intensity of some> alchemical texts such as those of Vaughan under discussion here.> The answer to this problem lies, I think, with something the godfather of the> history of religions, Mircea Eliade, said in communication with a French> interviewer on the subject of initiation:> Moi, je crois que nous—qui sommes les produits du monde moderne—nous sommes> “condamnés” à recevoir toute révélation à travers la culture. C'est à travers> les formes et les structures culturelles qu'on peut retrouver les sources.> Nous sommes “condamnés” à apprendre et à nous réveiller à la vie de l'esprit> par les livres.

In other words he finds himself> forced—by the terms of accepted academic practice—to abandon any pretense of> trying to understand the nature of the secrets themselves (since it is> unethical if not ultimately counterproductive to “infiltrate” a secret society> and become initiated for the purpose of discovering its secrets for the goal> of revealing them to fellow academics). Instead, he must observe the trade in> secrets to come up with conclusions based on this external operation.9> [index_split_010.html#filepos87237]> Urban justifies this position by citing two approaches that have been taken by> historians of religion, namely the textual approach—represented by Gershom> Scholem, Antoine Faivre, and others—that “limits itself to historical texts> and makes no effort to penetrate the esoteric tradition from within.”10> [index_split_010.html#filepos87851] He then speaks of what he calls the> initiate's approach of those who undertake to join secret societies, all the> while informing their hosts of their intentions, and then report on what they> have found in peer-reviewed journals. He cites Miranda Shaw, who famously> joined a Tantric circle to research the subject of women in Tantra, as an> example of this approach, but then immediately asks: “... how can one be sure> that what a contemporary practitioner says about a tenth-century text is> anything like what a tenth-century practitioner says about that text?”11> [index_split_010.html#filepos87993] He thus calls into question even that> approach.> This is a cynical reaction to the material, the result of the style of> academic endeavor that obtains in Western universities in this post-modern> age.

We thus are expected to make an assumption that> esoteric texts are not amenable to this type of universal understanding since> they do not describe anything “real.” We are further expected to acknowledge> that they resist any interpretation that does not take into account the> circumstances in which they were written, thus making a fetish of individual,> localized (in space and time) social, ethnic, and historical characteristics> as a way of avoiding the larger issues with which we are (presumably)> ill-equipped to handle.> This does not mean that Urban has nothing of value to add to this discussion;> far from it.

Urban insists in this paper14> [index_split_010.html#filepos88874] that it is not subversion that is at work> here, but elitism.

Benjamin> Franklin certainly lived in both of these worlds, not only in America but in> England and on the Continent, as well.> Urban goes on to describe four “strategies” through which esoteric statements> are made. First, there is the “advertising” of the secret in what he calls the> “dialectic of lure and withdrawal.”15 [index_split_010.html#filepos89013] This> is similar to the type of trumpeting of a secret one finds on the playground,> professing to have a secret while simultaneously refusing to tell anyone what> it is.> The second strategy is that of the “hierarchization” of truth and the control> of access to that truth. Hence the degree systems in many, if not most, secret> societies and occult orders.16 [index_split_010.html#filepos89154]> The third strategy is that of the “skillful use of obscurity,” what he calls> “mumbo jumbo with exchange value.” This is an essential element of his thesis> that one can analyze secret societies through the means in which they “trade”> their secrets for power or money.17 [index_split_010.html#filepos89295]> Finally there is the fourth strategy which uses what he calls “semantic shock”> and “extreme metaphorization.”18 [index_split_010.html#filepos89436] We will> return to this concept later as it may be considered one of the hallmarks of> alchemical texts in general.> Urban's complaint is that “it is not simply the case that secret discourse is> semantically ‘empty’ or devoid of any context.... On the contrary, we might> say that it has too many meanings, it is capable of bearing an enormous> variety of different interpretations. Secret discourse, in short, is extremely> indeterminate and radically contextual”19 [index_split_010.html#filepos89577]> (emphasis in original)> What may not be clear from the above is that—outside of the contextual> environment—secret discourse can be “extremely indeterminate” but that within> its specific contextual environment this discourse has equally specific> referants and meanings.

The most striking example of hermetic> literature, outside the Corpus Hermeticum (a series of various Hermetic> documents25 first translated by Marsilio Ficino in the fifteenth century), is> the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus. (See page 98.) This text has> influenced every author of occult and alchemical tracts since its first> translation (from the seventh century Arabic) into Latin in the twelfth> century C.E. Johannes Trithemius, Albertus Magnus, and others all studied this> document, certain that it contains the key to the Philosopher's Stone. It most> famous dictum, “that which is below is like that which is above, and that> which is above is like that which is below, for the performance of the wonders> of the one thing,” is the doctrine of correspondences and the doctrine of the> relationship between microcosm and macrocosm, all in one sentence, as well as> the promise that understanding this relationship will lead to wonders.> It was said to have been written by Hermes Trismegistus (“thrice greatest”)> himself. Hermes was believed by the Greeks to be cognate to the Egyptian god> Thoth, a god of writing and communication as well as of wisdom, thus making> the inevitable association. In Islam, it is said that Hermes is revered under> the name Idris in the Qur'an, in Surah 19 (Mary) verses 56–57, although Idris> is traditionally considered to be the same as Enoch.

In the Corpus, God> is immanent in everything, in every aspect of matter. In Gnosticism, the> material plane is essentially evil, entrapping the soul, and it is every> person's responsibility to escape the prison of the material world and ascend> to heaven, to be reunited with God who is transcendent (as opposed to> immanent). Yet, although the theologies may differ, the mystical approach is> quite similar: a seven-stage phased ascent from the material plane to the> spiritual plane, with the soul divesting itself of encumbrances along the way> until it stands, naked and perfected, before the heavenly throne. It may be> thought of as a return to the Garden of Eden, from which Adam and Eve—who had> been naked and pure until they ate of the forbidden fruit—had been expelled by> God. In the Gnostic version of this tale, the Serpent in the Garden was God,> and the deity who expelled the First Couple was the Demiurge who had created> reality as a prison for the soul. It was the Serpent who set Adam and Eve on> the path to spiritual liberation.> The themes of purification, transformation, and redemption which we find—in> different combinations in the Hermetic and Gnostic philosophies—are prevalent> in the alchemical process as well, even to the extent of mimicking the> seven-stage initiatory process. In alchemical symbolism, gold is the> personification of the divine spirit that must be rescued through a> seven-stage process of purification, mortification, and resurrection; and as> the alchemist proceeds through these steps in the external laboratory, the> same process is taking place internally. “As above, so below.”> Inasmuch as the Corpus Hermeticum influenced Ficino, and through him the other> members of what has been called the Florentine Academy, elements of the> central thesis of the Hermetica filtered down through Albertus Magnus,> Cornelius Agrippa, and eventually to Vaughan and other alchemists. The idea of> the redemption of the soul through purification and other technologies found> fertile ground in the doctrines of Christianity regarding salvation; Vaughan's> writings make it clear that he viewed the alchemical process through a> Christian lens.

This indicates that alchemy does represent something> real: a genuine experience that is interpreted variously by Europeans,> Indians, and Chinese but uses the same technical terminology even as the> cultural context shifts according to geographic area, dominant religious> environment, and location in time.> The element of secrecy is also found in all three of these very broad> categories of European, Indian and Chinese alchemy.

What we call “reality” is a moveable feast. It is subject to varying> degrees of definition. In the case of alchemy, as with occultism in general,> we are dealing with things that are outside the realm of the acceptable and> even the legal.

It is a concept that is derived from Bruno's close study of the> Pythagoreans and the Platonists; and while the concept is no where near as> articulated as the Tantras, it unequivocally does connect eros with magic,> which is a hallmark of the Tantras.

Yet it would> be a mistake to claim that sexuality is only a metaphor in these traditions,> just as it would equally be a mistake to claim that sexuality, as we> understand it, is the operative dynamic.

It would seem that they did not. There were rumors of attempts to> form an alchemical society involving Vaughan and other alchemists and “natural> philosophers” at Oxford, but there is no evidence that any such society ever> materialized. This would seem to indicate that the Vaughans were not initiates> of any kind, but came by their alchemical knowledge independently. He had been> accused of being a Rosicrucian (on the strength of the fact that he was the> first to publish their manifestos in English), but he denied ever having been> a member of that Order. We know that Thomas Vaughan read copiously in Agrippa,> Trithemius, Raymond Lull, Basil Valentine, and the Polish alchemist> Sendivogius, and that he had a working knowledge of Hebrew as well as good> Latin and Greek. He gives a précis of his spiritual antecedents early on, and> Agrippa has pride of place. Indeed, it is as difficult to understand Vaughan> without Agrippa as it is to understand Aleister Crowley without MacGregor> Mathers.> While it is far beyond the scope of this book to give a complete exposition of> Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, it would be well to give an> indication of the magician's worldview and cosmological system, since it comes> up in Vaughan repeatedly and is the framework for his own work.> From the very first chapter of Agrippa's magnum opus we understand that his> cosmos consists of three fields: the “elemental, celestial, and> intellectual.”22 This would become clarified to include the terrestrial, the> astrological/astronomical, and the purely spiritual. God is the Force behind> these realms, and everything that exists in Creation from the stars to the> stones on the earth are related to each other and to God as the First Cause.> This is what is known as the doctrine of correspondences, in which everything> that exists has its counterpart in each of the three realms, and an operation> on one simultaneously affects the other.> Even the structure of Agrippa's work reflects this cosmology divided as it is> into three books, each of which represents one of these realms. Thus the first> book is concerned with natural magic (the terrestrial), the second with> celestial magic, and the third with ceremonial magic.> This idea of three worlds or realms of experience and Creation is reflected in> Vaughan's work, over and over again. It was congenial to the Christian> believers of the time to use the Holy Trinity as a template for cosmology; and> this use of three realms was often identified with the Trinity since the> realms were the Creation of God and made in his image. Vaughan cites Agrippa> as his source numerous times and clearly his approach to Hermetism is informed> by the Agrippan worldview. Agrippa was so influential that his work was copied> shamelessly by Francis Barrett in The Magus: a very popular compendium of> ceremonial magic that influenced everyone from Joseph Smith Jr. (founder of> the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or Mormons) to the Hermetic> Society of the Golden Dawn (of which Macgregor Mathers was its chief and> Aleister Crowley its most infamous initiate).> Agrippa gave numerous tables for understanding the structure of the cosmos,> many of which was cribbed from Kabbalistic sources, and a breakdown of the> seven Platonic planets—Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and> Saturn—and their corresponding attributes in terms of metals, plants, animals,> humans, etc. This aspect of Agrippa is necessary for understanding the> worldview of Thomas and Rebecca Vaughan; for Agrippa's Occult Philosophy is> replete with associations drawn between planets, angels, demons, magical rites> and powers, and the idea that the entire world and everything in it is subject> to the will of an educated and determined operator. The imagination was> considered a powerful tool in the magician's repetoire for it acts upon the> bonds that connect the magician to the rest of the world.> Alchemy shares some of the same language as that of medieval European magic,> even as it focuses on the one aspect of Agrippa's Neoplatonic philosophy that> is essential to the work of both alchemy and magic. This is the idea that> everything proceeds from a single Source and that, therefore, Creation is> ongoing and susceptible to the will and the imagination of human beings—since> they, too, are part of the process, and in contradistinction to plants,> animals, and metals, humans are capable of acting directly and willfully on> Creation. The philosophy of the alchemist and the magician is eminently> scientific: that if one knows the right formulas, the correct degree of> relationship between one object and another, and if one realizes that> everything in Creation can be categorized, labeled, and understood—that the> universe is logical and rationally organized—then human beings can accomplish> what would seem to be impossible.> Yet in alchemy—as in Tantra, as in Daoism—it was understood that human beings,> animals, and even the plants and the metals were divided into two genders,> male and female. Both qualities are necessary to duplicate the moment of> Creation ... or any moment along Creation's timeline. The sexualization of the> world—of both chemistry and physics, biology and botany—was considered> self-evident, and the acknowledgement of this bi-polarity necessary to success> in the pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone.> The union of these two opposites was realized in the concept of the hieros> gamos, the sacred wedding. In alchemy, the notion of a “Chemical Wedding” was> immortalized in the famous Rosicrucian parable The Chemical Wedding of> Christian Rosenkreutz, a complex esoteric allegory published at Strasburg in> the year 1616. This was only a year after the publication of the Confessio of> the Rosicrucians and two years after the Fama Fraternitatis: the two seminal> documents that announced to the world the existence of a Rosicrucian> fraternity and, as mentioned, first published in English by Thomas Vaughan.> Said to have been written by Johannes Valentinus Andreae (1586–1654), a> Lutheran pastor, the Chemical Wedding is a story rich in arcane symbolism that> has defied most scholarly attempts at interpretation.> In the story, shortly before Easter, a pious man is invited to a wedding to be> held at a castle in the forest in a few days. It was to be a royal wedding, a> young King married to his Bride. After many trials, obstacles sent to test his> spiritual readiness, the narrator is finally present at the wedding. The event> turns into a bloodbath, with the King and Queen and many others murdered, only> to be resurrected a few days later after a long procedure involving many> alchemical elements and processes. It is certainly a very strange story and> its details and manner of narration are as close to twentieth century> Surrealism as it was possible to be in the seventeenth century. The essence of> the tale is found in the pairing of opposites, the seven-stage process of> purification and transformation, and the necessity for piety and moral> stability. The wedding, death, and resurrection of a King and Queen are common> motifs in alchemical art and literature, and are metaphors for the compounding> of Mercury and Sulfur among other ideas.> It is perhaps putting too fine a point on it to suggest that the premature> deaths of Rebecca and Thomas Vaughan in the midst of their operations mirror> the themes of the alchemical process itself. Their coniunctio—which actually> is described in some alchemical art as coitus—was the nearest we come in the> West to an actual “chemical wedding.” By using the lenses of Tantra and Daoist> alchemy we will peer into the mysteries of this hieros gamos—a little like> voyeurs perhaps, which is as good a description as any for those who seek but> are still leery of performing the act.> According to tradition, Thomas and Rebecca Vaughan had antecedents in the case> of Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, two French alchemists of the fourteenth> century. There is considerable controversy surrounding this couple as it is> believed that their legendary status as successful alchemists who discovered> the Philosopher's Stone is a myth perpetrated long after their deaths. What is> known is that Nicholas Flamel (c. 1330–1418) ran a small bookstall in Paris.> In 1368 he married Perenelle (d. 1397) who had already gone through two> husbands and who had—it is said—amassed something of a small personal fortune.> It is this fortune that is at the heart of the controversy, for the Flamels> did donate considerable sums of money to the city of Paris during their> married career, after Perenelle's death, and during the remainder of> Nicholas's lifetime. There is a street named after Nicholas Flamel in Paris,> and it intersects one named after his wife. Indeed, their home still> stands—the oldest stone house in Paris—and the ground floor is a restaurant> that is called Auberge Nicholas Flamel.> The story goes that Nicholas discovered an alchemical manuscript that resisted> all his attempts at interpretation. Eventually, during a pilgrimage, he> encountered a man who was able to give him the key to translating the document> which was nothing less than a guide to the making of the Philosopher's Stone.> This, Nicholas was able to do (according to the story), and performed his> successful transmutations with the assistance and cooperation of his wife who> was always by his side in one capacity or another during his alchemical> workings.> THE QUESTION REMAINS: did the largesse that the Flamels bestowed upon the> citizens of Paris originate solely in Perenelle's dowry and some successful> investments or was it augmented by the discovery of the Stone? It may be that> the value in this tale is the stress on the role played by the female partner> in the alchemical workings, something that would have been foreign to medieval> sorcerers and Christian Kabbalists with their patriarchal leanings. Indeed,> the manuscript that was discovered by Flamel was allegedly written by one> “Abraham the Jew” thus alluding to a possible Kabbalistic origin of the work.> It should be noted that the Sepher ha-Zohar—arguably the most famous text of> the Kabbalah—was published about the year 1300 C.E.,23 thirty years before> Flamel's birth, and contains a strong feminine component leading some modern> scholars of the Kabbalah to characterize the text as a kind of Tantra.24> There was a grimoire entitled The Book of Abramelin, said to have been written> by one Abraham of Worms—a magician's workbook attributed25 to the authorship> of one Rabbi Yaakov Moelin (ca. 1365–1427). This text, if it truly existed at> this time, would be contemporary with the Flamels and could have been> conflated with whatever text Flamel possessed. Although Abramelin is a book of> magic, its insistence on cultivating one's spiritual life and making contact> with one's spiritual counterpart—the “holy guardian angel”—over a course of> eighteen months of strenuous preparations, including fasting and chastity, has> much in common with alchemical prescriptions.

The snakes would sit next to him as he slept and lick his ears,> giving him this important ability—as the birds had knowledge of future events.> Birds, as they dwell in two worlds—that of the air and the earth—are liminal> figures in mythology as they are in alchemy. Mysterious beings from> civilizations as ancient as that of the Babylonians were depicted with wings:> half-bird, half-human creatures who guarded the entrances to temples (again, a> liminal function). Seers would predict the future based on observation of the> flights of birds. Famously, in early Christian iconography, the third Person> of the Trinity—the Holy Spirit—is depicted as a dove, which may be an allusion> to the dove who flew from Noah's ark after the flood waters had receded to> bring back evidence of dry land.> In the citation above, the language of the birds is linked to Egyptian> hieroglyphics and to Hebrew, both considered sacred languages by the> Hellenistic magicians and, later, by the magicians and alchemists of medieval> Europe. Fulcanelli goes further, however, and devotes considerable space to> explaining the relationship between the hieratic language—the symbolic medium> in which alchemical secrets are transmitted—and other forms of non-standard> speech, such as argot.> To Fulcanelli, the word argot or slang (also known as “cant,” or in French,> argotique) can be understood as a sly way of saying Art gothique, or Gothic> art, and Art goétique, or the Goetic art, i.e., magic.9> [index_split_017.html#filepos206062] The word thus links the architectural> embellishments of the Gothic cathedrals with the deeper understanding coded> into them by those knowledgeable in the Goetic art, in a language—an> argot—comprehensible only to the initiated. This indeed is the premise upon> which Fulcanelli's book is erected; without accepting the fact of this coding> system, this hieratic “language of the birds” known only to alchemists and> magicians, the entire “edifice” of The Mystery of the Cathedrals comes> crashing down. Fulcanelli's point is that the Gothic cathedrals themselves> were alchemical texts intended to be read, hidden in plain sight, immediately> recognizable as such by the initiate. This concept was taken further by> another French author and esotericist, Louis Charpentier, in a book published> in English as The Mysteries of Chartres Cathedral (1966, 1972). Charpentier> uses the dimensions of Chartres as a key to understanding how sacred geometry> was used by the medieval craftsmen to communicate higher truths and to design> the cathedral as a kind of occult machine that would enable the initiate to> attain advanced spiritual states. Charpentier's debt to Fulcanelli, to whom he> refers as a “scholar Adept,” is acknowledged.10> [index_split_017.html#filepos206314]> Thus, esoteric information could be coded into stone and mortar as well as> onto paper and papyrus. The hieroglyphics (literally “sacred symbols”) of> ancient Egypt were held up as prime examples of initiatic teaching, and the> Hebrew alphabet with its convenient letter-as-number system offered even more> possibilities. The language of the birds is mentioned fleetingly in Agrippa's> famous work, but as language peculiar to the birds that could be understood by> those who had the requisite occult insight, and not as a replacement hieratic> language.

To become immortal one must reverse> the flow of Time, and in order to do that one must gain control over bodily> systems that are normally beyond conscious intervention.> Thus, the language of alchemical literature is just as transgressive as the> practice of alchemy itself; yet, paradoxically, the alchemist must be of sound> spiritual character, pious, sensitive to the flow of subtle energies, and> meticulous in preparation. The alchemist is transgressive not only in action> but also in intellection: the words and images used to describe the alchemical> process are impossible to apprehend through any sort of rational analysis.> Language—a powerful tool of communication—suddenly becomes a plaything, a toy.> Language is used to break down normal communication, to defeat logical> thinking, to point in another direction.

There is a basic, invisible force present and at work in> the world and in the cosmos; it is this force that must be discovered by the> magician and the alchemist. As it is behind all created elements it can be> found in all created elements to different and varying degrees.> But why do we think that Love is a magician? Because the whole power of magic> consists in love. The work of magic is the attraction of one thing by another> ...—Marsilio Ficino, De Amore, VI, 10> We have claimed in our treatise De naturali magia that all bonds are either> reduced to the bond of love, depend on the bond of love, or are based on the> bond of love.—Giordano Bruno, De vinculis in genere> That Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499)—the translator of the works of Plato and the> Corpus Hermeticum from Greek into Latin, and thus a major proponent of> Neoplatonism and Hermetism—considered this force to be Love, and that Giordano> Bruno (1548–1600) concurred, is a matter of record. This Love, this> attraction, this “magnet” of Vaughan, the “Mystery of Union” as he calls it,> is both eros and amor. It is the vinculum, the magic “bond” of Bruno through> which the magician can perform miracles. In this way Vaughan was considered by> Waite to be a magician as well as an alchemist. Vaughan's writings can> certainly be perceived that way, as elaborations of the magical theories to be> found in Agrippa and Trithemius, which were themselves based on the Platonic> notions of Ficino.> The character of Love, however, was never clearly or consistently defined> except that it should somehow be elevated to a desire for the divine. Ficino,> who struggled with homoerotic love, eventually became ordained a Catholic> priest. Ironically, Bruno—also an ordained priest—was heterosexual and> eventually condemned to execution for his occult and heretical beliefs by the> same Church. Both of these men realized the power of love in general, and of> its sensual, erotic nature in particular which was a force that could destroy> a man as much as elevate him.> The emphasis in both writers is on the male half of the equation; there was a> great deal of ambiguity in their conceptions of the role and character of> women: with Ficino basically ignoring them and Bruno conflicted about his own> desires, denigrating the “common woman” and seeking instead to worship an> idealized female and to burn with unrequited lust in the process, a state he> considered enobling. It should be noted that many magical rituals prescribe a> certain period of chastity for the magician prior to the ceremony, and that> celibacy in the sense of a consciously-controlled sexuality was considered to> be a source of occult power.> Ficino wrote his De amore (“On Love”) as a lengthy meditation on the nature of> love, lust, desire, and beauty. Bruno wrote his famous De gli heroici furori> (“The Heroic Frenzies”) on the same subject, albeit from a different> perspective. Both men were Neoplatonists, occultists, astrologers, and> Hermeticists. Both men understood love—and especially its unruly companion,> eros—as the key to understanding Creation and, by extension, magic.> Ficino's student—Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494)—took the> Neoplatonism of his teacher even further and included the Kabbalah as well as> what was known of Islamic cosmology, astrology, and mysticism in his> worldview. He aggressively defended the occult arts to the point where he had> to flee to France to avoid prosecution by the Church. Coming under the sway of> the puritanical Dominican friar Savonarola, he began to study to become a monk> but he was eventually poisoned by political enemies and died in Florence where> his eulogy was delivered by his teacher, Ficino. He never repudiated his> earlier interest in occultism, however, even though he made what> accommodations he could to the Church's demands that he excise certain> statements considered heretical.> This back-tracking by some of the most influential occult thinkers of the> Renaissance due to Church suppression found its further expression in Agrippa> himself. Toward the end of his life, he distanced himself from magic and his> reputation as a magician but it was a futile gesture for the name of Agrippa> has come down to us as synonymous with occultism, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and> ceremonial magic. All of these influences were felt by Agrippa, and his work> in turn influenced Bruno.> The stream of Arab, Jewish, and Asian currents that flowed through the> Neoplatonic theories of the Renaissance magicians and astrologers developed> into a tidal wave of Hermetic thought and practice, involving everything from> astrology and alchemy to numerology, Kabbalah, medicine, and ceremonial magic.> What is generally perceived as a European phenomenon has its roots in the Near> East and Asia.> Perspectives on sexuality in regions not dominated by the Church were quite> different from those experienced in Europe. The repudiation of sexuality> except for purposes of procreation was alien to populations in China, India,> and Central Asia which nevertheless saw in the sexual impulse a force of> tremendous spiritual power. India, as an example, celebrated sexuality: in its> Tantric scriptures, in its idols, its temple architecture, its ancient sacred> literature. Creation was attributed to an act of copulation between a male and> a female deity. Lingam and yoni devices—representing the phallus of Shiva and> the vagina of Shakti, respectively—were (and are) everywhere in evidence, used> for many different ritual purposes including fertility.> This was not sex for the sake of physical gratification, but human sexuality> perceived to be the outer manifestation of an inner reality. Sex, as something> familiar to everyone, was simply a convenient means of explaining these deeper> issues. It would be a mistake to consider sexuality as a metaphor, however.> Sexuality was considered to be operating on more than one plane> simultaneously, so that human sexuality had a divine or sacred counterpart.> An objection to the late-nineteenth and twentieth century approach to> alchemical literature from the point of view of the depth psychology of C.G.> Jung was recently voiced by Lawrence M. Principe.28 He claimed, and rightly,> that the lack of a cultural context for alchemical literature coupled with> ignorance of chemical concepts inclined some readers to the conclusion that> the alchemists were talking about deep spiritual matters, when in reality> their use of sexual metaphor and analogy for chemical processes was pedestrian> and had nothing at all to do with deeper issues. Just as we speak of “male”> and “female” connectors that are respectively convex and concave, the sexual> allusions in alchemy—so goes this argument—are equally utilitarian and have> nothing to do with actual human sexuality. There can be little doubt that many> alchemical authors were doing just that, using sexual metaphors as a kind of> shorthand, but to draw the conclusion that all alchemy is based on mundane> chemical operations without a spiritual or at least a psychological> counterpart is equally erroneous.> Anyone who has worked with tools in any of the technical fields knows that> terms like “male” and “female” are applied to a wide variety of artifacts for> the sake of convenience. Therefore a plug is male and the connector or socket> into which it is inserted is female. There is no deeper meaning implied or> intended; but to an alchemist of a particular stripe, the almost universal> application of terms like this to mundane objects is a clue to something> deeper, something prevalent in the very fact of nature and how human beings> manage Creation. Whereas a plumber or a craftsman may not be aware of such> “hidden intercourses,” it is the occupation of the natural philosopher—the> alchemist, the magician—to draw more profound inferences from these phenomena.> That is not to say that the scientific approach to alchemical literature is to> be derided or abandoned, far from it; but when we approach the literature of a> Thomas Vaughan, or the Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, as examples,> it becomes clear that we are not speaking about “normal” chemical processes.> Those alchemists who were involved in separating the elements, purifying them,> and creating new compounds used the same language as those who were> interpreting these same processes on a different level, in a different> semantic field although sharing the same terminology.> What, then, of the historical antecedents of European alchemy, those practices> and their corresponding literature discovered in India and China? We encounter> the same bifurcation of intent. The Chinese approach to “external” alchemy and> “internal” alchemy is just such a case in point. There were two alchemies. One> was properly directed towards the manipulation of material substances to> derive the elixir vitae: a medicine that would cure all sickness and lead to a> prolonged life. The other had a similar objective, but was performed using> ritual, observance of the movements of the stars and planets, etc. with the> alchemical apparatus transferred from the laboratory to the human anatomy and> especially the nervous system. It was an interiorization of the external> alchemical process, which would imply there was more going on with alchemy> than the manipulation of metals. In a way, we can speak of alchemy as> “speculative chemistry” in the same way we speak of “speculative Freemasonry”> to distinguish the secret society phenomenon from its seemingly more mundane> origins as a guild of builders and bricklayers. Both are based on materialist> concerns but use these technologies as representative of other—spiritual,> esoteric—purposes.> This confusion, however, is to be expected of a discipline that falls under> the aegis of Hermes, the God of Liminality and Boundaries. Hermes is not only> a god of wisdom, writing, communication, and magic but of the ways in which> these abilities may be abused. The reflex of communication is misdirection and> disinformation. Magic may be used to enoble, but it can also be used to> enslave. As for writing, well, the German proverb has it that “paper is> patient.” One can writes lies as easily as truth; often much easier.> Hermes is a Trickster as well as a psychopomp. Mercury—Hermes's Roman> counterpart and planetary incarnation—had a reputation for cunning, trickery,> and thievery. As a god of the boundaries that exist in nature and in human> society, Mercury traveled back and forth over them with ease, no respecter of> class, status or differences. What belonged to one side, now belonged to the> other. As a god of poetry and eloquence, Mercury's silver tongue could charm> the birds from the trees ... or the money from your purse. In modern terms,> Mercury is an advertising guru; a speechwriter; a hacker. As a guide to the> underworld, Mercury is a psychopomp.> At other times he's just, well, a psycho. The allure of alchemy—of the> possibility of generating huge amounts of gold with just a little powder and a> crucible, or of finding the secret of immortality—caused many individuals to> abandon their common sense, lose their fortunes or their sanity, and> eventually begin to con their neighbors with false gold and counterfeit coins> in order to pull themselves out of the financial and personal ruin into which> they had dived headfirst. Alchemy can be an all-consuming obsession, once> begun. The encoded information in the texts remain tantalizing just out of> reach. The furnace bums, chemicals undergo transformations, strange fluids are> distilled, and this can go on indefinitely without tangible results. The only> safeguard against destruction is just what the more sober alchemists always> advise: piety, purity, and patience.> THESE WERE QUALITIES THE VAUGHANS seemed to have in abundance. Yet Vaughan's> devotion to Agrippa is curious. Agrippa wrote very little about alchemy and> was considered more of an author on magic and Hermeticism. In fact, as we now> know, he was an alchemist and according to his private correspondence set up> an alchemical laboratory wherever he lived. Yet why would Vaughan revere> Agrippa more than any other author unless he knew of this correspondence?> There is no indication in Vaughan's writings that he was aware of the type of> alchemical work Agrippa had done privately, so the mystery remains.> Another problem with Agrippa is that he seemed to have repudiated his interest> in magic in later years, and this was well-known. Still, he remained Vaughan's> favorite resource in spite of these apparent short-comings. He defended> Agrippa energetically all his life, in particular in a long statement that> begins his Anima Magica Abscondita where he addresses the rumors surrounding> Agrippa's supposed consorting with demons and sorcery head-on, ridiculing them> in the process.> A possible clue to Vaughan's spirited defense of the magus may be found in> another work by Agrippa, this one on women. Entitled De nobilitate et> praecellentia foeminei sexus (or “Of the nobility and superiority of the> female sex”) and published in 1529, this work had wide notoriety as it sought> to demonstrate that women were superior to men. Central to his thesis is the> idea that the Fall of Adam was not the fault of Eve. According to Agrippa's> reading of the Book of Genesis, God had instructed Adam not to eat of the Tree> of Knowledge. He gave no such instruction to Eve. When Eve presented Adam with> the fateful apple, it was up to Adam to keep God's law and he failed. Agrippa> went even further, by saying the reason God incarnated as a man—Jesus—was to> redeem Adam; Eve did not need any redeeming.> From what we know of Vaughan, and especially concerning his relationship to> Rebecca, we can imagine that this type of polemic would have pleased the> alchemist greatly. Knowing that Agrippa's heart was in the right place where> women are concerned would have had an impact on the Welshman's attitude> towards the German magus. He also would have been thrilled to read an> interpretation of Genesis—that document so important to generations of> mystics, Kabbalists, and alchemists—that diverged so greatly from the> consensus view. It was the women, wrote Agrippa, who stood by Jesus while the> men abandoned him. It was also the women to whom Jesus first announced his> resurrection. One could extrapolate from there. If we identify Jesus as the> Philosopher's Stone—the stone the builders rejected—we can say that the Stone> would be revealed to women first, and from women to men. Indeed, a> re-examination of what transpired on the day of Rebecca's death and Thomas's> recovery of the “Oil of Alkali” could suggest exactly that.> Agrippa's work on the superiority of women went into many editions and> translations during his lifetime. It was condemned by some as verging on the> heretical, but its popularity was assured. We do not know definitively if> Vaughan was aware of this work or if he read it, but it seems likely that he> must have known about it due to the book's availability throughout Europe at> the time it was published, albeit almost a hundred years before Vaughan's> birth. Yet, Vaughan was an enthusiastic reader of Agrippa's other famous> work—the Three Books—so it is entirely possible, if not likely, that he would> have been familiar with this one as well.> In his Magia Adamica Vaughan gives an account of Genesis from the Fall of Adam> to the story of Joseph and his brothers, but never mentions Eve. Instead, he> places the blame for the Fall squarely on Adam's shoulders. This may reflect> his reading of Agrippa on women, or it may be simply that he considered Eve> peripheral to the points he was trying to make—but the omission is interesting> nevertheless.> Marsilio Ficino and Giordano Bruno had their problems with women; in both> cases they seemed to consider the average woman as a center of pestilence, as> a trap for souls, as a means of depriving men of their strength, wealth, and> stability. Agrippa, in contrast, energetically defends womanhood against these> libels and especially the libel against Eve as the source of the Fall. This> libel was used in the persecution of women for millenia and especially during> the witchcraft hysteria of the Middle Ages when thousands of women were killed> by the State on orders of the Church. This defense of women has an underlying> feature that has been so far neglected, however.> If the reputation of Eve had been redeemed through the efforts of Agrippa, a> famous magician and occultist, then it stands to reason that women in general> would have a role to play in Agrippa's esoteric scheme. While women were> excluded from the Catholic priesthood, they would not be excluded from the> practices of magic and alchemy. In fact, since they were not to blame for the> Fall of Adam, they could be said to have a superior position in the operations> of magic and alchemy. This implication—so central to the practice of Tantra in> far away India—would not have been lost on Thomas Vaughan.> THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE HERMETIC THOUGHT behind the work of Vaughan and> his European predecessors—Ficino, della Mirandola, Agrippa, Trithemius—is thus> to be found in the idea that there is an identity between the microcosm and> the macrocosm. This identity is evidenced by the doctrine of correspondences> in which objects on earth have their celestial counterparts, and thus by> acting on the terrestrial objects—plants, minerals, metals, etc.—one can> effect changes in their celestial originals. There is a proof text of this in> Vaughan's Christianity, for Jesus tells Peter that “Truly I say to you,> whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you> loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.” (Matthew 18:18) No clearer> magical, alchemical explanation of the Hermetic axiom from the Emerald Tablet,> “As above, so below,” has ever been written.> Another Hermetic element to be found in Vaughan is the concept of the> ascending and descending elements we first saw in the Emerald Tablet. The> rising up and coming down of the base materials in a process that seems to> indicate a distillation and purification system in which impurities are> removed leaving only a single substance as a result is a feature of a great> deal of alchemical literature. Maria the Jewess describes the laboratory> equipment to be used for this purpose, and in the writings and drawings> attributed to her we have some of the earliest depictions of the still.> Also, the Hermetic concept of the importance of the gender relationship that> exists not only between human beings but between all created things was> another, we might say, critical point that Vaughan embraced so completely as> we will see.> The Hermetism inherited by Vaughan contained many elements from Egypt and the> Middle East, via the Corpus Hermeticum, the Emerald Tablet, and Agrippa's> Kabbalah and celestial magic. The alchemy he inherited is still something of a> mystery as discussed earlier. One influence that does stand out as a genuine> alchemist, however, is that of the Polish sage, Michael Sendivogius> (1566–1636).> Not much is available in the English language concerning Sendivogius (who> published largely in Latin) but he is becoming a focus of modern scholarship,> with biographical research being done in Europe with amazing results. We now> know that he was personally acquainted with the Elizabethan magicians and> alchemists, Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly, and that he even purchased land> belonging to Kelley's widow, Joan. Sendivogius was well-known to the courts of> eastern Europe, in Bohemia and Moravia as well as in Kracow and Prague, and he> enjoyed a successful career as a diplomat, a scientist, metallurgist, and> alchemist. He is known to have performed several transmutations of base metals> into gold for various nobles—using a red tincture for gold and a white> tincture for silver (a circumstance for which we moderns have no rational> explanation as we are taught that such transmutations are physically> impossible). Unlike many of his contemporaries, however, Sendivogius did not> seek fame or riches. He maintained a very low profile, and prevailed upon> those who did know him and were aware of his abilities to keep his name out of> publication. The result of this is that he is mentioned—if at all—with the use> of pseudonyms, initials, or code names based on the letters of his name> rearranged to form other words, or by allusion to his place of birth, etc.> Historian of alchemy Rafael T. Prinke has even suggested29 that Sendivogius> was the model for Christian Rosenkreutz of the Rosicrucian manifestos.> Sendivogius had travelled to Greece and Egypt where he claimed to have> received the secret of the Philosopher's Stone; he believed in anonymity and> in using his knowledge for medicine and healing; and he was a member of that> movement that sought political change in Europe very much in line with what> the Manifestos promoted. All of this is consistent with the description of> Christian Rosenkreutz in the Fama.> Sendivogius is also credited with the discovery that air is composed of> different elements, one of which—now known as oxygen—is necessary for life:> this almost two centuries before Priestley's work. Sendivogius also studied> the effects and properties of nitre, the observation of which in his> laboratory led to his discovery of oxygen, and this became an interest of> Vaughan as well.> The influences that formed the worldview of Sendivogius were also contained> within the Hermetica, and he claimed to have discovered two previously-unknown> Hermetic texts during his travels to Egypt. His works often include references> to Hermes, either as the father of wisdom or in his incarnation as Mercury,> the alchemical element, whom he anthropomorhized in his Novum Lumen Chymicum> (“The New Chemical Light”) published under an anagram version of his name in> Prague and Frankfurt in 1604. It contains in its opening chapter the> following, seemingly contradictory, statement:> ... let the sons of Hermes know for certain that the extracting of the essence> of gold is a mere fond delusion, as those who persist in it will be taught to> their cost by experience, the only arbitress from whose judgment seat there is> no appeal. If, on the other hand, a person is able to transmute the smallest> piece of metal (with or without gain) into genuine gold or silver which abides> all the usual tests, he may justly be said to have opened the gates of Nature,> and cleared the way for profounder and more advanced study.30> In other words, it is not possible to extract the essence of gold, but it is> possible to transmute metal into gold. We know that Sendivogius was credited> by his contemporaries with the ability to perform transmutations, so it seems> he is being quite specific in stating that transmutation is possible, just not> in the way the fraudulent alchemists—the counterfeiters and “puffers”—claim it> can be done.> If his readers were hoping for a clear-cut set of instructions, however,> Sendivogius has this to say:> Let me therefore admonish the gentle reader that my meaning is to be> apprehended not so much from the outward husk of my words, as from the inward> spirit of Nature. If this warning is neglected, he may spend his time, labour,> and money in vain. Let him consider that this mystery is for wise men, and not> for fools. The inward meaning of our philosophy will be unintelligible to> vainglorious boasters, to conceited mockers, and to men who smother the> clamorous voice of conscience with the insolence of a wicked life ... The> right understanding of our Art is by the gift of God, or by the ocular> demonstration of a teacher, and can be attained only by diligent, humble> search, and prayerful dependence on the Giver of all good things ... In> conclusion, I would earnestly ask the sons of knowledge to accept this Book in> the spirit in which it was it was written; and when the HIDDEN has become> MANIFEST to them and the inner gates of secret knowledge are flung open not to> reveal this mastery to any unworthy person; also to remember their duty> towards their suffering and distressed neighbours to avoid any ostentatious> display of their power; and above all, to render to God, the Three in One,> sincere and grateful thanks with their lips, in the silence of their hearts,> and by refraining from any abuse of the Gift.31> It should be realized from reading the above that even though Sendivogius was> a scientist and a doctor, and even though he was during his lifetime in charge> of mining operations in Silesia (a worldly and practical occupation), his> writings on alchemy are full of the spiritual advice and warnings that are> common to other such documents. This would seem to challenge the theories of> some modern commentators who—as we have seen above—claim that alchemical> language is merely a kind of scientific shorthand with no deeper or more> profound meaning. While this may be true in the case of some self-styled> alchemists, if this were so in the case of Sendivogius, then what would be the> purpose of the warnings and spiritual advice given in the opening pages of his> most famous work?> Vaughan refers to Sendivogius numerous times in his alchemical texts. It is> clear that the Polish alchemist straddled two worlds, that of the scientist> and lover of Nature and that of the pious Hermeticist and esotericist. This> combination would have appealed greatly to Vaughan, who worked diligently in> his own laboratory to perfect medicines and metals even as he promoted a> deeply spiritual approach to alchemy. Vaughan himself even published under a> pseudonym, Eugenius Philalethes, as if in emulation of Sendivogius who also> refused to put his real name on the covers of his books.> Behind all of these mystics and alchemists—behind Agrippa, Trithemius,> Sendivogius, and Vaughan—there was the Emerald Tablet with its spare fourteen> lines in which the whole theory of the nature of Creation is laid out in terms> that are simple but nonetheless elusive. All of these authors, and many others> of their milieu, proclaimed in print their debt to Hermes and his Tablet. It> was, in a sense, the starter's pistol in the race to find the Stone of the> Wise, to bridge the gap between Christianity and the religions of the East, to> find a scientific basis for faith, and to heal the wounds and the plagues of> the world. In order to probe the deepest mysteries of Nature, however, it> would be necessary to reverse the flow of time, to “invert nature” as Maria> the Jewess advised.> Just as it was necessary to deconstruct Nature in an attempt to read her> secrets, so it was necessary to deconstruct the human body itself. For the> human anatomy is a cosmos in miniature and by examining the secret functions> of the body it would be possible to understand the mind of God.1 [index_split_020.html#filepos212251] Cited in Raphael Patai, The JewishAlchemists, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1994, p. 63.2 [index_split_020.html#filepos213578] Thomas Vaughan, Magia Adamica, lines492–500.

The quest for a unified field theory that would combine these fourforces into a single field has so far proved elusive, due to the difficulty ofincluding gravity in the same field as the other three; a related problem is thedifficulty in combining general relativity with quantum mechanics into a singleoverarching “theory of everything.” That there are four such recognized forcesin the universe seems curiously relevant, considering that the ancientsconceived of four basic elements which, combined, yielded “everything.”18 [index_split_026.html#filepos316021] This may not be as futile or strange asit may seem, for the modern psychology movement beginning with Freud andextending through Jung and beyond was based on the idea that dreams concealhidden information about the psychic health of the patient; in just this way,spiritually-inspired documents could be considered to be sources of hiddeninformation about the world, whether deliberately implanted by the document'sauthor or the result of a hidden reality shining through the words of the text.19 [index_split_027.html#filepos317245] Thomas Vaughan, Euphrates, lines789–793.20 [index_split_027.html#filepos326055] Peter Levenda, Stairway to Heaven:Chinese Alchemists, Jewish Kabbalists, and the Art of Spiritual Transformation,Continuum, New York, 2008.21 [index_split_027.html#filepos327079] Fabrizio Pregadio, The Way of the GoldenElixir: An Introduction to Taoist Alchemy, Golden Elixir Press, Mountain View(CA), 2014, p. 19.

In the explanation by Kim Lai, referenced above, he> identifies a “spectrum” of practice in inner alchemy that seems to reflect a> pre-Buddhist Indian practice of breath and posture similar to> ha[images/00063.jpg][images/00064.jpg]a yoga on one end of the spectrum and an> approach he characterizes as Buddhist “gnosis” on the other. The ultimate aim> of this latter practice is the “complete transcendence of death and rebirth”> in the “actualisation of immortality.”22 He speaks of the complete> transubstantion of the human body as the goal towards which Tibetan inner> alchemy is directed. In order to achieve this, the practices of breath> control, postures, etc. are in a sense a necessary preliminary (or adjunct to)> the “Completion Stage” of Tibetan inner alchemy which goes beyond liberation> from the world and into “deep understanding.”> Significantly, the Tibetan procedure does not include references to> Ku[images/00059.jpg][images/00062.jpg]alinī or raising Shakti up the spinal> column as per the Indian techniques. Instead, the focus is on the “winds” in> the body, which of course has analogies to prā[images/00059.jpg]āyāma—which in> Tibetan is called srog tsol (“sok tsol”).

The Tibetan practice does not recognize the> Ku[images/00059.jpg][images/00062.jpg]alinī system, either, but still manages> to accomplish a similar (if not identical) goal using a different intellectual> construct but based on the foundational concept of the existence of essences> in the human body that can be manipulated through the control of the body's> “winds” and their passage through the cakras, “recombining them in the central> channel.”23 Most importantly, Kim Lai agrees that this is “a reversal of the> process of conception and birth ... returning the body to a primordial state> where all imbalances and all cycles are resolved.”24> This idea of going back in time to the moment of Creation (both microcosmic in> the case of the individual and macrocosmic in the case of the universe) is, as> we have seen, central to all the alchemical schools we have studied. The> techniques for doing this have changed over time and place and within> different cultural and religious contexts, but the basic methodology is the> same across all systems: the manipulation of the body's own> systems—biological, chemical, neurological, psychological—and the simultaneous> and concomittant manipulation of external systems that correspond to those in> the body. There is a phase of purification (in the metallurgical sense) of the> body as well as of the external elements—metals, plants, etc.—in order to> achieve a primordial, unmixed state.> The Kālacakra Tantra stipulates that in addition to the “above” and “below”> (macrocosm and microcosm) that is essential to the practice of alchemy there> is also an “Other” which is the force or essence that permeates the other two.> Again, this is not so different from Platonic, Kabbalistic, and Daoist> concepts. In China, the Dao is neither Yin nor Yang but a force in the> universe that is at once both and neither. The refinement of the body's own> “essences” leads back to the moment of Creation when all that existed was this> Other.

The term “seals” refers to consorts, female> partners in the initiatory process. This is where the experts and critics> become engaged in a variety of intellectual calesthenics in order to (a) prove> that the initiation is blatantly sexual in nature, involving sexual> intercourse and the consumption of bodily fluids, or (b) that the language of> the Kālacakra Tantra is purely symbolic and has no literal meaning.> The purpose of the “seal” or consort is precisely that of a sexual partner.> However, it obviously is not intended to encourage anything resembling normal> sexual intercourse for this occurs in the context of a ritual that is> surrounded with stringent requirements that emphasize intense meditation and> visualization that lift the experience out of the ordinary understanding of> sexual intercourse. Periods of similarly intensive training take place in the> weeks, months and sometimes years before this stage of the initiation to> prepare the initiand for what will be required during the ritual.25> That sexual contact takes place within the Kālacakra initiations is affirmed> by no less an authority than the Dalai Lama himself. In his own book-length> discussion of this ritual and specifically on the Permission Initiation> section, he clearly states:> It is said that those of the Vajrasattva lineage symbolized by a curved knife> “should not deride the sky-lotus of any woman,” those of low type and so> forth. In its provisional sense, this means that those of the Vajrasattva> lineage should not deride a woman of any of the five lineages even if she be> lowly. In its definitive sense, this means that those of the Vajrasattva> lineage should use seals [consorts] but within binding, without emission, the> white mind of enlightenment that is the basis of bliss.26> The Dalai Lama here is differentiating between two modes of interpretation of> the text: the provisional and the definitive. The provisional is the ethical> or philosophical interpretation, while the definitive is the ritual> instruction itself. Thus, this is one example of the multivalence inherent in> the alchemical texts given by the leader of an important Tantric lineage, the> Dalai Lama himself.> The instructions pertinent to the above qualification “without emission” are> complex and involve the imposition of a type of etheric “plug” on the opening> of the penis. This comes to us from a ritual that is part of the Kālacakra> Tantra and which involves the person desiring initiation to be “born again.”> Prior to the actual initiation into the Kālacakra system, the prospective> initiand is “enhanced”: a method of preparation that involves laying a> psychological foundation that is acceptable to the initiator. This involves> the initiand entering the right frame of mind by accepting that the initiation> is not for his or her benefit alone, but is undertaken for the benefit of all> of sentient beings. Once this has been established to the satisfaction of the> initiator, the lama, the initiand then undergoes a ritual in which he or she> becomes a “child of the lama.”> This process is described because of its relation to the ideas of creation and> conception we have been discussing so far, with all its attendant allusions to> alchemical processes of transformation including biological systems and> fluids. Jeffrey Hopkins, in his Introduction to the Dalai Lama's book on the> initiation, explains the “enhancement” process as including the requirement of> the initiands to visualize their conception as taking place between the lama> (visualized as the deity Kālacakra) and the “mother” (a consort, presumably> human and not virtual) in which they enter the lama's mouth, attracted by a> ray of light that proceeds from the lama's heart cakra. They descend down> through the lama's body to eventually enter the womb of the “mother,” where> they dissolve only to become gradually reborn as a Kālacakra (the central> deity of the tradition) themselves.27> The visualization then becomes even more complex, as the rays of light issuing> from the heart of the lama draw all enlightened beings into his mouth. These> beings become dissolved into an elixir, which then passes through the lama> into the womb of the “mother,” where it anoints the initiands. This elixir is> called bodhichitta and is described as a “light-like fluid” which is composed> of the red and white “essential fluids that both males and females have.”28> The term bodhichitta is also used in “specific circumstances” (according to> Hopkins) to mean the purified form of semen.> The initiands then are in possession of two forms of consciousness, “wisdom> consciousness” and “blissful consciousness.”29 This implies that they not only> understand the nature of emptiness that is the goal of Buddhism but also are> joyful in its realization. This is the result of the successful harnassing of> the body's sexual impulses to an abstraction; the abstraction may be> intellectually powerful and even stimulating in a cerebral way, but by> attaching the orgasmic experience to the purely conceptual idea of emptiness> it becomes more real than any logical or philosophical construct.> The difference between this form of conception and birth and their normal> human counterparts is that sexual desire—the desire for union—is motivated in> this case by compassion. One desires rebirth because of the compassion one> feels for all sentient beings and the understanding that by becoming initiated> into this system one will be an active participant in the spiritual evolution> of all life. Thus, the sexual impulse is transformed into an altruistic desire> and any knowledge, wisdom, and powers attained along the way are all for the> purpose of helping others reach the state of bliss that comes with> experiencing emptiness, the Void that is behind and beyond all creation, all> illusion, māyā.> Transformation of desire notwithstanding, the orgasm is still an important> factor. It is the intensity of the orgasm, when united to the realization of> emptiness (and most importantly without emission), that transforms the> realization into a blissful one and thus is a more powerful experience:> This is how the desire for sexual union is used in the path in Highest Yoga> Tantra; in this tantra set, the usage of desire in the path is explicitly for> the sake of enhancing wisdom consciousness realizing emptiness by way of> actually generating subtler and thus more powerful consciousnesses that> realize it. The difficulty of using an orgasmic blissful consciousness to> realize anything indicates that it would take a person of great psychological> development and capacity to be able to utilize such a subtle state in the> path.30> This “internal initiation” is performed five times during the course of the> process. Hopkins tells us that “a key to understanding tantric initiation and> practice is repetition. Repetition is not merely to repeat what one did> before, but a chance to make progress through deeper realization or movement> to a subtler level of consciousness.”31 This repetition is reminiscent of the> repeated refining process in metallurgical alchemy, and the refining process> mimicked in the practices of nei dan Chinese alchemy.> The enhancement or “internal initiation” procedure is not yet complete,> however. The initiands emerge from the womb of the “mother” and reappear in a> waiting area outside the room where the mandala of initiation has been> created.32 They have not seen the mandala and, indeed, when eventually they> are brought in to see it they will be blindfolded, as in a Masonic rite of> initiation.

We tend to project prurient or erotic—or even> pornographic—ideas onto anything resembling “sacred sex.” Sexuality has become> an obsession in Western culture which makes it difficult to speak of sexuality> in any but terms of either procreation (and thus in a purely clinical fashion)> or pleasure. That sexuality can be made to serve a “higher” (or, at least, an> “other”) purpose seems either ridiculous or naive, or worse: an attempt at> using God or religion for purposes of seduction or sexual manipulation of the> innocent.> How difficult it becomes, then, when we are confronted with sections of the> Kālacakra Tantra which detail the methods of selecting the appropriate> “consort” from three “types” that verge on pedophilia, but which refer to> three stages of alchemical mercury, “childlike, youthful and mature.”35> The first, the “body consort,” is “in the form of a very young girl,” i.e., up> to eight years old for the first type and from eight to ten years old in the> second. The young girl's body is said to be code for raw mercury.> The second, the “speech consort,” is a girl from eleven to fifteen years old,> etc. and finally a third or “mind consort”: a woman from sixty to one hundred> years old.36> That these characteristics do not apply to actual human beings is evidenced by> further instructions concerning children born of children, or children born to> women aged one hundred years old, etc. etc. The consorts in this case are> place-holders for forms of mercury—i.e., rasa, which can mean a variety of> substances used to make the Elixir—and the sexual terminology is used to (a)> differentiate between different forms of mercury and (b) to instruct in the> chemical preparations by using terms that suggest gestation, procreation, etc.> None of this is to say that actual women are not partners in initiation. There> are two basic types of “consort” referred to in early sixteenth century> Tibetan sage Khedrup Norsang Gyatso's commentary on the Kālacakra Tantra, the> “wisdom” consort and the “activity” or mudrā consort. The wisdom consort is a> non-physical being, an ethereal construct of intense meditation. It is not> possible for union to take place between an initiate's physical form and the> subtle form that is the wisdom consort; such union takes place only on the> plane of meditation and visualization.> The activity consort, however, is a human being. This is a young woman> selected according to various physical and personal criteria but who is> nonetheless trained in the system so she will be able to cooperate fully in> the rituals. Citing sources in the Hevajra Tantra and the Vajragarbha> Commentary, both key Tantric texts, Khedrup says:> This teaches the characteristics of a mudrā consort. Her eyes are quite large,> with the red and white well separated. Her waist is like a vajra. She is one,> age twelve or sixteen, whose blood is flowing and who delights in> bodhicitta.37> In order for this child to be a suitable consort, she must be trained in the> dharma (in Buddhism) and “given initiation and transformed into a suitable> receptacle for tantra.”38 She takes Tantric vows and “becomes wise in the arts> of desire.” Khedrup goes on to elucidate how the sexual union should take> place, with the appropriate visualizations of the male and the female partners> as Kālacakra “father and mother” respectively. The sexual organs are blessed,> and eventually the “vajra” of the male enters the “lotus” of the female,> coaxing the drop of bodhicitta to emerge nearly to the opening of the penis> but avoiding, of course, seminal emission so that the “combined mind and wind> is drawn back up to create the four joys of stable ascent.”39 Kim Lai explains> that this seals “the inner child-like mercury in the central channel and> produces a changeable bliss from the melting and subsequent dripping of white> drops from the crown.”> This is nei dan alchemy in another context. The physiological—or should we say> “psycho-physiological”—operations are the same. The sexual union, the> avoidance of seminal emission (and, in some sources, the avoidance of orgasm> as well), the drawing up of the “essence” of the semen (referred to as> “mercury”) back into the cranial vault where it is refined to the point of> pure white drops that drip back down the subtle body, causing a psychic event> that is transformative.> IT IS PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE for someone raised in a Western culture to imagine a> scenario in which consensual sexual contact is taking place between a man and> a woman that does not have as its purpose either pleasure or procreation as> commonly understood. The degree of control over the body's natural responses> and instincts is considerable, and has been strengthened by the regular> practice of meditation, yoga and breathing exercises which focuses the mind> and extends its dominance over the body and over precisely those functions of> the nervous system with which we are most concerned.> The contortions of apologists for Tibetan Buddhism notwithstanding, the> (sometimes lurid) instructions of the Kālacakra Tantra obviously are intended> to be taken both literally and figuratively.

However, Buddhism has scriptures,temples, monks, nuns, rituals, and an ecclesiastical hierarchy, so for want of abetter term “religion” or “belief system” will have to suffice.17 See the cogent explanation in Kim Lai, “Iatrochemistry, Metaphysiology,Gnosis; Tibetan Alchemy in the Kalacakra Tantra,” in Aaron Cheak, editor,Alchemical Traditions: From Antiquity to the Avant-Garde, Numen Books,Melbourne, 2013, pp. 229–287.18 Kim Lai, op. cit., p. 229.19 Kim Lai, op. cit., p. 230.20 Peter Levenda, Tantric Temples, pp. 37–10.21 In Kim Lai, op. cit., pp. 234–237, the author criticizes David Gordon White'spoint of view that Tibetan alchemy essentially recapitulates Indian and Chineseforms, and while it is always dangerous to draw too many parallels betweendifferent systems there is the contrary danger in not seeing the forest for thetrees. What should be astounding to modern scholarship — that all of theseculturally and geographically disparate parts of the world share the same basicconcepts and same basic terminology for a discipline that still resists allattempts at easy classification by the West — somehow is lost in the scramble toassert one approach over another.

Whatever> he knew about alchemy, hermetic philosophy, and magic he found in books.> Indeed, in his Preface to the English language translation of the Rosicrucian> Manifestos, he writes, “... lest the reader should be so mad as to entertain a> suspicion that I am of the Order.”10 This would seem to argue against> Cockren's contention that he was a Rosicrucian, except perhaps in spirit: and> that may be where true Rosicrucianism is to be found.> There is a certain degree of romanticism associated with the idea of a secret> cabal of enlightened persons operating behind the scenes to make the world> right—the Ascended Masters of the Theosophical Society or the Secret Chiefs of> the Golden Dawn—and who is to say that this romantic ideal has not inspired> others to attain that same degree of selfless passion, becoming in the process> carriers of the Rosicrucian mythos if not the actual initiations?> Therefore we can see Vaughan's work as the result of a man struggling with an> intellectual endeavor for which there are no reliable sources, no competent> teachers. There is only the beautiful and seductive promise contained in a> literature of the fantastic, the obscure, the gothic, the politically and> religiously transgressive; yet it is a promise that Vaughan knows to be true.> He has seen it, touched it, been touched by it, and during his marriage to> Rebecca he comes as close as ever to solving the alchemical riddle and, in> fact, makes an important discovery on the very day Rebecca dies, which also> happened to be his birthday. This juxtaposition of birth and death is a> leitmotif through all of the alchemical literature—from the meetings of> Tantric circles in cremation grounds in India, meetings that included ritual> forms of sexual intercourse, to the many illustrations in European alchemical> treatises of dead and buried kings and queens rising from their graves. The> effect—of performing the act that leads to conception and birth in a place> where the dead are cremated—is that of the collapsing of time to a single> point.> During the process of teaching himself how to read the “book of Nature,” he> learned the alchemical language well enough to identify many of the substances> otherwise discussed under code names, and understands the alchemical process> so well he can relate it to Biblical scenarios. There is a “chicken and egg”> dynamic here, however. Once one has a grasp of the essentials in alchemy one> can then apply this knowledge towards an “initiated” reading of Biblical> sources and make further discoveries based on interpreting the Biblical> allegories as alchemical instructions. Vaughan's selection process, rooted as> it is in the chemistry as well as the philosophy, seems insulated against this> rather surrealist approach to the material, however. He uses Biblical sources> more as “proof texts” to illustrate his points rather than as sources of> specifically alchemical knowledge.> He finishes his Dedication to Anthroposophia Theomagica with a reference to> “the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood,” an obvious Christian reference but one> which has Platonic and alchemical (as well as Tantric) significance. He is> signalling here that he understands the interpenetration of religion and> alchemy, even where Christianity is concerned. It is reminiscent of Christ's> first transmutation, the changing of water into wine, and his last> transmutation, that of wine into his own blood. Christ, of course, is a kind> of alchemist not only because of the transmutations he effects in the Gospels> but also the multiplication of the loaves and fishes, and the raising of> Lazarus from the dead, as well as his own eventual death and resurrection. His> baptism at the hands of John the Baptist also can be considered an alchemical> act, the purificatio at which event the Spirit descends from above. Vaughan> does not expand on any of this, however, but simply drops it in without> further clarification.> Then, as he begins his text proper with a section entitled “The Author to the> Reader” he begins with another curious allusion, one which Waite himself> interpreted curiously.> God in love with His own beauty frames a glass, to view it by reflection. But> the frailty of the matter excluding eternity, the composure was subject to> dissolution. Ignorance gave this release the name of death, but properly it is> the soul's birth and a charter that makes for her liberty. She hath several> ways to break up house, but her best is without a disease. This is her> mystical walk, an exit only to return. When she takes air at this door, it is> without prejudice to her tenement.11> This is a rather roundabout way of describing the soul and its relationship to> the body, specifically the ability of the soul to leave and to return to the> same body at the moment of a “mystical union.” Waite calls it “... the> well-known mystical state of figurative death which is the threshold of union> ...” and goes on to say “The psychic substitutes are many, within and without> those states which belong to pathology ... It will be seen that this is> realisation in mind; but the true attainment is in love.”12> Vaughan goes on for a few more pages, talking about various ideas concerning> the soul and its characteristics according to various philosophies of the> past. It is a kind of critical “review of the literature” concerning the soul,> what it is, how it behaves. It is Waite's reaction to this initial statement> about the soul's “mystical walk,” however, which must have grabbed Rexroth's> attention, for all its talk of “figurative death,” the “threshold of union”> and the “true attainment is in love.”> The sense of Vaughan's statement is that the soul can leave the body but still> return to it; it does not signify literal death. Waite understands this to> mean that Vaughan is really talking about the “figurative death” that he> claims is a “well-known mystical state.” As this first work of Vaughan has the> state of man “after death” as its subtitle we would do well to look at Waite's> claim by a little more closely.> The idea of a mystical death as taking place on the “threshold of union” can> be understood as that loss of ego and sense of self that occurs in a deep> trance, when the soul is believed to have left the physical body (or, at> least, to be unconstrained by it), and comes close to an encounter with the> divine. In this state one is still conscious but lacks all self-awareness; it> seems that one's identity, if even for a moment, ceases to exist. In a> Biblical context, Jacob experiences his famous Ladder while sleeping with his> head on a stone; and angels appear to Saint Joseph—the spouse of Mary, the> mother of Jesus—on three separate occasions, always when Joseph is asleep.> Thus, sleep as a mimic of death can lead to dreams and visions, and also a> confrontation with the divine.> Among non-mystics, however, it is also known as la petite mort, the “little> death” that occurs immediately after orgasm to some persons at some times. It> is a state similar to a loss of consciousness. Is this the context within> which Waite understood the passage? It may be so, since he refers to the> “threshold of union” as being attained “through love.” This is both mystical> and erotic, as recent scholarship on analogies of death to sex has shown, and> becomes even more pronounced in a later treatise (the Magia Adamica), where> Vaughan refers to the Mors Osculi—the “kiss of death”—as the sleep of Jacob> that culminated in the vision of the Ladder:> Now to return to Jacob, it is written of him that he was asleep, but this is a> mystical speech, for it signifies death—namely, that death which the Kabalist> calls Mors Osculi, or the Death of the Kiss, of which I must not speak one> syllable.13> Waite's footnote to this passage states, “The state of mystical death and the> Kiss of the Shekinah.”14 Thus these concepts—at least insofar as Waite is> concerned—are linked: mystical death, the Mors Osculi, the “threshold of> union,” and “attainment in love.” To raise the stakes, Waite equates the Death> of the Kiss with the Kiss of the Shekinah. The Shekinah refers to the divine> Presence in post-Temple literature, and definitions and characterizations of> the Shekinah multiplied among the Kabbalists and Jewish mystics, to the point> where the Shekinah is now referred to as the “Bride of the Sabbath” in Jewish> religious ceremonies. The Kiss of the Shekinah is understood to be a sweet,> peaceful (permanent) death and is not normally equated with the temporary> mystical death to which Vaughan and Waite refer. Unless by emphasizing the> feminine aspect of the Shekinah as a Bride desiring to re-unite with God we> have a possible Tantric scenario consistent with reports of the Tantrikas> meeting in cremation grounds to conduct sexually-oriented rituals to bring> them to the “threshold of union” with the divine. In that case, all of the> above inferences and allusions by both Vaughan and Waite begin to make sense.> This association with mystical death, the kiss, the Shekinah, and a possible> erotic subtext is very suggestive of what Rexroth saw in the Vaughan oeuvre,> and current research in the subject seems to bear him out.> Eros, far from a mere symbolic representation of love or desire, appeared> historically as a numinous figure representing death and transmigration.15> Could Vaughan have failed to draw these conclusions on his own? After all, he> had an academic grounding in Latin and Greek and was quite familiar with the> Hermetic literature as well as the Classical, and had some knowledge of> Kabbalah (mostly through the Florentine Academy and Agrippa). The term Mors> Osculi could have come from Pico della Mirandola or even from Giordano Bruno,> both of whom discussed it in their work, but his source remains something of a> mystery.> Another tantalizing allusion is that of Waite to the idea of mystical death> and “psychic substitutes” both “within and without those states which belong> to pathology.” As usual, he does not elaborate on the most suggestive aspects> of his commentary. Is he referring to schizophrenia, or what they used to call> pre-senile dementia, or today's bipolar disorder? What pathological state> mimics mystical death? Catatonia? As someone who was a member of several> esoteric societies, Waite might have been familiar with some of these states> from would-be initiates whose obsessive tendencies led them to delusional> states, but I am not certain if that is what Waite intends by this throwaway> comment.> Anthroposophia Theomagica is primarily a study on the soul, but from the point> of view of alchemical and Platonic principles. Here begins Vaughan's> preoccupation with the idea of seed, of sperm, and of generation. To Vaughan,> a seed contains the essence of the plant. It appears as only a small object> when planted, but then grows into something more luxurious. How is this> possible? According to Vaughan, there is a spiritual power—a “pre-existent> matter”—in the seed that causes it to grow into a plant whose entire existence> is contained within the seed. While we know the mechanism by which a seed> sprouts and grows—earth, moisture, sunlight, etc.—we do not know or understand> the motivating force behind the sprouting and growth. When science did finally> reveal the phenomenon of photosynthesis, even that seemed magical: after all,> here was Light itself feeding the plants.> I conceived those seeds whereof vegetables did spring must be something else> at first than seeds, as having some pre-existent matter whereof they were> made, but what that matter should be I could not guess. Here I was forced to> leave off speculation and come up to experience. Whiles I sought the world I> went beyond it, and I was now in quest of a substance which—without art—I> could not see.16> He was seeking a substance behind Creation, an invisible essence that was at> the heart of reality. He draws an analogy between imagination in humans and> something similar to it in the mind of God:> That meditation foreruns every solemn work is a thing so well known to man> that he needs no further demonstration of it than his own practice. That there> is also in God something analogical to it, from whence man derived this> customary notion of his, as it is most agreeable to reason, so withal is it> very suitable to Providence.17> He spends some time on this theme, forging an identity between the mind of God> and the vital spirit that informs all Creation. He draws similarities and> inferences between these Platonic ideas and that of the Holy Trinity, which we> won't go into here as they would be of interest to an audience even more> limited than the present readership! He then cites Biblical sources as proof> that God sometimes communicates through dreams; this will come into play> again, especially in the Notebook wherein he records dreams he had of his wife> after her death.> Then he does something interesting by connecting the idea of the Trinity to a> concept of love that reminds us of Pico della Mirandola and Giordano Bruno:> God the Father is the Metaphysical, Supercelestial Sun; the Second Person is> the Light; and the Third is Fiery Love, or a Divine Heat proceeding from both.> Now, without the presence of this Heat there is no reception of the Light and> by consequence no influx from the Father of Lights. For this Love is the> medium which unites the Lover to that which is beloved, and probably ‘tis the> Platonic's “Chief Daimon, Who doth unite us with the Prefects of Spirits.” I> could speak much more of the offices of this Loving Spirit, but these are> “grand mysteries of God and Nature” and require not our discussion so much as> our reverence.18> It is striking that Vaughan becomes reticent precisely on those points that> touch most directly on the primary secret of the alchemical process. Waite in> a footnote to this statement clarifies the idea that the Holy Spirit> represents “the bond of love between the Father and the Son. So also in the> inward human trinity the desire part is the bond between mind and will.> Finally, in the great attainment love is the chain of union between the soul> and the Christ-Spirit.”19 What is striking is that Waite's clarification> amplifies Vaughan, but does not reveal why Vaughan would have been cautious in> mentioning something that was, according to Waite's own admission, a point of> view of “orthodox theology.” Clearly, both Vaughan and Waite are skirting the> issue here.> Love (or desire) as the bond between mind and will in the human being reflects> the thought of Bruno, who identified love as the bond that is the engine of> magic, echoing certain sentiments of the Florentine Academy but expanding upon> them greatly even going so far as to prescribe different magical approaches> for different purposes.20 In more modern times, it anticipates the famous> dictum of the English magician, Aleister Crowley, who affirmed “Love is the> law, love under will.”> There is much more in this work about “love” in its various mystical> manifestations and, indeed, this concept is carried further in his other> works. That love was considered to be the creative impetus in Creation—and> that love was the source of the power that is in the seed—is central to> Vaughan's thesis as it is to both the Platonists and Agrippa. It is difficult,> if not impossible, to separate mentally the “philosophical” idea of love from> its more mundane manifestations, and perhaps it is this multivalent quality of> the word that enables philosophers like Vaughan to use it with abandon. This> becomes amplified when he begins discussing seeds, sperm, seminal fluid,> menstruum, impregnation, generation, and reproduction. Ostensibly he is> requiring the reader to look beyond the common understandings of these words> to what is represented by them—as is true of all alchemical language—but at> the same time, due to the nature of alchemy itself which is the “science of> everything,” he must realize that he also intends the reader to understand the> common applications of these terms. It is only by applying what we already> know of subjects like love, desire, seed, etc. that we can understand> Vaughan's thesis; and the very fact that he avoids giving a clearer> explanation of what he means—specifically when it comes to this point—is> evidence that he is well aware of what he is describing.> The beginning of this work is entirely involved with describing Creation, and> is based on a motley of sources, from the Bible to Agrippa, Trithemius, the> Platonic philosophers, etc. It is an example of what we have been insisting> upon since the beginning of this work, that what preoccupies alchemists is the> Creation. It is a desire to go back to the beginning of time to bear witness> to that moment and to observe how everything was made. There is also the keen> sense that Creation is somehow perfectible or, at any rate, that its process> can be speeded up. Lead can become gold because lead is already in the process> of becoming gold; people can become healthy because the body wants to be> healthy, it only needs an external power to remove impurities and restore the> balance. The implication in this concept is that Creation—while a perfect> emanation from the mind of God—is imperfect. Something happened along the way,> and to the Christian alchemist that means the fall of Adam. It was the sin of> disobedience to God that caused humanity to find itself in a state of crisis> and imbalance. The alchemist seeks to restore that imbalance and—because of> awareness that sin was the ultimate cause of the problem—understands that an> integral part of the alchemical process is a spiritual quest for Unity, and> Union. The alchemists of Asia understood the same problem but expressed it> differently. For them it was not a question of sin—with all its moral and> ethical baggage—but simply one of imbalance: spiritual and biological> obstacles, the need for greater sacrifices, more attention to ritual, and a> close observation of Nature in its alignment with macrocosmic forces.> The entire created world existed, according to Vaughan, in the mind of God in> all of its particulars:> No sooner had the Divine Light pierced the bosom of the matter but the idea or> pattern of the whole material world appeared in those primitive waters, like> an image in a glass. By this pattern it was that the Holy Ghost framed and> modelled the universal structure.21> This seems at first glance like a description of DNA, or perhaps the> Holographic Universe theory. The Divine Light was identified by Vaughan with> the Second Person of the Trinity and the Holy Ghost, one recalls, is> identified with Amor. Thus, the Second Person (Christ) pierced the bosom of> matter and the pattern of the whole world appeared—and then Amor “framed and> modelled the universal structure.”> There also is darkness at the center of the world, according to Vaughan. The> Light of Genesis contracted into a Sun, and Darkness remained hidden in> Creation only to come out at the appointed time every day. There is a lot of> discussion of darkness, how it was suppressed, submerged, etc. by the Light> and the various stages of matter that ensued involving water and earth, and> then the influence of Light. He even speaks of a union between God and Nature> as a kind of hieros gamos, and then—when speaking of the darkness that lurks> beneath the surface of the created world—he writes the following curious line:> The darkness, whence proceed the corruptions and consequently the death of the> creature, was imprisoned in the centre, but breaks out still when the day> gives it leave, and like a baffled giant thrusts his head out of doors in the> absence of his adversary. Thus Nature is a Lady whose face is beauteous but> not without a black-bag.22> It is an oddly surreal image, and follows on the idea that darkness is a> baffled giant stuck in the center of the earth. This is an example of the kind> of prose for which Vaughan is known and may owe something to the fact that his> brother was a well-known metaphysical poet.> We could spend a lot of time going over some of Vaughan's other quirky prose,> and even Waite is often confused by his use of pronouns, various allusions,> misquoted Latin phrases, etc. This is the writing of someone eager to convey> something, something that he believes he knows, and is simultaneously> desperate to communicate it and just as anxious about revealing too much.> Hence, what we get at times is perilously close to stream-of-consciousness.> However, while a complete interlinear annotated edition of Vaughan is a> desideratum we will restrict ourselves to the matter at hand which is> Vaughan's “secret,” the one he wishes us to know without actually telling us> what it is.> He begins to talk about the condition of the primordial earth as an “impure> sulfureous substance or caput mortuum of the creation.”23 The term caput> mortuum or “death's head” is an alchemical reference and sometimes means the> residue of an operation, the material to be discarded. However, this phase> also is sometimes referred to as the Nigredo, the “blackness” or, as Vaughan> seems to imply above, the “darkness,” and is a necessary first step in the> alchemical operation. It is from this decomposed matter that vital essences> will be extracted. In this instance he also connects the caput mortuum with> sulfur, and is clearly making a statement concerning alchemy but using Genesis> as a blind.> He goes on to state “But the Divine Spirit, to make His work perfect, moving> also upon these, imparted to them life and heat, and made them fit for future> productions.”24 It is interesting that Vaughan seems to think that Creation at> this stage is impure, a caput mortuum, which needs the influence of the Spirit> to make it fit for production. Thus he is clearly not speaking any longer> about the Biblical account in Genesis. In fact, he goes on to claim that God> will eventually rid Creation of the darkness so that darkness will only reside> outside of Creation, an “outward darkness” as he calls it.25 These are all> alchemical allusions, but couched in such Biblical-sounding terminology that> one can become easily confused.> Much of the next few pages is taken up with describing the various types of> water, of earth, of the elements themselves and how they are combined. He> notes that each of the four “Platonic” elements of earth, air, fire and water> has two genders—male and female—and three principles (corresponding to the> Trinity). Some of this is derived from Agrippa and similar sources, and for> now we need not concern ourselves with the considerable detail and convoluted> prose.> There are a few passages that deserve our attention for the glimpse into> Vaughan's worldview they provide. It is an extremely gendered view, everything> explained in terms of male and female, of sperm and menstruum, with Biblical,> Platonic and Kabbalistic proof texts provided to serve as foundations for what> is an essentially Tantric worldview. We can say that Vaughan had absolutely no> idea of Tantra or of Indian or Chinese alchemy, which makes his writing even> more compelling for he struggles to express the Creation in Tantric terms.> Considering his pious Christian background, a gendered view of Creation would> have been unusual if not heretical. In terms of orthodox Christian theology,> Creation took place as a result of the will of God. It would remain to the> philosophical contortions of Neoplatonic commentators and Gnostic mystics to> see a sexual apparatus at work in the Creation as an illuminated> interpretation of the standard Biblical texts.> Vaughan writes:> ... the earth ... being the subsidence or remains of that primitive mass which> God formed out of darkness, must needs be a feculent, impure body; for the> extractions which the Divine Spirit made were pure, oleous, ethereal> substances, but the crude, phlegmatic, indigested humours settled like lees> towards the centre. The earth is spongy, porous and magnetical, of composition> loose, the better to take in the several influences of heat, rains and dews> for the nurture and conservation of her products. In her is the principal> residence of that matrix which attracts and receives the sperm from the> masculine part of the world.26> There is nothing in the above statement that corresponds with the Biblical> account of Creation, so we are forced to interpret all of this as alchemical> formulae. There is a “masculine part of the world” which somehow contributes> sperm to the earth. The earth, in this case, being the caput mortuum since> Vaughan's earth is a “remains of that primitive mass which God formed out of> darkness....”> He continues with a most interesting statement:> We have astronomy here under our feet; the stars are resident with us ...27> While Vaughan is expressing ideas learned from the doctrine of correspondences> and especially from Agrippa, as someone who has studed Shangqing Daoist> alchemy and the strange “Pace of Yü,” I cannot help but see an allusion to the> practice of “walking” on the stars of the Northern Dipper (or Big Dipper) that> is so much a part of this ancient shamanic practice. In this ritual, astronomy> is indeed “under our feet” and the stars of the Dipper are “resident with us”> as the chapter on Chinese alchemy shows. More importantly, perhaps, Vaughan is> emphasizing (as he does throughout his work) the interpenetration of the> macrocosmic and microcosmic worlds. This is something that he takes for> granted, but realizes that it is not immediately obvious to an observer on> earth—so he is at pains to convince the reader using the poetic language that> is the only real tool at his disposal. He will further develop this theme of> stars and what he calls the “Star-Fire of Nature” in other works in which he> will claim that each star in the heavens contains an essence which can be> found on earth as well, and again continuing his sexual allegory:> There is in every star, and in this elemental world, a certain principle which> is the “Bride of the Sun.” These two in their coition do emit semen, which> seed is carried in the womb of Nature, but the ejection of it is performed> invisibly, and in a sacred silence, for this is the conjugal mystery of Heaven> and Earth, their act of generation, a thing done in private between males and> females, but how much more—think you—between the two universal natures? Know> therefore that it is impossible for you to extract or receive any seed from> the sun without this feminine principle which is the Wife of the Sun.28> It is completely unnecessary to belabor the point (as Vaughan does) that there> is an emission of semen between two principles which occurs “in a sacred> silence” and is a “conjugal mystery,” etc. etc. unless there is another point> he is trying to make. From the point of view of chemistry, of course, there is> no point. From the point of view of alchemy and its infamous twilight> language, there is still no point. One can use the similes of semen and womb> briefly and without further elaboration as alchemists sometimes do, but> Vaughan does not stop there. He is clearly writing on several levels> simultaneously which is what perplexes commentators like Waite who accurately> point out that Vaughan frequently confuses different contexts, contradicts> himself in many places (sometimes on the same page), and rambles> incomprehensibly into what appear to be sidetracks unrelated to the central> argument of the work. It is, as Rexroth pointed out in his Foreword, “...> though a textbook of chemistry, another of mining engineering, another of> geology and mineralogy, another of physiology, another of gymnastics and> breathing exercises, another of pharmacology, several sex manuals, and many> treatises of transcendental mysticism had been torn to pieces and not just> mixed up together, but fused into a totally new chemical compound of> thought.”29 Furthermore, Rexroth suspects that Waite understood this all> along, and that in his own Introduction and the footnotes that accompany every> text of Vaughan he was “covering his tracks.”> Later on in the same work, Vaughan goes into considerable detail on each of> the four elements. When speaking of the water element, he states the> following:> The water hath several complexions, according to the several parts of the> creature. Here, below, and in the circumference of all things, it is volatile,> crude and raco. For this very cause Nature makes it no part of her provision> but she rectifies it first, exhaling it up with her heat and then condensing> it to rains and dews, in which state she makes use of it for nourishment.> Somewhere it is inferior, vital and celestial, exposed to the Breath of the> First Agent and stirred with spiritual, eternal winds. In this condition it is> Nature's wanton—femina satacissima, as one calls it. This is that Psyche of> Apuleius, and the fire of Nature is her Cupid. He that hath seen them both in> the same bed will confess that love rules all.30> First, we notice that Nature rectifies the element of water because it is> useless to her in its original state. She “exhales it up with her heat” and> then condenses it “to rains and dews” and is eventually “stirred with> spiritual, eternal winds.” If we apply this terminology to the human body then> we have a seventeenth century English version of the raising of> Ku[images/00059.jpg][images/00062.jpg]alinī through the use of> prā[images/00059.jpg]āyāma.> Waite has no explanation or translation of the words raco and satacissima, but> that is because he probably was working from a corrupt text. Rudrum shows raco> as raw, and femina satacissima is actually femina salacissima, or a “wanton> woman”31 (from the same root, salax, as the English “salacious”). This “wanton> woman” has parallels in Indian alchemy and Tantra, especially with regards to> the seductive powers of Pārvatī, the wife of Shiva, which is cognate of course> with the Serpent Ku[images/00059.jpg][images/00062.jpg]alinī.32 It is the> reference to Psyche and Cupid, however, that is of interest here.> Waite complains in a footnote to this statement that the proof is on Vaughan> to demonstrate that there is any alchemical relevance to the story of Psyche> and Cupid, notwithstanding—he says—the French hermeticist Antoine-Joseph> Pernety (1716–1796) who claimed that Psyche represents “Mercurial Water” and> Cupid “igneous fixed earth,” but that these are “reveries.”33 However, a> closer look at the tale of Psyche and Cupid in the famous version referenced> by Vaughan as that of Apuleius (c. 124–170 C.E.) in The Golden Ass shows that> Psyche battles dragons in order to seize the Elixir of Life and that she is> assisted in this mission by an eagle sent to her by Jupiter. This is very> close to the story in the Indian Rā[images/00066.jpg]āyana of the bird Garuda> fighting serpents to obtain the am[images/00053.jpg]ta, the same Elixir of> Life. The similarity in motifs between the two tales suggests that they either> come from the same source (or simply that the tale of Apuleius was borrowed> from the Hartlib, which implies that this was available in the Near East and> Greece during Apuleius's lifetime) or that they both refer to a basic concept> that was known to the ancients of different nations and encoded in this form.> By insisting on this melange of symbols from various sources, all referring to> sexual conduct, we are forced to entertain the idea that Vaughan's intention> is to reinforce the genderized view of the cosmos in all its particulars—from> the macrocosmic play of forces, elements, and essences to the microcosmic> relations of men and women. This is not, however, merely a “salacious”> approach to the material; for Vaughan—like alchemists in other parts of the> world, and at other times—views sexuality as sacred. It is not to be indulged> in for the sake of pleasure only, but as a means of reaching God. The mystical> union of a human being with God is mimicked in the sacred union between two> human beings; better said, the sacred union is a microcosmic version of the> macrocosmic union that results in the transcendent state of advaita or> non-duality. They both take place at the same place and time; that is the> essence of the alchemical worldview. Like the Indian and Chinese alchemists,> Vaughan knows that ordinary sexuality that results in the propagation of the> species also propagates the errors and weaknesses of the species. To underline> this point, he writes:> Out of this and some former passages the understanding reader may learn that> marriage is a comment on life, a mere hieroglyphic or outward representation> of our inward vital composition. For life is nothing else but an union of male> and female principles, and he that perfectly knows this secret knows the> mysteries of marriage—both spiritual and natural—and how he ought to use a> wife. Matrimony is no ordinary trivial business, but in a moderate sense> sacramental.34> The remark about how one “ought to use a wife” (!) aside, this is one of those> statements in Vaughan that truly “gives the show away.” Taken purely at face> value, what Vaughan is telling us is that there are two marriages—the one> spiritual, the other natural—and that marriage is a microcosm of what is> taking place macrocosmically. It is not merely a doctrine of correspondences> in which the sun in the heavens has a counterpart on earth or in the human> body; those are correspondences of objects. What Vaughan is revealing is that> there is a corollary to this doctrine and it extends to acts performed.> In order to be an alchemist, then, it is necessary to first know the basic> “philosophical” structure of the universe and then to become willfully and> consciously engaged in its processes. To become aware with the realization> that every act performed in the world has a counterpart in the “heavens” is to> enter into a profound relationship with matter, which itself is seen as> sacramental.> There is a danger here, however. The kind of consciousness required of the> alchemist—the magician, the Tantrika—can lead the unprepared to paranoia,> suspicion, anxiety, and madness. The extension of conscious control over the> autonomic nervous system—as mentioned by Rexroth—has its counterpart in the> extension of conscious control over all the events in one's life. For those> with demons in their unconscious minds—like impurities in their water, or> harmful bacillae in their bloodstreams due to guilt, or anger, frustration, or> even desire—this acknowledgment of responsibility can be overwhelming, and> devastating.> (It is not the author's intention to invoke Jungian or any other school of> psychology in these pages, but it is impossible to ignore the psychological> implications of engaging upon an alchemical quest. There are some safeguards> built into taking the various Buddhist, Tibetan, and Indian initiations as> there are teachers operating within an identifiable school with a (more or> less) consistent literature. The Western alchemical path, however, has no such> safeguards. It is essentially a solitary, trial-and-error method. It is> walking an existential tightrope without an ontological net.)> Happily, for Vaughan, death (at least) is not the end. We remember that the> subtitle to this work concerns the state of human beings “after death,” and in> this Vaughan does not disappoint:> Death is “recession of life into the hiddenness”—not the annihilation of any> one particle but a retreat of hidden natures to the same state they were in> before they were manifested. This is occasioned by the disproportion and> inequality of the matter; for when the harmony is broken by the excess of any> one principle, the vital twist—without a timely reduction of the first> unity—disbands and unravels.35> Thus for Vaughan—as for modern science—energy cannot be destroyed, but only> change its state from kinetic to potential. It is tempting to think of> Vaughan's “vital twist” as a prophetic reference to the DNA molecule, but of> course that is pure fancy.> Vaughan ends his work with a reference to, and defense of, Cornelius Agrippa.> This is somewhat problematic, as we mentioned earlier. Agrippa was not known> as an alchemist but what alchemical operations he did perform aroused the> contempt of other alchemists, such as Michael Maier who condemns Agrippa by> name (and a hideous pun) in the very first emblem of his Atalanta Fugiens.> Michael Maier (1568–1622) was a German alchemist who wrote extensively on the> subject, and who was an enemy of those who equated alchemy with magic,> including Edward Kelly and Cornelius Agrippa. Kelly he characterized as a> “puffer”: those who pretended to alchemical knowledge and ability but who were> most usually found to be frauds who deceived the public. As for Agrippa, he> accused him of black magic and of obviously being a charlatan as evidenced by> his unhappy, impoverished life. Maier wanted to rescue the reputation of> alchemy from the disdain it had acquired in scientific and intellectual> circles as superstitious and pagan. He also believed that music had as much a> role in alchemical theory and praxis as did chemistry and philosophy. In fact,> Maier also included poetry in the world of alchemy, which is certainly one way> to interpret alchemical language.> For Agrippa, however, Maier skewers him in the Epigram to Emblem I in his> Atalanta Fugiens as follows:> When the unborn child, which lies hidden in the womb of the North wind,> One day will rise to the light, alive,> He alone will be able to surpass all deeds of heroism> With his art, his hand, bodily strength and spirit,> Let him not be born for you like a Coeso, and not as a useless abortion,> Not as an Agrippa, but under a lucky star.36> Historian Dr. H. M. DeJong explains the reference to Agrippa thus:> ... Maier warns that the “Son of Philosophy” has to be born under a lucky> star, and not like a child delivered by a caesarian section, not as a useless> abortion, not like an Agrippa. In Pliny's works, Agrippa means a coccyx birth,> where the mother suffers pain. In the same way the abortive “Son of> Philosophy,” Agrippa of Nettesheim, made his mother Sapienta suffer.37> This rather vile attack on the author of the Three Books of Occult Philosophy> seems a little overboard considering that many of Agrippa's problems in life> occurred because he ran afoul of the Church. As a theologian, he defended> works on the Kabbalah such as Reuchlin's De verbo mirifico, and was> stigmatized as a heretic (although he was not arrested on this charge). Of> course, his friendship with the renegade Catholic Abbot Johannes Trithemius> would also not do him any good in the long run as Trithemius himself was> suspected of demonolatry and heresy. Maier, it seems, wanted desperately for> alchemy to be considered a mainstream practice—the pinnacle if not the> apotheosis of the liberal arts—and in order to do this he had to strip away> anything that seemed questionable or transgressive. He was a champion of the> Rosicrucians—as was Vaughan, of course, though Vaughan does not mention Maier> in his works—and saw in that Society a way of incorporating alchemy more> firmly into the arts of medicine and theology. He repudiated Edward Kelly> because Kelly was exposed at one point as a fraud, even though he had known> both Kelly and his comrade John Dee in presumably happier times. Thus, it> would seem that Maier was eager to distance himself and alchemy from any taint> of magic, sorcery, counterfeit gold, etc. and to do so he had to ridicule some> of the major voices of Renaissance esotericism.> It is possible that Vaughan had Maier in mind when he wrote Anthroposophia> Theomagica in 1648, thirty years after Atalanta Fugiens was published in> German in 1617. It is also possible that the sentiment of the times was> against all magic anyway and included Agrippa in a list of objectionable> thinkers and philosophers who were easy targets for Maier and demanding some> kind of defense from Vaughan. What is more likely is that Agrippa was the> first stop in the literature for someone like Vaughan, just as Arthur Edward> Waite's Book of Ceremonial Magic was a first stop for many would-be occultists> in the 1960s. Agrippa introduced a wider world of subjects ranging from> Platonism to astrology, from ceremonial magic to the occult properties of> stones, plants, and minerals. Vaughan may have found in this encylopedic work> a valuable reference and introduction to many of the themes that would consume> him for the rest of his life.

When shown the offending passage in a ritual entitled Star> Sapphire—and having to do with an adept “armed with his Magick Rood (and> provided with his Mystic Rose)”—the penny dropped and Crowley realized that> the secret of the O.T.O. had to do with a sexual rite between a priest and a> priestess, the “rood” in question being interpreted by Reuss as a word for> “phallus” and “rose” as “vagina,” hence lingam and yoni.

There is no space here to go into a discussion of thiscontroversy, except perhaps to add that Crowley was a syncretist and in a sensea popularizer of esoteric themes, which often leads to an editing process whereinformation that is not supportive of a point of view is—consciously orunconsciously—suppressed.

Then, he digresses into a colorful attack upon Henry More> before finally beginning his work proper.> This is probably a good place to clarify the concept of Chaos. We saw in the> previous chapter that no less a modern occultist as Aleister Crowley enshrined> Chaos as the Father and Babalon as the Mother in the Gnostic Mass. Chaos has> an ancient Greek pedigree as the watery mass out of which all Creation> proceeds. It was Chaos that gave birth to the Earth as Gaia, to the Underworld> in the form of Tartarus, and—tellingly—to Desire as Eros. These three> offspring of Chaos are responsible for the Universe as we know it according to> the Greeks.11 [index_split_054.html#filepos764421]> A symbol of this primordial Chaos was the Orphic Egg. Orphism was the mystery> religion that gave rise to the Dionysian mysteries. In the myth, Orpheus> descended into the Underworld (as did Persephone and Bacchus, among others).> The Orphic mysteries were thus transgressive, liminal rites that led devotees> to the experience of death and rebirth; according to Orphism, the natural fate> of human souls was an endless cycle of reincarnation or metempsychosis. The> Orphic initiate was promised an end to this fate and a release from this world> and union with the Divine. (If this sounds suspiciously like Buddhist Tantra,> be assured you are not alone!)> The Orphic Egg was the foundation of the Universe. It was Dionysus (in some> versions, Phanes in others) who broke out of the Egg and brought Light to the> world and to Creation. One can say that the Egg was the state of the universe> in the second immediately preceding the Big Bang. Thus, when Vaughan> references Chaos and the Egg he is referencing this long Hellenistic tradition> which also saw a similar Creation myth in Egypt with the Egg of Ra. (In this> case, an Egg is deposited on a mound of earth, and Ra is hatched from it;> other versions give Ptah as the god who comes forth from the Egg.) When> Crowley and other modern esoterists reference Chaos they are also—consciously> or not—repeating this ancient concept.

It is:> ... the first, visible, tangible substance that ever God made: it is white in> appearance and Paracelsus gives you the reason why: “All things”—saith> he—“when they first proceed from God are white, but He colours them afterwards> according to His pleasure.”33 [index_split_054.html#filepos770331]> In the alchemical laboratory this substance—which Vaughan now calls “the> chaos”—is blood-red “because the Central Sulfur is stirred up and discovered> by the Philosophical Fire.” That was the first preparation. In the second> preparation, “it is exceeding white and transparent like the heavens. It is in> truth somewhat like common quicksilver, but of a celestial, transcendent> brightness, for there is nothing upon earth like it.” 34> [index_split_054.html#filepos770541]> To confuse matters even further, Vaughan insists that this substance “is no> animal, no vegetable, no mineral, neither is she extracted out of animals,> vegetables or minerals, but she is pre-existent to them all, for she is the> mother of them. ... She yields to nothing but love, for her end is generation> and that was never yet performed by violence. He that knows how to wanton and> toy with her, the same shall receive all her treasures.”35> [index_split_054.html#filepos770758]> This seems curious at face value. The First Matter is something basic to> everything in Creation, which pre-exists Creation, and which is the impulse> behind all generation. Once again, Vaughan recapitulates his insistence on> “love” as the means of approaching the First Matter. His insistence that the> substance is neither animal nor vegetable nor mineral may reflect more his own> limitation of understanding the composition of the First Matter rather than an> accurate or literal characterization, for this substance clearly has color,> brightness, and a certain corporeality. However, we may say that light itself> also satisfies these conditions and this idea may take us somewhat further> along towards discovering the First Matter.36> [index_split_054.html#filepos770968] Light does pre-exist all animals,> vegetables, and minerals especially in terms of Genesis, the prime alchemical> text, where light is created on the first day of Creation and the animals,> vegetables and minerals not until the third day. Light cannot be extracted> from them but was a pre-requisite for their existence if Genesis is to be> believed.> We should be cautious, however, and not jump to conclusions that may be> premature. Vaughan has much more to say on this subject, and his terminology> ranges from the purely chemical to the biological to the spiritually abstract,> which is suggestive of our own line of inquiry since the alchemy of the Daoist> and the Tantrika is both chemical and spiritual as well as biological."},{"pageContent":"An Obsession with Obfuscation> In order to spare the reader a lot of exposition on a page-by-page, or> line-by-line basis as we have done previously, I would like to summarize the> essential points of the remainder of this work.

The First Matter is called “the sperm”> by one Rachaidibius, the Persian, and is “outwardly cold and moist but> inwardly hot and dry.” Another alchemist is quoted as saying, “The sperm is> white and liquid, afterwards red. This sperm is the Flying Stone, and it is> aerial and volatile, cold and moist, hot and dry.”40> [index_split_054.html#filepos772773] This leads us to understand that the> sperm, or First Matter, is both cold and hot, moist and dry, which seems quite> ridiculous at first; but these are four qualities that may be found in> everything and the First Matter is, by definition, the source of all the> elements. The colors white and red are, of course, the iconic alchemical> colors representing sperm and menstruum respectively, both in their biological> and in their chemical states.

From the famous alchemical text, the Turba> Philosophorum, is quoted: “... our Stone is no stone: but amongst ignorants it> is ridiculous and incredible.

This is, according to Vaughan, a “discourse of the First Matter”> which originally appeared in Latin but which he gives in English translation.> The nameless author of this text begins by speaking in the name of Nature,> which is a goddess “for beauty and extraction famous, born out of our own> proper sea which compasseth the whole earth and is ever restless.” Again we> find that the First Matter begins as water, or the sea, but not as the water> or sea with which we are familiar.> Out of my breasts I pour forth milk and blood: boil these two till they are> turned into silver and gold.... Thou art the First Matter, the seed of Divine> Benediction, in whose body there is heat and rain, which notwithstanding are> hidden from the wicked, because of thy habit and virgin vestures which are> scattered over all the world. Thy parents are the sun and moon; in these there> is water and wine, gold also and silver upon earth, that mortal man may> rejoice.... Torture the Eagle till she weeps and the Lion be weakened and> bleed to death. The blood of this Lion, incorporated with the tears of the> Eagle, is the treasure of the earth.

While this may certainly represent a chemical process in> disguise, it also can be taken somewhat literally. The milk and blood—the> white and red—we have already come to understand as the subtle counterparts or> essences of human sperm and vaginal secretions. That they “turn into silver> and gold” represents the moon and the sun, respectively, and therefore the> female and male principles in Nature which united are the “seed of Divine> Benediction,” i.e., the bodhicitta or the purified sexual essences which have> been united in the cranial vault, purified, refined, and which drips back down> into the body as “heat and rain.” This is emphasized in the lines “Thy parents> are the sun and moon; in these there is water and wine, gold also and silver> upon earth....” This easily could be a prose analysis of the Chinese> alchemical depiction we discussed earlier, showing the sun and moon as the> eyes, etc.> The passage concerning the torture of the Eagle and the weakness of the Lion> and the fluids of tears and blood is once again a patently biological allusion> which—although it may be interpreted chemically, albeit with some> contortions—nevertheless is revealing of the true nature of Vaughan's alchemy.> When the blood and tears are united, the “treasure of the earth” is obtained> as long as it “remains in the fire without any detriment,” i.e., is> continually recycled within the subtle body and not allowed to dissipate. If> successful, then the product of this practice “cures all diseases of men,> beasts and metals” which is as good a description of the Elixir Vitae—the> am[images/00053.jpg]ta, the soma, the nei dan or “inner elixir”—as any.> The reference to the Salamander indicates the elemental force of Fire; but it> is also a reptile and this may be purely speculative but seems consistent with> the idea that the First Matter is a serpent coiled at the base of the spine.> Vaughan's Rosicrucian excerpt then goes on to relate a system of five gates:> alchemical processes necessary to the production of the Elixir. The first gate> is knowledge of “the True Matter”; the second gate is the process whereby the> tears and blood of the Eagle and Lion are obtained, which leads to the> preparation of the Matter; the third gate is the fire that produces what he> calls the Medicine; the fourth gate is that of multiplication, which is the> end of the process of making the Medicine; the fifth gate is projection, which> is appropriate only for metals (the implication being that the Medicine is> indeed the Elixir Vitae).> These steps are actually well known to alchemists and refer to inceration,> multiplication, and projection of the Red Stone. The Red Stone is itself a> preliminary manifestation of the Philosopher's Stone which goes through these> additional steps in order to prepare it for the transmutation of metals.> Vaughan is thus speaking of the chemical process as well as of the spiritual> one, remembering all the while that in alchemy one cannot separate the one> from the other: they are part of a single continuum of Creation. If the> corporeal aspect of the Work is neglected, all that is obtained is a ghost. If> the spiritual aspect is neglected, all that is obtained is a stillbirth: a> physical body but without a soul, i.e., without life or motion.> Further on in the Rosicrucian discourse a poisonous Dragon is invoked: “Out of> my body thou shalt draw the Green and the Red Lion; but if thou dost not> exactly know me thou wilt—with my fire—destroy thy five senses.” The Green> Lion has many possible interpretations—depending on whether mineral or plant> alchemical processes are being described—but in minerals it usually refers to> vitriol, another name for sulfuric acid. The Red Lion in the mineral process> is a compound of red lead and acetic acid. The combination of the Green and> Red Lions would produce a volatile and poisonous environment. In biological> terms the Red Lion is, of course, the life force believed to be present in> blood; the Green Lion is an analogue of the process of photosynthesis (the> Green Lion is often depicted devouring the Sun, and this is believed to refer> to the heat of the Sun causing moisture to feed the plants from the earth and> the light of the Sun energizing the plants to grow; thus we have water, earth,> heat, and light which are the forces to which Vaughan and many other> alchemists always refer).> If we port these concepts to the inner alchemy of China and India we will> discover that the images are cognate. The Dragon is the untamed life force in> the body, the Ku[images/00059.jpg][images/00062.jpg]alinī in its resting state> before any type of spiritual cultivation, being dissipated through normal> intercourse. You must separate the Green and the Red Lions from the Dragon so> that the female and male principles are independently refined using the fire> in the crucible of the subtle body and then brought together again in divine> union in the cranial vault. A mistake somewhere along this process would> “destroy thy five senses,” i.e., cause neurological damage.> If this explanation seems fanciful, read what Vaughan's anonymous Rosicrucian> has to say next:> I give thee faculties both male and female and the powers both of heaven and> earth.44 [index_split_054.html#filepos773613]> If one is given faculties “both male and female” it is easy to see that we are> speaking of an internal psycho-biological process such as we have already> described at length. Then:> I am the egg of Nature known only to the wise, such as are pious and modest,> who make of me a little world.45 [index_split_054.html#filepos773830]> We see that Vaughan's egg analogy has come back to us, albeit from a different> source. One begins to wonder if, perhaps, this nameless Rosicrucian author is> none other than Vaughan himself.> The piety and modesty required by the Egg of Nature is consistent with the> moral obligations of the Tantrika. Even if actual sexual conduct is practiced> by the Tantric alchemist, it is not done within an atmosphere of> lasciviousness or abandon but within the strict confines of the ritual> practice. Vaughan himself was dripping in Christian piety as these and his> later works attest, even though we have every suspicion that he was involved> in the type of psycho-spiritual, psycho-biological procedures we have been> studying. This is perhaps a state of mind that twenty-first century moderns> would have a hard time understanding, let alone accomplishing, and it would> seem therefore that the secrets are still safe!> The Rosicrucian then goes on to describe the First Matter in terms with which> we are already too familiar: as ascending and descending, as father and> mother, life and death, most high and most low, etc. etc., the pairs of> opposites that define the valences of energy in the universe from the> alchemical—and Tantric, and Daoist, and Hermetic—perspective.> Now Vaughan, resuming his own voice, states:> She is not any known water whatsoever but a secret spermatic moisture, or> rather the Venus that yields that moisture. Therefore do not you imagine that> she is any crude, phlegmatic, thin water, for she is a fat, thick, heavy,> slimy humidity.46 [index_split_054.html#filepos774040]> One is tempted, of course, to leave it at that. How much more “on the nose”> can this analysis be than to include a reference to “the Venus that yields> that moisture”? Even Waite at this point is either confused or engaged in a> strenuous misdirection. As Vaughan goes on to describe this “water” as “Water> of Silver, which some have called Water of the Moon; but ‘tis Mercury of the> Sun, and partly of Saturn, for it is extracted from these three metals and> without them it can never be made,” Waite writes in a footnote, “He is> therefore giving a wrong name of the literal kind to the substances which he> has just described figuratively, using familiar terms of alchemy.”47> [index_split_054.html#filepos774250]> Thus, Waite finds himself forced to acknowledge that Vaughan is not writing> about chemical substances but is using alchemical terms to describe something> else. One feels almost sorry for Waite; after all, it was the work of Thomas> Vaughan that set Waite upon the path he was to follow for the rest of his> life, and now he finds himself in the unenviable position of either having to> explain him or run interference for him. One cannot choose from these two> alternatives easily, for Vaughan himself stumps the critics constantly by> switching from metaphor to metaphor, seamlessly and without a care for the> average Reader or the would-be magician or alchemist. Just as Waite tries to> explain Vaughan's work one way, Vaughan turns the tables and forces Waite to> retrace his steps, trapping him in contradictions ... all to no avail.> Instead, Vaughan then summons the great Spanish philosopher and Catholic> missionary Ramon Lull (also known as Raymond Lully, 1232–1315) who, in his> Theorica, wrote:> I swear to thee upon my soul that thou art damned if thou shouldst reveal> these things. For every good thing proceeds from God and to Him only is due.> Wherefore thou shalt reserve and keep that secret which God only should reveal> ... For if thou shouldst reveal that in a few words which God hath been> forming a long time, thou shouldst be condemned in the great day of judgment> as a traitor to the majesty of God ...48 [index_split_054.html#filepos774479]> This is Vaughan once again citing authorities as defense against the criticism> that he is not revealing enough of the Art he professes to understand so much.> No matter, for he continues in another vein and begins to reveal more of the> process as he describes the work of the Kabbalists.> Referencing the Anima Magica Abscondita—which we have examined in chapter> eight [index_split_041.html#filepos566272]—he writes that Nature has two> extremes and between them a middle “substance.” The first extreme was the> “remote matter and the invisible chaos ... this is the Jewish Ain Soph ... Out> of this darkness all things that are in this world came, as out of their> fountain or matrix.”49 [index_split_054.html#filepos774689]> For those not familiar with Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah generally, the Ain> Soph (or “limitless”) was the “chaos”—as Vaughan has it—out of which the ten> sephiroth of the Tree of Life were emanated. He thus equates the Orphic> concept of Chaos with the Kabbalistic idea of the Ain Soph. It is further> evidence that Vaughan understands his Art to be revealed in chemical alchemy> as well as in Kabbalah and the other esoteric sciences, for he finds> validation in all of these (although selectively chosen). Kabbalists may find> Vaughan's flights of fancy in this regard to be in error, but as we said above> this is not the point. Vaughan is not pretending to be an expert in any of> these specialized fields, but only using concepts and terminology from all of> them in order to communicate the reality he has experienced himself. This is a> kind of poetry, which makes use of simile, metaphor and analogy in order to> produce an emotional as well as an intellectual (or psychological) reaction in> the Reader. Alchemy is unapproachable otherwise, whereas chemistry needs no> such ornamentation.> He then makes a statement that is surprisingly prescient for his time and> place. It concerns “physic” or what we could call today medicine and> pharmacology, something with which Vaughan was very familiar and, indeed, he> made a living at it while still an alchemist. Speaking of Nature and of the> presence of “corruption” in Creation, he writes:> [Nature] did not separate the parts and purify each of them by itself; but the> purities and impurities of the sperm remained together in all her productions,> and this domestic enemy prevailing at last occasioned the death of the> compound. Hence they wisely gathered that to minister vegetables, animals or> minerals for physic was a mere madness, for even these also had their own> impurities and diseases, and required some medicine to cleanse them.50> [index_split_054.html#filepos774899]> It need hardly be pointed out that the idea that our medicines themselves are> contaminated—even by substances of which we may not be aware—is in current> fashion today, hence the involvement of national overseers such as the Food> and Drug Administration in the United states and other groups, some of them> private, that test natural and homeopathic remedies as well for purity. More> importantly, however, is the idea that these impurities are inherent in> Creation itself and are passed down through “the sperm” and result in the> “death of the compound.” The only recourse to be had was to return to the> point of origin—to Chaos itself—and derive the essential medicine from the> First Matter. “This was their physic,” writes Vaughan, “this was their> magic.”51 [index_split_054.html#filepos775109] By operating on Chaos one> circumvents the problems inherent in dealing with created compounds and> natural minerals; one operates directly on the First Matter, and this is not> only Vaughan's alchemy but is essentially Asian, as well. Through the use of> the First Matter the secondary elements—animals, vegetables, minerals—may be> purified and transmuted although not without the danger inherent in removing> alien substances, such as what might happen during or after surgery when a> tumor is removed: the danger of infection, of metastasis, or simply the> invasion of the body itself which can cause unintended reactions.> That death is an inevitability which is caused by an impurity or “corruption”> of the generating sperm is basic to many alchemical traditions. As we have> seen, the Elixir Vitae is a substance that is intended to remedy that> condition and now we have some further understanding of how it would operate.> As an artifact of the First Matter, of Chaos out of which everything has its> origin, it would serve to purify the organism (or mineral, etc) by breaking> down its component parts, removing the impurities, and building the organism> back again. We hear echoes of this idea in the concept of rebirth in the> spirit: i.e., “Unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God”> (John 3:3) and “Truly, truly I say to you, unless one is born of water and the> Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God” (John 3:5). This emphasis on> water and the Spirit is by now familiar to us all from Vaughan's work.> In Daoist alchemy we have seen the requirement for a second, spiritual birth> and the creation of an embryo that will act as the carrier of the alchemist's> soul and individuality. This can only be accomplished through the refining of> the inner elixir."},{"pageContent":"Our Sulfur and Our Mercury> In all of these cases under review so far, we see a consistent pattern of a> return to the moment of Creation—the Chaos, as Vaughan describes it in this> work—and the ensuing re-experiencing of that moment with a view towards> perfecting it, whether by creating a new “self” that is free of impurities and> corruption or by a re-birth composed of pure elements taken directly from the> Chaos.

If we> can do that, then we will understand (if we have not already) that our> alchemists were mystics, Tantrikas, and Daoists:> After putrefaction succeeds generation and that because of the inward,> incombustible Sulphur that heats or thickens the coldness and crudities of the> Quicksilver, which suffers so much thereby that at last it is united to the> Sulphur and made one body therewith.

Instead of the “Sulphur” and “Quicksilver” of de Meung, however,> Flamel writes of the “solar and lunar Mercury” which obviously refer to the> same substances as those in de Meung:> Take them therefore ... and cherish them over a fire in thy alembic.

Although he says he was not able to bring his knowledge to> “perfection” during his wife's lifetime, he implies that he did so after her> death but only due to the principles he discovered during her life.> One of these is central to Vaughan's work: the Oil of Alkali that we mentioned> in Chapter Two [index_split_011.html#filepos92462]. It is enigmatic because it> seems to refer to a natural substance, but in context it appears he is writing> of something else entirely. To quote Vaughan:> On the same Day my deare wife sickened, being a Friday, and at the same time> of the Day, namely in the Evening: my gracious god did put into my heart the> Secret of extracting the oyle of Halcali, which I had once accidentally found> att the Pinner of Wakefield, in the Dayes of my most deare Wife.

In the first place it could be assumed that the> stress of his wife's illness (which seems to have been sudden) is what jogged> Thomas's memory so that the “Secret” came flooding back to him. In the second> place, however, it would appear that he was busy in his laboratory during his> wife's illness and, indeed, right up to the moment she died. He states he> extracted the “oyle of Halicali” on the day she died.

Was the “oyle of Halicali” a medicine that would> have cured her of the unnamed illness?> That is the third question and one which may elude us. The reason for this is> the fact that alchemical terms are interchangeable: the First Matter, as we> have seen, can be called Water, Mercury, Earth, and any number of other names.> The same is true for the Oil of Alcali. Vaughan himself writes of it several> different ways; there is a formula for making it in the notebook, but one is> forced to wonder if that formula represents the same substance to which he is> referring above.> As we have seen, in Lumen de Lumine Vaughan refers to the Halicali as “the> catholic receptacle of spirits” and according to the magicians “a Sealed> House, full of light and divinity.” Waite in one of his informative if> perplexed footnotes comes to the conclusion:> It is obvious that this is not true of Sal alkali, but it is not to be thought> that in using this name the alchemists meant what ordinary chemistry signifies> thereby, and they were not concealing their real subject more completely than> Thomas Vaughan or his authorities under the denomination of Halicali.

Since we have no idea what illness she had, we may never know> the answer. It may be that his understanding of this substance was that it> was—as the magicians said—“full of light and divinity” and that he believed it> would have curative properties anyway.

This seems> unlikely to have been named after Rebecca Vaughan, so this does not seem to be> the reference we need.> However, there is another possibility and it may provide a clue as to the> relationship between Thomas and his wife, and this is to be found in Genesis,> chapters 24–27, the story of Rebecca, the wife of Isaac.> Vaughan alludes to this story in his notebook, in the context of a dream he> had about Rebecca that had similarities to the Biblical tale as we shall see.> The Biblical tale of Rebecca has her being spotted near a well by a servant of> Isaac. She came to give the servant water and to water his camels, which he> took to be a sign from God that she was the kind and generous type of woman he> was seeking. He gave her some jewelry and was invited to her family's tent> where the terms of marriage were discussed and agreed upon.

One of these concerns the miracles that were> said to take place when Rebecca moved into the tent of Sarah, Isaac's mother,> which were a reprise of three miracles that took place when Sarah was alive:> one involved a Sabbath candle that burned an entire week, from one Sabbath to> the other; the other involved a cloud that hovered over the tent, signifying> the presence of God; the third involved a multiplication of loaves of bread.> It is easy to see the candle as meaning something profound to Thomas Vaughan,> since the Candle of the Halicali is so prominent in Lumen de Lumine, as well> as in the illustration that accompanies it. The cloud over the tent would also> resonate with ideas concerning the First Matter: the dew that descends from> the clouds. The multiplication of the loaves—so similar to the New Testament> miracle of Jesus multiplying the loaves and the fishes (Matthew 14:13–21)—is> indicative of the alchemical concept of projection in which transmutation and> multiplication are effects.> In Genesis, Isaac and Rebecca prayed to God that she might bear children, and> eventually their prayers were answered. She gave birth to the twins Jacob and> Esau. It would be Jacob (slightly younger than Esau, just as Thomas was> slightly younger than his twin, Henry) who would become the patriarch of the> twelve tribes of Israel; it was also this same Jacob who had the vision of the> Ladder which Vaughan believed to be a core mystery of alchemy, as we have> seen. Thus, for a pious couple like Thomas and Rebecca Vaughan—moreover a> couple steeped in the analysis of symbols and in applying that analysis to> real life, including the laboratory work of alchemy—these references would> have been instructive and perhaps even prophetic.> Which brings us to an uncomfortable suspicion: did Thomas Vaughan poison his> wife?> Kenneth Rexroth, in the Foreword cited so many times already, implied that> whatever it was the Vaughans were doing, “it killed them.” Is it possible that> one of the many medicines and elixirs being sought and tested by the Vaughans> included one that was so toxic it killed Rebecca?

As thisstatement appears twice in the Notebook, and both times from Rebecca, we aredisappointed that we do not know more about this exceedingly influential woman.19 [index_split_059.html#filepos818441] Scott Carney, “Death on the Path toEnlightenment: Inside the Rise of India Syndrome,” in Details, October 1, 2012,http://www.details.com/culture-trends/critical-eye/201210/india-syndrome-death-enlightenment[http://www.details.com/culture-trends/critical-eye/201210/india-syndrome-death-enlightenment],last accessed June 2, 2015.20 [index_split_059.html#filepos819761] See for instance the case of SangeethaArjunan, a twenty-four-year-old woman who, it is claimed, died of a heart attackat the Nityananda Ashram in Tamil Nadu. “Ashram Death: Body to be Exhumed inTN,” Express News Service, January 7, 2015.21 [index_split_059.html#filepos820097] Dean Nelson, “Indian court asked to ruleon whether Hindu guru dead or meditating,” in The Telegraph, UK, May 28, 2014.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/10860998/Indian-court-asked-to-rule-on-whether-Hindu-guru-dead-or-meditating.html[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/10860998/Indian-court-asked-to-rule-on-whether-Hindu-guru-dead-or-meditating.html]last accessed June 2, 2015.22 [index_split_059.html#filepos823144] Alberto Perez-de-Albeniz and JeremyHolmes, “Meditation: Concepts, effects and uses in therapy,” in InternationalJournal of Psychotherapy, Mar 2000, Vol. 5, Issue 1, p. 49.23 [index_split_059.html#filepos823623] Timothy McCall, “The Scientific Basis ofYoga Therapy,” in Yoga Journal, Aug. 28. 2007.24 [index_split_059.html#filepos827285] Vaughan, Lumen de Lumine, Waite, p. 245.25 [index_split_059.html#filepos828191] Dickson, Aqua Vitae: Non Vitis, p. 239.26 [index_split_059.html#filepos828510] Ibid., p. 239.27 [index_split_059.html#filepos829692] Ibid., p. 234.28 [index_split_059.html#filepos830532] Vaughan, Lumen de Lumine, Waite, p. 250.29 [index_split_060.html#filepos832769] See the corresponding image in the Neijing Tu, of the spiral located at the same level in the body as the spool ofthread in the Angel's hand.30 [index_split_060.html#filepos833802] Vaughan, Lumen de Lumine, Waite, p. 268.31 [index_split_060.html#filepos834278] There are, however. no fewer thantwenty-six recipes requiring actual lunaria in the notebook.32 [index_split_060.html#filepos834478] Vaughan, Lumen de Lumine, Waite: fn 1.,p. 258.33 [index_split_060.html#filepos837141] For further clarification, see theexplanation given in chapter six [index_split_031.html#filepos375703] of the“inner child-like mercury” and the “subsequent dripping of white drops from thecrown” as analogues of the child, the dragon, and the white herb Lunaria growingat the top of the mountain.

Thus it becomes impossible to even begin to acknowledge all of those who> have helped or been influential in some way along this circuitous path.> Two places in particular deserve mention. I first began studying Mandarin> Chinese in the early 1970s during intensive classes at Educational Solutions,> in rooms located across the street from the New School in New York City, and> among friends at a Chinese shop on West Fourth Street called China Center.> The Samuel Weiser Bookstore—in its several Manhattan incarnations—was a> constant source of “Orientalia” as it then was known: books on Asian religion> and language that were otherwise scarce and hard to find. The Magickal Childe> bookstore on West 19th Street was another important source for esoterica; and,> of course, the venerable Forty-Second Street main branch of the New York> Public Library. The Zoltan S. Mason bookstore on the East Side was where I> sourced my first books on alchemy during the late 1960s and early 1970s.> Unfortunately none of those institutions survived into the twenty-first> century; however, there is Seven Stars Bookstore in Boston run by the> indefatigable Stuart Weinberg (an author and researcher himself), that has> inherited their astral mantle and continues to be the best source for> esoterica and related subjects in North America.> Many were the individuals who helped and influenced along the way and they are> way too numerous to mention. In no particular order, some of them are: Margot> Adler; Ellen P. Randolph; Tom Mellett and Robert Friend of the Arthur Young> Forum, who will recognize some elements of Young's Theory of Process in these> pages (or not!); the late Judith McNally; Annie Azzariti; friends such as Maya> Gabrieli, and Sophie and Adrian Anderson; and as always to Yvonne Paglia and> Donald Weiser, who continue to insist on publishing serious works on esoterica> and related subjects to the delight of readers and writers alike; and of> course to James Wasserman, who has edited and designed several of my previous> works and whom I have known lo! these many decades since the occult> renaissance in New York City in the 1970s.> Of course family is an important element in every writer's career and there> are many to acknowledge, of steadily increasing levels of importance over the> years, but it is doubtful whether they would welcome mention in a book so> concerned with—as Francis King once characterized it—“sexuality, magic and> perversion.”> (You know who you are!)"},{"pageContent":"A NOTE ON SOURCES> For many years the definitive collection of the works of Thomas Vaughan was> the one edited by Arthur Edward Waite, first published in 1919 and reprinted> in 1968 with the Foreword by Kenneth Rexroth. Vaughan's work is replete with> lengthy passages and citations in Latin; Waite provides in-line translations> of all of these with the original Latin appearing as footnotes to the English> versions. Waite also provided some excerpts of the Thomas Vaughan notebook,> Aqua Vitae: Non Vitis as an Appendix. He also “cleaned up” the> seventeenth-century English spellings used by Vaughan so that they would be> easier to read by a twentieth-century audience.> In 1984, Alan Rudrum published the collected Works of Thomas Vaughan which was> reprinted in 2010 by Oxford University Press. This volume presents Vaughan's> work in the original spellings and with the Latin passages preserved as in the> original, with translations provided in the End Notes section. Rudrum claims> that the Waite version is “highly inaccurate,” to which I respectfully take> exception. I have matched the Rudrum version to the Waite version in those> passages I have quoted and see no particular differences except where noted in> the text when the Rudrum edition helps to clarify some of the confusion> present in the Waite version.> I have used both versions in the preparation of this volume. In the first> section I have relied on Rudrum's edition in order to give the reader a feel> for the original English and the mixture of English and Latin that is typical> of Vaughan's work. In the second and third sections, however, I have relied> more on the Waite edition for the sake of clarity and ease of reading except> where there may be difficulties in interpretation.> Footnotes are used to specify the edition quoted, such as “Vaughan, Lumen de> Lumine, Waite, p. 305” which indicates the Waite edition of Vaughan's> collected Works. Where Waite is not specified, Rudrum's version is intended.> Where Vaughan's Notebook is mentioned or quoted, I have used Donald R.> Dickson's definitive edition.> For sources in Indian religion and alchemy, these are cited in the text. David> Gordon White's The Alchemical Body is still the best introduction we have to> Indian alchemy. For Chinese alchemy there are several important sources and> they are referenced in the text, but one of the most valuable is the work of> Fabrizio Pregadi, published by Golden Elixir Press. In terms of Western> alchemy, the various works published by Nicholas-Hays and Ibis Press—such as> Real Alchemy by Robert Allen Bartlett and Michael Maier's Atalanta Fugiens by> H. M. De Jong—are invaluable resources, as are the essay collections published> by Numen Books. For Western esotericism in general, the books being published> under the editorial aegis of Wouter Hanegraaf, Jeffrey J.
