Mulla Nasrudin called on the minister and told him a distressing story of poverty and misery in the neighborhood. ”This poor widow,” said the Mulla, ”with four starving children to feed, is sick in bed with no money for the doctor, and besides that she owes 100 rentf orthreemonthsandisabouttobeevicted.I ′ mouttryingtohelpraisetherentmoney.Iwonderedif youcanhelp ?” ”I certainly can,” said the minister. ”If you can give your time to this cause, so can I.

As usual, Mulla Nasrudin showed up for supper with dirty hands and a dirty face. ”Go wash up,” his wife screamed at him. ”Night after night I tell you. And night after night you always come to the table without washing. Why don’t you ever do it without my shouting at you?” ”WELL,” said the Mulla, ”IT’S ALWAYS WORTH A TRY. WHO KNOWS? YOU MIGHT FORGET ONCE.” 80. The burglar was not only carrying a mean-looking gun, he also appeared to be drunk. ”Get ready to die,” he said to Mulla Nasrudin. ”I am going to shoot you.” ”Why shoot me?” asked the Mulla. ”I have always said that I would shoot anyone who looked like me,” the burglar said. ”And do I look like you?” asked the Mulla. ”Yes, you do,” said the burglar. ”THAN GO AHEAD AND SHOOT,” said Nasrudin. ”ONE LESS LIKE YOU, THE BETTER.” 81. Mulla Nasrudin’s wife played bridge wisely and according to the rules. Mulla Nasrudin boasted of knowing no rules. However, one evening, he bid and made a grand slam, doubled and redoubled.

After cleaning up, the lady forgot to turn off the faucets in the bathroom. Half an hour later, Mulla Nasrudin, the guest in the room directly under them, opened his window, stuck out his head and called upstairs to attract their attention. ”Hey, you up there!” shouted the Mulla. The man upstairs opened his window and stuck out his head. ”What’s the matter?” he asked. ”Turn off those faucets in your bathroom!” demanded Nasrudin. ”It’s pouring down here. What’s the matter with you? You must be a dope.” He ended his tirade with a wild outburst of profanity. ”Wait a minute,” said the man upstairs. ”Stop your cursing. I have got a lady up here.” ”WHAT DO YOU THINK I HAVE GOT DOWN HERE,” yelled Nasrudin, ”A DUCK?” 83. Mulla Nasrudin stopped the doctor on the street one summer day. ”You remember when you cured my rheumatism ten years ago, Doctor,” asked the Mulla, ”and told me not to get wet?” ”Y-e-s, Yes, I remember,” said the doctor. ”WELL, I JUST WONDERED IF YOU THINK IT’S SAFE FOR ME TO TAKE A BATH YET,” said Nasrudin. 84. The clerk was waiting on a customer, Mulla Nasrudin, at the meat counter, when a woman pushed herself ahead of the Mulla and said, ”Give me a pound Or cat food, quick, I am in a hurry.” Then she turned to the Mulla and said, I hope you don’t mind my being waited on ahead of you.” ”NOT IF YOU ARE THAT HUNGRY,” said Nasrudin sweetly. 85.

Mulla Nasrudin had just bought a dog and was bragging about his good points to a friend. ”He is not what you would call a pedigree dog,” said the Mulla, ”but no prowler could come near the house without him letting us know about it.” ”What does he do?” asked the friend. ”Bark and arouse the neighbourhood?” ”NO,” said Nasrudin proudly,”HE CRAWLS UNDER THE BED.” 88. Mulla Nasrudin was weeping and complaining in a bar. ”I don’t have anything to worry about,” he said. ”My wife takes care of my money. My mother-in-law tends to my business. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WORK.” 89. A friend gave a bottle of cheap liquor to Mulla Nasrudin as a birthday present. Later he asked the Mulla how it was. ”It was just exactly right,” said the Mulla. ”What do you mean just right?” asked the friend. ”WELL,” said Nasrudin, ”IF IT HAD BEEN ANY BETTER YOU WOULDN’T HAVE GIVEN IT TO ME, IF IT HAD BEEN ANY WORSE, I COULDN’T HAVE DRUNK IT.” 90.

Finally, Mulla Nasrudin stood up wearily and said, ”WELL, I GUESS I WILL JUST GO HOME AND DIE NATURAL DEATH.” 92. Mulla Nasrudin’s wife was feeling a bit sorry for herself. ”You don’t seem as devoted to me as you used to,” she complained. ”Do you still love me?” Nasrudin looked up from his newspaper and shouted, ”YES, I STILL LOVE YOU. NOW SHUT YOUR BIG MOUTH AND LET ME READ MY PAPER.” 93. ”Look here,” she said to Mulla Nasrudin, ”Why do you always come to my house to beg?” ”Doctor’s orders, lady,” said the Mulla. ”What do you mean, doctor’s orders?” she asked. ”He told me,” said Nasrudin, ”THAT WHEN I FOUND FOOD THAT AGREED WITH ME, I SHOULD STICK TO IT.” 94. ”When I was broke,” Mulla Nasrudin told his neighbour, ”Harry volunteered to lend me 1000” ”Did you take it?” his neighbour asked. ”NO,” said Nasrudin. ”THAT KIND OF FRIENDSHIP IS TOO VALUABLE TO LOSE.” 95.

Do you think I should have kissed her goodnight, Mulla?” ”NO,” said Nasrudin. ”I THINK YOU DID ENOUGH FOR HER FOR ONE DAY.” 97. Mulla Nasrudin had listened to the encouragement of a friend who had touted a certain horse pretty highly. The next day, after the horse had come in last, the Mulla saw the tipster and screamed, ”Brother, have I got it in for you. That horse you told me to bet on came in last.” ”Last?” the fellow said. ”I can’t understand it. He should have been able to win that race in a walk.” ”THAT’S THE WAY HE TRIED IT,” said Nasrudin, ”BUT HE STILL CAME IN LAST.” 98. One day Mulla Nasrudin visited a large department store to buy his wife some nylon hose. Inadvertently, he got caught in a mad rush at a counter where a bargain sale was going on. He soon found himself being pushed and stepped on by frantic women. He stood it as long as he could. Then with head lowered and elbows out, he plowed through the crowd. ”You there!” said a woman. ”Can’t you act like a gentleman?” ”NOT ANY MORE,” said Nasrudin. ”I HAVE BEEN ACTING LIKE A GENTLEMAN FOR AN HOUR. FROM NOW ON, I AM ACTING LIKE A LADY.” 99.

Mulla Nasrudin came home about midnight and threw himself on the couch in the living room. He woke his wife up with his clumsiness and she stuck her head out of the bedroom door and said, ”Well, you finally came home.

The doctor was giving some bad news to Mulla Nasrudin about his wife. ”This is a serious case,” the doctor said. ”I hate to tell you, but your wife’s mind is gone, completely gone.” ”WELL, I AM NOT SURPRISED,” said Nasrudin. ”SHE HAS BEEN GIVING ME A LITTLE PIECE OF IT EVERYDAY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS.” 103. Invited to stop for a drink with his friends following the lodge meeting, Mulla Nasrudin said he had to hurry home. ”I can’t stop,” he said, ”I have got to go home and explain to my wife.” ”Explain what?” one of his friends asked. ”I DON’T KNOW,” said Nasrudin, ”I AM NOT HOME YET.” 104. Mulla Nasrudin fainted on the street and a crowd quickly gathered. ”Give him air!” shouted a man. ”Clear the way. Hurry up someone, get him a drink!” Nasrudin’s eyes fluttered open and he gasped, ”PLEASE, MAKE IT A DOUBLE MARTINI.” 105.

And, did you see the announcement of my death?” ”YES,” said Nasrudin. ”WHERE ARE YOU CALLING FROM?” 108. Mulla Nasrudin had been to the state legislature. After he had spent thirty days with his fellow legislators at the state capital, he came home for a weekend. In telling his wife about it, he said: ”I HAVE DISCOVERED ONE THING – IT’S THE FIRST INSANE ASYLUM I HAVE EVER SEEN THAT’S RUN BY THE INMATES.” 109. Mulla Nasrudin was milking a cow, when suddenly a bull tore across the meadow toward him. The Mulla didn’t move, but kept on milking. Several men, who were watching from the next field, were surprised when the bull stopped dead within a few yards of the Mulla. He then turned around and walked away. ”Were you not afraid, Mulla?” asked the men. ”OF COURSE NOT,” replied Nasrudin. ”THIS COW IS HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW.” 110. Mulla Nasrudin was watching the youngsters put on their horse show. He said to a bystander, ”It’s terrible the way they dress today. Just look at that young boy with the cigarette, sloppy haircut, and tight breeches.” ”That is not a boy,” said the other. ”It’s a girl and she’s my daughter.” ”Oh, excuse me, Sir,” said the Mulla. ”I meant no offence.

Mulla Nasrudin’s wife complained bitterly to the Mulla. ”I am absolutely ashamed of the way we live. Mother pays our rent. My aunt buys our clothes. My sister sends us money for food. I don’t like to complain, but I am ashamed that we cannot do better than that.” ”YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED,” said Nasrudin. ”YOU HAVE GOT TWO UNCLES THAT DON’T SEND US A DIME.” 113.

A guest at a concert turned to Mulla Nasrudin sitting next to him and criticised the voice of the woman who was singing. ”What a terrible voice,” he said. ”Do you know who she is?” ”Yes,” said the Mulla. ”She’s my wife.” ”Oh,” said the embarrassed guest, ”I beg your pardon. Of course, it is not her voice that is bad, it is that awful song she has to sing. I wonder who wrote it.” ”I DID,” said Nasrudin. 161. A drunk cowhand rushed into a bar waving and firing his guns at random and shouting, ”All you dirty, lousy skunks get outta here.” Within a minute everybody had scattered and disappeared except Mulla Nasrudin, who sat at the bar finishing his drink. ”Well,” barked the cowhand, waving his smoking gun. ”What about it?” ”My,” said the Mulla, ”THERE WERE CERTAINLY A LOT OF THEM, WEREN’T THEY?” 162. Mulla Nasrudin always said: ”Oh, well, it might have been worse.” One day an acquaintance stopped him and said, ”I dreamed last night that I died, went to hell, and was doomed to everlasting torment.” ”Oh, well,” said Nasrudin, ”it might have been worse.” ”What do you mean, Mulla!” cried the man. ”How could it have been worse?” ”IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRUE,” said Nasrudin.

Mulla Nasrudin had just returned a sheaf of poems to the budding young poet. ”Do you think it would help if I put more fire into my poetry, Sir?” the young man asked Nasrudin. ”NO,” said the Mulla. ”I WOULD RECOMMEND THE REVERSE.” 166. Mulla Nasrudin finally bought a parrot at an auction after some rather spirited bidding. ”I assume the bird talks,” he said to the auctioneer. ”TALKS?” the auctioneer said. ”WHO DO YOU THINK HAS BEEN BIDDING AGAINST YOU FOR THE PAST HALF HOUR?” 167. Mulla Nasrudin, carrying a chair, walked up to the owner of a secondhand store and asked how much it was worth. ”Three dollars,” said the secondhand dealer. The Mulla seemed surprised. ”Isn’t it worth more than that?” he said. ”Three dollars is the limit,” the owner said. ”See that? Where the leg is split?

After a consultation on the matter, they came into the room and told him the plain truth – that he might develop hydrophobia – that his chances were pretty bad. Instead of seeming to be upset at the news, Mulla Nasrudin asked for a pen and paper and began to write at great length. After an hour of steady writing, his nurse said to him, ”What are you writing, Mulla? Is it your will or a letter to your family?” ”NO,” said Nasrudin, ”IT’S A LIST OF PEOPLE I AM GOING TO BITE.” 176. Mulla Nasrudin and his young son were driving in the country one winter. It was snowing. Their bullock-cart broke down. They finally reached a farmhouse and were welcomed for the night. The house was cold, and the attic in which they were invited to spend the night was like an icebox. Stripping to his underwear, the Mulla jumped into a featherbed and pulled the blankets over his head. The young man was slightly embarrassed. ”Excuse me, Dad,” he said, ”don’t you think we ought to say our prayers before going to bed?” The Mulla stuck one eye out from under the covers. ”SON,” he said, ”I KEEP PRAYED UP AHEAD FOR SITUATIONS JUST LIKE THIS ONE.” 177.
