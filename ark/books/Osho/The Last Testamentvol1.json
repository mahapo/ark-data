A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, YOU ADOPTED A VOW OF SILENCE. RECENTLY, YOU HAVE DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT TO YOUR SUPPORTERS AN D THEN TO US HE RE TODAY. WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT NOW? ANSWER: I live spontaneously. I never decide anything beforehand. I keep tomorrow open. If I feel like speaking, I speak. If I feel like being silent, then there is no other way than to be silent . And I never ask myself why, because no why is answerable. All answer s are arbitrary. So I simply go on floating with the river, never asking where it is going, why it is going, where it is going to end. And this is my basic approa ch to life: a total letgo. Q: WAS THERE A REASON THAT YOU DECIDED TO ADOPT THE VOW OF SILENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE, OR WAS THERE ALSO NO REASON? A: There is never any reason. I don't live by reason. I simply allow things to happen. I don't know why I became silent . I don't know why I started to speak again, but I enjoyed being silent and I'm enjoying being out of silence again. I don't know about tomorrow. I may be silent, I may be speaking. I may not be here at all. Q: WHEN YOU WENT BEFORE THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE FOR A VISA AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER, THE COMME NT WAS MADE BY THE OFFICIALS OF THE SERVICE THAT HOW COULD YOU BE A RELIGIOUS LEADER IF YOU DIDN'T SPEAK? DID THAT HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON YOU AT ALL? A: No. Nothing influences me. Nor do I want anybody to be influenced by me, because the very fact of being influenced is a kind of mental slavery. I keep"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"myself totally free from influences, and I never influence anybody, never try to convert, convince anybody. I am the first one who can claim to be re ligious. The whole past and its religions have been pseudo, false. To me religion has a totally different meaning. There is no God. There is no heaven and hell. All those past religions have exploited man with fear of hell and greed for heaven, and all those religio ns have kept man retarded, dependent on God, a big daddy somewhere above who is taking care of you. This made man irresponsi ble. This made man unintelligent. My religion is basically centered around consciousness, silence, and silence has its own way of communication. Just as words speak, but can be misunderstood- they ARE misunderstood-silence also spea ks. It also can be misunderstood. To understand silence, the other side, the rece iving side, should also be silent. Then there is a meeting of the hearts. Someth ing starts falling into tune, harmony, a kind of synchronicity. Nothing is sa id, nothing is heard, but everything is understood. Lovers know it; just sitting side by side saying nothing, something goes on moving between them. Q: IF YOU WERE TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE LISTENING AND WATCHING WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT YOU OR YOUR RELIGION... WHAT IS YOUR THEOLOGY, WHAT IS YOUR BELIEF WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE? A: I have no system of belief I have no catechism like Christians, and I don't have any dogmas, principles, theology. If some body wants to understand me he will have to learn meditation, learn being sile nt and sit with me, live with me. There is no other way. All those belief sy stems are nothing but a process of conditioning you. A belief simply means you don't know -- still you believe. My effort here is that you never believe unless you know. When you know, there is no question of believing, you know it. I destroy all be lief systems and I do not give you any substitute. Hence, it is not easy to understand me. Q: YOU HAVE NO PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE? A: No philosophy of life. I have LIFE itself. There are people who have philosophies of life, but they don't have any life. Q: YOUR PHILOSOPHY, IF THERE IS ONE, HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN \"THE THREE L'S, \" LOVE, LIFE, LAUGHTER. IS THAT A PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE? A: No. Q: COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" A: It is just a consequence of being silent and in tune with existence. Love arises in you. Life becomes abundant; laughter, for no reason, just because this whole existence is so hilarious. This is not philosophy, this is the consequence of being silent. Q: IS IT TO ENJOY LIFE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT TOMORROW? A: There is no tomorrow. If there is tomorrow, you cannot stop worrying about it. Tomorrow never comes, it is a pr ocess of worrying. Nor is there any yesterday. One is no more, one is not yet. All that is in our hands is the present moment, now, here. And this is a miraculou s experience. If there is no yesterday, no tomorrow, and this very moment yo u are silent, all worrying disappears. All imagining, dreaming, projecting disappears. And it is not that you have to enjoy this moment. That rejoicing arises out of this moment. But you are never here, you are always somewhere else. You are never in the now, you are always then. Otherwise, everything is available, but you are absent. I want my people to understand a very simple fact -- not a philosophy, something existential, not philosophical -- be present to this moment and then see what happens. Q: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID A MOMENT AGO. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IN CONTROLLING PEOPLE, AND HAVE NO CONTROL. BUT DO YOU NOT HAVE EITHER CONTROL OR TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE OVER 350,000 OF YOUR FOLLOWERS? A: I don't have any control. I don't give these half million people who love me any discipline. I don't give them any commandments. I insistently emphasize that they are not my followers, but only fello w travelers. It is up to them to go a few miles with me or not to go. If th ey join with me, I'm happy; when they depart, I say goodbye. Q: IF THEY LOOK TO YOU, THEY WORSHIP YOU, WOULD THEY THEN NOT DO WHATEVER YOU TELL THEM? A: I am trying on my part that there should be no worship. They should not be influenced by me. But if they worship an d if they go on being influenced, they are not understanding me. Q: WHO IS BHAGWAN SHREE RA JNEESH? HOW DID YOU BECOME BHAGWAN? "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A: The word Bhagwan means \"the Blessed One.\" When people started feeling my blessing throbbing in their hearts, when they started feeling that something has happened to me of immense value which th ey would like to share, they started calling me Bhagwan. I could not deny it because it was a fact: I was the Blessed One. Q: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE THE BLESSED ONE? A: How do I know when I have a headache? I know Q: WHEN DID YOU KNOW IT? A: Thirty-two years ago. Q: HOW DID YOU KNOW IT? A: That question is absurd. When you are sick, you know. How do you know? When you are healthy, you know. How do you know? That \"how\" is absurd. You simply know it. Q: WAS THERE A VISION? A: No, there is no question of vision. Vi sion is always objective, of something else. It was an experiencing. Not even an experience, but experiencing. I was full of it. I was it. And since then not for a single moment have I been otherwise. It was not something that happened and disappeared. It was a transformation. It has remained with me. Q: DID YOU KNOW AS A CHILD, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT YOU WOULD BECOME THE ENLIGHTENED ONE? A: No. I never knew... not even a single moment before. But I was searching from my very childhood. I was seeking and tr ying in every possible way not to be influenced by any religion, by any ideo logy, because if I am already having a faith, already believing, the search stops. The inquirer has to be very alert and aware that no belief enters into his bein g. He has to remain open and agnostic, knowing perfectly well that he does not know. From that space of not knowing, the search, the seeking, arises. But who can say when it is going to be fulfilled? It is unpredictable. Q: DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A GOD? "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A: My God! There is no God, so how can I consider myself a god? God is the greatest lie invented by man. Q: WHY? A: Because man feels so helpless, so afraid of death, so burdened with life's problems. Because he has been raised by a father, by a mother, and those were the beautiful days -- no responsibility, no worry -- somebody was taking care of him. That psychological childhood is projected into all the religions: God becomes the father. And th ere are a few religions in which God becomes the mother. It is a simple psychological projection of a child. It has no basis in reality. And whenever you are afraid, whenever you are in trouble, you start seeking help. No help ever comes. Even Jesus on the cross was waiting for the help to come, and finally got disappointed and shou ted, \"Father, have you forsaken me?\" A great doubt must have arisen in him, a great question. Nothing is happening, and he was believing all these years that God would come to save him, his only begotten son. Nobody came. Jesus Christ must have died in utter disillusionment. I don't have any illusion. I cannot be disillusioned. Q: HE ALSO SAID, \"FATHER, FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.\" A: That was again the same mind. I call Jesus' mind sick. Q: WHY? A: Because his whole life... whatsoever he was teaching and doing was just nuts. Only a crackpot can claim to be the only son of God. And then, preaching to people that he is the savior, and whos oever is with him will be saved, and whosoever is not with him will fall into hell -- eternal hell... all these things. His behavior: he cursed a fig tree because he and his disciples were hungry and there were no fruits on the fig tree. In fact, it was not the season; it was not the fault of the fig tree, but he cursed the fig tree. I cannot conceive of this man as sane. And this prayer to God that, \"Forgive these people because they know not what they are doing,\" is again out of that same arrogant, egoistic idea. I don't think that it is out of compassion. It is the emphasis of the Christians for centuries that out of compassion he prayed even for his enemies. But let me repeat his sentence: \"Forgive these people because they know not what they are doing.\" In fa ct, it was not an act of compassion, he was still condemning the people th at they knew not and he knew. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Q: BUT HAVEN'T THERE BEEN SOME TEACHINGS HANDED DOWN FROM JESUS WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF MUCH THAT IS GOOD IN CIVILIZATION TODAY? A: Nothing. Not a single thing has come out of Jesus which has helped humanity in any way. All those teachings have prov ed not blessings, but curses. They are beautiful words and because they have been repeated so often, you have -- and everybody has -- forgotten the implications of them. He says, \"Blessed are the poor, for thei rs is the kingdom of God.\" It looks beautiful, but basically it is ugly. It is a consolation to the poor. It is an exploitation of the poor. It is giving fals e hope to the poor, and the ultimate result is that the world has remained poor. Who would not like to inherit the kingdom of God? Jesus says that even a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, bu t a rich man cannot enter through the gates of heaven. Now this man is responsible for all the poverty in the world. He is condemning richness. He is condemning the creativity which can make the world rich. I am all for richness in all dimensions, and I cannot say, Blessed are the poor. That is just what Karl Marx said: Opium of the people. It is possible to use beautiful words, but if you go into th e implications, what are the Christians doing today and what have they done for two thousand years? They will open orphanages. They are against birth control. They are against abortion. Q: SOME OF THEM. A: Those who are not will soon be expelle d. They are being expelled. And those who are... for example the pope himself is against abortion, against birth control. He is against the greatest revolution in humanity -- the pill. Population goes on growing, poverty goes on growing, and wh o is responsible for this? I think these people are criminals. Q: THE POPE? A: The pope. He should be behind bars. Q: WHY? A: Teaching such stupid things to huma nity: go on producing children -- they are gifts of God. He is responsible for Ethi opia. He is responsible for poor India. Anywhere poverty happens, these people are responsible. On the one hand, they go on increasing the population, which is already too much, in the name of God. But the real thing is that they can conver t only the poor to Christianity. I have"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"never seen a single rich man being converted to Christianity in India. Beggars, orphans, prostitutes-these people get converted. Q: IS THERE ANY PART OF CHRISTIANITY, HINDUISM, BUDDHISM, ANY OF THE ESTABLISHED RELIGIONS THAT YOU THINK ARE GOOD? A: Nothing is. I want to be finished with the whole past completely, I want it to be erased completely. I want a discontin uity with the past. Only then the new humanity is possible, a new world, a new man. So I categorically say everything is wrong. And the proof is there: the whole world is in a mess. These are the people who have given the world principl es how to live, ideologies, systems. This is the outcome of Buddhism, Hi nduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism. This is the outcome. Q: YOU SAY THE WHOLE WORLD IS A MESS. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE IN MAN, IN THE WORLD? A: I'm simply saying that there is a way to be sane. I'm saying that you can get rid of all this insanity created by the past in you. Q: HOW? A: Just by being a simple witness of your thought processes. That's my method of meditation. It is not a prayer because there is no God to pray to. It is simply sitting silently, witnessing the thoughts passing before you. Just witnessing -- not interfering, not even judging, because the moment you judge you have lost the pure witness. The moment you say this is good, this is bad, you have already jumped into the thought process. It takes a little time to create a gap between the witness and the mind. Once the gap is ther e, you are in for a great surprise: you are not the mind, you are the witness, a watcher. This process of watching is the very al chemy of real religion, because as you become more and more deeply root ed in witnessing, thoughts start disappearing. A moment comes when there is no thought at all. You are, but the mind is utterly empty. That is the mome nt of enlightenment. That is the moment when for the first time yo u become unconditioned, sane, a really free human being. Q: BHAGWAN, SINCE YOU CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, THERE HAVE BEEN A LO T OF THINGS WRITTEN -- ALLEGED -- ABOUT YOU AND THE RAJNEESHEES. SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE SPEAKING IN PUBLIC, I'D LIKE TO GET YOU TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT SOME OF THESE TH INGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID. FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"YOU AS A \"FREE SEX GURU,\" BELIEV ING IN PROMISCUOUS SEX WITH VIOLENT ENCOUNTER SESSIONS AND MIND CONTROL. TRUE OR FALSE? A: Do you think sex should be charged for? Should it not be free? Should it be paid for? To me, sex is a simple, beautiful, natural phenomenon. If two persons want to share the energy with each other, it is nobody's business to interfere. And to say \"free sex\" implies that you want sex also to be a commodity, that it has to be purchased -- either from a prostitute for one night or from a wife for the whole life, but it has to be purchased and paid for. Yes, I believe in free sex. I believe that sex is everybody's birthright to share, to enjoy. It is fun. There is nothing serious about it. The people who have been talking about me as teaching free sex are really pathetic. They are sexually repressed people. Q: I THINK WHAT THEY WERE IMPLYING IS THE IMAGE OF WILD SEXUAL ORGIES GOING ON. A: No orgies are going on. And if people should want an orgy, it is nobody's business. If a few people want group sex, what is harmful in it? If two persons can enjoy, why cannot ten persons enjoy together? Once we think of sex as a natural, joyful fun.... That's why I call the pill the greatest re volution since fire was discovered. The pill has freed sex from all nonsense, seriou sness, marriage, legalities. It has made man enjoy sex for the first time as man, not like other animals who are in a biological bondage. No orgies are happening here, but I am not prohibiting them. It is up to the people. If they feel like having an orgy, so far so good. But these people are also conditioned by your society. They also ha ve the idea of relationship one to one. They also have the monopoly, monogamy, planted in their minds. Q: IS THAT NOT GOOD? A: It is absolutely unnatu ral. Man is not a monogamous animal at all. He is polygamous and everybody knows it. You may have the most beautiful wife, but that does not mean you don't get attracted to other women, that once in a while you don't dream about other women. Somebody may have the best possible husband. That does not make any diffe rence. Man is by nature polygamous. Monogamy iS enforced on him. Q: ARE YOU SAYING THAT MAN SHOULD FOLLOW HIS POLYGAMOUS INSTINCTS? "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A: He should simply follow nature wherever it leads. Polygamy is perfectly good. In fact, there is no need for mo nogamy or polygamy. I'm a little further ahead. I see the relationship of love or sex as an absolutely free phenomenon. Q: YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING-AND I BELIEVE YOU'VE SUGGESTED BEFORE -- THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY \"WESTERN HANGUPS, \" SO CALLED, ABOUT SEX. RECENTLY YO U PREDICTED THAT AlDS WILL KILL TWO-THIRDS OF THE WORLD'S PO PULATION, AND YOU TOLD YOUR FOLLOWERS TO ENGAGE IN CELI BACY OR HAVE SEX WITH ONE PARTNER. WHY? A: AIDS is a totally new phenomen on, and the old religions are again responsible for it. Q: RESPONSIBLE FOR AIDS? A: For AIDS. Q: WHY? A: They are responsible for everything that is wrong. Homosexuality and all kinds of perversions were created by religious people, by teaching celibacy. Now, to force men or women to remain celibate is taking them against their biology, chemistry, physiology -- their whole nature. It is impossible for them. They will find some way, and it will be perverted. Nuns were kept in one monastery, monks were kept in another monastery. There are monasteries still where no woman has ever entered. Now these monks are the original homosexuals. These nuns are the pioneers of lesbianism. All kinds of perverted things have brought AIDS as the ultimate result. I'm not telling my people to be celibate because celibacy has any spirituality. I'm telling them that you can be celibate with out any repression, just out of sheer understanding. You are not going to be r ewarded in heaven for it, you will just be being careful about your health. That is enough reward. But if you feel that celibacy is difficult for you, then use all possible methods to protect, to prevent. AIDS is going to kill the larger part of humanity. Q: WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? A: Because it is spreading so fast. And it will spread... just one contact with a person who has AIDS is enough, and then those contacts will go on spreading. Just the other day I was looking into it because we were having the festival. Fifteen thousand people were going to come here from all over the world. Now it was a problem: many people can bring AIDS and destroy the whole commune."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"We tried to find out. Two sannyasins ha d it confirmed, and we asked them how many other contacts they had. One woman had fifty contacts. Those fifty people may be carrying AIDS and may be having other contacts. That's why I have said remain with one partner. It is nothing to do with monogamy, it is just pure hygiene, health. I am telling that on medi cal grounds, there is no religious basis to it. Q: BHAGWAN, LET ME MOVE ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT. AGAIN, IN KEEPING WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AND SAID ABOUT YOU AND THE RAJNEES HEES, AND THAT IS THE FEAR WHEN PEOPLE SEE YOUR BODYGUARDS CARRYING WEAPONS -- SUBMACHINE GUNS-AND RUMORS THAT THERE ARE LARGE CACHES OF WEAPONS HERE ON THE RANCH. IS THAT TRUE? AN D IF SO, WHY ARE THE WEAPONS KEPT HERE? A: I'm not a man like Jesus Christ. I will not carry my cross on my own shoulders. And I'm not suicidal. Jesus must have been suicidal. I love life, my people love life. I'm not afraid of death. I will enjoy death as mu ch as life, but my people don't want me to leave the body now, and they have every right to protect me. I'm not going to prevent an ybody who is going to assassinate me. Why should I prevent my people from protecting me? If the assassin is free, I'm not going to interfere. And the people who love me and want to protect me, I'm not interfering with them either. This is something between those who love me and those who hate me. This is their business, I am simply out of it. Yes, guns are there, but not according to the rumors. Those rumors are too much exaggerated. Q: LARGE NUMBERS OF GUNS? A: No, not large numbers. Q: DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ATTACKE D? ARE YOU AFRAID OF ATTACK? A: I am not afraid of anything. I have b een attacked many times before. I can be attacked any time and I'm not concerned about it, but my people are concerned. Who am I to prevent them if they love me and want to do something? And I have around me one of the most in telligent groups of people. Jesus had only twelve fools -- uneducated , unintelligent fishermen, carpenters -- and he himself was uneducat ed, uncultured. And when he was crucified they all escaped. They were not in love with Jesu s; they were hoping that through Jesus they would enter into p aradise and enjoy paradise. I give no hope to my peop le, no promise to my people. They are not going to gain anything as reward."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Q: SO WHY SHOULD THEY STAY HERE? A: They stay here because meditation is its own reward. There is no other reward beyond it. Q: IN FACT, RECENTLY YOU SEEM TO BE PAINTING A VERY PESSIMISTIC FUTURE OF THE WORLD AND MANKI ND WHEN YOU WARNED THAT A CYCLONE OF DESTRUCTION BOTH NATURAL AND MAN MADE WILL HIT THE WORLD, AND THAT THE RAJNEESH RELIGION WILL PROVIDE A \"NOAH'S ARK OF CONSCIOUSNESS,\" ALLOWING YOUR SUPPORTERS TO SURVIVE. A: It is not pessimistic. It is simply factual. Q: COULD YOU EXPLAIN TH AT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? A: It simply means that all the centuries that have passed have been bringing this day closer and closer. Religions have b een talking about peace and fighting and killing and murdering, burning people aliv e. On the one hand they will say God is love, on the other hand they will be burning living people. Christians have been killing, Mohammedans have been killin g, Hindus have been killing. It is a strange phenomenon that Bu ddha was born in India, but in India there are no Buddhists. For twenty-five centuries there have been no Buddhists. They had to escape because Hindus were killing them. Q: BUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS CYCLE OF DESTRUCTION? A: We have destroyed the harmony of nature through our unguarded scientific experiments. We have now in the ha nds of politicians; who are the most mediocre people in the world, such i mmense energy to dest roy that they can destroy this whole earth seven hundred ti mes. Now if just one politician goes nuts, that's enough -- and they are all nu ts. So I am not painting any pessimistic picture of the future. I am not a pessimist, neither am I an optimist. I am simply a realist. Q: BHAGWAN, A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE NOT PESSIMISTIC; YET, IF I MAY READ ANOTHER QUOTE WHEREIN YOU SAID \"THIS WORLD IS NOT WORTH SAVING. ONCE IN A WHILE I THINK IT WILL BE BETTER IF THE THIRD WORL D WAR HAPPENS AND DESTROYS THIS WHOLE STUPID HUMANITY.\" ISN'T THAT PESSIMISTIC? VERY GLOOMY?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" A: This is optimistic! Q: WHY? A: Because if something has become so rotte n, it is better to be finished with it. Q: YOU THINK THE WORLD SHOULD BE DESTROYED? A: The world has become almost a madhouse. If we cannot change people's consciousness, if we cannot destroy th e boundaries between nations, the boundaries between colors, and the boundari es between religions -- if that is not going to happen.... I am trying on my own whatsoever I can; but one cannot simply forget the reality. The world is divided into nations, into religions, all fighting and trying to kill each other. One cannot forget America and Soviet Russia, ready to destroy the whole world any moment. This is simple realism. As I see it, this humanity, if it is not going to change, is not worth saving. Q: BUT YOU, AS A RELIGIOUS LEA DER, SHOULDN'T YOUR ROLE BE ONE TO ENLIGHTEN AND TO HELP TO CHANGE...? A: That I am doing.... Q: RATHER THAN TO SAY THE WORLD SHOULD BE DESTROYED? A: That is part of my effort. That ma kes my thing emphatically clear: Either change, or the world is going to be dest royed. So your change is absolutely necessary. It is not something that can wait, that tomorrow we will change. Q: LET ME GO BACK... I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HERE TO OREGON, YOUR SUPPORTERS SAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T TAKE OVER THE TO WN OF ANTELOPE. YET NOW RAJNEESHEES ARE IN CONTROL OF THE TOWN AND THE RESIDENTS THERE HAVE CHARGED THAT THEY WE RE FORCED OUT. THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT PERHAPS TH E RAJNEESHEES REALLY WANT TO TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE STATE OF OREGON. TRUE, OR FALSE? A: I want first to make it clear that I am not a Rajneeshee. You should ask Rajneeshees -- that is their problem. I am an outsider. I am ju st a guest here, not even a resident. I am not even living in the City of Rajneeshpuram, but outside the city in a guest house. I am not a Rajneeshee; I don't belong to any organization. Now, whatsoever they are doing, you should ask them."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Q: WELL, WOULD YOU WANT TO S EE THEM TAKE OVER THE STATE OF OREGON? A: I would like them to take the whole world! -- because I feel that they can manage this world better than anybody el se. But I am not interested. I am not a politician, and that is not my concern. Q: THERE IS A PERCEPTION TH AT YOU AND YOUR RELIGIOUS FOLLOWING ARE EXTREMELY WEALTHY. IF IT'S TRUE, WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM? A: My people are rich. In fact, only the very rich, educated, intelligent, cultured can understand what I am saying. Beggars cannot come to me. Poor people cannot come to me. The gap is too big. They can hear me but they cannot understand me. So it is natural: I am the rich man's guru. Q: ISN'T THAT A CONTRADICT ION WITH THE TRADITIONAL PERCEPTION OF A LIFE OF AUSTERITY LED BY RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND ASCETICS? A: I simply think those traditions ju st rubbish. There is no question of contradiction; I am simply against them. I don't want to be consistent with them. I want to drop all connections with th e past. They have done enough harm. My conception of a beautiful, flowering bein g is not that of austerity, it is of luxury. He will enjoy all that is beautiful in the world -- great paintings, great music, poetry. I don't conceive of him standing on his head in the hot sun of Oregon, fasting, slowly destroying himsel f. To me, all religions of the world up to now have been sado-masochistic. My religion is for the first time life- affirming. Q: ONE THING I THINK PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE REMEMBER ABOUT YOU WHEN THEY READ STORIES OR SEE YOU ON TELEVISION IS THE FACT THAT YOU OWN SO MANY, OR HAVE SO MANY ROLLS ROYCES. WHY IS THAT? A: How many? Q: EIGHTY? A: No. Q: FORTY?"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" A: Ninety. And they are not so many. Q: WHY DO YOU NEED NINETY? A: I don't need even a single one. And they don't belong to me, either. But my people want 365, one for every day. And I go for a drive only for one hour. But if my people want it, if they are happy and rejoice doing it, I don't want to destroy their joy. It is perfectly okay. Q: COULDN'T YOU TELL THEM TO GI VE THEIR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE, OTHER THAN FOR ROLLS ROYCES? A: All other religions are doing that. Let them do that as their work. Let me do my work. All other religions are looking af ter the poor. At least leave me alone to look after the rich. Q: BHAGWAN, THERE HAVE BEEN FEARS EXPRESSED, AS YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE YOU FIRST GOT TO OREGON, THAT RAJNEESHPURAM MIGHT TURN INTO ANOTHER JONESTOWN. A: That's absurd. Q: ARE THERE ANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YOU AND JIM JONES? A: There is only one thing between me an d Reverend Jim Jones, and that is of absolute opposition. He was a Christian, and Christians are cowards, afraid to take the responsibility for whatsoever happened in Jonestown. From Jesus till this Pope the Polack, all are responsibl e for it, because Christianity is a death- oriented religion. The cross is its symbol. There is nothing common between me and Reverend Jim Jones. Everything is opposite to him. Q: PEOPLE THINK THE POWER YO U HAVE OVER YOUR FOLLOWERS.... A: I don't have any power. I don't have any position. I don't even know my people by their names. Q: BUT YOU SEE THEM OUT THERE EVERY DAY AS YOU DRIVE BY. A: I see them, but I don't even know th eir names. I don't relate with them personally, I don't talk with them personally. What power? I don't have any power."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Q: YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE DEVOTED TO YOU. A: That is their thing. I am not exploiting their devotion for any power for myself. I could have declared myself th e only begotten son of God. Then it would have been a power trip. But I say I am simply an ordinary man just like you. And I emphasize it again and again so that my people can understand that if this experience can happen to me, it can happen to them, too. It is nothing special. It is absolutely natural and ordinary. Q: SO YOU SEE NO SIMILARITY BETWEEN RAJNEESHPURAM AND JONESTOWN? A: Not at all. But I see every similarity between Jonestown and the whole world. Q: THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL END UP LIKE THAT? A: They are trying. Seventy-five percent of their national incomes is going into making more and more weapons, nuclear weapons. Even poor countries are trying to create nuclear plants. They are all in tune with Reverend Jim Jones. Except Rajneeshpuram, the whole world ha s a similarity with him. This is the only place.... We are absolutely opposed to destruction. We believe in creativity. We don't believe in the creator, we believe in creativeness. And my people are creative. They have ch anged the shape of this desert, with all the hindrances from the state, the government, the politicians, the religious people. Still, they have changed it into a small, beautiful oasis. If no barrier is created, we can make it one of the most beautiful places in the world. Q: A NUMBER OF OREGONIANS HAVE EXPRESSED A CONCERN, HOWEVER, THAT YOU WILL EVENTUA LLY ATTRACT UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THIS CITY AND THAT IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU CALL ALL 350,000 OF YOUR SUPPORTERS TO COME HERE TO LIVE. A: I may. Q: YOU MAY? A: Yes. Q: WHEN? "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"A: Anytime. Tell the Oregonians that their fear is perfectly right. Tremble. Have nightmares. I can call my followers anytime. Q: AND YOU MAY DO IT. A: But I may not. Q: SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT THIS LAND SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT THAT MANY PEOPLE, THAT IT WOULD HURT THE LAND IF THAT MANY PEOPLE LIVED HERE. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THAT? A: The people who say these things, have they ever come here? Just four years ago there was no water. We managed tw o big lakes, small ponds all around, enough water. And we can create more lakes, more water. We can make more land ready to be cultivated. It is only a question of effort, devotion, and the joy of creation. Those people are simply jealous, lazy, lousy, and nothing else. And it is our problem, not their problem. If my people die because the water is not enough, the land cannot support them, then it is my problem, not their problem. I will not come to them for help. Q: WHY DO YOU FEEL YOU ENGENDER SUCH HOSTILITY ON THE PART OF YOUR NEIGHBORS AND OTHER OREGONIANS? A: There are no neighbors. We are alon e here, and we want to be alone here. Q: PEOPLE IN NEARBY TOWNS.... A: We don't want even to relate. Q: WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS THIS HOSTILITY? A: It is not hostility. It is simply that we want to be left alone. Q: NO, ON THE PART OF SOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OREGON, SOME OREGONIANS. A: Now, that is their problem, and you have to ask them. We don't have any hostility towards them. All that we want is to be left alone to do our thing. They are hostile because this land was there, available, for fifty years, and they could not make anything out of it. And within four years we have made a beautiful place where five thousand people are joyously living, luxuriously and comfortably living. They are simply je alous and hostile because they know we"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"can manage one hundred thousand people here. And to them, number is power. To us, there is no question of any trip for power. Q: ISN'T IT REALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE DIFFERENT THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU? THAT PEOPLE DRESS ALIKE, WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED, WEAR BEADS? A: There are so many reasons besides. There was a time when the Christians were treated by the Jews the same way. Jus t to be a Christian was enough to be a criminal. Q: WHY DO YOUR PEOPLE WEAR VA RIOUS SHADES OF RED? WHY DO THE PEOPLE here WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED AND BEADS? A: I want them to be recognized by me, and by other people. I want them to face the world... that they have dropped out of it. I want them to be clearly individual. They don't belong to this rotten world around. The day I see that there is no need, they will be using all colored clothes. It is nothing spiritual, nothing religious; it is simply an iden tification card put all over the body. Q: THERE HAVE BEEN THOSE WHO HAVE ACCUSED YOU AND THE PEOPLE LIVING HERE OF OBSCURING THE LINE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. IS THIS A RELIGIOUS CITY, OR IS IT A CITY, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SHOULD QUALIFY FOR SCHOOL AID? WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE? A: This is not a religious city. The city has its own functions, religion has nothing to do with it. Religion is an individual phenomenon. It has nothing to do with the streets, the houses, the maintenance of the city. Religion is purely individual. The city is taking care of the collectivi ty of the community. They are two separate dimensions. They don't overlap, they don't meet anywhere. Q: BUT EVERYBODY LIVING HERE BELIEVES AND FOLLOWS YOU. A: Nobody follows me because I don't have any followers. If somebody is walking behind me, that does not mean he is a follower. If somebody feels that what I am saying is true and experiences it as true, what does the city have to do with it? The truth of the individuals living in this city is their private experience. The city is for other purposes, mundane. It has nothing to do with religion. What I am saying is true only about Ra jneeshpuram, that there is no mixing of state and religion. About the outside world that is not true. Everywhere else state and religion are mixed. Otherwise, why shou ld the Bible be there in the court for"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"somebody to take an oath? What does it mean? Every Bible sh ould be thrown out of every court. It is mixing religion.... And do you think the people who are presidents, premiers, governors, are not prejudiced in favor of some religion? Are they capable of discriminating, so that when they are in the office they are no longer Christians? It has not been our experience here. Q: LET ME GO BACK, IF I CAN, A NUMBER OF YEARS, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME THINGS WRITTE N ABOUT IT. WHY DID YOU LEAVE INDIA? A: For health reasons. I never wanted to leave. India may be poor, may have its troubles and problems, but it has a beauty of its own. Q: THERE WERE STORIES AT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE FORCED OUT. IS THAT TRUE? A: That is nonsense. I can go back ther e. Nobody can force me out of anywhere. If Oregonians cannot force me out of Or egon, do you think Indians can force me out of India? Q: DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE OREGON? A: No, I never plan anything. But I can leave any day. Or I may not leave ever. Q: DO YOU THINK THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE IS HOPING YOU WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY? A: They are waiting, perhaps. They can wa it... and if I don't want to leave, I will not leave. I will go on fighting to the end. I will not leave. If I want to leave -- even if the whole of America begs me to stay here -- I'm not going to stay a single moment. Nobody forced me out of In dia. In India I was living with my commune, ten thousand sannyasins were livin g with me. It was my health that was getting worse and worse. Q: ARE YOU RECOVERED NOW? ARE YOU BETTER? A: Not completely. I am feeling better, but it is just on the boundary line; at any moment a small thing, and the trouble can arise. Q: WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU AND FOR RAJNEESHEES? A: I never think of the future. We are happy now."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Q: BHAGWAN, I MUST TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT FEELING WELL TONIGHT BECAUSE I'VE STOPPED SMOKING. A: I knew. You must be feeling nervous. One hour more, and you will be in a nervous breakdown. Smoking is a di fficult thing for people to stop. Q: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT, JUST BRIEFLY, OF YOUR DAILY ROUTINE, WHAT YOU DO HERE? A: I am a very lazy man. I call myself the lazy man's guide to enlightenment. I don't do anything. In the morning I have started talking again, as I have been doing for thirty years. I love it. It is not a lecture, a prepared speech, or anything. People ask questions, and whatsoever spontaneous response happens in me, I tell it to them. And because I am not co ncerned at all about any consistency, I have made it clear to my people never to say \"Yesterday you said this, and today you are saying this, and these seem to be contradictory.\" I always insist whatever I am saying right now is the truth. Q: YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBED AS A PERSON OF CONTRADICTIONS. ARE YOU? A: I am. Because life is full of contrad ictions and I am in tune with life. I am not in tune with Aristotle. Aristotle, I think, is a disease. I call him Aristotle- itis. Life is very different. It is not a logical system. Now modern physics has come across facts which have baffled a ll the scientists because they contradict Aristotle's logic and Euclid's geometry . They have no obligation to perform according to the logic man has created. They just go on their way doing their thing in their own way. I am not a logician, and I have never claimed that I am not a man of contradictions. I am big en ough, as Walt Whitman once said: \"I am big enough to have all the contradictions in me.\" And yet, there is a possibility that all those contradictions may become a deep harmony. They may not remain contradictions, they may become complementaries to each other. That's how it is in existence; that's how it should be in life. Now, give him his cigarettes!

ALSO, THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ASKED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE, BUT STILL I APOLOGIZE FOR SOME QUESTIONS THAT PROBABLY YOU HAVE ANSWERED SO MANY TIMES. ANSWER: No problem. You just ask what soever you want, and in whatever way you want. And a question may have been asked thousands of times, but I have not given the same answer again and again and again. My answer has been a thousand times different. So you need no t be worried; this is my business. You just ask.

Q: WELL, IT ALSO HAS AN ALLUSION TOWARDS THE FOUNDER OF A RELIGION. ARE YOU ABOUT TO FOUND A NEW RELIGION NOW? A: I am the founder of the only religion. All those founders were all hocus pocus. Q: WHY IS YOURS TRUE? A: Because I find them all... Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavira -- you name the person and I will show you why he is not the founder of a religion but is simply exploiting people's gullibility. Q: WOULD YOU EXPLORE THAT ON JESUS? A: Jesus, in the first place, knew nothin g of religion. He never meditated in his life. Whatever he was doing was praye r, and prayer means you have already accepted the existence of God, to whom yo u are praying. Your prayer is based on a belief, and all beliefs are ignorant.

If you have experienced a headache, then you know it; but if the whole world goes on talking about headaches and you have not experien ced it, just for etiquette's sake you may believe in it. But that belief is ungrounded. Q: AND THEY ALSO TAKE AN ASPIRIN. A: If you believe too much, perhaps you may take an aspirin. Then things become worse than before.

Just I am here; be direct. Q:... SHE SAID, \"ASK THIS QUESTI ON TO BHAGWAN, \"WHICH I HAVE NOW DONE. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS SENTENCE TO US? A: You ask directly, don't bring anyb ody in. Don't make it unnecessarily complex, ask directly. Why are you afraid of asking the question directly?... Afraid of people in Germany? Q: NOT REALLY.... A: No? Then just ask directly. Q: THIS WAS ONLY A POLITE REFERENCE TO MA SHEELA. A: Don't be polite to me, because I will not be polite to you. Q: I WAS ONLY BEING POLITE TO MA SHEELA.... A: Ma Sheela is no more concerned here. Q: OKAY. THE QUESTION IS: \"HITLER WAS AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF MAGICAL POWERS. THIS IS WHY HE WAS VICTORIOUS ONLY UP TO A CERTAIN POINT.\" WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, AND WHO ARE THESE MAGICAL POWERS? A: Adolf Hitler was very much concerned about astrology. He was not listening to his generals, where to attack, when to attack. Rather he was listening to his astrologer, what is the right time, and wh at is the right place. And the generals were puzzled because astrologers have no thing to do with military science. But for five years continuously he went on winning simply because leaders of the opposite nations -- Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin -- were following the rules of military science, and he was just going a ccording to something which is not part of military science. They could not concei ve where he was going to attack. They could not conceive where they should ga ther their forces. Finally, Churchill had to import astrologers from India to England. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Q: APART FROM MILITARY ASPECTS, HOW WOULD YOU JUDGE HIM MORALLY AND POLITICALLY? A: Morally, he was as moral as Mahatma Gandhi. Q: AS MAHATMA GANDHI? A: Yes, because I consider both absolute ly immoral. In fact, he was more a Hindu than Mahatma Gandhi himself Q: IN WHAT RESPECT? A: In his life. In his way of living.... Q: BECAUSE HE WAS A VEGETARIAN...? A: He was a vegetarian.. Q: BUT HE WAS NOT NONVIOLENT, AS MAHATMA GANDHI WAS. A: Mahatma Gandhi was also not nonviolent. Just wait a bit; let me finish with Adolf Hitler. He was a vegetarian. He wa s an early riser in the morning, going early back to sleep. He remained a bach elor almost his whole life -- only three hours before he died, he married. He wa s not a drunkard, he was not a smoker. He was a puritan in every possible way, and he lived a life of discipline, just as a saint lives in a monastery. You ask me if Gandhi was nonviolent. That was a political strategy -- but he was not nonviolent. He had declared that af ter India became independent, armies would be dissolved. But when India be came independent and he was asked about armies being dissolved, he remained silent. He was really a cunning man. His secretary said that it was his day of silence. Q: MAY I DRAW BACK YOUR ATTENTI ON TO ADOLF HITLER: IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN COMMON WITH HITLER? THERE WAS A JOKE RELATED BY MA ANAND SHEELA -- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S TRUE. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TOLD THE JOKE OF A TIGER WHO STUC K HIS NOSE INTO THE ASS OF ANOTHER TIGER AND WHEN HE WA S ASKED WHY HE DID THAT, HE SAID, \"WELL I JUST ATE A JEW AND I WANT TO GET RID OF THAT BAD TASTE. \" IS THAT TRUE? IS THAT PROPERLY RELATED, THAT JOKE? A: It will be good if you don't bring Sh eela or anybody in between me and you. Be direct."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" Q: DID YOU TELL THIS JOKE? IS THAT YOUR JOKE? A: I cannot remember. For thirty-three years I have been speaking constantly, two hours in the morning, two hours in th e evening. Perhaps there is no single individual alive who has spoken as much as I have spoken. So, ask the question! Q: DO YOU LIKE JEWS OR DON'T YOU LIKE JEWS? A: I love them -- what is the question of liking? I have among my sannyasins more Jews than anybody else. Almost fo rty percent of my sannyasins are Jews. Q: FROM ISRAEL, OR AMERICAN JEWS? A: From America, from Israel, from Europe, from Germany. Q: THAT MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY NATIONAL, ANY RACIAL PREJUDICES? A: I don't believe in the very concept of nations, or religions. I don't draw any lines between one human being and anothe r. And if I have told any joke which you think is anti-Jewish, then I have also told jokes which are anti-Hindu, anti- Mohammedan, anti-Christian. In fact, I ha ve been telling jokes which are against me! Jokes are just jokes. They are not a philosophical standpoint. Q: YOU SAID YOUR RELIGION IS TH E FIRST AND LAST RELIGION. SO, AFTER YOU THERE WILL BE NO MORE NEED FOR ANY RELIGION ANYWHERE? A: Yes. Q: DOES THAT APPLY TO AFTER YOUR DEATH? A: I say it is the first and last religion fo r the simple reason that I don't consider old religions authentic religions. They wer e pseudo. They pretend to be religions, but they were not religions. Q: BECAUSE THEY WERE RELIGIONS FOR THE POOR? A: No. Because they were religions of supe rstition. Not a single religion has been able to prove God's existence. Not a sing le religion has been able to give any proof for heaven and hell. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Q: THAT DOESN'T MEAN GOD DOESN' T EXIST, IF YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT HE EXISTS. A: It does not mean that; it simply means you cannot go on worshipping something for which no evidence exists in the whole history of man. Q: SO, MAYBE FOR AN OUTSIDER IT IS SOMEHOW CORRE CT TO PUT THE CORE OF YOUR RELIGION INTO THE SENTENCE: FIND YOUR OWN EGO, FIND YOUR OWN SELF. A: NO. Not your own ego, but your own being. And there is a great difference between the two. Not only different, but they are absolutely contrary to each other. The ego is the false idea in you cr eated by the society... you are a Jew, you are a Mohammedan, you are a Nazi, you are a communist; you belong to this family, this is your holy book, this is your name. You have to remain attached to your tradition, convention. All these things contribute to your ego. Out of all these your ego is created... as just a combination. Your being is not given to you by the society, church, education, family -- nobody. Your bein g you bring with yourself when you are born. It is existential. Q: IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE SAID -- AND PROBABLY HAVE DONE -- IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE SAID, \"I HAVE TO DESTROY ALL YOUR EGOS\"? -- MEANING THE EGOS OF YOUR FOLLOWERS.\" A: Yes. Q: SO, THE TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE SITTING RIGHT BEHIND MY NECK HAVE NO EGO ANYMORE? A: You can just look and see. Q: WELL, THEY DON'T REALLY LO OK LIKE IT, BUT YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON IT, AREN'T YOU? I MEAN, IF THIS IS YOUR AIM, YOUR TARGET... WHEN DO YOU, THE TE ACHER, NOTICE THAT SOMEBODY'S EGO HAS BEEN CRUSHED, DISAPPEARED, VANISHED, OR WHATEVER HAPPENS? A: Yes. I immediately recognize it. Q: YOU SENSE IT? A: Yes."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Q: DOES YOUR PUPIL SENSE IT? (To the audience): WHEN DID YOU ALL REALIZE YOUR EGOS HAD BEEN DESTROYED? A: My disciples are at several stages of development. Somebody's ego has completely disappeared, somebody's ego is just on the boundary to disappear, somebody's ego is still trying to survive, somebody is trying not to let it go. So they are at all stages. But I try to explai n to them where they are, and where they have to move from there. Q: WOULD YOU AGREE TO CALL THIS METHOD OF TREATING PEOPLE TOTALITARIAN? A: No, because I am not giving them any orders to follow me. I am simply sharing my experience. I have not called them here, they have come on their own. It is their decision to be with me; it is not my decision that they should be with me. Q: SO, HOW DO YOU MAKE THEM, MA KE PEOPLE GIVE UP THE FAMILY, THEIR PROPERTY, THEIR HOME...? A: I don't. Q: BUT YOU MUST HAVE AN IDEA WHY THEY ARE COMING HERE. I MEAN, THEY GIVE UP EVERYTHING THEY HAD BEFORE JUST TO BE CLOSE TO YOU. THEY GIVE UP EVEN THEIR OWN PERSONALITY, AND WHAT ARE THEY GETTING FOR IT? A: Whatsoever they feel around me, they are on their own accord ready to leave everything behind. But I have never told a single person to leave his family or leave his job. I am not in favor of renunc iation. All the old religions were in favor of renunciation. They were telling people to leave the family, to remain celibate. They were telling people to move to the monastery. They were taking people out of the society. I have never told anyb ody to do anything on my order. But if, being with me, they start feeling that some thing is stupid that they are carrying and they drop it, that is their business. Q: THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE COMING FROM WESTERN CIVILIZATIONS -- FROM THE UNITED STATES, FROM WESTERN EUROPE -- BUT HARDLY ANYONE IS COMING FROM YOUR OWN HOME COUNTRY, HARDLY ANY INDIANS.

IS THERE ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT? A: I have no idea, because I have never paid any tax. I have no income, either. Q: YOU HAVE NO INCOME? A: No income. Q: WHAT ARE YOU LIVING ON THEN? A: Just my friends -- I am their guest. I have been a guest for thirty-five years continuously -- in fact my whole life. In the beginning I was a guest in my family, and after that I have been a guest in other families. Q: JUST ONE MORE QUESTION C ONCERNING THE MOTIVATION OF PEOPLE COMING TO JOIN YOU, TO JOIN RANKS WITH YOU. I HAVE THE FEELING THAT PRINCIPALLY FRUS TRATED WESTERN YOUTH ARE COMING WHO SEEM TO BE THE MORE OBEDIENT KIND OF CUSTOMERS, WHO DON'T ASK TOO MANY QUESTI ONS. AREN'T THE INDIANS, FOR INSTANCE, MORE PRACTICALLY MINDED? A: Do you think you are an Indian? Q: NO, NO. A: Do you see anybody here more frustrated than you? Q: NO, NO. A: You go to the commune and see if you can find a single frustrated person. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Q: NOT HERE, BUT THEY SEEM TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH WESTERN CIVILIZATION.... A: They are dissatisfied because they are intelligent people. Only buffalos don't get frustrated. Q: YOU FIND A NUMBER OF INTELLI GENT PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN HOME COUNTRY, TOO. WHY DON'T YOU ATTRACT ANY OF THEM? A: I'm telling you, India is a dead country. And everything which is born has to die one day. Even civilizatio ns are born and they have to die. But it is very difficult for people to drop the corpses of the ancient past, their glory, their tradition. They go on carrying the corp ses on their shoulders. They are very traditional, very orthodox, and completely closed to anything new. They have the idea that their scriptures have all the truth that is possibl e There is no need for them.... Q: WE HAVE THE IMPRESSION THE MA JORITY OF YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE -- I'LL SAY IT, I DON'T MEAN IT NEGATIVELY -- SOME KIND OF DROPOUTS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION. A: No. Q: I READ A BOOK BY ANDRES ELTEN AND HE DESCRIBED EXACTLY THE FEELING THAT HE WAS DISSATISFIE D COMPLETELY WITH WESTERN CIVILIZATION, AND.... A: Will you call Jean-Paul Sartre a dropout? Q: WHO? A: Jean-Paul Sartre. Will you call Bertrand Russell a dropout? Q: IN THE WESTERN SENSE, JA. A: Bertrand Russell, a dropout? Q: IN THE WESTERN SENSE, JA, I WOULD CALL HIM A DROPOUT A: In no sense can you call Bertrand Russell a dropout. You give on the one hand the Nobel prize to the man, and on the other hand you call him a dropout. Q: WELL, LIFE IS FU LL OF CONTRADICTIONS."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" A: I understand perfectly what you mean . Anybody who is intelligent, is a little aware of the situation of the world, of the society, of the family, is bound to be a dropout. Dropping out is absolutely positi ve. If the house is on fire, you run out of it. That is not escapist. Q: BUT YOUR WAY IS THE ONLY WAY TO SALVATION, YOU FEEL? A: No, I don't say that I'm the only savior, or the only salvation, but.... Q: WHAT ALTERNATIVE WO ULD YOU SUGGEST THEN? A: I don't suggest any alternative. Q: WELL, YOU CALLED FOR THE CR EATION OF WHAT YOU NEW MAN.... A: I simply explain to them what I have experienced, and if they feel themselves somehow falling into a kind of synchronicity with me, then it is up to them. Whether they want to be with me or go back to their home... I never persuade anybody to be here; I never prevent anybod y from going. It is all up to them. This commune is completely free. Q: BUT YET, YOU ARE TRYING TO FORM THE NEW MAN, AS YOU SAY. THAT'S WHAT YOU WROTE. A: I am trying to form a new man. It is just an idea, it is not that a new man can be made like a sculpture. I am just explaining what a new man should be. Q: THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EXPLICATI ONS BY LENIN, BY MARX, EVEN BY ADOLF HITLER, BUT NO ONE EVER MANAGED TO REALLY CREATE THE NEW MAN.... A: Because all their ideas were not right, th ey did not fit with existence, they all failed. Q: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR NEW MAN AND NIETZSCHE'S SUPERMAN? A: Superman is a fascist idea. A new man is not superior in any way. A new man is really the most ordinary and simple man. Just try to understand one thing: that I want man to live naturally, ordinarily , without trying to become superior, without going into a pilgrimage towards paradise.

A: You have to understand me: I don't CARE. Q: SO YOU HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR YOUR CHURCH? A: No responsibility whatsoever, beca use every responsibility makes them slaves.

Q: OH, I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU SAID IT, BUT I READ IT FROM ONE OF YOUR SCRIPTS. IT WAS...\"IF I GO MANY OF YOU WILL GO WITH ME.\" DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF YOU DECE ASE THAT OTHERS WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW YOU? A: No. If you have read somewhere, you must have read wrongly, out of context. Q: THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE IT KEEPS CROPPING UP IN THE BIBLE, AS WELL. YOU ARE STRONGLY FOR WHAT YOU CALL DEATH CONTROL -- EUTHAN ASIA, ISN'T THAT THE ENGLISH WORD? -- DEATH CONTROL. A MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO GO TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TO BE FREED FROM HIS BODY, THIS SORT OF THING. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"A Yes. Q: SO THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO KEEP TO THIS TOPIC. ALSO, YOUR FIRST ENLIGHTENMENT S TARTED WITH A.... A: You are not keeping to any topic at all. I am trying to keep you.... Q: I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN MY READERS, NOT ONLY YOU. A: I am not concerned with your readers. I am concerned only with the truth that I can impart to you. Q: WHAT'S TRUTHFUL ABOU T DEATH CONTROL THEN? A: Once birth control is there, death contro l has to be there. It is just the logical consequence of birth control. If you try to control birth, you are only trying to control on one end. What about the othe r end? You are preventing new children being born; it becomes absolutely necess ary that people should not be just vegetating in hospitals. They want to di e; if they want to die, this is their birthright. And all medical facilities sh ould be provided to these people.... Q: I THINK I HAVE THE VERY POINT HERE. THE RAJNEESH TIMES QUOTED YOU JUST RECENTLY, SAYI NG, \"I TEACH YOU TO REALIZE SUICIDE SO THAT YOU CAN GO FOREVER.\" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE TEACHING SUICIDE AS PART OF YOUR RELIGION? IS IT DESIRABLE? A: I am simply saying that nothing is wron g with death. It is as beautiful as life. If you have lived, and you feel that now life has no more to give to you, and you feel that you are tired, exhausted and spen t, then what is the point of forcing you to drag on because an old idiot, Hippocrates, created the medical oath for doctors that they should always try to save the man? The man wants to die; he is hanging between life and death, and they go on trying every way to keep him alive. Who are you? Q: WILL YOU COMMIT SUICIDE ALSO , UNDER A CERTAIN CONDITION? A: If I feel like it, if I feel like now there is no work for me, I will. There is no problem in it. I am Master of my own self; nobody is to control me. Q: AND WILL YOU ENCOURAGE SOMEONE ELSE TO FOLLOW YOU? "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"A: No. I never encourage about anythin g. I simply explain myself, I never encourage anybody. Q: YOU ARE A GREAT ADMIRER OF VINCENT VAN GOGH, THE DUTCH PAINTER, THE ONE WITH THE EAR. YOU SAID SOMETHING LIKE, \"HE COMMITTED SUICIDE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE HAD PAINTED EVERYTHING HE HAD WANTED TO PAINT. SO TO THE WHOLE WORLD IT SEEMS SUICIDE, NOT TO ME. TO ME IT SIMPLY SEEMS A NATURAL END. THE PAINTING IS COMPLETED, LIFE IS FULFILLED.\" A: Yes, absolutely. Q: BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO OWN A PAINTING BY VAN GOGH, IN ADDITION TO YOUR NINETY ROLLS ROYCES? A: No. I own nothing. Q: BUT WHO IS THERE TO DECI DE WHETHER THIS EUTHANASIA SHOULD BE DONE? IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION -- MAYBE NOT FOR YOU -- BUT IF DEATH CONTROL IS EXERTED, WHO SHOULD DO IT? A COMMITTEE OF DOCTORS? A LAWYER? A POLITICIAN? A: Politicians, certainly not. Legal expert s have no business in deciding about life and death. But the medical profession shou ld be freed from the Hippocratic oath; that their function is just to save, what soever the situation. They should be allowed... their function is to serve, whatsoev er the condition. If the person is still capable of living a meaningful life, if he is still wanting to live, if he has still the lust for life, help him. But if a person has nothing to live for and he is telling you that it is time for him to be freed from this body.... Q: WELL, HE MAY HAVE RE GRETTED IT NEXT DAY. (BOTH JOURNALISTS CONTINUE TO TALK SIMULTANEOUSLY....) A: You go on interfering with each other! Q: (FIRST JOURNALIST): BUT WE'RE SPONTANEOUS PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.... Q: (SECOND JOURNALIST): YOU KEEP SAYING YOU HAVE NO INFLUENCE AT ALL, AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE, BUT YOU KEEP WRITING THICK BOOKS. AND YOU'RE HOLDING INTERVIEWS. A: I will continue, but I am not trying to influence anybody."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Q: BUT CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND TH AT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU DO...? MR. TEERTHA SAID IN AN INTERVIEW, \"IF BHAGWAN TOLD ME TO COMMIT SUICIDE, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY TAKE A GUN AND KILL MYSELF.\" IS THAT A REAL EVIL KIND OF INFLUENCE? A: What he is saying is his side. He is not saying that I am going to tell him, because I don't tell anybody even to drin k a glass of water or a cup of tea. Q: THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF INFLUENCING PEOPLE, JUST.... A: No, I am not. I am consistently making them alert not to be influenced by me. I may be wrong. What that man has said IS HIS trust. Q: THERE IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY YOU. THE TITLE IS Dying for Enlightenment.... A: That's perfectly good. Q: JA, BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL ENCOURAGED BY SUCH A TITLE, AND WHAT IT CONTAINS? A: No. That dying means the death of your ego. Q: THE DEATH AND ENLIGH TENMENT THROUGH DEATH. A: Yes, that means the death of your ego... not the death of you. Q: ANOTHER THING YOU TRY TO DESTROY IS CONSCIENCE. A: Yes, the conscience that has been crea ted by the society; because only that is the way to free his consciousness. And th ese are two different things, except in the French language. In the French language, there is only one word, CONSCIENCE for both consciousness and conscience. But they are two different things. Consciousness the child brings wi th himself Conscience is given by the society, the family, the educational system and everybody else.

"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Q: ISN'T IT CONSCIENCE THAT RE FRAINS PEOPLE FROM GOING ROUND HURTING OTHER PEOPLE? A: It is conscience that has been crea ting all the wars in the world and killing millions of people. Q: MAYBE THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSCIENCE. A: All the consciences: Mohammedans have done that, Hindus have done that, Christians have done that. For three thousand years there have been five thousand wars in the world, and they are still preparing for the third, total war. This is the conscience of your presiden ts, of your prime ministers, of your leaders, of your popes, of your priests. A man of consciousness cannot do anything wrong. It is impossible. Q: IS MOTHER TERESA A WOMAN OF CONSCIENCE? I AM JUST MENTIONING THE NAME BECAUSE I HAVE A QUOTE.... A: Can't you find anybody better? Q: IT'S VERY GOOD FOR A START, THAT REMARK; AND YOU CALLED HER, BY GOD, CRIMINALLY MINDED AND IDIOTIC...! A: Yes. Q: DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE RIGH T WAY OF CALLING SOMEONE WHO DEDICATES HIS LIFE TO HELPIN G THE MISERABLE IN THE WORLD? A: The people who devote themselves to helping the mise rable keep misery alive. Q: THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGHT IT, AT LEAST. A: No. They are simply exploiting the mi sery for their own glory. Misery can be destroyed completely, but it cannot be destroyed by Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa wants more orphans. Mother Teresa wants more poor people so that she can convert those people to Catholicism. It is sheer politics. All the religions have been exploiting and doing the same thin g. I don't make any distinction between those religions. Q: YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE GOOD HEARTEDNESS AS...? "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A: No, not at all. I approve only of one thing: If you have plenty -- abundant life, joy, anything -- and you want to share it, an d if that sharing is a joy to you, share it. It does not matter with whom you share . Whether the other person is rich or poor, Hindu or Mohammedan, Western or Eastern, if you are full of fragrance, you will share it. There is no other way. When the cloud is full of rain water, it showers. I do not teach serving the poor, I teach destroying poverty. And we have all the means in our hands to destroy all poverty. But the politicians will not allow, the priests will not allow, because they both will disappear with poverty, remember. Q: WHO IS \"WE\" -- MANKIND, OR THE RAJNEESHEES? A: I mean the intelligence of mankind. I am not a Rajneeshee. Q: I STILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO A CCEPT THE FACT THAT IT SHOULD BE A BIG STEP FORWARD FOR MANKIND IF CONSCIENCE IS DESTROYED. A: All that conscience has done up to no w has been simply ugly, destructive. We need a better concept, and that is consci ousness. Consciousness is a purification of your being through meditative me thods. That's my whole work. Then whatever a conscious man does is right. Then there is no question of choosing for him. Q: HE MAY KILL? A: If he feels it right, he may kill. Q: THAT'S QUITE FAR AWAY FROM CI VILIZATION AS WE UNDERSTAND IT. A: You are not civilized. And where is civilization? Q: RIGHT HERE... IN AMERICA. A: Nowhere does civilization exist. It is just an idea that humanity has been hoping for. What exists is barbarism with clothes covering it, masks hiding the real faces of people. But true civilization does not exist. Q: DID I REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY? ANYBODY WHO HAS REACHED CONSCIOUSNESS MAY KILL IF HE FEELS LIKE IT?

Q: UNREGARDING OF THE EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY...? A: There is no question for him. He sees where the door is, and he moves. He has eyes of his own; he does not need to borrow eyes and insight from others. Q: THAT MEANS, IN PRACTICAL TERMS, IF IT COMES TO THE WORST, AND THE OREGON POLICE SENDS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY POLICEMEN TO SEND YOU OUT FROM HERE BECAUSE OF SOME LEGAL REASONS, YOU WOULD RESIST BY MEANS OF ARMS AND EVEN ON THE RISK OF KILLING PEOPLE? A: We will decide in the moment. We never plan. Q: BUT IF IT HAPPENS, YOU WOULD BE PREPARED TO KILL PEOPLE? A: No. We will see at the moment what we can do, whether it is right to stand before them with our chests open and tell them to kill us and prove that they are civilized, and prove that they are democratic.... Q: YES, PROVIDED THIS IS A CIVILIZED DEMOCRACY. A: It is not. Q: THE AMERICAN SOCIETY IS NOT DEMOCRATIC? A: No society anywhere is yet civilized. Q: I SEE. THAT MEANS YOU WOULDN 'T APPROVE OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT OF AN OREGONIAN JUDGE IF HE DECIDES TO EXPEL YOU...? A: I have seen their judgments.

Q: EVEN ON THE RISK OF CREATING BLOODSHED -- LIKE JONESTOWN? A: It does not matter. Nothing matters if somebody is being nasty to innocent people who are not doing any harm to anybody. Then, whatever happens.... Q: YES, IN A DEMOCRACY IT'S UP TO THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY TO DECIDE WHAT IS HARMFUL AND WHAT IS NOT. A: We will go on fighting up to the Supreme Court of America, and even if we see that.... Q: SO, IF YOU LOSE THERE? A: Then we will fight. Q: WITH THE ARMS YOU ARE COLLECTING ALREADY? A: No. We don't have arms to fight America. Q: SO WHAT ARE THE ARMS FOR? TH EY SAY YOU HAVE ARMS FOR -- I READ THE QUOTE SOMEWHERE, I THINK IT WAS FROM A SENATOR -- HE SAID \"THEY HAVE ARMS FOR A COMBAT REGIMENT, LIKE A COMBAT REGIMENT IN VIETNAM.\" WHAT ARE THE ARMS FOR?

We don't want this loving community to be destroyed by idiots. In these four years in this commune, no crime has happened, no drug has entered in, no theft has happened, no murder has happened, nobody has been raped ... no violence. These few arms and policemen are part of the Oregon government. Q: JUST IN CASE A CRIME WO ULD HAPPEN, DO YOU HAVE THE JUDICIAL MEANS TO DEAL WITH THEM? A: We have every judicial means. We have four hundred sannyasins who are legal experts. Perhaps nowhere else will yo u find such a big legal firm. And these four hundred legal experts are going to fight to the very end. Q: HOW IN YOUR COMMUNITY IS \"DEVIATION\" TREATED? A: Hmm? Q: WELL, IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENS? A: He is just taken to the hospital. Q: AGAINST HIS WILL? A: Otherwise he is told to leave. If he does not want to live here in communion with people, he is free to leave. If he wants to live in communion here, and if the community feels that something is wrong in him, he goes to the hospital. And in four years, nobody has resisted, nobody ha s been taken to the hospital forcibly. Q: YOU DO PERFORM YOUR OWN BIRTH... WELL, YOUR OWN MARRIAGE AND DEATH CEREMONIES. WOULD YO U PLEASE DESCRIBE THEM TO US? A: I do not perform anything, my people do everything. I am just a non-doer, just good for nothing. My people do everythin g. If they want to perform marriage, they will perform marriage. If they want to perform divorce, they will perform divorce. It is up to them, their business, nothing to do with me. I am completely an outsider. Let me repeat, I am not a Rajn eeshee. I don't live even in the City of Rajneeshpuram. I live outside in a gu est house. I am not a resident.

I have never performed a single marriage, I have never gone to any service for somebody who has died. Q: BUT IF YOU DRIVE ALONG THE STREET, THEY STAND AND CHEER. A: That is their business and their joy. Just now they were standing outside; I had not asked anybody to stand there, and they will be standing still, just open the door and see. And nobody is telling them. Two hours those loving people will be waiting for me.... Q: YEAH. YOU SAID ONCE, \"IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE A PART OF MY COMMUNE, YOU ARE TAKING A RISK.\" WHAT KIND OF RISK DOES EVERYBODY TAKE WHO JOINS YOU? A: The risk is of dropping all rubbish that everybody carries and thinks is very valuable -- all kinds of c rap. Your religion will disappear, your nationality will disappear, your whole idea of racism will disappear. Your belief systems, your political ideologies will disappear. Here you will be just a simple, innocent human being. I believe in the individual. Q: INNOCENCE ALSO MEANS IRRESPONSIBILITY. A: Yes. It means both. It means irrespon sibility to those who have been forcing responsibility on you. But in fact it mean s responsibility, because a person who is totally free, whatever he does he is responsible for. He cannot say, \"My commander-in-chief ordered me,\" that \"It was from the pope, what can I do?\" \"It is from Jesus, the only begotten son of God.\" He has nobody to dump anything on. All responsibility is his, so whatsoever he does, he has to take the responsibility upon his own shoulders. So to him it means responsibility, but certainly to others it will look like irresponsibility. Q: PERHAPS HE CAN ALSO BE MANIPULATED EASIER.

It was a secret pact between Swami Swarupananda and my father. They were fr iends. And it was just superstitious astrology.

My father is dead, now Swarupanand a is the only person who knows, and who has all the documents. So when he declared, I came to know about it. Q: WELL, I'M QUITE AMAZED BY THAT HIGH RATE OF COINCIDENCE. A: It is not a coincidence. It happens in India every day. If people are told by astrologers that their children will die, it is good to let them be adopted that way they think they are going to deceive the stars and death, and everything. It is foolish, but it happens every day. And they kept it a secret pact between themselves.... Q: UNTIL THEY COULD USE IT, OR UNTIL SOMEBODY COULD USE IT. A: There was no question.... Yes, my fath er told Swarupananda, \"If there is any need any day, you are authorized, he is your son.\" Q: WE HAVE STILL TWO, THREE MORE IMPORTANT CONFLICTS.

A: One piece of advice: that all nati ons should dissolve into one global government. The only way to avoid the thir d world war is that there are no more nations, but only one world. Q: IN THAT CONTEXT YOU HAVE SA ID YOU WERE GOING TO SAVE THE ELITE OF THE WORLD BY CREATING UNDERGROUND SHELTERS.

A: There have been many others whose names are not known; but these people, Jesus, Moses or Mohammed were not enli ghtened themselves. But there have been many: for example, Kabir, in India; Farid, a Mohammedan in India; Bodhidharma, an Indian in China; ChuangTz u, a Chinese; LaoTzu, a Chinese. It has happened around many people in different countries, and I have spoken on all these people. There are at least 350 book s that I have spoken and I have talked about these people, their methods, what happened in their lives, and what happened in their death. But these people, Mohammed, Moses, Je sus were themselves not enlightened. Jesus was a mental case, thinking that he is the only begotten son of God, thinking that he is the savior of the whol e world, telling his people that he will come back to save them. And the things that he did-condemning, cursing a fig tree because he and his disciples were hungry and the fig tree was not welcoming them with fruits.

My commune has hundreds of other cars, hundreds of buses, four planes, they have everything. It is not that only I am enjoying luxury -- they have everything. It is simply out of respect they will not use a Rolls Royce. And I am using it because I have tried a ll the cars and just by coincidence only the Rolls Royce seat suits my backbone.

His family is much disturbed, because he is the head of the family and head of the businesses and corporations, and they are naturally worried that if he becomes a sannyasin, he may start donating to my Rolls Royce collection. But nobody is interested in converting him to be a sannyasin. In fact, he was amazed that nobody had even asked him to be a sannyasin. For almost one year he has been coming here. His family is worried. Here nobody is bothered, here nobody takes an y interest in anybody's personal life: why you are not a sannyasin, why you don' t become a sannyasin.

The woman is not more intelligent than man. But because the woman has not been allowed to use her intelligence for centuries... Q: SHE KEPT IT FRESH.... A:... she has kept it fresh. That's why she looks superior and better and more capable. Otherwise, there is no question. It is just a land which has not been used, not been cultivated. She gives better crops, and woman has always been symbolized by the earth. That's why the husband -- the word HUSBAND simply means the cultivator. Because women have suffered for centuries, I would like to compensate. Man has done sheer inhumanity to women. They ha ve been treated worse than cattle. So in my commune, I have allowed them to express and come up with their whole potential. One thing is certain, that they are more loving. Q: CLEVER? A: More loving. And as far as religion is concerned, a loving person has more possibility to grow than a man who is stuck in his head with logic, ideas, philosophies. The woman is free. If she falls in love, she is more courageous than any man. And to be with a Ma ster is a kind of love affair. For men, for women, it makes no difference. These people love me.

A: America is too small a thing for me. We are trying to deprogram the whole world. I have my people around the worl d trying to deprogram every country, every religion, from all the conditions that have been forced upon them. And remember one thing. Don't ge t confused when I use the word deprogramming -- because there are psychologists who are trying to deprogram people. They are not really doing deprogramming, they are doing RE- programming. A Christian moves out of the fold, he is brought back forcibly to the deprogrammer, who reprograms him back into Christianity. I am simply deprogramming and then leaving you alone to your own consciousness, your awareness, and to do whatsoever your insight allows you, your responsibility feels. It is you wh o have to be decisive about yourself. Neither the Bible, nor Koran, nor Gita; neither Jesus, nor Buddha, nor me -- nobody is going to dominate and manipulate you like a puppet. A deprogrammed person is one who is no more a puppet, who has declared his independence from the bogus God and his prophets, messiahs and incarnations. We are already doing it.

In America, everybody is a foreigner! Q: I HAVE BEEN IN THIS CITY EIGHT HOURS NOW, AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF EMOTIONS, MOST OF THEM STRONG. BUT I WAS FOLLOWING YOUR LECTURE THIS MORNING AND THERE WERE MANY THINGS THAT YOU SAY THAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO ITALY. MY... THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION! A: Just ask it. Don't say it's serious. If you say it is serious you have already destroyed its seriousness. Just say it. Q: AMONG THE MANY THINGS TH AT YOU SAID THAT IMPRESSED ME, THERE WERE A FEW THAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO A CULTURE THAT I THOUGHT I HAD LEFT IN ITALY, NAMELY THAT GOD DOESN'T EXIST; THAT ANY RELIGION THAT IS ORGA NIZED MEANS EXPLOITATION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE -- AND MANY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU SAID. IT CAME TO ME THAT THERE WAS ONE ITALIAN THINKER, ANTONIO GRAMSCI, WHO HAS SAID MANY THINGS THAT WERE VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS, ESPECIALLY THE ONE ABOUT GOD, THE ONE ABOUT RELIGION, AND ABOVE ALL THE ONE ABOUT THE NE W KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE NEED IF WE WANT TO CHANGE LIFE ON THE PLANET. HE WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS, DO YOU SEE ANY POSSIBILITY FOR THE BIRTH OF A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF COMMUNISM, OF ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT EXIST ON THE PLANET? A: There is every possibility -- not on ly possibility, but I would say almost certainty of its happening. Even in a communist country, consciousn ess cannot be prevented from growing, from spreading; love cannot be prevented. In communist countries they can nationalize your house, your money, your other commodities, but they cannot nationalize your being. That is everywhere just the same. It makes no difference. And to bring the consciousness to its high est peak, any place is as good as any other place. The question is basi cally the individual's decision. I have sannyasins in the Soviet Union. Of course, they cannot come into the open, they are underground sannyasins. They are being persecuted, but persecution somehow always helps people to spre ad the message and their number is"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"growing every day. My books are prohibited in the Soviet Union, but my people are writing them with their own hands or making typescripts, and they are moving hand to hand, from one person to another person. In fact, in the basements of houses where my people m eet in Soviet Russia, they are more excited than anywhere else, beca use for the first time certainly they are doing something that gives them their dignity back. Communism has nothing to do with God, heaven, hell. Communism is an economic theory. In fact, this should no t interfere with religion. Religion is not their domain, but Karl Marx is their Holy Bible because he said there is no God, there is no consciousness even. What consciousness we have is only a by- product. The moment we die, th e consciousness is finished. They have not explored within, they have not meditated; they have simply believed in Karl Marx, in DAS KAPITAL. So I include communism also in all the other rotten religions. That is a different ki nd of Christianity, a different kind of Hinduism, a different kind of Buddhism -- and they all are bent upon destroying the individual. All the religions of th e world, communism included, are bent upon destroying the in dividual, his freedom. I am trying my best, even in communist countries, and the message is reaching. And the problem is not so big as it appears. Even if there are only two hundred enlightened people in the whole world, the third world war is not possible. So the work is not that big. We CAN ma nage it, we WILL manage it, and I am absolutely certain about it.

DO YOU HURT WITH TH E KNOWLEDGE THAT OTHER PEOPLE"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"SUFFER SO AND DIE FROM STARVATION, OR HAVE TO SLEEP ON STREETS AND THINGS LIKE THIS? A: I know, and I know also why they are suffering there. They are suffering there because of your priests and your politic ians. Still, all the religions are against birth control methods. They want abortion to be made illegal. Pope the Polack continuously says that these children are sent from God, so we cannot prevent them. I am not responsible for this poverty that you see on the earth. If the world listens to me, this poverty can disappear immediately. But they are listening to the wrong people, because they have become accustomed to list ening to them for centuries. The Hindu shankaracharya, the Mohammedan caliph, the Christian pope, howsoever they may be different in small, meaningless matters, are absolutely together in that people shou ld continue to produce more and more people. Then this world is going to die, naturally. My few Rolls Royces -- which are not mine, I just use them -- I can give to Ethiopia. Do you think Ethiopia will be save d? If you are certain, then take all the Rolls Royces from here, and give them to Ethiopia. Ethiopia is created by the pope, and I have to sell my Rolls Royc es...? What kind of logic is this? Why should I bother about the people who don't listen to me, if they are starving? They are not even ready to unde rstand me, to listen to me. This I am saying from my own experience. India... I have been there, for thirty years continuously moving around the country, a wandering teacher. Nobody is re ady to listen. They are ready to throw stones at me, they are ready to throw shoe s at me, they are ready to throw knives at me, they are ready to make attempts on my life, and when these people start dying I have to sell my Rolls Royces? I am not going to do that. Whether there is Ethiopia or not does not matter at all. What does it matter? If India disappears, it will be unburdening the whole world, brin ging a little more richness. In fact this world needs one fo urth of its population, and the only way is for twenty years, absolute birth control. And abortion should not only be legal, it should be rewarded.

And what I am saying to them is abso lutely appealing to them, because I am speaking against all male chauvinists of the past. I stand for absolute liberation of women from man's hold, even to the exte nt that there should be no marriage, because marriage is a bondage, a life-long bondage. People should live naturally just as all an imals live -- no marriage, no divorce, no quarrels, no problems. Have you seen an y henpecked camel? And on the other hand, have you seen any man who is not a henpecked husband? You have repressed the woman, you have taken away everything from her. They were not allowed to be educated, they were not allowed to be economically independent, they were not allowed even to go out of the house, they were not allowed even to show their faces to ot her human beings. These people who have continuously killed the spirit of th e woman are the worst criminals we have known, but they are worshipped. They are worshipped by men, because they have given men power over half of humanity. Here, everybody is absolutely free.

ARE YOU CELIBATE? A: No. Why should I be? I am just natu ral, why should I be unnatural? If you want to meet celibates you go to a Catholic monastery, and you will meet celibates doing nothing but masturbating. I don't see that anybody can be naturally celibate. He is bound to become a pervert, some way or other. And I am a simple, natural man. I follow my natural instincts in every way. I have loved many women -- perhaps no man may have loved so many women. In the beginning I used to keep a count; then I dropped it, because what is the point? Q: BHAGWAN, ONE FINAL QUESTI ON. WHY DO YOU THINK OUTSIDE PEOPLE FEEL THREATENED BY THIS COMMUNITY OR YOU?"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" A: I don't care at all. The outside does not exist. We are absolutely contented and happy herenow. They should take care of themselves. We are not hostile to them, we are simply unconcerned. They are hostile towards us.

If they are hostile, they have hate towards us, sooner or later they are goin g to fall into my trap, because hate can turn into love very easily, just as love can become hate very easily. But my people have nothing to do with them. We are not hostile to them, we are not against them, we never think about them. For five years I have not seen a single newspaper. I don't read. I don't see television. I don't know what is being sa id about me. I don't care, because I have no desire to be a respectable great master, a messiah, a prophet. I am just an ordinary man. And I am notorious enough -- what is the point of reading it again and again? Bruno Glaus World Press Institute, Switzerland Q: BHAGWAN, MY QUESTION REFERS TO THE WORLDWIDE FAMINE CRISIS. DON'T YOU THINK YOUR LECTURE THIS MORNING MAKES THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND THE CURRENT GOVERNMENTS VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY THINK ALSO. I QUOTE: \"STARVATION IS A WAY OF NATURAL BALANCE\" OR I QUOTE, IF I QUOTE IT WELL: \"HELPING THE POOR IS DESTROYING THEIR LICENSE TO HEAVEN.\" THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THEY SEE THE WORLD. A: They must be quoting me. Q: DON'T YOU THINK YOUR COMMUNITY STABILIZES, BY THIS KIND OF VIEW, THE CURRENT POLITI CAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM? A: No, my community is so much more intelligent that there is no need for nature to balance it. In four years' time here, not a single baby has been born. Four sannyasins have died. I am not going to overburden the earth. It is simply a way of nature to establish harmony. It is in fact absolutely true that service to the poor has been the basic cause of poverty remaining for centuries. You go on throwing a few crumbs off your table, and those poor people go on hoping for more, and your priests go on telling them, \"Just wait a little. After deat h you are going to be in paradise.\" And in paradise, even a camel can pass throug h the eye of a needle, but no rich man can enter the gates. They console the poor to remain poor. They make him happy because the rich man will suffer in hell. They make the rich man happy because their consolation"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"of the poor prevents revolution. The happy rich man goes on contributing to make big cathedrals, churches, because he knows that if he can manage here, he will be able to manage there too -- if even a camel can manage, do you think Rockefeller, Morgan or Ford will not be able to manage? They are certainly far more intelligent than a camel. I am certainly against poverty, and I want to destroy it completely. But to destroy it completely one thing has to be understood, that all preventive measures should be taken. People who are not giving birth to childre n should be rewarded. People who are giving birth to children -- their income taxes should go higher and higher. People are doing just the opposite. If you have more children, you have less income tax. This is strange. The government policy is family planning, and on the other hand if the family is bigger you support the bigger family, you don't support the person who has no family. These priests and politicians are responsi ble for keeping poverty somehow alive. They are still doing that. Send help to Ethi opia, send help to India. It fulfills the ego of the super-rich countries, and it al so keeps those poor countries in a subtle, mental slavery, always dependent on you. If I am listened to, it is so simple a matter. We just need one world government; we don't need any countries. We need one government, one world, and that government, that world can easily see where the problem is. Even a poor country like India, where people are starving, is exporting wheat to other countries. It seems we are livin g in a madhouse! Indians are dying, starving, and they are exporting wheat. But they have to export, because they want to make nuclear weapons. From wher e are they going to get nuclear plants? They need money for that. Seventy-five percent of the national incomes of all the countries goes to war, either fighting or preparing for fighting. If the world is one, seventy-five percent of the income of the whole world is i mmediately released. Poverty disappears like a dewdrop in the early morning sun. Ma Mary Catherine The Rajneesh Times, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT POLITICS? A: Do I have to say? I curse it. It is the calamity that has ma de us live for centuries in suffering. Politics is absolutely unnecessary. But po liticians will not allow it to become unnecessary because then they lose thei r presidencies, their White Houses, their Kremlins, their prime ministerships."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Politics is not needed, it is really out of date. It was needed because nations were continuously fighting. In three thousand years there have been five thousand wars. If we just dissolve the boundary lines -- which exist only on the map not on the earth -- who will bother about politics? Ye s, there will be a world government but this government will be only functional. It won't have any prestige to it, because there will be no competition with anybody. If you are the president of the world government, so what? You are not higher than anybody else. A functional government means the way ra ilways are run. Who cares who is the president of the railways? The way the post office is managed and managed perfectly, who cares who is the head postmaster general? Nations have to disappear, and with the disappearance of nations politics itself disappears. It commits suicide. What rema ins is a functional organization that takes care. It can be made rotary like a Rotary Club, so sometimes a black man is the head, sometimes a woman is the head, sometimes a Chinese is the head, sometimes a Russian is the head, someti mes an American is the head -- but it goes on moving like a wheel. Perhaps not more than six months should be given to one person, more than that is dangerous. So for six months be pres ident and then go down the drain forever. And no person should be chosen again. This is simply poverty of intelligence that you go on choosing the same person as president again, again and again. Don't you see it as poverty of intelligence? You don't have any intelligent people? You have just one dodo to go on? In one world there is no need for politic al parties, either. Individuals should decide individually. There is no need for an y political party, it is very destructive of democracy. Although people say that democracy cannot exist without political parties, I say to you democracy cannot exist if political parties are there, because they have their vested interests. Each individual is free to run for any post or to vote for anybody he feels right. And whoever comes out may be far wise r than your presidents and prime ministers. Perhaps because he is going to be there for only six months, he cannot waste his time inaugurating this un iversity, inaugurating that bridge, inaugurating this road, inaugurating all kinds of nonsense and wasting time. And the parliament is simply arguing abou t absolutely meaningless affairs as if they have eternity in their hands. A small bill takes years to pass. A man who has only six months cannot allow this stupidity. He will choose scientific advisers, experts in different fi elds. For example, in economics he will find all the best economic minds in the world to advise him. He has not much time. He cannot go on with third-rate polit icians who know only the art of lying and nothing else. If he has to decide about education, he will ask the advice of the great educationists of the world.

YOU SAID THIS MORNING THAT MESSIAH S, PROPHETS, INCARNATIONS OF GOD ARE CHEATING US, KEEPING US REPRESSED AND PREVENTING US FROM REBELLING AGAINST THE STATUS QUO. YOU SAID THAT POVERTY AND HUNGER ARE NOT A BLESSING. BUT COMMUNISTS HAVE SAID THESE SAME THINGS FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING TO ELIMINATE POVE RTY AND HUNGER. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? A: Yes, they have tried to eliminate... not poverty, but richness. And they have eliminated it. Now the whole of communist Russia is equally poor. That gives a certain satisfaction, of course, but it is not my goal. I want to destroy poverty. I am all for the rich man. I am the rich man's guru. Q: LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUES TION.

A: That's okay. From wherever you are, I am glad to see a black man. To me black is beautiful, and I am all for the black people, although they have not started coming to me; perhaps they are so poor, so downtrodden, that they are involved in their own misery. But take my message to them, that I woul d like as many black people as possible here. Q: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE LACK OF FOLLOWERS WITH BLACK SKIN IN THIS COMMUNITY? A: The world has been divided into the East and the West. Now it should be divided between the North and the Sout h. The South has been completely denied, ignored. It has not been able to grow in intelligence. It has the same potential as the white people of the North. Perhaps the black man has more potential than the white man. One thing is certain, that black people 's intelligence has not been used for centuries, perhaps never. So it is absolutely raw, unused, ready to burst forth. They are not coming to me for the simple reason that my teaching is difficult for them to understand. The poor people may turn Catholic, may turn communist, but they cannot become Rajneeshees, because the poor people have hopes with the Catholics -- yes, after life, after deat h -- they have hopes with the communists"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"in this life.

You have to learn classical music, its delicacies -- only then you can understand Mozart. I am speaking in favo r of luxury, richness in all dimensions of life. Naturally the poor, wherever they ar e, will not feel in tune with me. But in fact, I am the only person they SHOULD f eel in tune with. I ca n drag them out of their poverty. Just look at my communes around the world. We have hundreds of communes around the world, and they are all livin g richly, joyously. We would like the same for you and for your country and for your people. But it is a very strange phenomenon: you tend to listen to those same people who are the cause of your poverty, your degradation, your slavery. In India I have experienced it. I was talkin g to people to make them free of all mental bondage, all spiritual slavery, but they were turning against me, because they think their spiritual slavery is not slavery, it is something holy, a divine heritage. It is very difficult. I can very easily reach people who have known the taste of richness and have found frustration in it, those who are educated and have found that all this education is worthless. It does not give you wisdom to live; it gives you only knowledgeability that can allow you somehow to vegetate. The gap is big, even in India. Here you w ill see all white people. In India it was the same. All white people, ten thousand sannyasins from all over the world, were living with me -- but the Hindus were trying to kill me. They made attempts to kill me. Before ten thousa nd white people a Hindu stood up and threw a knife at me. That is their response. I can understand it, because I am speaking against their tradition, and they are so burdened with tradition they cannot imagine themselves free.

All Christians are responsible for it because they have been teaching that all that is beautiful is beyond death. Jesus was doin g the same as Reverend Jim Jones, they belong to the same category.

Carlo Silvestro Grazia Magazine, Italy Q: YES, ANOTHER ITALIAN. BHAGWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SPEAK ON WHAT KIND OF LOVE IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN, AND ALSO IF THERE IS ANY HOPE FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WH ICH IS NOT GOING TO BE ENTANGLED IN THE USUAL PATTERN OF SADO-MASOCHISM. A: It is a very significant question. Ordinarily, religions have made it impossible. Any beautiful relationship between man and woman -- they have destroyed it. There was reason to destroy it. If a man's love life is fulfilled, you will not find so many people in churches praying. They will be making love, early morning love, on Sundays. Who bothers about the idiot who is preaching in the church? If people's love lives are of immense content and beauty they won't both er about whether God exists or not, whether the philosophy preached in the Bible is true or not. They are so contented with themselves. Once in a while it happens that I pass on the road and two lovers are hugging each other. They don't even look at me . I feel so happy; they must be in an immensely groovy place. Religions have destroyed your love by creating marriage. Marriage is the end, not the beginning. Love is finished. Now you are a husband, your beloved is a"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"wife. Now you start trying to dominate each other. It is politics, no more love. Now every small thing becomes a point to be argued. And marriage is against human nature, so s ooner or later you are going to be fed up with the woman, and the woman is going to be fed up with you. And it is natural, there is nothing wrong in it. That is why I say marriages should not be there, because marriages make the whol e world immoral. A ma n sleeping with a woman, and they are not loving each other but still are trying to make love because they are married -- this is ugly, disgusting. This I call real prostitution. When a man goes to a prostitute, at leas t it is straightforward. He purchases a certain commodity. He does not purchase the woman, he purchases a certain commodity. But he has purchased the wh ole woman in marriage -- and for her whole life. All husbands and all wives with out exception are caged, trying to get free of it. But even sometimes in countr ies where divorce is allowed and they manage to change the partner, within a f ew days they are in for a surprise. The other woman or the other man proves an exact copy of the one they have left behind. I remember hearing about one man who marri ed eight times -- of course, it must have been in California. When he married the eighth time, after two days he recognized that he had married this woma n once before too. And then he started thinking, \"What have I gained by changing women? It all comes back to the same rut.\" Stability in marriage is unnatural. Monoga my is unnatural. Man is by nature a polygamous animal, and anybody who is intelligent will be polygamous. You can't go on and on eating Italian food. Once in a while you want to visit the Chinese restaurant! I want people to be completely freed from marriage and marriage licenses. The only cause of their being together should be love, not law. Love should be the only law. Then what you are asking is possible. The moment love disappears, say goodbye to each other. There is nothing to fight fo r; love was a gift of existence. It came like the wind, it has gone like the wind. You will be grateful to each other. You may part, but you will remember thos e beautiful moments you had been together. You may remain friends, if not lo vers. Ordinarily lovers when they part become enemies. In fact, they become enem ies before they part -- that's why they part. Ultimately, if both persons are meditators, not just lovers, trying to transform the very energy of love into a meditative state.... And that is my whole approach towards man and his relationship with woma n. It is a tremendous energy. It is life. If, while making love to your wo man, you can both move into a silent period, utterly quiet, no thought passing through your minds-as if time has stopped -- then you will know for the first ti me the real taste of love. That kind of relationship can remain for the whole life, because it is no more just biological"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"attraction which fades away sooner or later. Now you have a new dimension opening. Your woman has become your temple. Your man has become your temple. Your love has become your meditation, and this meditation goes on growing, and when it is growing you start becoming more and more joyful, more and more nourished, more and more strengthened. There is no relationship, there is no bondage to remain with the woman. But who can renounce joy? Who can ask for divorce when there is so much joy? Peopl e are asking for divorce because there is no joy, just despair and twenty-four hours a day nightmare.... My people here and around the world are learning that love is only the jumping board. There is much more ahead of it, which is possible only if two persons remain intimate for a longer period of time. With a new person, again you begin from scratch. And there is no need for a new person, because now it is not the biological or the physical aspect of the person, but you have come into communion spiritually. To transform sex into spirituality is my basic approach. And if both are lovers AND meditators, they will not mind, once in a while, if you visit a Chinese restaurant, or she goes to visit some continental restaurant! It is not a problem. You love the woman; if she is feeling ha ppy once in a while with somebody else, what is wrong in it? You should be ha ppy that she is happy, because you love her. Only meditators are capable of dropping jealousies. Be a lover -- that is a good beginning, but not the end. Go on trying to be more meditative. And be quick, because your love may be finished the day the honeymoon is finished. So meditation and love should go hand in hand. If we can create a world where lovers are meditators too, then there w ill be no problem of continuous torture, nagging, jealousies, hurting each other in every possible way. Love without meditation is bound to tu rn into hatred any moment -- beware -- but love with meditation will become deeper and deeper, more and more intense. And perhaps two persons will feel together so attuned, a kind of at-one- ment, that they would love to be together forever. But that is not a condition. Any day, even if one partner decides, \"Now I am moving from this crossroad, away from you. Thank you for all you have done. I remember all these beautiful moments, bu t I cannot continue\" -- that's enough. No court is needed to decide for you that you are married, to decide for you that you are divorced. What an insane world we are living in! Even our love is not free. And when I say that love should be our freedom, they condemn me all over the world as the \"free-sex guru.\" Certainly I am all for freedom of love. And in a way they are right: I don't want sex to be a commodity in the market. It has to be freely available just two persons agreeing , that's enough. And this agreement is only for the moment; no promises for th e future, because th ey become chains around your neck. They will kill you. No pr omises for the future, just relish this"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"moment. And if next moment you are still together, you will be able to relish it more. So I don't use the word RELATIONSHIP. I use the word RELATEDNESS. You can relate, but don't create relationship . If your relating becomes a lifelong process, good. If it does not, that is even better. Perhaps this was not the right partner, and it is good that you separat ed. Find another partner. There must be someone somewhere who will be waiting for you. But this society does not allow you to find out who it is who is waiting for you, who is the person who will fit with you. They will call me immoral.... To me, this is morality. What they are trying to practice is immoral.

A: You can just see Sheela: she is so beautiful. Do you think anything more is needed?

As a man, he is just a barbarian. To acquire some feminine qualities.... And just see, all qualities are feminine: love, compassion, sympathy, service, sharing -- all qualities are feminine. Even if a man wants to function at the highest peak of his intelligence, he will have to be guided by his heart.

Our whole educational program is how to bypass the heart -- the feeling part, the emotions, the sentiments, the smiles, the tears --"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"and just go directly to the head. And the head is the mo st insensitive place in the whole existence. Inside the skull there is no sensitivity at all. Even if a bullet is put inside your skull or my skull, under anesthesia, and I wake up, I will not feel that there is anything inside the skull. The skull is completely insulated in a way -- it is insensitive. That's why all of science has gone in an insensitive way and has become a curse rather than a blessing. The heart has to be the master, and the he ad has to be the servant. Just because physiologically the heart is lower and the head is higher, it does not mean that the head is superior. The superior part of your being is your heart. The delicate, the nice part, the most beautiful part, is your heart. So whenever you start moving towards the heart, the heart guides the head. Then wh atever you do, you do with sensitivity. That's why I said all my sannyasins are women in essence. They have accepted the heart as the master and the head as the servant.

Swami Ramateertha The Rajneesh Times, Germany Q: BHAGWAN, I WAS VERY SHOCKE D AT HEARING YO U SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION OF TEST-TUBE BABIES, SAYING THEY COULD BE GENIUSES, MORE BEAUTIFUL AND HEALTHIER THAN HUMAN BEINGS. SURELY THE BEAUTY OF OUR INNER BEING IS ALL THAT MATTERS? -- OR WERE YOU JOKING? A: No. Very rarely I am serious, and at th e time I made that statement I was very serious. I mean it -- because the man that has been created by blind nature, blind biology, has not proved a real growth for humanity. You can see it. Charles Darwin says that monkeys became man. But, since that time -- that must have happened a million years ago -- for these one million years man has not created anything better. Monkeys were far more intelligent; at least they gave birth to humanity. Human beings seem to be absolutely impotent. They go on creating carbon copies of themselves. This has to be stopped. I have heard... it happened in an office . The orders from above came that the office is too cluttered with old files -- th irty years, fifty years old -- they should be destroyed. But make sure that every file's carbon copy is kept.... But what is the point? Why destroy the originals? Man has been meeting with woman accidentally up to now. Hence, you feel shocked -- anybody will feel shocked, I ca n understand -- to think that a baby should not have the mother's womb, the warmth of the mother, the care of the mother, the love of the mother.... But, you know, there are many other things also"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"in the mother: her nagging, her hatred, her jealousy, her stupidity. He will get all those things too. And we can see, the specimens are available all over the world. This is what has come out of your relationship: Adolf Hitler is born out of your human relationship, he was in a mother's womb. Jo seph Stalin is born in the same way. And all these criminals -- Alexander the Gr eat, Napoleon Bonaparte, Mussolini, Mao Tse-tung, Nadirshah, Tamerlane, Genghis Khan -- history is full of these monsters. They have also come out of loving women. I don't trust any more in blind biology. I trust more in a conscious human being. It is better to give the birth of the ch ild to a test tube, where we can choose the best semen, the best egg from the woman. And there is no need to be worried because they are anonymous; in fact, ev ery hospital should have a bank. They have banks for blood; they should have banks for semen and eggs, and they should look into the best semen cell and the best egg meeting in a very clinical way -- in a test tube. They will not have th e heritage of your ugly past. They will be fresh beings and we can program those eggs and the semen cells so that more health, more life, more in telligence becomes possible. In each love affair the man releases millio ns of living cells. Only one of them will reach the female egg; he will become Ronald Reagan. They all rush -- it is really a great rush.... Millions of living beings, al though they are very small and you cannot see them with your eyes -- and it is a big race, bigger than any race that happens on the earth. Thinking of their size, the track be tween the semen and the woman's egg proportionately is two miles long. If they were your size, the track would be two miles long. A two-mile track... and they are fighting hard to survive, because there is not much time. They are always close to the third world war. They can live only two hours, not more than that . And only one cell reaches the egg and the egg closes. It rarely happens that tw o cells reach simultaneously, that's why twins are born. Rabindranath Tagore, one of the great poet s of India, was the thirteenth child of his father. The other twelve proved just idiots, nobody knows their names even. Now, it is a long blind passage. If Ra bindranath's father had stopped after the twelfth child -- which seems to be a good point to stop; one dozen is enough, more than enough -- then you would ha ve missed one of the most beautiful beings on the earth: a great poet, a gr eat painter and a great human being... in every way beautiful. But in a test tube it is so easy. Thos e twelve should have been discarded. We have chosen Rabindranath to be the first child -- and who knows how much more potential would have been in him if he had gotten the best female egg. Nobody knows. We don't know the potentiality of humanity. Give it a chance. What I am saying is, give it a chance. It looks in the beginning inhuman. Everything new looks inhuman in the beginning."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Do you know, when the first railway train moved from London to a nearby station, just eight miles' journey, nobody was ready to sit in it... even for free. Lunch was served, free, but nobody was ready to enter the train because the priest in the early morning said in ch urch that God never created any railway train; this is unnatural, this is danger ous, this is inhuman. Don't sit in it. What do you think would have happened if people had stopped? There would have been no trains, no c ars, no airplanes, no rocket s to reach to the moon, and we have to reach to the stars.

Bob Chase KEX Radio, Oregon, USA Q: BHAGWAN, FOR THE LAST MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY RAJNEESHEE LEADERS THAT THE RE ASON FOR THE VOW OF PUBLIC SILENCE WAS BECAUSE YOU HAD NOTH ING MORE TO SAY, THAT YOU HAD SAID IT ALL IN YOUR TEAC HINGS AND WRITINGS. IS YOUR FEELING NOW THAT THERE IS SOMET HING NEW TO SAY, THAT THE PAST BEARS REPEATING, OR IS IT THAT YOU ENJOY THE SHOWMANSHIP IN THE SETTING THAT YOU HAVE HERE TODAY, FOR BREAKING THE PUBLIC SILENCE? A: Your question implies so many things. First, my silence was not because I have said everything. My silence was because I wanted to drop those people who were hanging around my words. I wanted people who can be with me even if I am silent. I sorted out all those people without any trouble. They simply dro pped out. Three years was enough time. And when I saw all those people -- an d they were not many, but they were hanging around my words. I don't want people to just believe in my words; I want people to live my silence. In these th ree years it was a great time to be silent with my people, and to see their courage and th eir love in remaining with a man who perhaps may never speak again. When the work was done, wh en those people had left, there was no need to remain silent. I am back again, and I have much more to say -- and I will always have much more to say. Even on my deat hbed, or in the chair being assassinated, I will still be saying something. I will not die silently. And I enjoy talking to my people. I enjoy their response. And, of course, I am a showman. Everybody is, they just don't have the guts to say it.

HOW COME SHEELA MAKES THOSE STATEMENTS? SHE IS ANTAGONIZING PEOPLE.\" WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT? A: I was also very much offended by Sheela. Whenever she came back, I hit her hard , because she was not the way I would like her to be-really outrageous! She wa s falling below the standard.

Penny Allen Esquire Magazine, USA Q: BHAGWAN, A NUMBER OF YOUR SANNYASINS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY SENSE A CERTAIN RIPENESS IN THIS MOMENT. THEY FEEL THAT THE FRUIT OF RAJNEESHISM IS RI PE NOW AND READY TO BE PLUCKED FROM THE TREE. DO YOU FEEL THIS ALSO, AND IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE CHOSEN THIS MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS OF THE PRESS?

A: No. I am just myself and I don't belong to any past, past prophets, messiahs. I am the beginning of a new man, absolutely discontinuous with the past. I have nothing to do with Jesus, Moses, Abrah am, Krishna, Buddha. To me they are all dead and of no use for the future new man. In fact they are the barriers for the new man to be born.

It is a strange phenomenon that the grea t scientists are very stupid as far as religion is concerned. They are absolute ly ignorant about it. Even the ordinary man is more aware of the religions. The expe rt is basically to be understood as a man who knows more and more about less and less. The ultimate expert is one who knows all about nothing. The religious man is not an expert. His situation is just the opposite. He knows less and le ss about more and more, and ultimately he comes to a point when he knows nothing about all. And that nothingness has been called nirvana. It is not ignorance, it is innocence. Q: LET ME TRY YOU ON SOME OTHER NOT SO ORDINARY MEN.

Q: YOUR FOLLOWERS LAUGH AND YE T, WITH THAT KIND OF VERY UNSETTLING RAW STATEMENT THAT YOU MAKE, YOU CLEARLY DISTURB PEOPLE, WHO SEE THAT SORT OF STATEMENT AS PROFANE. A: I love to disturb people, because only by disturbing them can I make them think. They have stopped thinking for centuries. Nobody has been there to disturb them. People have been consol ing them.

A: Those guards are the responsibility of the Rajneeshees, I am not concerned. I don't interfere in anybody's life. I have ne ver interfered in any way.

I am not tired of it. And the people who make my circus are not the animals of a circus. They are the most intelligent people of this earth, the very salt of the earth. They go on creating something new every day. It is always new. And it is always new also because I neve r compare anything. Yesterday is gone. I don't bring it back to compare with to day. Tomorrow has not come. Who cares? It is always new, fresh. People get tired because they go on comparing. Comparison means: you have lived this th ing many times, you have seen this rose flower many times; so slowly, slowly you become blind to it, you start taking it for granted.

WOULDN'T YOU HAVE MORE SU PPORT REALLY TO SHOW...? A: We don't need any support. I am not a politician seeking for support. I want to share something, but that is possible on ly when you are shocked and disturbed in your sleep. I have to wake you up, and Sheela has been doing a good job of shaking people and waking people. She prepares the ground for me. When she has done enough, then perhaps I may come there to find people with whom I can relate heart to heart. And there are millions of people in the world who need just a little bit of shaking and they will be awake. Their sleep is not very deep. Q: YOU DO SEEM TO LIKE TO SHAKE THE RICH MOST. MAYBE IT IS THE JINGLE OF THE COINS IN THE POCK ET YOU LIKE TO SHAKE LOOSE. A: The reason is that the poor man is fa st asleep; otherwise he cannot tolerate his poverty. He needs deep sleep. He needs some opium given by the politicians, by the priests. His sleep is not just ordinary sleep, it is narcotic. The rich man needs no consolation from anybody. The rich man is not worried about heaven and hell. He knows he can purchase everything -- the priest, his God, his heaven, his hell -- everything can be purchased. He is not in the same situation as the poor man, he can be easily awakened. Between the poor man and me there is a great distance. Q: AND THE BLACK MAN? THERE ARE FEW BLACKS HERE. A: A few blacks have come... because they are as beautiful people as anyone. The problem is, once a person comes here and just gives us a little chance to shake him and wake him, he is not going to leave the place. So those few black people had come just for three months to live with us -- we had invited anybody to come and live with us for three mo nths -- and they have remained. Many have gone, but they go on continuous ly writing to us that they miss us and would like to come back because for the first time they had been treated as human beings. For the first time a whit e man has hugged a black woman or a black man has hugged a white woman, ma de love to a white woman. For the first time he was not thought to be seco nd rate. He was respected, just the way everybody else is respected. There was no discrimination. The problem is, people are afraid to come, because the politicians are making them afraid. The religious leaders are maki ng them afraid, creating all kinds of rumors, preventing them from coming here, because they know perfectly well"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"that anybody who comes here with open eyes, alert mind, is going to fall in love with this place.

IF THERE IS THIS MUCH FREE LOVE HERE, WHY THE RUBBER GLOVES IN THE HOTEL ROOMS? WHAT HAS CHANGED? A: It is being careful about my people. They should take every precaution that they don't get AIDS, which is spreading fa st. There is no cure for it. Once you have AIDS, at the maximum you have only two years more to live. That is the maximum. Most probably within six months you will be finished. I would not like my people to be finished that ugly way. Love is free, AIDS is not free.

HOW DOES AN ORDINARY MAN BECOME A GURU, BHAGWAN, WITH SUCH CLARITY AND CERTAINTY ABOUT THESE THINGS? A: Only an ordinary man can become so certain, so clear. The extraordinary man is so much burdened with his ego, with his knowledgeability, with his schizophrenic mind, with all kinds of arguments. I am reminded of Immanuel Kant, one of the most important philosophers of the West. A woman fell in love with him. He said, \"I will have to think about it.\" Now, you don't think about love -- either yes or no -- but Immanuel Kant is a big philosopher. He thought about it for thr ee years and he managed to find all the arguments for marriage and against marriag e. The trouble was, they were equal. After three years he went to the woman's house, knocked on the door. He had gone to say, \"Forgive me, I cannot decide. The arguments are equal, fifty-fifty.\" But the woman was not there....

He never claimed that he was a prophet. He lived just like an ordinary man, but he was most remarkable. His insight and clari ty are just inconceivable. Q: HE MOVED, WHEREAS YOU SIT STILL. DO YOU THINK ONE IS SUPERIOR? HE SEEMS TO BE A TRAVELER; WHEREAS YOU ARE TRAVELING HERE, BUT YOU PHYSICALLY REST ANYWHERE. IT SEEMS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO YO U WHERE YOU ARE IN THAT SENSE. DO YOU THINK ONE IS A SUPERIOR CHOICE TO THE OTHER, OR...? A: No, there is no question of any superi ority. It is just with whom your heart starts beating. It is just a question of liking, loving.

He said, \"She was my daughter, but she has been married for three years and she has two children, too. She does not live in this town anymore. What business do you have with my daughter? Yo u go and think a little more.\" Thinkers are the most clumsy people in the world, most indecisive. I am not a thinker. I simply SEE, and whatsoever I see I say it without bothering about the consequences. I am an absolutely open person -- nothing private in me.

I LOVE, and my love is not addressed to anybody in particular. And I have loved so many women, I don't think anybody else could have manage d it. Even Gurdjieff is far behind me in that matter. He loved many women, but not more than a dozen. Q: IF SHEELA IS THAT SPECIAL, IS SHEELA THE POWER BEHIND THE THRONE? IS SHE THE HEIR APPARENT TO YOUR SPIRITUAL KINGDOM? A: No. There is no power, no kingdom. I am here. She is just a fellow traveler, as others. Q: IT IS A KINGDOM WITH MORE RO LLS ROYCES THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE WORLD. A: That is true. I am a man of very simple taste. I like the best of anything -- this is certainly true. I would like this city to be in many ways the only city in the world which has that capacity. Certainly , we have ninety or more Rolls Royces. No city of a comparable membership can claim that. In every way: we don't have a single beggar, we don't have a single thie f, we don't have any crime, no murder in four years -- in America, where twen ty percent of the presidents are being murdered -- no prostitution. In many ways this place is unique, and we are going to make it more and more unique and beautiful. Just the stupid politicians cannot understand a simple thing: that we are not doing any harm to anybody. Don't prevent us from doing things which are not harmful. But they go on, they are so afraid. The governor goes on speaking against us and we have been inviting him, \"First come and just visit. Be here and see the people and the pl ace, then if you feel to speak against, speak against. We have no problem with th at. But at least be acquainted, at least be a gentleman.\" Q: IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE JONESTOWN TO US. A: It is just exactly the opposite of Jo nestown. They were death-oriented. We are life-oriented. We love to enjoy everythin g. They were just an unintelligent group of people -- mostly black, uneducated , knowing nothing -- following this man who was telling them that if they go with him, they will ente r into the kingdom of God. We are creating the kingdom of God here. In fact, we are waiting for God to knock on our doors some day and say, \"Let me come in.\" We are just the opposite.

That is exactly what the popes have been doing. That is why I say he is the logical conclusion from Jesus through all the popes and all the Christian theologians. They have all been trying to prove the power, the glory of Jesus, his spec ialness and his special connection with God. And if you follow him then you n eed not worry about the future.

A: I have never learned anything. I just go on doing naturally whatsoever I feel to do. Whatsoever I have to say, I say it, because I don't have any obligation to anybody, and I don't have any commitment to anybody. I don't belong to any party line. I am absolutely free to be fu nny, to be shocking. I don't even bother about contradicting myself, because to me it seems that a man who remains consistent his whole life must be an id iot. A growing person has to contradict himself many times, because who know s what tomorrow brings in? Tomorrow may cancel this day completely. And I am ready to go with life with no hesitation. Q: DID YOU LOVE THOSE CONTRADICTIONS WHEN YOU WERE A DEBATER MANY YEARS AGO? A: I have always loved the contradiction s, because for me contradictions have something of tremendous value. They a ppear contradictions to the intellect, but the deeper you go into them, you will fi nd they are compensatory, they are not contradictions. They somehow depend on each other; if one di sappears, the other will not be there. For example, if there had been no British rule in India there would have been no Mahatma Gandhi -- no possibility. If there had been no Adolf Hitler, forget all about Churchill an d Roosevelt and Stalin. Life exists in such a way that it makes contradictions, complementaries. I have always loved them.

If they feel they can get it better somewhere else, I will be the first person to send them and help them to go. I have been doing that for years.

YOU SAY YOU'RE AN OR DINARY MAN. WHERE DOES THAT PLACE THE REST OF US? Answer: You will be drinking water and I will not be touching the champagne. There is the difference. Q: YOU AND PARTICULARLY YOUR RAJNEESHEES HAVE CREATED QUITE AN IMPACT ON WESTERN AU STRALIA, WHERE I COME FROM, THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS -- TH EIR COMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS, AND THEIR EFFORTS TO START A COMMUNI TY SCHOOL IN OUR SOUTHWEST. THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU, ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE. COULD YOU TELL THEM WHAT SORT OF PERSON YOU ARE? A: I don't know at all. I just live moment to moment, so you cannot confine me into a personality. You cannot define me, you cannot predict me. I don't know even myself what I am going to do tomo rrow morning. I am simply as open as the existence, and as indefinable as the ex istence itself. So people have to figure out whatsoever they want. I am availabl e. There are people who love me, there are people who would like to kill me. They have chosen different parts of me. They have focused their eyes accordin g to their prejudices. But I am not concerned in any way about the opinion of others. I don't have any opinion about other people, any judg ment about other people. Q: ARE YOU A THREAT TO THEIR EXISTENCE AND THEIR FUTURES? MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE. A: Perhaps. If you don't understand what I am saying, I am a threat, certainly. But if they understand what I am saying, they will rejoice, there is no threat. In"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"fact, I want to make these people cont emporaries. They are not. Somebody is hanging two thousand years back with Je sus Christ, somebody is hanging even farther back with Moses or Buddha. These people certainly will feel me a threat because I belong to the present. I want them to come to the present, otherwise there is no hope for humanity. These people are simply walking corpses, burdened with the whole load of the past -- ugly, superstitious. Certainly I am a threat to their superstitions. I am a threat to their rotten theologies. I am a threat to their concepts about morality, God, religion, about everything they have th at is out of date. Certainly they will feel threatened because that's how they ha ve become identified in their own eyes, and it is always difficult to change. Whenever a man like me is there, there are not two ways: either you have to be with me or you have to be against me. Q: DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE TO BECOME RAJNEESHEES? A: No, there is no need. They have to become contemporaries, that's enough. Rajneeshees are not an alternative. It is simply the groundwork for the contemporary man to begin with. Once the world has understood that we have to live in the present, not in the past, Ra jneeshees will simply dissolve. It is not something that I would like to remain foreve r and forever, it is a simple device to challenge people, to bring them to their senses. And once our work is done they don't need to become Rajneeshees, they need to become contemporaries. And the moment they are contemporaries, our wo rk is done. Rajneeshees will simply melt and dissolve into the whole world. Q: YOU CERTAINLY CHALLENGE PEOPLE'S TRADITIONAL VALUES, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I BELIEVE MAKES YOUR JOB MORE DIFFICULT. DO YOU THINK THAT YO U COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE MODERATE AND LOOK FOR THE EN D RESULT RATHER THAN THE IMMEDIATE REACTION? A: I don't care about the end result. My whole concern is not diplomatic, not political. I am simply respon ding with my totality to anything that comes in front of me. I cannot be cunning. What you are sa ying to me -- be a little more cunning -- I cannot be. Q: YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN, ARE YOU? A: I am not a politician. That is the ugliest thing that can happen to a man. I am not diplomatic. I do not want people to be manipulated po litely. I am not a hypocrite, I simply say the truth as it is. If it hurts, it is your problem. If it creates enemies I am not worried, because the enem ies are the first step to becoming my"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"friends. They have already recognized me in their hate.

Q: YOU CERTAINLY WON'T BE IGNORED, I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT. A: Thank you for the compliment. Q: YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE I COME FROM IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA WHERE YOUR RAJNEESHEES HAVE GOT TO GET APPROVAL FROM GOVERNMENTS, FROM POLITICI ANS, TO GO AHEAD WITH THEIR PROJECTS THERE. WHAT'S YOUR ADVI CE TO THEM IF THE POLITICIANS ARE AGAINST YOU? A: Fight. Q: WITH GUNS? A: No. Legal methods are available. Thos e politicians themselves are claiming that they are democratic. Use their own democracy and fight with them. They are saying that their judicial system is fa ir? Use it and fight them. Guns are just barbarous. Q: YOU WOULD NEVER USE GUNS OR CONDONE THAT SORT OF...? A: I myself will never even touch a gun. My advice to the people who belong to me is to be intelligent, use your intellig ence.

Q: TO AUSTRALIA, TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA? A: Certainly. When Sheela come s, that means I am coming. Q: SHE'S GETTING US READY, IS SHE? A: Yes. She is coming again. She will come again and again, and prepare the ground. And she will hit people more and more, and their values more and more, so they become ready. Because wh en I come, then comes the final hit. Q: ALL YOUR OPPONENTS WILL BE ALMOST KNOCKED OUT BY THEN. A: Just tell your people, \"Be ready.\" Q: WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU GET THERE?

BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT CLA SS YOU AS ONE OF THE GREAT COMEDIANS OF THIS WORLD. A: I am. Q: WHERE DOES THE TALENT COME FROM? A: Just because I don't expect any respectability from anybody. So I can act the way I want. I can be funny without any trouble. I have nothing to lose, because in the first place I have never expected th e world to praise me and give me Nobel prizes and this and that. I have everything that I need, and it is within me. And I am completely fulfilled. Now I can be c razy, mad, a comedian. I am absolutely free to be anything. I can afford anything, even to be a madman. But it is within my control. And I enjoy the whole show so much.... Q: YOU ENJOY THE LAUGHS? A Yes Q: MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE? A: Yes Q: YOU'VE SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN BE A MADMAN. I DON'T THINK YOU ARE A MADMAN AT ALL. BUT THERE ARE MADMEN AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND I'D ASK YOU, IF I COULD, IF YOU WOULD COMMENT ON SOME OF THEM. THE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI? A: I said to you I can be a madman, and th at is possible only if I am not mad. I can enjoy being mad, but I am not mad. That's why I can enjoy it. The madman has become identified with his madness. One thing is absolutely certain about every madman: he will never accept that he is mad. The religious leaders are mostly mad people, fanatics, and just beca use they are mad, fanatic, they gather all kinds of idiots around them. Q: WHOLE NATIONS SOMETIMES, LIKE IRAN. A: Yes... because most human beings are retarded. Scientifically, the average mental age of a human being is below thir teen. Now if thirteen is your mental age, you may be seventy years old, bu t you can be exploited, you can be"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"conditioned for any nonsense. You can be made afraid of hell, for which no evidence exists. You can be motivated. Your greed can be aroused for heaven, for which no evidence exists. You can be conditioned to pray to a God who is the greatest lie in the world. And the wonder of wonders is that even in your supreme courts, where you have your best judges, the cream, the oath has to be taken in the name of God. The oath to be truthful, in the name of th e greatest lie! None of those judges have seen God, none of those judges have any idea what God is. But it is being used. Most of humanity is so mediocre that it can follow any madman. The madman just has to be a little methodological , and the religious madmen are very methodological. There is no contrad iction in being methodological. Methodology does not need intelligence . Now, what is the methodology of Jesus? -- \"I am the only begotten son of God.\" And the mediocre people are going to believe it, because not to believe in it is to go to hell and suffer for eternity. Nobody wants to suffer for eternity. As it is, one is suffering enough already. One wants some relief. Even if the relief comes after death, one wants to live peacefully and joyously, not starving, not sick, not old, not ugly. Naturally, simple methodology -- \"I am the only begott en son of God, I can save you, I have come to save the whole world, those who believe in me I will choose for paradise, and those who don't believe in me will fall into an abysmal darkness of hell\" -- a very simple methodology. And th e suffering, the poor, the starving, the uneducated, the downtrodden, the oppressed, exploited are ready to cling to any hope. Q: WHY? A: Because there is nothing in their life. It is so empty that if there is no hope for them they will commit suicide. Then there is no other way. For what should they go on, continue dragging their empty lives? Just to suffer? Just to get hit, just to be crushed under the boots of people who are in power? The hope helps. And that is the methodology of all the religions: give people hope. But the strategy is very cunning: keep the hope beyond death -- because they know perfectly well that hope in this life ca nnot be fulfilled, and then these same people who are their followers will kill th em. So keep the hope beyond death. You can never be caught. Nobody comes back from death to say that these people are lying. So they go on lying, an d the more a lie is repeated, day by day, year by year, century by century, for thousands of years... it almost starts sounding as if it is true. Q: SO IS THE POPE A FRAUD? A: Certainly. Absolutely. All religions up to now have been fraud. They have deceived people and because of their deception humanity has continued to"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"suffer. Otherwise, we have enough intell igence. If we can reach to the moon, do you think we cannot manage en ough food for humanity? Q: PERHAPS WE ARE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY REACHING THE MOON. A: That, too, is foolish. If you cannot f eed people here, what are you going to do on the moon? Seventy-five percent of ever y nation's income, even poor nations, is going into construction for the co ming war. Everybody is getting ready. Q: IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN? A: If all these people are getting ready and getting excited about it, any fool can start it. My effort is that it should not happen, but the only way to prevent it is to make human beings more alert, so that they cannot be exploited by priests and politicians. And that's what I am doing. Naturally, politicians are against me -- all kinds of politicians. It is a miracle: the capitalist is against me, the socialist is against me, the communist is against me, the fascist is against me. It is simply a miracle. Q: BUT YOU'RE A CAPITALIS T HERE, RUNNING A COMMUNE. A: I am not a capitalist. I use capital as a servant. It is not my political ideology. I want people to live richly in every possible way. Luxury should be available to everybody. I don't want people to become equally poor and call it communism. I want people to become equally rich, and th en whatever name you want to call it, you can call it. Names don't matter. Q: IS THAT SORT OF WEALTH AVAI LABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF, LET'S SAY, INDIA, THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT MOTHER TERESA TRIES TO HELP? A: These people like Mother Teresa, who have been helping the poor for centuries, are really the causes for co ntinuing poverty. The poor cannot be helped the way Mother Teresa is helping. This is not help. This is politics, because all those orphans she helps are transformed, converted into Catholic Christianity. In fact, Mother Teresa wo uld be out of a job if there were no orphans in. India. Sh e needs more orphans. That's why they are all against birth control methods, against abortion. Otherwise, where are you going to get orphans? They need the poor, because wi thout the poor whom are you going to serve? And without service you cannot reac h heaven. This is a simple strategy to reach heaven. I love one story: It happened in China that a man fell into a well. It was the annual fair and there was so much noise that nobody took an y note that he was"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"shouting, \"Save me!\" A Buddhist monk pa ssed by. He looked into the well and told the man that there was no need to cry and scream. \"Accept whatsoever is the case, be contented. In the next life you will be fulfilled a thousandfold.\" The man said, \"I am not here to listen to philo sophy. I am dying and you are talking philosophy. First, please help me to get out.\" The Buddhist said, \"That is against my religion, to interfere into the actions and the consequences of somebody else. You must have committed some sin in your past life. You have fallen into the well. Be happy that your sin is finished, your punishment is over. But I am not going to take you out, because tomorrow if you murder somebody then I will also be re sponsible for it. I am not going to be responsible for any murder.\" And he went away. The man could not believe it: \"These Bu ddhists talk about compassion. I am dying and he talks philosophy. I am not in a state even to understand what he is saying.\" And just after him came a Confucian monk . In the old days in China the wells had no walls surrounding them, so it was very easy to fall into them in the darkness, there was no preventive measur e. The Confucian monk said, \"Listen, you are the proof of what my master has said. My master has said that every well should have walls around it. Don't be worried. I am going to create a great revolution in the whole country, so th at every well is well protected.\" The man said, \"But when will the revolution happe n? And when will all the wells have walls? By that time I will be gone.\" The Confucian said, \"You are not the ques tion. Individuals come and go. It is a question for the whole society. We canno t bother about a single individual, we think in terms of the whole civilization.\" And he went away to create revolution. And then came a Christian monk with a bag hanging on his shoulder. He took out a rope from the bag, threw it in, took the man out. The man was immensely grateful, fell at his feet an d said, \"You are the only religious man. But tell me how you guessed that somebody has fallen in to the well. And you came with the rope... why are you carrying the rope?\" He said, \"We carry everything in this bag for emergency purposes, anywhere. Somebo dy will need to be served, and our lord Jesus Christ has said that those who serve will receive immense rewards in heaven.\" Now, think of a world where nobody is in need of anybody's service; everybody is happy, healthy, comfortable, luxuri ous. What will happen to the great Christian servants and saints? They will simply be out of a job. They need poverty to remain. That is their very sour ce of becoming saints, holier than thou. I don't say to my people, \"Go and serve the poor.\" Service, to me, is not a beautiful word. I say to my people, \"If you have someth ing, share it. But remember one thing: there is no reward beyond it. Sharing, en joy -- that is the reward. If you pull out somebody who is drowning in a well, that 's a great joy. What more reward do you want? You saved a life; you should be immensely happy. The reward is in"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"the act itself and the punishment also in th e act itself They are not extrinsic, they are intrinsic.\" But all these religions have been tellin g people the reward is somewhere far away -- beyond death, and punishment, too. Neither can it be proved, nor can it be disproved; hence their business goes on and on, and mediocre people go on following it. If all these religions disappear two things are possible: either the poor will die out of poverty... Ethiopia will disappear. So what? -- it is better that Ethiopia disappears from the earth, rathe r than thousands of people dying in hunger. And in hunger you don't die in a day; a man can live hungry for three months. He will become just a skeleton, and what is the point of these three months of torture? So, there are two alternatives if all these great servants of people don't interfere. Either countries like Ethiopia, India, other poor countries will disappear.... Let them disappear. This earth cannot manage so many people. Q: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANS WHO HAVE DONATED TO BUY FOOD FOR ETHIOPIANS WHO ARE DYING OF HUNGER, DYING OF WAR? A: It does not help. It simply will save a few Ethiopians, who will produce more Ethiopians. Q: WE SHOULD STOP AID TO ETHIOPIA? A: You should completely stop, because the world needs only one-fourth of the population that it has right now. Only then can people be peaceful, living comfortably, joyously. There is no need. Wh at is the point? I have been in India for fifty years, and for thirty years I have been teaching people that birth control is absolutely essential, that abortion is absolutely essential. And they were throwing stones at me, knives at me , shoes at me; that was my reward. Q: IN PLACES LIKE INDIA AND PE RHAPS SOUTH AMERICA, OPPRESSED COUNTRIES, SHOULD THERE BE A MO RATORIUM ON ALL BIRTHS FOR, SAY, TWENTY YEARS? A: That's what I said, that there should be total birth control for twenty or thirty years. That's what I was saying, that there are two possibilities. One, the poor will disappear. Please don't serve them, be compassionate. Your service is not compassion, your service is your greed for heaven. You are using human people and their poverty for your own joys in heaven -- beautiful women who are always young, who don't even perspi re and don't need any deodorant."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"In the Mohammedan heaven there are rivers of wine. You cannot get water in the Mohammedan heaven, only wine. Here it is a crime, here it is a sin. And the same thing that is sin here -- Mohammedans are against alcohol; by a miracle, the same wine becomes virtue. Saints are enjoying it. To look at somebody else's wife with lustful eyes is sin. And your saints , what are they doing in heaven? They are not married, there is no marriage in heaven. They are enjoying all kinds of women. Be compassionate. Either let the poor di e, or if you are REALLY compassionate, then stop this wastage of your energy and money for war efforts and drop these boundaries between nations. Let there be only one government -- which is enough! There is no need for America an d Soviet Union and India and Ethiopia. Just let there be one global government. Q: WHO WOULD BE ITS PRESIDENT, RONALD REAGAN? A: Certainly not! Q: YOU? A: No! Not I, because I don't want to get into any stupid mess. Not Reagan, because if the world is one, people w ill find a better, wiser man. Because the world will be available to choose, an d they will not choose Reagan, with a chimpanzee as his friend. There are wiser people in the world. And the moment nations are not there, war is impossible. Seventy-five percent of the income of the whole world can change the whole scene. There will be nobody who is poor. There is no need for anybody to be poor. And if there is one world, all scientific effort will become creative. Ri ght now it is destructive, right now it prepares only for war; but when there is no need for any war all scientific minds will take a 180-degree turn. It will be cr eative. We can create so much that nobody will bother about paradise. Q: WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN? YOU'RE ENOUGH OF A REALIST TO KNOW THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN TOMORROW. A: I don't know. I am simply saying that these are the two alternatives. Either let the poor die and don't make a fuss about it , or, if you are really concerned, then let the nations disappear so there is no need for war. An d scientific efforts automatically will go towards making mo re comfort, more luxury, more health, longer life. I am not concerned what ha ppens, I am simply saying these are the only two alternatives. There is no third al ternative. And I am telling my people to spread the word all over the world.

PEOPLE HERE, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, COULD AFFORD TO PROCREATE. A: No. If they want to live really joyous ly and luxuriously, th ere is no need. If they want freedom and equality between man and woman, then it is better to avoid babies. Q: BUT SURELY THE HUMAN RACE WILL DIE OUT OF EXISTENCE IF EVERYBODY DOES THAT? A: No, no. I am not saying that. My propos al is that people stop this accidental creation of babies and start looking for a more scientific way. Any man, any woman who wants a baby, should be give n permission by the medical board. It does not matter if the medical board says to the husband, \"You are not the right person for this woman. You will have to take some semen, either from the hospital bank or from somebody whom we propose, to make this woman pregnant. Then your child will be a genius.\" Q: SO YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO THE TEST-TUBE BABY PROGRAM? A: I am absolutely in favor of scientific production of children. Q: A MASTER RACE. A: Right now it is mass production -- and accidental. That will not be mass production and it will not be accidental . It will be intelligent, and we will not be producing in a factory. There is no need for so many people to be produced, we need only a few people. And as science goes on serving humanity and human needs, people will be living longer and longer, and we will need fewer and fewer new people. It is an absolute certainty that we have the capacity to live at least three hundred years. There is no question of mass production. And even if you want to call this mass production, so what? If it is better than your individual, haphazard way of production, not knowing what you are do ing, not knowing what is happening.... You are just making love to a woman, ab solutely unconscious of what is going on in the biology, of what kind of child is going to be born: blind, deaf, retarded, mad, sick from the very birth, crippled .... You call it an intelligent way? The intelligent way will be that we can mana ge that the best human seeds meet together from the very beginning. And we can program -- now it has become possible -- we can program the egg and the semen cell for anything. It is a question of giving a certain program.

Q: IF YOUR PREDICTIONS ARE CO RRECT IT WILL BE AIDS THAT WILL REDUCE AND CONTAIN THE WORL D'S POPULATION, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID THAT IT WILL KILL TWO-THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE HERE HAVE GONE TO EXTREME LENGT HS TO STOP IT INFILTRATING YOUR COMMUNITY. THERE ARE CONDOMS AND RUBBER GLOVES SUPPLIED TO ALL. MEDICAL SCIENTISTS, HOWEVER, ARE CLOSELY MONITORING AIDS, AND THEY SA Y THAT ONLY A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT IS GOING TO KILL SO MANY PEOPLE? A: It is absolutely clear, simple arithmetic. It is scientifically certain now that there is no remedy for AIDS. The man wh o has it is going to die within two years' time. Two years is the maximum limit. He may die within six months or two months or six weeks or today, but he cannot live more than two years. And medicine has nothing to help. There is no way, because AIDS is not an ordinary disease. It is a very strange disease. It simply destroys your resistance against diseases. You become vulnerable to all in fections, all contagions. Nothing inside you is there to fight against it, it is as if the very life force has disappeared. And this man who has AIDS can have many contacts. Before he became aware, he may have had many contacts, sexual re lationships. He must have given AIDS to those people, and they will be spreading it. And now it is known that it can be given to a person even by kissing -- no t even sexual intercourse is needed -- because saliva carries the disease. Kissing should be absolutely illegal. Q: WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE? A: Rub your noses. There are tribes who don't kiss, they just rub their noses and enjoy. I don't see that there is any problem. And noses are hygienic. Find some other alternative. But kissing cannot be in favor of human life anymore. It can pass, they suspect, even through breathin g. That's why I say it can spread like wildfire. I would not like my people to die from AIDS. Dying is not a problem. I am not afraid of death, but death should be a cele bration, it should come out in a joyful,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"blissful mood. We celebrate death here. We dance, we sing. This is the final goodbye to the person whom we have loved and with whom we have known many beautiful moments. What more can we do? But dying from AIDS will not be a celebration. Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HOMO SEXUALS? -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR SPREADING MOST OF THE AIDS. A: They are all perverse. But the religions are responsible for homosexuality, it is a religious perversion. The first homosexuals happened in monasteries where men were not allowed to see women, in nunneries where women were not allowed to see men. There are monaster ies where for one thousand years not even a six-month-old female baby has en tered. It is not allowed. Sometimes I wonder! A six-month-old female baby is not allowed to go inside... are there monks living there, or monsters? But they have become monsters. They are not meditating, they are masturbating. Q: THEY TELL US THEY'RE CELIBATE. A: They go on telling that to the whol e world. But they should come to the scientific lab and prove it. How can they be celibate? Nobody can be celibate. It is just as if somebody says that he does not urinate. You will not believe him. He will say it is his religion not to urinate. Nobody will believe him, but everybody believes celibacy. There is no celibacy. It has never existed, and all those who have pretended either became homosexuals or became masturbators. Or, if they were not courageous enough even to be homosexual s or to masturbate, then nature has its own way: in their sleep their semen w ill be released. They will be having beautiful women in their dreams. Maha tma Gandhi, who tried his whole life after he had given birth to five sons -- he must have been forty at that time -- for thirty years he tried to be celibate. Impossible. He was having wet dreams even at the age of seventy. Q: HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LUCKY. NOT MANY SEVENTY-YEAR-OLDS HAVE THAT SORT OF DREAMS, DO THEY? A: No. If you are repressed, only then can you have them. If you are enjoying love, you will be spent. Q: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CELIBATE? A: Right now I am celibate, but if my health gets better I am not going to be celibate. I have never been celibate. I do not do anything against nature. Right"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"now I am celibate not because celibacy has any value, but just because I am sick. I don't have any energy to make love to a woman and do all th e gymnastics, no. I have enough energy to talk to my people, to talk to yo u. If I get healthy again, I promise you, I will not be celibate. Q: DON'T PROMISE ME, PROMISE THEM. ALL THESE LADIES ABOUT THE PLACE TELL ME THAT YOU'RE A GREAT LOVER. A: I am! Q: HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT? A: Many of them must have loved me. I must have loved them. Q: DOES THAT MEAN YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH THEM? A: Certainly. How do you love if you don't have sex with them? Q: HOW DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR SEXUAL PARTNERS? A: No question, because I don't have an y contract, any rela tionship, anything similar to marriage. No, just for the moment, in the moment. Traveling in a train I meet a stranger... I don't ask even the name of the woman, because we may never meet again. What is the point? But if she is willing.... And I am really the Blessed One: I don't kn ow why, but women are always willing. I have never come across a woman who was not willing. If I was not willing, that is another matter -- but if I was willing, then I have never come across a woman in my life who was not willing. And there was no question of any promise that, \"I will love you forever, forever.\" There is no problem. It is just a mome ntous, momentary affair. We share this moment, we enjoy this moment. And perhap s at the next station I will be gone, or she will be gone and we may never see ea ch other again. I have not seen again many women with whom I had a beautiful moment of love. But there are many women here in my commune, and that proves a very fundamental thing: that although I ha ve loved so many women they are not jealous of each other. Q: HAVE YOU EVER COME CLOSE TO GETTING MARRIED? A: No, never. I have been against marriag e from the very beginning, because that means cutting down your fr eedom. Getting attached legally to a woman or to a man, no. Freedom to me is the ultimate value There is nothing higher than freedom."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"It was difficult, because I was fighting from the very beginning. My parents were in difficulty, my family was in difficulty, but I told them absolu tely clearly that I was not going to be married. They would have been perfectly happy if I had been going to be a celibate monk. I said , \"No, I am not going to be a celibate monk either.\" That was their trouble: if I was going to be a celibate monk they would be happy. In fact, they would have felt proud th at their son had become a great monk. I said, \"No, both are ditches. I am going to walk just in the middle, on the razor's edge.\" And I have enjoyed the walk tremendously. Q: WHAT ABOUT THE PRESSURES FR OM THE SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVED? -- NOT JUST YOUR PARENTS -- BECAUSE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE DAYS INDIAN SOCIETY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY CLOSE AND WOULD HAVE DEMANDED THAT YOU DID ONE OF TWO THINGS. A: I am intelligent enough for that society. Q: SO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY NOW TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE MARRIED? SHOULD THEY ALL GET DIVORCED? A: Everybody should get divorced, with out exception. People should meet and love each other occasionally, as opport unity comes. There should be no ugly state when a wife has to make love to a man whom she does not love anymore, but she has to fulfill her duty. The husban d is fulfilling his duty. While he is making love to the woman he may be thinking of some other woman, she may be thinking of some other man. What kind of neurotic society have you created? If you don't love each other, at least be human and say frankly that it was beautiful to be together, but now it is finished. Say goodbye. I would like marriage to disappear completely from the world, and with marriage, divorce will disappear. With marriage, prostitution will disappear. With marriage, most of the work of the priest will disappear. With marriage, almost ninety-nine percent of the psycho analysts, therapists, psychiatrists will disappear. It is marriage that is creating all kinds of psychological perversions, repressions, guilt. It is simply human that you see a beau tiful woman and you would like to have some time with her. It does not need any God's permission. Even your God committed rape with the Virgin Mary without her consent. Q: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT STORY? A: I just believe that story because it prov es that your God is a rapist; otherwise, I don't believe in the story. Jesus must be a bastard. It is certain he was not the son"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"of Joseph, and just to cover up the wh ole thing, that great story has been invented. Q: GOT GOD TO DO THE JOB! A: They say God is a trinity: God, the Holy Ghost and the son. The Holy Ghost did it, but he is part of God. It is just like my hand is part of me and your genitals are part of you, the Holy Ghost is part af God. Perhaps he is his genitals. Otherwise, how could he manage to make a virgin girl pregnant? Q: WHAT ABOUT FAMILY RESPONSIBIL ITIES, THE MARRIED PARTNERS' RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR CHILDREN, FOR A START? A: Children should be the responsibility of the commune, not of the family. It is the family which creates tremendous problems in the children's minds. It gives them all their sickness, all their superstiti ons, all their stupid ideas, theologies, religion, political parties. It enforces on the child. The child has to be freed from the family. If you want a n ew man... then the family is an ugly institution, its time is over. It should be replaced by the commune. And then it is very easy: the commune takes care of all the children. There will be the father, the mother. They can meet the child, the child can come to them. But basically it is the responsib ility of the commune to take care of the children. The children will have many uncles and many aunts, and they will have more opportunity for human contact with different types of people. They will be immensely enriched. Our children are very impoverished. They know only one man, one woman, and they know the constant quarrel between the two. The woman is nagging the husband, the husband is beating the woma n. And this is what you are training them for. Your boy will repeat you. He will be your carbon copy, knowingly or unknowingly. Your daughter will repeat your wife, knowingly... unknowingly. That's why no son can ever forgive his fa ther, and no daughter can ever forgive her mother. They destroyed their lives. It is absolutely a psychologically proved phenomenon. But if the commune takes care, then th ey will have experiences of so many different kinds of people. It is my experien ce that every person is so unique that the more contacts, intimacies, love affair s you have, the richer you will be. I have not seen two women who are similar. Making love to many women, I have seen every woman is a unique personality in herself, her way of making love is totally different. The people who have never known anyone except their wives are really poor. They don't know how many nuances, how many fragrances, how many different ecstasies are possible through love. The same is true about children. They should be available to the whole commune. And because the commune is re sponsible, you need not be afraid"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"what will happen to the children if you se parate. You can separate. Nothing will happen to the children, the children will be the same. Q: HOW DO YOU RELATE THAT TO A WESTERN SOCIETY WHERE MOST PEOPLE LIVE AS AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY IN EACH HOME, NOT IN A COMMUNE? WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN THERE? A: It can be immediately transformed into a commune. There is no problem. Just understanding is needed. A whole big bu ilding which has ten thousand people living in it can become a commune. It is a question of understanding, there is no problem in it. Now there are skyscraper buildings -- each building can be a commune. Q: AND A STREET ROW OF HOUSES? A: Yes, they can also become communes. We are making communes all over the world; purchasing properties, different houses, making one commune. Sometimes we have difficulty getting all the houses in one place. No difficulty then, either. We have one main house, the meeting house, and the commune people live in different places. But they have dropped the idea of th e family. It is not a question of arrangements. Arrangements can be made very easily The question is of understanding. Our mind is created by the family, so it is very difficult to think that there should be no family. But the family is the basic unit of the nation. Unless the family disappears, the nation ca nnot disappear. The family is the basic unit of the church, so I am cutting at the very root. Q: YOU SURE ARE. A: If the family disappears, then nati ons cannot exist anym ore. Churches and their congregations will simply disappear from the world. We need individuals. I respect the indivi dual the most. The in dividual should be able to have as many experiences about ev erything as he is capable of, so that all his potential becomes actual. Right now the situation is really sad. Ev en our geniuses like Albert Einstein use only fifteen percent of their potential. What a poor world we are creating. If an Albert Einstein uses only fifteen percen t of his potential, then what about the ordinary people? -- perhaps thre e percent, four percent, at the most five percent... and you will call these people talented. Beyond five percent you will call them geniuses. I am not ready for this retarded world. Q: YOU TALKED BEFORE ABOUT WOMEN AS SEXUAL PARTNERS AND AS LOVERS, BUT YOU SEE THEM AS A LOT MORE THAN THAT. IN FACT,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"LOOKING AROUND HERE, IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IT'S THE WOMEN WHO ARE RUNNING THE PLACE. A: Yes, that is true. Q: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE MEN? A: Man has been running the whole society for thousands of years, and he has proved absolutely impotent to run the society in the right direction. Give the chance to the woman now. My commune is running far better than any society which is dominated by male chauvinists. It is running perfectly be autifully. There is no problem. All my communes around the world are run by women. Man has proved his incapacity. He has tried hard enough to repress wome n, to keep them uneducated, to keep them economically dependent, to keep th em almost like cattle, so that he can prove he is very superior. But the basic ph enomenon is that man feels inferior to a woman because he cannot give birth to a child. The woman can give birth to a child; man's function in giving birth is only that of an injection. The woman has the capacity to give birth to children. That creates a deep sense of inferiority complex in man. To cover it up he started repressing woman, cutting her talents, telling her that she is not capable of anything, that she is only capable of doing the jobs of cooking, ta king care of the children, washing the floor; of more than that she is not capable. Only man is capable of all the great things. All religions are founded by man, and all religions have condemned women. Jainism, one of the most ancient religions in India, says that from the body of a woman nobody can be liberated, nobody can become enlightened. From the female body, nobody can grow into consci ousness. Strange. The same people go on teaching that body and soul are sep arate, and the soul is neither male nor female, and that growth happens in the so ul, and that liberation is of the soul, not of the body. Then why can't women enter into paradise? No, they have to be put down in every possible way. First, they should practice religious disciplines so that they are born in a man's body in their next life. All that they can do right now is pray, medita te, fast, to get into a man's body in the next life. Then there is a possibility. From the female body there is no possibility. In India they were not allowed to read religious scriptures. Jesus had twelve apostles, twelve idiots around him, who could not do anything to save the man. They all knew that the next day he was going to be crucified, they all knew that he was going to be caug ht that night, and not a single one of them was courageous enough to tell Jesu s that going to Jerusalem was suicidal. There was no need. Why should they go there? It was not the right time. He would be crucified."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Not a single woman was Jesus' apostle. But when he was crucified all the men had escaped. Only three women were ther e under the cross: his mother, Mary; his lover perhaps, Mary Magdalene, wh o was a prostitute; and another woman called Martha. All the ap ostles had disappeared. Men have been telling women that they weak, which is medically wrong. Women live longer than men, five years longer. Women suffer less from diseases than men. Women go mad half as often as men. Women commit suicide half as often as men. Still, the woman is weak, an d she has to be kept cut off from every corner so she cannot grow. And half the society consists of women. They give birth to your children. What you are doing to the woman you are also doing to your children, because they will be taking care of the children; the children will be learning from and imitating the woman. That's why every language is called mother tongue. Even Germans don't have the guts to call their language father tongue. Q: SO WHEN YOU GO, WHEN YO U DIE, WILL A WOMAN BECOME THE LEADER OF THE RAJNEESHEES? A: I don't care. I don't care at all. I am a man who is not concerned with past or future. Q: BUT YOU CARE FOR THE FUTURE OF RAJNEESHEES? A: I care in this moment. It is not caring about their future. In this moment I care. What happens tommorrow I have nothing to do with. But in this moment, whatsoever response arises in me I have to share with my people. Q: HAVE YOU MET A WOMAN WHO COULD DO THE JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING AS WELL? A: It is very difficult to say. Because unless the opportunity is given, one never knows what a woman can do, what a man can do. It is always the opportunity. While I am here it is difficult for any wo man to do what I am doing. Once I am gone, perhaps a woman can do it better than a man. Perhaps she may do even better than me. After all, unfortunat ely, I belong to the male race. Q: WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN A WOMAN? A: No, because I love women so much. I would not be able to love men, that would be the difficulty. Q: WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL? WHY ARE YOU THE ONE WHO IS THE LEADER? YOU TELL PEOPLE THINGS , AND THEY FOLLOW WHAT YOU"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"SAY, BUT WHY YOU? WHY NOT SOMEBODY ELSE? WHY NOT NOBODY? COULD THESE PEOPLE NOT JUST FOLLOW YOUR PHILOSOPHIES WITHOUT YOU TELLING THEM? A: You ask them -- because I am not their leader. I have not told them that they are my followers. I have not asked them to come and be here with me. It is their business and their problem, and their resp onsibility. I am a very irresponsible person. I don't take anybody else's responsi bility. It is enough that I take my own responsibility. You will have to ask my people why. Q: DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT TH EY FOLLOW YOU THE WAY THEY DO? A: It surprises me immensely. It is re ally a miracle. I am nobody's leader, but there are half a million people who think they are my followers. Q: DO YOU ENJOY THE ADORATION? A: No. Not at all. I hate it. I enjoy friendship. Adoration is putting somebody high above you. I don't have any ego. I am not higher than anybody else, not holier than anybody else. But it certainly surprises me. They ador e... they must be crazy!

They love to see me in fabulous clothes. Q: ARE YOU FASHION CONSCIOUS? A: I love everything that is beautiful. I will not say I am fashion conscious, because my robe is not a fashion.

They enjoy, and they know that I love only the best of everything. So they do it, and try their best. And I am perfectly contented with my people. In fact, I adore them. Nobo dy has been so fortunate as I am. Jesus certainly was surrounded by fool s. Buddha had not the guts to allow women to enter into his commune. For almost twenty years he continuously refused to initiate a woman. What was th e fear? And when he was asked why, he said, \"If I allow women into the commune, then my religion will last only five hundred years. If I don't allow women in to my commune, my religion will last for five thousand years.\" But why this desire that the religion shou ld last for five thousand years? This seems to be only greed, immense greed, to keep your firm running for five thousand years. What is the point? An d why are you afraid that if you allow women entry, your religion will be gone within five hundred years? The fear is every man's fear. Man feels deep down that he is inferio r; the woman is superior. She is beautiful. The man tries also to imitate. For what reason does he shave his mustache, his beard?

ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANT TO AS K AS A DISCIPLE MYSELF AND AS A REPORTER WHO COMMUNICATES IT TO FELLOW SANNYASINS, IS: HOW, IN WHAT WAYS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE US BECOME AS ORDINARY AS YOU ARE? ANSWER: One never becomes ordinary. You can become extraordinary. The very process of becoming leads you away from being ordinary. So there is no how as far as being ordinary is concerne d. You are ordinary. You don't have to become. You have to drop becoming, you have to start living. These are the two types of people in the world: those who are continuously becoming and in their very effort of becoming this and that, th ey are losing being what they are. They are losing time, life, energy, and their becoming is never going to end. It is just like the horizon there, appearing so close that you can reach it -- just a few more miles to go. But as you reach the few miles, you find the horizon has receded again, the distance remains alwa ys the same. The pers on who is caught in the net of becoming wastes his whol e life, dies unfulfilled, in tremendous despair, because he can see that the wh ole life was there for him to live, but because of his desire to become somethin g, someone, he sacrificed all that was freely available to him. One does not become ordinary. You are ordinary. You are born ordinary, just like everything else in existence: animals, birds, trees. No bird needs to be ordinary. No tree asks, inquires how to be ordinary. But man asks it. And this very process of becoming makes you insane. Drop becoming anybody else. Drop the very idea that you have to be according to some discipline, some scripture, some theology. Forget completely that you have to be like Jesus or Buddha or Mahavira, and suddenly you will find you are"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"who you are. Live it joyously, without any guilt. Existence wanted you to be what you are. If existence wanted another Jesus he would have created thousands of Jesuses, there is no proble m. He would have made Jesuses on an assembly line. But he makes only indivi duals. Existence never duplicates, never makes anybody similar to somebody else. This is the beauty and the glory of existenc e. This is a blessing, that nobody like you has ever existed and will ever exist again. You are simply unique. Don't waste this uniqueness in running after some goal, some shadow. Now, because I am telling you it is so beauti ful to be ordinary, it is so joyous to be ordinary, you have made being ordina ry also a goal. Yo ur question would have been perfectly right if you had asked how to become a Jesus Christ, how to become a Buddha, how to become a great celebrity. But the very processes of becoming and being ordinary are absolutely diametrically opposite to each other. Yo u are where you are trying to reach. There is nowhere to go. You have not to become anybody. This very moment you are what existence wanted you to be. Don't miss it. Enjoy it. All the religions have deceived humanity and created the id ea of becoming in the mind of man. Once you get caught in the idea of becomi ng, then there is only misery, suffering, anxiety, anguish, despair, defeat, death. That's what has been happening to millio ns of people for thousands of years. Everybody was trying to become something. You cannot go against nature. You cannot in any way be anything other than what you are. The very effort of becoming something, someone, is absu rd. But how have the religions managed to make this whole earth a madhouse? They gave you goals, they gave you great ideals you have to fulfill. It is impossibl e. By the sheer nature of things, it is impossible. But because it is impossible, far away, it becomes a challenge to your ego. The impossible has a tremendous attrac tion, but you are forgetting that it is impossible. It may have tremendous attraction because of its impossibility, but you are going to be a failure finally. There are so many people who realize that they were alive only when they die. When they were alive they were so busy with so many things, they completely forgot about life. They remembered it only when they kn ew that only a few breaths are left -- the heart is sinking, on ly a few beats more -- that is the moment the realization occurs to them, \"What a fool I have been. The whole life has simply passed by my side. I have not drunk from its wine, I have not eaten its fruits, I am not even acquainted with it s fragrance. What was it? And now it is too late.\" That's why I say only the ordinary bein g is capable of rejoicing, because his energy is not involved in any process of becoming. It is all available, it is overflowing. What can you do with overflowing energy? Sing, dance, rejoice. My insistence for ordinariness has trem endous implications you may not be aware of. By telling you to be just or dinary, I am making you free from all strategies of religions, theologies, political ideologies. I am cutting their very"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"root, even without mentioning it. If yo u are ready to be or dinary, nobody can exploit you. Nobody can push you in a direction which is not for you. Nobody can create a guilt in you. Nobody can say that something is wrong in you. I am making you free from all kinds of parasites. All over the world they have been using the same methodology just to make you feel guilty. What you eat is wrong, how you live is wrong, how you sit is wrong, how you walk is wrong. They have no t left anything for you to decide for yourself. Somebody else -- Manu, five thousand years ago -- has decided for Hindus how they should be, and for fi ve thousand years Hindus have been imprisoned by that man Manu. And it is so stupid. You just be what you are... no becomi ng. Being is my message. Up to now becoming has been the message of everyb ody. Being is my message. Becoming has created guilt, sadness, despair, because you cannot do it. On each step you fall, and on each step you realize ho w poor, how inferior, how powerless you are. On each step you are forced to reco gnize that you are unintelligent, stupid; otherwise, why are you not succeeding? You are not stupid, you are not unintellig ent, you are not powerless. You are just trying to do something which simply cannot be done. Have you seen sometimes a dog trying to catch his tail? A dog is sitting, is in a thinking mood, contemplating; he sees th e tail, becomes curious: \"What is this?\" Naturally, if human beings are doing su ch stupid things, you cannot expect a dog not to do a stupid thing. He tries to ca tch hold of the tail that is lying there, but as he tries, the tail moves away. He tries harder -- that is logical -- he jumps with as much force as possible, but he is simply amazed that the tail also jumps in the same proportion and the distance remains the same. But I think dogs are not so idiotic. After a few efforts he realiz es that this is not possible. He drops the idea, forgets about the tail. It is his own tail, there is no problem. But man goes on and on, chasing so mething, a shadow. No, don't make ordinariness a goal somewher e away from you, so that a path is needed, a discipline is needed; so that yo u have to follow a leader, you have to listen to a priest, you have to change your habits, you have to fit with the goal. Nobody in the whole history has ever su cceeded in becoming anybody else. And it is good that everybody has failed, because even if one man had succeeded, he would have proved all the religions ri ght. One exception would have been enough. If one can succeed, then why no t others? History totally supports me. Without exception, everybody has failed-except those few rare people who have never tried to become anybody, who simp ly lived ordinarily without any plan, without any tomorrow, without any idea ls, without any philosophy, who have simply lived. Living is my religion. Living hereno w, and living as you are without any conditions, without any qualification, that's my message.

When you go out, you try to prove you are somebody special. You try to prove that you are no ordinary human beings. You are somebody chosen, you have a message, you have a special way of life. You have certain understanding which everybody else is lacking. Naturally you will feel in difficulty because they are in the majority and you are alone. Here in the commune you can rejoice in being special, because everybody is rejoicing in being special, there is no problem. And nobody cares what anybody thinks, nobody is trying to impress anybody. In the commune you are living simply. There you become tense, tight, af raid of public opinion; you want to prove in the public's eyes that you are a superior being to them, which you cannot prove. Nobody is superior or inferior. There is no question of comparison. And the very tension, tightness, anxiety makes you feel guilty, as if you have betrayed me, as if you have not b een the way you were expected to be. I have no expectations of you. Go to the courts, to the marketplace, anywhere, but remain ordinary, with no attitude of holier than thou. And you will be surprised: there is no tension, there is no anxiety, there is no guilt. And your intelligence will function more efficiently because you will be so relaxed. It is a miracle to know the beauty and th e power of being relaxed. Suddenly your intelligence has a sharpness that you were no t aware of Your capacities come to their very peak. You function not just on the minimum survival level, but on the maximum. Your torch of life burns from both ends together. It is a strange thing. You were trying to be special and you felt guilty. You were trying to prove yourself holier, higher, and you were feeling a failure. Now you are not trying to be higher, and you are . You are not trying to be better than anybody else, but you are, because they are not relaxed and you are relaxed. And that small difference makes such a grea t difference that it is immeasurable. In my whole life I never felt guilty abou t anything. I don't have any idea how you feel guilty. What kind of thing is guilt? Intellectually I understand, but existentially I have never experienced it, for the simple reason that I have never tried to be anything other than I was.

The church was a beautiful building with a very big garden around it, but it had become a jungle, nobody was taking any care. They broke the lock. They asked me to inaugurate the opening.

Then he inquired of the archbisho p of England what to do, \"because a few Christians have broken the lock, ente red the property, and are worshipping every Sunday there.\" Of course the archbishop was angry and he told him, \"Take legal action against them.\" The legal action was taken against them. That's why I was also found guilty. I inaugurated it, I inspired those people to enter into the church, so I was the most responsible person. I said to the judg e, \"A church, a temple, a mosque, a synagogue belongs to those who worship there. It is no ordinary property. For ten years the church has remained with out a single worshipper. The archbishop of England is guilty for that, the bishop of Nagpur is guilty for that.

In Ahmedabad a man came just after I had finished the meeting, fell at my feet and said, \"Forgive me.\" I said, \"But you have not done anything to me, why should I forgive you?\" He said, \"I have no t done what I had come to do,\" and he showed me a big knife that he was carry ing. He said, \"I had come to kill you because I had been told that you are against religion, an d I am a great devotee of Krishna.\" He was a fanatic Hindu. I said, \"Then why don't you kill me?\" He said, \"Listening to you I became aware that what you are saying is religion. Yo u are not against religion, you are against religions. Those religions I have followed up to now, but I want to change. I had come to kill you, but you have killed me !\" And that man is a sannyasin since then and has been a very stable, reliable sannyasin. Just go simply anywhere as you are and present yourself openly. We don't have any secrets; only guilty people have secr ets. Only people who are burdened with"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"the idea of sin have secrets. We don' t have any secrets. We don't have any theology, so nobody can contradict you. There is a saying that man proposes and God disposes. What I am doing here is: I have disposed of God and I am asking you not to propose anything. So both parts of the proverb, \"Man proposes....\" Why? Why should you propose? Proposals can be contradicted, better proposals can be produced. There is no need to propose anything. Live whatsoever you feel is right. And it is your life, nobody else's business to interfere. Go d I have disposed of completely. And if you don't propose, even if God is there, how can he dispose it? I am making a very strange and unique effort with you. Buddha was making people special, holier, higher than the layman. The layman was almost a word of condemnation. The bhikku, the sannyasin, was truly a man. The layman was not worth anything. Now, he was creating a class, helping their egos to become stronger and stronger. And these are the methods to make your ego stronger: Do things which are against nature. Do things which other peop le find very difficult to do. Fast, and then people will respect you. They cannot fast for seven days, and you have fasted for twenty-one days. You have do ne something superhuman. They cannot drop even one breakfast; th ey cannot live without eating for just a single day. But whatever you have done is against nature. You have tortured yourself, but it will give you a very sophisticated ego. So do things which are not natural: be celibate, which is not natural. Don't enjoy an ything, because every enjoyment iS condemned. Jainas, Buddhists, Hindus have five great principles of life which can make a man a superman. The first of those five is aswad. The word means tastelessness. Drop all taste. They are asking of yo u something absolutely unnatural: don't enjoy your food, don't enjoy eating anyth ing, or, before eating it, destroy its tastefulness. The Hindu monk begs from houses and then goes to the river, mixes all kinds of food into his begging bowl, gives the begging bowl a dip in the river, so whatsoever is left unmixed, the water do es it, and then eats it. Now, in that begging bowl was every kind of thing -- sa lty, with sugar, sweets. They have all lost their taste. Now it is religious. People will worship you because you have conquered taste. All you have done is dest roy a sensitivity that is part of your individuality. Islam is against music. Strange: \"Don't enjoy music.\" Someone is against the tongue, another is against the ear. And there are Mohammedans who have never listened to any music. Then why not become deaf? Why not give your tongue plastic surgery? Remove those small buds on your tongue which taste things -- which is so much easier and so scientif ic -- rather than the whole life suffering. And because these things are unnatural , you are never absolutely successful. Hence the guilt arises and hypocrisy, becaus e you have to go on pretending that you have succeeded."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"I have been very friendly with a few Jaina monks and nuns. They had become very intimate and were almost ready to drop their monkhood . Then I came to know about a few things which no Jain a knows. These monks are not supposed to enjoy taste, but I found that in the temple where they were staying, they were keeping Coca-Cola, Fanta, hidden behind the statue of God, Mahavira. And because I was very intimate and they tr usted me, they offered me their Coca- Cola. And I said, \"Great, but how do yo u manage?\" They said, \"A few laymen love us so much that whatsoever we say, they manage.\" They all had small transistor radios; no Jaina can suspect th eir monks are carrying transistor radios, listening to all kinds of film music. Whenever you ask people to fulfill unnatural things, you are asking for them to be guilty. So on the one hand they are cr eating a big ego, the ego becomes bigger, becomes a mountain; and on the other hand , side by side, a deep valley of guilt. The bigger the mountain, the bigger the valley. I want you to be just walking on the earth. There is no need to go to Everest. I don't want you to be anybody special. Your dress is not to make you special; on the contrary, it is to remind you that you are an ordinary human being. Behave with that ordinariness and you will be surprised that you are received and welcomed. Your ordinariness will destroy the hostility in the other person. Just go into the whole world. It is ours; wh y should we feel anxiety and tension in any way? By making you realize your ordinariness, I am giving you the whole kingdom of God here on the earth, and only an ordinary person can enjoy the kingdom of God. Try. And when I say try, I don't mean make effort. I mean give it a chance the way I am saying. Give it a chance, and something will trigger. I was in the university, a student of ph ilosophy, and I was never in agreement with my professors because they were all outdated. They had studied in the universities twenty, thirty years before. In these thirty years the whole world of philosophy had changed. They had read Bradley, Bosake, Kant, Feuerbach, but they had not heard about Wittgenstein, Je an-Paul Sartre, Jaspers, Heidegger. I was ahead of them, so there was contin uous argument. And because I was ahead of them, they were always in trouble. Th ey had never conceived that Kant can be criticized, that Bradley can be criticized . And after they left the university they had never touched another book of philosophy. So it was an everyday trouble. I woul d not agree with their arguments, their arguments were so poor, and they were continuously in a nervous breakdown because the whole class was with me, and nobody was ready to agree with them. One of my professors, finding it almo st impossible to manage me, one day invited the vice-chancellor, the head of th e department, the assistant head of the department and all other professors of th e department, almost eight persons. As I entered the class I could not believe wh at was the matter, because in my class there were only three students: two girls and me. What were the vice-chancellor, head of the department and ot her professors doing there?"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"And the professor said, \"Now I am going to teach, and you, before all these people, bring your arguments.\" He was th inking that I would become nervous. The vice-chancellor was there, the greatest authority in the university. The head of the department was there, who could make or mar my whole future. All the other professors were there. Anybody in my place would have collapsed. His mind would have gone berserk, he would not have been able to argue. But I got so ecstatic that first I than ked the vice-chancellor, the head of the department and the other professors. I said , 'I was waiting for this opportunity to show you what kind of professors you have. This man must have been dead thirty years ago. In thirty years' time philosophy has taken such quantum leaps he is not aware of. He does not know even the names of the latest philosophical minds, developments. I am grateful that he has gathered you; in fact I was going to invite you all one day, but I am lazy . So I waited for some day, but he has done my job. I am thankful to him also.\" And I told him, \"You start.\" He was teaching Gautam Buddha at that time and he said, continuing, that the country in Gautam Buddha's time was so moral, so religious, so spiritual, that there was no crime, no theft, no murder. In fact, people never used locks on their houses. Even if they were going for mo nths, their houses remained unlocked, because it was unheard of that anybod y would steal. That's what Buddhist scriptures say. He asked me, \"Now what do you have to say?\" I said, \"They had no locks on their doors for two simple reasons: for the first, there were no locks invented. You will have to give me proof that locks existed. Otherwise, how do you suppose poor peop le locked their houses? You will have to give evidence that there were locks in existence. Secondly, I say to you that the people were so poor, they had nothing in th eir houses. Even if locks existed, they would not have been able to purchase them. And for what? -- there was nothing in the house to be stolen.\" And he turn ed to the vice-chancellor and said, \"You see, this is how the whole year goes by. Now what am I supposed to do?\" I said, \"You are not supposed to do anything, just listen to me a little more and withdraw whatever you have said. If it is true that people were rich and there was nobody who was poor, then why does Buddha continuously teach to help the poor, serve the poor? Why does he ma ke it a great virtue? If there were no poor people, whom are you going to serv e? He continuously preached for forty- two years. \"I can bring all the scriptures tomorrow,\" I said, \"and put them before you. Every day for forty-two years he was teaching that stealing is a great sin, never steal. If there were no thieves and everybody was a spiritual saint, who was he talking about, who was he addressing? Where could he get every day for forty-two years people he had to teach, 'Don't steal, don' t be violent, don't be jealous, don't be this, that'? It certainly proves people were stealing, people were thieves, people were lying. That's why he goes on insist ing, 'Don't lie, speak the truth.' What more evidence do you want?\""},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The professor was absolutely dumb. The vi ce-chancellor stood up and said to the professor, \"It will be good for you to le arn from that student. And if you don't have any argument, then accept his argum ent. It does not matter who is arguing, whether he is a professor or a student; the question is whose argument is closer to the truth.\" The vice-chancellor was a retired chief just ice of the high court. I thanked him. I said, \"I was expecting fairness and I am happy that you have not been unfair. You have not supported the wrong side ju st because he is a professor. You have supported a student.\" In my whole life I have never found th ere is any problem, any need to be nervous, to be guilty, to be tense. Bu t people are. Everybody is, not only you. Perhaps you will feel it more because yo u can immediately be distinguished by your dress, by your mala. You can immediately be distinguished, and you are standing against a thick wall of prejudice. But remember: truth may be very small, but its power is almost like an atomic explosion. And howsoever big the lie may be, almost as big as God himself -- God is the lie -- a small truth is capable to expose the greatest lie. I don't say you need conviction, because that is a wrong word here. A Christian needs conviction, because he does not know. Don't make conviction a problem at all. Just say whatsoever you know, an d just be whatsoever you are. Don't pretend to be bigger than yourself. Don' t pretend to know that which you don't know. Always be ready to say, \"I do not know th is.\" There is no guilt in it because in fact nobody in the whole history of huma nity has been able to say that he knows everything. There is always a point where he has to accept and say, \"I do not know.\" So why be afraid? We are ordinary people. If even Socrates has to say, \"I do not know,\" why can't Pratima say, \"I do not know\"? Conviction is not needed. Experience, and don't pretend beyond your experience, and you will be always at ease and relaxed. Can't you see me? I never think what I am going to say to you, because one thing is certain with me: if I know, I will an swer; if I don't know, I will say I don't know. What is wrong in not knowing? Th ere are limitations to everything. If I don't have to say I don't know, it is beca use of you. You cannot find the place, the point, the question, where I will have to sa y,\"I don't know.\" It is your problem, not my problem. Seek and search and try to find something that I have to answer, \"I don't know,\" and I will say it with the same strength as I say anything that I know. I will not speak out of weakness, I will not hesitate. I will not be wishy-washy, I will not try to divert the subject. But to ask a question for which I have to say, \"I don't know,\" you will have to come to the same space where I am. An d in that space you cannot ask. You yourself know that in this space all ques tions are futile and no answer is possible. People are afraid of me. Strange: I am no t a Muhammad Ali, and I am not going to do any boxing, so why are they af raid of me? The journalists have been"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"continuously asking me why people are afraid of me. They are afraid for the simple reason that whatsoever they kn ow, they really don't know. And coming in front of me, they are goin g to be exposed. They will be standing utterly naked, and that is the fear. I am not afraid of anybody. What can an ybody do to me? At the most somebody can assassinate me. To me it seems ex citing. Death is bound to happen, and assassination is not a bad way, in fact pe rfectly suitable to a man like me. I will enjoy it. I will thank the man; I will not die before thanking him. And I will ask you that that man not be punished, becaus e to me he has not given any pain, he has simply given me an opportunity to move beyond the body. So don't drag him to the court. Don't force him to be se ntenced to death. Make history out of it: be the first people in the whole history whose Master has been assassinated, but you are not against the assassination or against the assassin. And there is every possibility the assassin will become a sannyas in, otherwise he will not be able to survive. Do you know what happened to Judas? He sold Jesus for only thirty pieces of silver. When Jesus was crucified, he wa s also expecting a miracle would happen and God would save him. And meanwhile, just being a Jew, if he has earned thirty silver pieces, what is wrong in it? Jesus is not dead; on the contrary, on the cross God fulfills his promise and Jesus is recognized as the real messiah for whom the Jews have been waiting for thousands of years. So in fact I don't think he was betrayin g Jesus. He was just being an authentic Jew. It is all profit: Jesus will be recogn ized as the messiah, God will be known by thousands of people -- an opportunity wh ich is rare -- the ultimate miracle of God descending to save Jesus will be a proof that God is, that Jesus is God's only begotten son. There is no problem in it. Judas believed it; and if he can make some money by the way, it is simply Jewish and human. But the miracle did not happen. Nothin g descended from the sky. Judas was hiding in the hills waiting for the mi racle. When the miracle did not happen, Judas committed suicide within twenty-four hours. He felt that he had done wrong, just for thirty pieces of silver. If he had really betrayed Jesus, there was no point in his committing suicide. He felt so full of guilt that he had to punish himself with the same punishment that poor Jesus got because of him. He hanged himself from a tree. Christians never talk about Judas. He is a man of a certain ch aracter; I don't see anything in him that has to be condemned. He believed in Jesus, that's why he sold him. His trust was so much that he thought there was nothing wrong in getting thirty pieces of silver. Jesus was going to be saved by God. But Jesus was not saved. He must have thrown those th irty pieces of silver in the mountains and hanged himself out of sheer guilt: what has he done? As far as I can see his crucifixion by his own hand is far more significant than Jesus' crucifixion by others. Judas should be counted among th e great names of world history. He is as valuable as Jesus."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"But why did the guilt come in? It came be cause he was convinced. It was not his experience that Jesus was something divi ne. He had heard Jesus say that he was God's son, but it was not his experience. These were words repeated so often that he started believing in them. The conv iction of Judas was greater than the conviction of the other apostl es. But conviction is superficial. It is not that you don't have conviction, so you feel afraid; no, it is because you have certain conviction that you feel afraid. Do you see my point? I am emphasizing continuously: don't believe in anybody, particularly in me. Between Jesus and you is a great distance; Moses even greater. These people are just names to yo u. But I am not just a name. I am flesh and bones, and as real as you are. It is possible that you can st art believing in me; then, that belief will create fear. Facing the hostility of others, your suspicions which you have repressed by the belief ma y start asserting. Perhaps, if so many people -- and the world is large -- are against Bhagwan, then who knows whether he is right or not? That hesitati on will create fear in you, nervousness in you. I have been surprised giving interviews to the journalists, seeing that they are so nervous. And this must have been thei r experience also... because whomsoever they go to interview is usually nervous about what they are going to ask. They may ask questions which may create troubl e. They may ask questions that if he answers them, he will be exposed; if he does not answer them, then a great suspicion will arise. People are very much afraid of journalists, very nervous. With me the experience has been totally different. And I have told Isabel, \"Now find all the journalists from all over the world, and bring each guy and I am going to give him a good heart attack. This will be his real experience of journalism.\" If I am open, you cannot expose me. If I am utterly available, if I put all my cards before you on the table, what can you do? In fact, they become nervous because they start feeling the tr uthfulness of what I am saying. They forget that they are here only as journa lists. Their human being is also there in the same search as everybody else, in search of silence, serenity. One journalist was here. His people wanted only a thirty-minute interview and it went on for two hours. His director was getting very disturbed, but the man forgot completely that he was only a jo urnalist and he was to ask only questions in which the ordinary public and the au dience would be interested. He became so involved personally, he started aski ng questions which were relevant to his growth. Of course the director was puzzl ed about what he was doing. They had prepared all the questions. He was given the list again and again, and he would hold the list, and carry on with me. You need not be nervous, afraid. And rememb er, it is not lack of confidence. It is your belief, conviction, your confidence that you feel here in the commune, where everybody is supportive of you, nobody is hostile to you. Outside, you are alone there with hostile people. But enjoy it. My whole life I have enjoyed facing the hostile public. It is such a beautiful challenge, and if you have something to"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"say, they are going to hear it.

Q: WHY ARE WE AFRAID, AND SO METIMES EVEN RESENT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OURSELVES, AND WE EXPECT EITHER YOU OR THE COMMUNE TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY? A: It is because from your very childhood you have been taught not to be responsible. You have been taught to depend. You have been taught to be responsible to your father, to your mothe r, to your family, to your motherland, to all kinds of nonsense. But you have not been told that you have to be responsible for yourself, that there is nobody who is going to take your responsibility. No, on the contrary, your parents were taking your responsibility. Your family was taking your responsibility. The prie st was taking your responsibility for your spiritual growth. You were just to follow all these people and do whatsoever they said. When you are gr own up and you are no more a child, a great fear arises because you have to take responsibility and you have not been trained to take responsibility for yourself. You go to confess your sin to the priest ... what kind of stup idity are you doing? First, to think that you have committed sin; second, feeling guilty that you committed it; third, now you have to go to the priest to confess it, so that he can pray to God to forgive you. A simple thing has become so complex, so unnecessarily long and circuitous. Whatever you have done, you wanted to do it, that's why you have done it. And who is there to decide what is sin and what is not sin? There is no criterion anywhere, no weighing scale that you ca n go and weigh how much sin you have committed -- one kilo, two kilos, three kilos. How long a sin have you committed? -- one yard, two yards, three yards? And what was this sin, and who is this priest you are going to confess to? And this is his strategy: if you go on confessing to the priest, you are certainly afraid of him, because he knows all the ins and outs about you. The priest knows every gossip going in the town; he knows how many husbands are flirting with other people's wives, he knows who is doing what. They themselves go on confessing it. This is the priest's strate gy to keep control of his congregation. You cannot leave the congregation because the priest can expose you. And also you are afraid that if you leave the congrega tion the priest may not ask God for you to be forgiven, and you have committed so many sins.... Now it is too late. You have to remain in the same herd, in the same crowd, for your whole life. I teach you not to be responsible to anyb ody; the father, the mother, the country, the religion, the party line -- don't be resp onsible to anybody. You are not. Just be responsible to yourself. Do whatsoever yo u feel like doing. If it is wrong, the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"punishment will immediately follow. If it is right, the reward will follow immediately, instantly. There is no other way. This way you will start finding what is wr ong, what is right, on your own. You will grow a new sensitivity -- Indians call it the third eye. You will start seeing with a new vision, a new eye. Instantly yo u will know what is wrong, because in the past so many times you have done it and always suffered in consequence. You will know what is right, because whenever you did existence showered great blessings on you. Cause and effect are together, they are not separated by years and lives. You are responsible then. If you want and enjoy a certain act, although it brings suffering, then do it. It is good, because you enjoy it . The suffering is not big enough to deter you from the enjoyment that your act brings. But it is up to you, wholly and solely up to you to decide. If the suffering is too much and the act brings nothing, no joy, and necessarily a lo ng anguish follows it, then it is up to you if you are an absolute idiot, and what can anybody do about it? This is what I mean by being responsibl e to yourself. There is no God on whom you can dump your responsibility, but you are always searching to dump on somebody, even on a poor man like me, who is continuously telling you that I am not responsible for anything, for anyb ody. Still, somehow, deep down you go on carrying the illusion th at I must be joking. I am not joking. He is our Master, you mu st be thinking, how can He say that He is not responsible? But you don't unde rstand. Dumping your responsibility on me, you will remain retarded, childish. You will never grow. The only way to grow is to accept all good, bad, th e joyful, the sorrowful. Everything that happens to you, you are responsible for. That gives you great freedom. If I am responsible for something, then th e key to your actions is in my hands. Then you are a slave to me. Then you are a puppet and the strings are in my hand. I say dance, you dance; I say stop, you stop. Of course, the puppet cannot be responsible for anything. The puppetee r, who is behind the screen, is always responsible. God is the great puppeteer. And all these popes and saints and mahatmas are great puppets, just mediators between the big puppeteer and you. They are also puppets, but they are great puppets because they follow every single instruction from on high, absolutely. You are a little smaller puppet. Once in a while you dance on your own, too. Once in a wh ile the puppeteer goes on pulling your strings and you don't dance. The moment I say there is no puppeteer, no God, no saint, it is all rubbish, I am trying to give you total freedom. I am making you absolutely responsible for everything that happens to you or does not happen. Rejoice in this freedom. Rejoice in this great understanding that you are responsible for everything in your life. This will make you what I ca ll the individual. And to become the individual is to know all that is worth kn owing, is to experience all that is worth experiencing.

Nobody was born blind, but there was a cert ain fly whose bite made the person immediately blind. Ever y child was born with eyes, but those flies were there all around. It was impossible to escape from those flies. All the older people, the adults, the mothers and fathers, could not do anything -- they were all blind. The whole community was blind. The fly affected only a certain age-group, below five years of ag e. Five years is a long time for a child, and the fly was a ll around. Within those five years... any moment. In fact, within six months ever y child was blind; those flies were not waiting for five years. For the first time, a stranger came into the community from faraway lands. He was an adventurer. Seeing from the hillt op thousands of blind people, he could not believe his own eyes. He felt immensely sorry for them. He forgot about his further exploration in the mountains an d he remained with those people. He wanted to help them somehow. He wanted to find what had happened. It is acceptable that in thousands of people there may be one man blind -- that he knew -- but in thousands of people not a single man with eyes? -- it was a great challenge for him. He wanted to find out what was the matter, what had happened. Soon he was able to find out that every child was born with eyes, and every child became blind within six months. He di scovered the fly, too, which was a common fly. But while he was doing this research, why these poor people had all gone blind, he fell in love with a blin d girl. She was immensely beautiful. He had seen beauty before, but this girl's beau ty was a category in itself, incomparable. Although she was blind, she looked li ke a marble statue made not by any amateur, but by some Leonardo da Vinci. The girl was still unmarried. A great problem arose in the community, because never before had it happened that anybody from their community had married somebody, particularly a stranger -- and more emphatically, a man who is mad because he thinks he has eyes. But they were simple mountain people, they did not want to make these two young people miserable."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The community agreed that the man coul d marry the girl, bu t first he had to become blind. Then he would be one of th em, no more a strange r. First he had to drop that madness that he had eyes -- who had ever heard about eyes? -- if he was not willing to drop that insane idea, then the marriage was not possible. He was not only a stranger, he was insane too. The man so loved the girl that he destroyed his eyes. In his life, for the first time, love became blind. For love he became blind. Why could those people not accept that he had eyes? It was against the egos of the whole community. They were blind and he had eyes. He was somebody special, so either he was mad, imagining, hallucinating about eyes, or perhaps he had eyes. But then he could not be tolerated, allowed to continue to have eyes, because he would remain a stranger, an ou tsider, and the very idea that he had eyes made everyone feel inferior. The day he destroyed his eyes and said, \"I have dropped that idea of being a man with eyes,\" there was great rejoicing, dancing, singing. This is the situation. This is my situatio n. This is your situation. On your own accord you have become part of my caravan. I had started alone; then people went on coming, and the caravan went on becoming bigger, and bigger, and bigger. Now we are a reality the world cannot tolerate. They will condemn you, they will curse you, they will criticize you -- but they cannot destroy you for the simple reason that they are mere ghosts of the past. They are not living people. They can make much noise, but you just have to remember that they are dead and that th e future does not belong to them. They can look backwards into the past. They can sing songs of glory about Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Mahavira, but they don' t have any eyes for the future. They don't have even eyes for the present. And to have eyes for the past is absolutely meaningless, because the past is no more. It is dead, it is a long, long graveyard. And suddenly you come and start dancing and singing and celebrating. It hurts their egos. It makes them feel inferior. When they have missed joy, how dare you dance and sing? And for what? They know only one thing, that you can be happy. But for happiness you need a certain cause... and I am teaching you that happiness is your nature. You don't need any cause. It is not that when you win a lottery of one million dollars, you give a big party, wine and women and dance. This will be understood. I am saying you need not win any lottery, you need no cause to be blissful. Blissfulness is your very nature. Sadness needs a certain cause. Bliss is free of all causality. Once you have understood it, you become a participant in a new way of life, a way so new that it is discontinuous with the past. But you have to understand that all those poor people who have missed are going to be angry with you. In their cr iticism, in their condemnation, there is nothing but jealousy, anger. They cannot be lieve that you can be right, because for millions of years they have lived th e life of sadness and sorrow and suddenly a few strangers arrive on the earth as if from another planet and start doing"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"things which have never been done. They would like to destroy you so they feel comfortable; they would like that you are no t. They will feel a certain satisfaction that whatever they are is the only reality, that there is no other reality. But they cannot destroy you for the simple reason that you are living. You are vital energy and they are spent cartridg es. They can shoot you with their guns, but their guns are full of spent cartridges . They cannot destroy you. Life is so strong and death is so weak. Joy is so strong and sadness is just a shadow. You are undefeatable. When they condemn you, enjoy that, too. Wh en they criticize you, sing a song as a response to their criticism, and don't pay much attention to them. Ignore them. Anyway, they are going do wn, drowning. Don't waste your time arguing with drowning people. You continue your da nce, and you go on spreading your dance. Religion, in the authentic, true sense, is here. You may not be aware that you are part icipating in something which is so important that nothing like it has ever happened before. And because you are capable, intelligent, you can forgive them. Not to let them feel inferior, you can forgive them, knowing that they are on th eir deathbed and you are just starting to grow and live and flower. There is no comparison. One journalist has asked if my commune can live in coexistence with the neighbors. In the first place, there are no neighbors, we are alone on the earth. Ghosts are not neighbors, graveyards are not neighborhoods. Those dead people, although they are still breathing, are not alive. Just to breathe is not enough to claim life. Much more is needed. Just to breathe is to vegetate -- even trees are breathing. Being able to walk is not much; animals and even a few trees can wa lk. In Africa, trees walk miles away from their place of origin to find new sour ces of water. Of course it is a very slow journey, but they go on spreading their roots, and slowly go on moving miles away to where they can find water, miles away to where they can find open sky, the sun. Yes, these people we are surrounded with are breathing, walking, eating, doing all kinds of things which any robot is ca pable of doing. Any mechanical device will be able to do all that these people are doing, but no robot can feel joy without any cause. No robot can be meditative and experience silence, ecstasy, blissfulness. What coexistence can there be between living, overflowing people and the dead? -- or the nearly dead, which is even worse. If you are dead, at least a misery is finished, a long tragedy has come to an end; but nearly dead, almost dead, life is not there but the tragedy co ntinues. They have enough energy for misery. Misery does not need much ener gy. You cannot say that you are so weak you cannot be miserable. Can you say th at? -- that I am feeling so weak today that I cannot feel miserable? Misery needs no energy. It is easy, cheap, costs nothing. But to be blissful, to be dancing and singing, to be a joy to yourself and others, certainly you need energy, more energy than is needed only for survival. If a tree gets enough"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"energy just to survive, it will not flower. No fruits will come for the simple reason that flowering is an overflowing of energy. The tree has so many colors within it, so much fragrance that it canno t contain it anymore. It has to be shared with existence, with the sun, with the moon, with the wi nd, with the birds. That's how flowers come and open up. That's how it gives you fruits -- it has so much life energy that it can give. These people who condemn you because yo u have become a participant with a man who is against the whole past of man, just forgive them. They do not know that they are being foolish. Rather th an wasting their energy in condemnation and criticism, they should come closer to you, know you better, feel you deeper; because if this ecstasy is possible to you, it is possible to them also. Howsoever late, it is still possible. There is a proverb in India: if you get lost in the morning but somehow manage to come back home by the evening, you are not lost. These people you are surrounded by are coming closer and clos er to evening, but they are still far away from home. And if they could not find home in the sunlight, it cannot be conceived that they can find home wh en the sun has set and the darkness of night covers the earth. That darkness is not far away. Its name is the third world war. Every moment we are coming closer to it. That is going to be the night, unending, perhaps forever and forever. It is going to destroy all that is living and all possibility for life to exist on this planet. It has happened on other planets; it is now a recognized scientific fact that there are planets which give indicati ons that some day life had existed there. How it disappeared nobody knows, but soon we will know how it disappears. But there is time still, even if the sun is setting, there is time still. Those people, if they are intelligent, will come and try to mix with you, so that they can understand where they got lost, where they missed the right path. So remember, those who are intelligent are going to become participants in this caravan. Those who are retarded will crit icize you, condemn you. Ignore them. They are already stepping into their grav es, soon they will disappear. They don't have any vision for the future, they don't have any solution for the problems that the past has created. Every day more and more problems are being created by their past, and not a single solution. We don't have any problems from the past, any hangups. And we can see clearly that all their problems can be solved. But they are blind and deaf; they cannot listen, they cannot see. Perhaps they don't want to see, they don't want to listen because that will make them feel more inferior. They want to continue to feel that they are superior beings, that the problems are bad, the problems are insoluble, but they are doin g their best. If the problems still remain, what can they do? I want to say to you that those problems are their creations. With one hand they go on creating the problem, with the other they go on trying to solve it. Their"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"right hand knows not what their left hand is doing. I have not come across a single problem which cannot be solved ri ght now. But they have their vested interests -- and if the problem is solved , then what will happen to their vested interests? So they go on talking abou t solving the problem -- poverty, war, disease, death -- but just talking, and th ey have been talking for thousands of years. Their philosophers have been thinking , creating great treatises, but what is the outcome? What is the outcome of th at whole genius of the past? How have Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Bradley, Bosake helped to solve any human problems? Has Mohammed, or Jesus, or Buddha, or Ma havira been able to give any solution so that man can live at peace? No. On the contrary, they all created more problems, they added more problems. The older ones were there, they created n ew ones with their so-called solutions. It is really very surprising and amazing to see into the past and to see the people who have been adored in the past, re spected like gods. And what is their contribution? Nobody asks. What has Krishna given to the world? Nothing at all. Yes, a few problems, certainly. He has given the idea to the Hi ndus that they are the right people, that everybody else is wrong in the world. Hindus think they are the purest race, everybody else is impure. Hindus go on sa ying that it is a great blessing, that they are fortunate to be born as Hi ndus. To be born as Christians or Mohammedans would have been a condemnation from the very beginning. Unless you have committed some great sins in the past, how can you become a born Mohammedan, a born Christian? All the virtuous people are born brahmins, Hindus. But the same kind of idea is given by th ese so-called geniuses to everybody. Jesus says to Christians the same stupid thin g: You are the very promise, all God's hopes are with you. Everybody has gone wrong, now only you can help people to come to the right path. Moses says to the Jews: You are the chosen people of God. You are born to rule over the world. Now, what is the difference between Moses and Adolf Hitler? From where did he get this idea that German Nordics are the purest Aryan race in the world and they have, by their very birth, the right to rule over the world? Adolf Hitler must have got it from Moses. Perhaps th at's why he killed one million Jews. You will be wondering what the relation is between them. It is very simple. What Hitler is claiming is also being claimed by Moses. Those claims are going to be clashed against each other -- either the Jews are to rule the world, or the German Nordics. Both cannot rule the world, bo th cannot be the purest and the highest race. Something had to be decided, and he decided. By killing one million Jews, he made it clear to them who is higher, more powerful, stronger. Religious leaders, political leaders, they are all sailing in the same boat. I see man's whole past as utterly impotent. It has not contributed more beauty to the world, more joy to beings, more health, more happiness. It has not been creative. It has been simply destructive. I am totally against it."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"It has been asked by very scholarly prof essors, \"As you are a rational person, how can you say that everythin g in the past is wrong? Something must be right, too. There must be someth ing that is good in Buddha's approach, something good in Jesus' approach. You may not agree with their total message, but to deny the total message -- not of one person, one country, one culture, not of one civilization, but of all the civilizations, all the cultures, all the prophets, all the messiahs, all the religions!\" This professor was the professor of Bu ddhism in Benares University. His name was Bhikshu Jagdish Kashyap -- he said, \"You are a rational man. I cannot see how you can say this.\" I said to him that just because I am a rational man I can say it, and also can prove it. Yes, there are things in Buddha which l ook beautiful. There are words of Jesus which look beautiful. But remember one th ing: Jesus is one organic whole, his good words cannot be separated from his bad deeds. Buddha has to be taken as a whole, because whatsoever he says and does is interconnected. You cannot just cut pieces from different people, the good ones, the nice ones, and make a living culture out of it. That is impossible. In the first place, the moment you take a small piece from Mohammed, it is already dead. It was alive in the Mohammedan context. Once it loses that context it has no meaning at all. For example, Jesus says: Blessed are those who are the last in this world, because they will be the first in my kingdom of God. A beautiful sentence. To find something wrong with such a beautiful se ntence is difficult. Even enemies of Jesus cannot do that. I am not an enemy, neither am I a friend . I am simply looking with open eyes, with no emotional antagonism, favoriti sm. He says: Blessed are those who are the last. But how many people can be the last? If the whole humanity is standing in a queue, one man will be the last; and if humanity is standing in a circle, then it will be impossible to find who is the last. And how do you determine? What is the criterion to decide wh o is the last?-the beggar? Buddha was a beggar. Do you have the guts to say that he is the last? He had nothing but his begging bowl, that was his only possession, but you cannot say he is the last. He was so magnificent a person that you can only put him as the first -- this world or that does not matte r. And Jesus is saying this thing without considering how long humanity has existe d. How many people would have been the last in each generation? And why were they last in the fi rst place? They had no intelligence, they had no strength, they had no guts to move. These will be the first in the kingdom of God? -- then in the kingdom of God only idiots will be found, and those who are intelligent, ge niuses, they will be thrown into hell because they were never the last. A beautiful sentence, but if you start thin king and dissecting it, you find that you will have to accept Jesus' whole theology. Only in that context can that sentence have any meaning."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Buddha says beautiful things but also says stupid things. Now, I cannot conceive of a man doing both things together. On the one hand he says that men and women are equal; on the other hand he is not willing to initiate women into sannyas. Now what to make of it? If they are equal, then why are you preventing the equal people equal opportunity? Certainly they are not equal. Your action proves they are not equal. You initiate the most idiotic man and you are not w illing to initiate the most intelligent woman. Then, when you say men and wome n are equal, it seems to be just a political, diplomatic statement. It has no value. You yourself have canceled it completely. I have looked into the past, I have tried my best to find something. It is always connected with something which is ugly. Now the Hind u god Rama is a beautiful person, if you are not very alert. If you are very alert, you will find that this man is an enemy of humanity. His wife was stolen by another king. Three years he had to fight to get the wife back. Poets and Hindu saints praise him because he respected womanhood so mu ch that he fought for three years. Otherwise, in those days, who bothered? Every king had many wives, who cares if one is lost? It looks right, the man must be very respectful towards women. But the same man when he is victorious, when he takes out his wife Sita from the imprisonment of the enemy king, the first words that he says destroy him completely. He says: Listen, woman -- he is not even saying, My dear, my darling. Three years of separation, and the word he uses is derogatory -- \"Listen, woman, I have not fought this war for you. I have fought this war for my own prestige, for my kingdom's prestige, for my forefathers' prestige. It is not a question of you, so don't get a big head because Rama fought for you for three years.\" These are ugly words. And then he is kn own to have forced the woman to pass through fire to prove that she is pure, that she has not made love to the enemy king. In the first place, it is such a stup id idea that the fire will judge whether the woman is pure or not. You can try it. Do a small experiment. Speak something absolutely truthfully. Speak something which cannot be in any wa y untrue. Say the time in your clock at this moment, and put your hand just on a candle flame to see whether you are true or not. And you will know that th e candle flame does not bother whether your clock is there or not, whether you are saying the truth or untruth. It is going to burn you. Then try a lie, anything that cannot be true in any possible way, that two and two make five, and put your hand on the flame. See whether it burns you more, less, or the same. Fire has its own laws. Now, putting this poor woman who has been three years in prison waiting to see her husband, crying and weeping... this is the welcome. And I do not understand how she becomes impure even if she ha s made love. On what grounds is she impure? And, secondly, Rama himself was three years without his wife. He also should have walked through fire to prove his purity. That he does not do. This is"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"strange, that only the woman has to be pure, and man need not bother about such small things. You ask the wife to be pure, at least you should have the courage to go through the same test. The story is beautiful. Sita passes through the fire, is not burned by the fire. It cannot be an historical fact, but just for argument's sake we accept that she survived the fire. But it did not make Rama any more respectful towards her. When they reached their capital, on e washerman, just one washerman, condemned -- that too in his privacy -- hi s wife, because she had not been home the whole night. In the mo rning when she came, he was angry, started beating her, and told her, \"This won't do. Where have you been the whole night? With whom? And remember, I am not Rama that I will accept you. One night is enough, now get out of here. I am not Ram a, who accepted Sita after three years.\" The message was brought to Rama by one of his people who was passing and heard the washerman's stat ement, that one man in the capital was shouting loudly, \"I am not Rama. I cannot tolerat e such things\" -- and this was enough. What happened about the fi re test? Rama renounced Si ta again, and sent her back into the forest, into an ashram . He abandoned her. And Hindus go on saying that this must be something right, unless there is nothing right. Then people like Mahatma Gandhi continuously worshipped Rama. His last words were, \"Ah, Rama!\" when he was shot de ad. But the way Rama behaved with his wife was just ugly, inhuman. She was pregnant, and she was thrown into the forest, abandoned. For what? Again it was a question of prestige. One man has suspected her integrity.... I don' t see the point. If he thought that it was a question of prestige, he should have gone with Sita to the forest and renounced the kingdom -- \"I don't care about the kingdom, I love the woman. I love her purity. I put her under the fire test, now what more I can do?\" But no, the kingdom was too precious. The prestige of the family was too precious, and just one idiot washerman was enough to make a statement and Sita was abandoned. Now, whatsoever good things this man may have said and done -- I have looked into everything minutely, and I have trie d to find something good that can be taken out -- I am puzzled, because with that good thing so many things are joined absolutely. You choose it, you choos e all that which is connected with it organically. It is not a hasty judgment on my part th at I abandon the whol e past of humanity. For almost forty years I have been contin uously trying to be fair and to find something that can be saved. But I'm sorry to say to you that there is nothing. It is far better to start humanity anew, from the very scratch, fresh. Naturally, you will be in danger. I am in danger. I have put myself in danger, this is my responsibility. You have be come my participant; that is not my responsibility, that is your responsibility. I have made it clear to you that being with me is dangerous. Still you choose to be with me. It is your responsibility."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"I don't want to take your responsibility, because with responsibility goes your freedom, too. That's how things are connected . You will feel good if I say, \"I will take your responsibility, don't be worried .\" You will feel good, not knowing that your freedom is finished. Now I am the Master and you are simply a follower. I have reduced you into a certain in feriority. No, I cannot do that. I am a master of myself, but you are not my followers. My mastery does not depend on your following. It depends on my experience. Even if all the followers are gone, I will still be the same Master. You are not my followers. I emphasize it again and again that you are my fellow travelers, that I am doing something risky, that I am walking on the razor's ed ge. And you have chosen to be with me, with full responsibility and freedom. Th en you are not inferior and I am not superior. I want to destroy all kinds of inequalities in the world. They are all the same -- man is higher, the woman is lower; the white man is higher, the black man is lower; the Master is higher, the disciple is lower. I want a very simple fact to be recognized: Everybody is unique, incomparable. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower. Let the whole world condemn; the victory is going to be ours, because we are the people of the rising sun and they are hanging around the sunset. Soon they will disappear into the darkness and be lost forever. And the sooner it happens, the better. But you have a vast future ahead of you, a tremendous opportunity to create man again, because the old man has failed, and the new man is needed urgently. We are living in one of the hotte st times. There has never been such an emergency before. The time is short and the job is immense. But, if you are intelligent, silent, blissful, it can be done. And it can be done without any hardship. It can be done almost as if it is fun, and I don't want you to be serious. I want to create the new man in a very nonserious way, playfully. The old man was serious. I don't want even that connection with the new man. The new man must be playful, nonserious. No God, no hell, no heaven, nobody to impose what is right and what is wrong except your own awareness to decide and then to accept the consequences. I love one of the statements of a Baul fakir -- baul means a mad man. His name was Chandidas. He says, Sabar upar manus satya, tahar upar nahin. \"Above all is the truth of man, and above that there is nothing.\" No God, no heaven, no hell. He was condemned as a madman, and he was saying one of the basic fundamentals. You will be condemned, you will be cursed, you will be criticized, but you cannot be defeated, because the time is with you. The future is with you. Only the new man can survive. The old ma n is almost fading away. Say goodbye to the old man, he has done enough nuisance on the earth. It is time that the new man takes over and does not repeat the old mistakes.

HOW CAN AVOID THESE EXPLOITATIONS? A: There is not much difficulty in it. Simply drop the whole idea. I am teaching you every day that there is nothing higher, nothing lower. It is simply man's ego creating if not money, if not politics, then meditation. The ego can exploit any situation, but it will play the same game. One is higher in meditation, the other is lower in meditati on. One is an older sannyasin, senior -- as if it is a government bureaucracy -- and the other one is a new fellow. You can tolerate him, but he is not to be considered much, not to be taken seriously. It is the same ego, you just have to watch. It is the same ego. Whenever it creates any comparison and brings the qualities of higher and lower and judgments, immediat ely cut its head, then and there. Take a deep breath and drop it. Exhale it!

It is only a wrong habit, nothing to be worried about, a hangover from the old so ciety where everything is compared, everything is put in a certain hierarchic system.

ANSWER: Thank you. Q: PROBABLY THE FIRST QUESTION ON MY MIND IS, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR RELIGION, THAT PEOPLE FIND SO APPEALING? WE SEE PEOPLE LIKE ISABEL AND SHEELA AND SARITA AND K.D., PEOPLE THAT WE THINK ARE LIKE OURSELVES, AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE HERE, AND WE AS K OURSELVES, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU AND THIS PLACE THAT IS SO ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE? A: It is very simple. I am so ordinary a man that nobody can feel any inferiority with me. And all the so-called religious leaders of the world were nothing but egoists, making everybody feel inferior, guilty, sinners. I don't make anybody feel guilty. If he feels guilty already, ju st coming to me his guilt disappears.

They are not sheep and I am not their shepherd. I am just a human being, as they are. And my emphas is is that every human being has the birthright to become enlightened. This is nothing special. Q: BUT ARE YOU REALLY AN ORDINARY MAN? WHEN WE SEE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE COMMUNE AND WHO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR WAY OF LIFE, THEY SEEM TO WORSHIP YOU, AND THEY TREAT YOU WITH REVERENCE, THEY TR EAT YOU WITH RESPECT THAT, PERHAPS, THEY WOULD NOT TREA T OTHER PEOPLE. SO DO YOU REALLY CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ORDINARY MAN? YOU CALL YOURSELF THE ENLIGHTENED ONE."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" A: I am. I don't consider, I don't think. I am just an ordinary man. And that's why they adore me. They have adored for ce nturies people who are just egoists, people who have been deceiving them, calling themselves prophets, messiahs, only begotten son of God, and all kinds of nonsense. They are intelligent enough to see that I am not putti ng any burden on them. I am trying to remove all burden. I am saying to them continuously there is no need to worship me, because I am just amongst you. There is no need for adoration. Q: BUT THEY DO GIVE IT, AND THEY DO NOT TREAT YOU AS AN EQUAL. A: That is the problem. The more I try to be nobody, the more they love me. Now what do you propose I should do? Q: I HOPE YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK THE QU ESTIONS. IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT THEIR LEADER, WHAT DO YO U DO FOR THEM? DO YOU JUST SET AN EXAMPLE? WHAT DO YOU OFFER THEM? A: I don't offer them anything except myse lf. I am available to them. I have no secrets. I am completely open. All the prophets and the messiahs had secrets, esoteric philosophies. I have none. But I say to them that being nothing, no body, brings you all the blessings of the world. And just being close to me, slowly they start feeling also that they are nobodies, nobody is special. And the mo ment one feels he is nobody, the whole existence starts pouring immense blissful ness. It showers on him like flowers. And once you have known the secret, that is how you can commune with existence. With your ego you cannot commune with existence; you are separating yourself. With no ego, there is communion. And th at communion is enlig htenment. That is real godliness. I don't have any God to offer them, but certainly I can show them the way to godliness. And remember, god liness is nothing special. It is our birthright, we just have to claim it. It has been said for centuries, again and again, that you have to earn virtue. It will take many times, many lives for yo u to reach the kingdom of God. They have made it very far away, it is always beyond death. I say to my people that this is sheer stupidity. They were exploiting people's gullibility. They were exploiting people s hope. I am saying to them that there is nothin g beyond this moment. Don't wait for any Godot.

Q: SIMPLY AND BRIEFLY: IS TH ERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO BE A SANNYASIN? I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE: MOST PEOPLE AR E FAMILIAR WITH CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIANS. THEY BELIEVE TH AT CHRIST IS THE SAVIOR, THE MESSIAH. CHRISTIANS TRY TO LIVE THEIR LIVES ACCORDING TO A CERTAIN SET OF STANDARDS. CA N YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING BRIEF LIKE THAT FOR HOW SANNYASINS LIVE? A: I don't have anything like that. I don' t have any catechism, any dogma. I don't offer any principles, any philosophy, any theology. My sannyasins live individual lives in freedom. Q: SO THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BAD SANNYASIN, LIKE THERE IS A BAD CHRISTIAN, OR...? A: No. There is no good sannyasin, ther e is no bad sannyasin; there are only sannyasins. Good and bad are ugly words and I have dissolved them completely. Here is no judgment. Everybody has to be responsible for himself, his freedom and whatsoever he wants to do with his lif e. So it is difficult for me, impossible, to explain to the outside people how a sannyasin is. The only way is to invite him to be here, live with the sannyasins, e xperience what they are going through. Taste it -- their fragrance will be my explanation. Th e taste of being with the sannyasins is my theology. Those people will have to come to the well, the well does not go to the thirsty. Q: SO, IF THERE IS NO GOOD AN D BAD AND NO JUDGING, HOW DOES ONE KNOW IF HE IS IMPROVING? OR IS THERE EVEN A NEED TO IMPROVE? OR IS THAT UP TO TH E INDIVIDUAL? OKAY, AM I HAPPY WITH WHAT I AM DOING NOW, AM I HAPPY WITH THE LEVEL I AM AT NOW? "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"A: I do not teach that you have to beco me somebody other than what you are. No improvement is needed. No goal is there to be achieved. Whatever you need is already provided by existence each moment. It is up to you how to use it, or not to use it. Q: YOU KNOW, I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BIBLE. I DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT YOU JU ST SAID IS ALMOST SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS IN THE BIBLE: TH AT ANSWERS ARE THERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE THEM. EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED IS HERE RIGHT NOW. YOU JUST HAVE TO OPEN YOURSELF UP TO IT. THE ANSWERS ARE ALL THERE. A: No, it is not in the Bible. You don't know anything about the Bible. In the Bible it is said, seek and ye shall find, ask and you will receive the answer, knock and the door shall be opened. This is totally against what I am saying. I am saying, seek and you will miss. Do not seek becaus e it is here right now. In seeking you will forget the moment which is slippi ng by. Do not ask because you are the answer. Why become a question? It is simp ly stupid to become a question when you can become the answer. Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE OF US WHO DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR WAY OF LIFE? A: I don't care. I simply allow them thei r freedom -- nor do I subscribe to their philosophy, their religion. It is perfectl y right they don't subscribe. But we are not at all worried about them. They are worried about us. That makes the difference. Somehow they are troubled by us. We are not troubled. Q: DOES THAT AMUSE YOU? A: Yes, it amuses me immensely. It is our whole entertainment. Their worry, their concern, their continuous curiosity makes it clear that whatever philosophy, theology, religion they belong to, it is no t giving them what they want. It is not making them joyful. It is not making th em sing, dance. It is not giving them anything substantial, any nourishment. That is the reason they go on look ing, perhaps somewhere else.... They are curious, but also afraid, because they ha ve been conditioned. They have lived according to a certain dogma. A man who has lived for seventy years according to a certain dogma is in a really big me ss if he comes across sannyasins. He can see there are people who are happy, dancing, singing for no reason at all. To dance is enough, a reason unto itself. To sing is enough, you need not be rewarded for it in heaven. In the ve ry singing of it you are rewarded."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"They can see these people are happy. Th at makes them curious. But they are afraid to come too close, be cause of their seventy years' devotion to Christ, to the Bible. They don't want to recognize the fa ct that for seventy years they have been idiotic, not Christian. They have been ca lling their stupidity Christianity. It needs guts to come close to my sannyasins. Those who have guts, they are coming, from all over the world. Those who have no guts, let them go to hell. It is none of our business to interfere in their journey, in their pilgrimage to hell. Let them go. Q: HOW MANY SANNYASINS ARE THERE NOW THROUGHOUT THE WORLD? WE HAD HEARD THAT PERHAPS YOUR NUMBERS WERE SHRINKING AND THERE WERE NOT AS MANY. A: Never shrinking. We are always expanding. But we don't bother about numbers, we don't even have an exact ac count of how many people are there. But they are every day growing; around the world in every center people are taking sannyas, joining communes. There are almost eight hundred thousand sannyasins. And a few have left; they can be counted very easily on ten fingers... a dozen or two dozen people. And even though they have left, they are in tremendous trouble, because once a sannyasin, you cannot again become part of the old world. Now they are in a limbo. They cannot mix with the old world. I have already deprogrammed them. They cannot go to the church and listen to the sermon without thinking this is idiotic. They cannot come back because of their egos. Now that they have left, how sh ould they approach Bhagwan again? I would like them to know that the doors are open. Nobody is going to ask you why you had left. We never ask anybody why they have come. Q: IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF TH E PEOPLE IN TOP, OR VISIBLE POSITIONS ANYWAY, IN THE COMMUNE AND WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND THE RELIGION ARE WOMEN. WHY? HOW DID THAT COME TO BE? A: Certainly. Because I am a man. Q: AND WOMEN ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU? A: Certainly. I love them. I love you. Q:... AND WE HAVE ONLY MET.... DO YOU THINK THAT -- THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING -- DO YOU THINK THAT WOMEN ARE NECESSARILY BETTER THAN OR MORE IMPORTANT THAN, OR PERHAPS SMARTER THAN MEN? "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"A: They are lovelier, delicious, tasteful . And they have been repressed for centuries, that's why they appear not to be so intelligent as men. Otherwise, they are exactly equally as intelligent as men. And more earthly than the man. Man is always a moongazer: the woman doesn't care about the moon. She cares about the earth, her concern is very practical. And I am creating a certain way of life which is not schizophrenic, which does not divide materialism from spiritualism, a life in which materialism and spiritualism are together -- not as enemies, not as contradictories, but as complementaries. And one has to begin from the earth. Even if you have to go to the moon, you have to begin from the eart h. The woman is very earthly. I don't need moongazers, I need very earthly people. And the woman gives roots to you. A man without a woman is without roots. Q: IS THERE A SPECIAL WOMAN IN YOUR LIFE? OR DO YOU HAVE MANY? A: I have so many that it is very difficu lt to say who is special. In this moment you are. It is moment to moment. Q: WELL, OKAY, OTHER THAN THIS MOMENT, IS THERE A COMPANION THAT YOU SHARE YOUR LIFE WITH? A: No. I don't make any contracts, particul arly about love, because love is a very delicate phenomenon. It is just like th e wind. A cool breeze comes in and passes from the other door. You cannot catch hold of it, you can enjoy it, but if you try to catch hold of it you miss the moment of enjoyment. In a closed fist there is no wind. If you want to enjoy, keep the fist open. I have no contract with anybody. I neve r promise anything. Because I don't know if tomorrow I will be there or not. And who knows, the next moment somebody else enters into my life, and I am enchanted. I never make any promise. Q: HOW CAN SOMETHING SO FLEETING GIVE A MAN ROOTS THEN? A: It gives you roots. It is not that yo u love one woman, then you will get roots. What gives you roots is that you love. Lo vers can change but your love remains. And that gives you roots. That is permanen t, that is not a fleeting thing. I have always loved. Addresses have changed, bu t I have been writing love letters my whole life. That gives roots, and that gi ves you a very beautiful centering and a feeling of earthliness. From there you have to start to grow, just like a tree. The phenomenon of the tree is exactly simil ar to what I call my religion. (BHAGWAN SPEAKS TO THE VIDEO CREW) Change it . There, you see? No contract even with the film. In the middle of a sent ence the film changes... what to do?"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"A tree is exactly symbolic of what my religion is. The tree grows roots deep under the earth. The deeper the roots go , the higher the tree stands up. It is equal, proportionate. If the tree wants to reach to the stars then the roots will have to reach to the very hell. My commune is a very balanced phenom enon. There are more women than men, for the simple reason that I am prepari ng the earth. Men are coming. Soon you will see equal numbers. But they can come only, the trees can grow upwards only, when the ground is ready. The woman is of tremendous importance. Q: WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN PLAY? A: The children are the commune's. They ar e not yours or mine. In the first place my approach is that the world is alre ady overpopulated, so don't burden it anymore. And science has given you the greatest revolution in human history, the pill, which makes you absolutely capable of making love just a play, a fun, a game. There is no need to be serious ab out it anymore. In the past, of course, people were serious, because children will co me, and who is going to take care of the children? So first my emphasis is , remember, the earth is already too burdened and we have to unburden it. So in four years' time, in my commune not a single child has been born. Although four sannyasins have died, we have not even replaced the four sannyasins with four children. Q: IN HOW MANY YEARS? A: In four years. Secondly, there are children, because when sannyasins come, a few sannyasins come with children. When they became sannyasins they were already mothers and fathers. Those children are here, but the commune is responsible. We remove the responsibility from father and mother. We make them free, unburdened. Their children are there, th ey can love them, they can live with them, they can go to them, they can call them, but they belong to the commune. If they don't care about their children, th e children are not going to suffer in any way. The children have the whole commune of uncles, aunts, and they go on making friends with different kinds of people. This is a tremendous education and a grea t preparation for a rich life. It is an established fact that the boy loves his mo ther and the girl loves her father. But this kind of love remains only in th e mind. The boy cannot make love to the mother. That is unimaginable. The boy fant asizes but goes on repressing it, feels guilty. The girl feels guilty. You can see sma ll girls flirting with their fathers. It is natural; he is the only man she knows from the very beginning. This is a very significant thing, because the girl becomes impressed with the idea of men according to the image she carries of her father. And the same with the boy: his whole life he will remain frustrated. He will not find the right woman"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"for the simple reason that it is alwa ys his mother that he is looking for, unknowingly, unconsciously. When he falls in love, he cannot say why he has fallen in love with this particular woman, but psychologists know perfectly well. Something in this woman resembles his mother -- perhaps the color of the hair, the style of her dress, the way she walks, the sound of her voice, her eyes, her face, her color -- anything. But something resembles the mother so mu ch that the boy has fallen in love. But the woman soon will not be able to fulfill all the demands that the boy is going to make, that he was making on the mother. And soon he is going to discover that she only walks like his mother, but sh e is not the woman he was seeking, searching. In the commune we destroy this neurosis completely, because the child goes on moving with many aunts, many uncles . And remember, father and mother are later additions to language. Uncle and au nt are far more ancient; because there was a time when there was no family, so everybody of the age of the father was an uncle. Nobody knew exactly who was the father. I would like my commune's children not to be focused on one figure, but to have a rich experience of many women, many men, so they have only a general, vague feeling which can fit with any woman, any man. Q: HOW WERE YOU RAISED? WERE YOU RAISED IN THE SAME WAY? A: No. How I could be raised in the same way? I had to fight for it. I had to struggle for it. I was raised in a family , but the family never thought that I belonged to them, because I never listened to them. In fact I had made it clear that if they want me to do something they should keep quiet. If they say they want me to do it, then I'm not going to do it. Then I will do just the opposite, because I don't want to be ordered in my life, and I don't receive anyone's commandments. I told them, \"If you want to throw me out of the house you can. This is your house. Remember, I am born through you, but I have my own individuality and I have to discover it on my own. Your orders will not help me.\" Soon they became understanding, beca use how long could they fight? And slowly they started understanding what I was saying. Now my mother is a sannyasin. My father, who died a few years ago, died a sannyasin, and before his death he told me, \"We were trying to mold you, we were trying to make you. Forgive us. If we had succeeded, we would have destroyed something beautiful.\" Q: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN THEY FINALLY UNDERSTOOD? A: When I came back from the universi ty, then they had to understand it, because their first thing was to get me m arried -- just the general idea around the world, that if a person is married then hi s wings are cut, he is chained. Then he"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"forgets all about revolutionary ideas, rebellion, those youthful dreams of a better world, better humanity. Just chain him to responsibility. He has a wife who nags him. He has children who are not allowing him to sleep in the night, and he has a job where he never reached in time beca use of those children and the wife. He forgets all about revolution, a new man. So that was their way. They thought that the first thing after I came back from the university was to force me to get married. Q: HOW OLD WERE YOU WH EN YOU STARTED REBELLING? A: I must have been four years old when I started rebelling. Q: FOUR? A: Four. Q: THAT'S YOUNG. A: It is, yes, certainly young, but I was strong enough. I was ev en ready to go and beg on the street, but not to be commanded , and not to be forced to do anything. Q: AT FOUR? A: Four. Q: WAS THERE ANYONE THAT YO U ADMIRED WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP? A: Yes... a few people I admired, but very few people. I admired one of my professors, for the simple reason that he had as much respect towards me as I had for him. When I used to enter his r oom, he would stand up to receive me. I would say, \"This is not right, this is not do ne.\" He said, \"I don't do it for anybody, but somehow, the moment I see you I cannot remain sitting. It feels embarrassing.\" I loved the man. He was a gambler, a drunkard, but a very prominent philosopher. Most of his years he was te aching in America. Only in his old age he had come back home, and that was the time I entered the university. He had just come back from Havana. We fell in love with each other for the simple reason that he had been in rebellion his whole life. His wife, his sons, his daughters were all in New Delhi. He never lived with those people, only on holidays. He made it clear to them th at, \"Too much time with you drives me insane, so I will be coming only on holidays.\""},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"And then he found my ideas... because I wa s continuously arguing in the class. I was not just a silent listener getting re ady for the examinatio n. The examination never meant anything to me. Learning was my purpose. And I said to him that the examination does not matte r, what matters is learning, so I have to argue if I see that something is wrong, that someth ing you are saying is illogical -- and on so many points he found himself wron g. But he was a man of tremendous courage. He accepted that he was wrong and I was right. Slowly, slowly we became more and more close and intimate, so intimate that one day he took all my luggage from the students' hostel to his own house. He said, \"You don't live outside, you live with me.\" I said, \"It will be a little difficult for you. For me it is just beautiful -- so silent a place, and a beautiful bungalow with a beautiful garden -- but for yo u it is going to be difficult.\" And within three days he understood what I meant. After three days he said, \"You were right, because I want to drink, but I cannot drink before you, I feel bad. I want to smoke, but I cannot smoke before you, so in my old age I am hiding in the bathroom and smoking. You have brought my childhood back. When you go to sleep, then I drink. I have to keep my bottles hidden.\" I said, \"I know everything, because when I see ci garettes in the bathroom, and only we two persons are here, it is a simple deduction who is smoking. I am certainly not smoking. And I know that you are drunk; in the morning I see your hangover. So I know where you are hiding your bottles; I have figured it out, because you go to the university every day.\" He was the head of the department of philosophy, and I was a rare visitor. I was a student, but I visited the university very rarely, only to some professors whom I liked. If their period was happening I would go, otherwise I would remain in the house. So I explored the whole ho use and I found out where he had been hiding the bottles. I said, \"Y ou don't do this. Now it is becoming embarrassing to me. Just for me, you have to smoke hiding , you have to drink like a thief. If you cannot smoke before me, and cannot drink before me, I am leaving.\" And you will be surprised: he said, \"No, you don't leave. I will stop smoking, I will stop drinking.\" He threw away all the cigarettes, the best that he had brought from Havana. He poured all the wine that he had brought from outside into the gutter, and he said, \"Nobody has been able to convince me. My doctors were against my smoking because my heart is weak, my lungs are weak. My doctors were against drinking because I ha ve diabetes. But I ne ver cared, I told those people, 'I may live two years less, that does not matter, but I will live in freedom.' You never asked me not to smoke. On the contrary, you told me, 'Smoke in front of me. If you feel too em barrassed, I will start smoking with you. If you feel too guilty drinking, I will share.'\" I loved that man. Only very few people I have found, but I was never impressed by anybody. I have never followed anybod y. I have met remarkable men, but the more remarkable a man was, the more alert I was not to be influenced, because I want to remain myself -- good, bad, famo us, notorious, but I want to be just"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"myself And I have retained my individuality, not even a dent on it. I don't like even a dent on my car. I was born just as everybody is born -- in families -- but with a rebellious mind. And as far back as I remember -- that is four years old -- I started asserting myself, slowly, and then it became absolu te assertion when they asked me to get married. I asked my father, \"Are you sati sfied with your marriage? I have seen you being nagged by my mother every day. You cannot even eat your meals peacefully... I have seen you eating your meals, your eyes down, and the mother continuously hammering you, because that is the only time she gets when you are at home, otherwise you are in the shop . Do you want me also to be harassed by another woman? You think it over.\" I asked my mother, \"Are you happy that you got married? Are you happy that you have eleven children? Your whole life is wasted -- what have you got out of it? -- not even a single moment of peace. So please, before asking me to marry, think for fifteen days, and then, if yo u both say so, I will get married. But remember, I am giving you a great respon sibility... my whole life.\" And that was really a great challenge for them. My father broke down within three days. He said, \"I take my words back. I will never again ask you to marry. I have su ffered much, and I know everybody is suffering.\" My mother took fifteen da ys -- naturally, women are stronger, can resist anything longer than men -- but afte r fifteen days she told me, \"You forget about marriage. Our life is enough proof, and we don't want you to get into the same trap. You be yourself.\" Q: WELL, BHAGWAN, THEN WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT MARRIED; WE KNOW YOU GET TO EAT YOUR MEALS IN PEACE. HOW DO YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR DAY? DO YO U MEDITATE A LOT? DO YOU GET INVOLVED IN ANY KIND OF PHYSIC AL ACTIVITY? WHAT DO YOU DO IN A TYPICAL DAY? A: I do many things. One, I have always loved my bathroom -- the bathtub, the shower. So, one and a half hours in the morning, one and a half hours in the evening, three hours every day, I devote to my bathroom -- that is my temple. Q: WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO IN THE BATHROOM FOR THREE HOURS A DAY? OR SHOULD WE NOT DISCUSS THAT ON VIDEOTAPE? A: Just I enjoy sitting under the shower, lying down in my tub. I change from hot, extreme hot, to extreme cold, freezing water. That is immensely healthful to the body. One and a half hours is not long. It goes so fast because I enjoy it so much. So three hours go into the bathroom."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Two hours, or two and a half hours in th e morning, I talk to my disciples. Then in the night, two hours, just the way I am talking to you, I talk to some journalist, some author. So four or five hours I am talking. Then I enjoy my food. I don't like to ta lk even, because whatever I am doing, I want to do it totally. When I am eating , then I just want to eat and relish every bite to the fullest. So one hour or on e and a half hours -- because I take two meals, lunch and supper -- and then I take, before I go to sleep in the night, my whole life I have taken some special s weets which are made only in Bengal, India. So in all, one and a half hours goes to my food. Two hours I sleep in the day. I have na pped as long as I can remember, and I love to sleep because to me sleep is just meditation, as pure and as simple and as relaxing. And whatever time remains in the night, I go to bed at about ten or eleven, it depends on the interview. I wa ke up at six in the morning. I love sleeping on a king size bed -- I love big things! (LAUGHTER) Q: WHAT DO YOU DO FOR FUN? WH AT DO YOU DO FOR RECREATION? A: I go for a one-hour drive in one of the ninety Rolls Royces. Q: IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR TO SELECT ONE OUT OF NINETY, I IMAGINE.... A: So, one hour after my sleep in the af ternoon -- I wake up at two -- I go for a drive. My people have made a special ro ad for me. Perhaps I am the only man in the whole world who has a special road with out any traffic. It is used only for one hour in twenty-four hours. I love driving, I have always loved it. Then whatsoever time is left, I am sitting in my chair. I use only one type of chair -- this is the type -- I have many chairs of the same type, so wherever I am, I am in the same type of chair. I have designed it myself, and I have not found any other chair more comfortable than it is. Th en I simply relax with closed eyes. You can call it meditation. I cannot call it medi tation because to me meditation is now my very nature. Not that I am doing anythin g, I am just sitting with closed eyes, no ideas floating in my mind. Just utter silence. My life is simple in a way, no complexity ; in a way a very strict routine, too. Every day at the same time in the mornin g I wake up, every day at the same time in the morning I talk to my people -- and that's how I go around the clock. Q: DO YOU EVER GET BORED OR TIRED OF ROUTINE? A: Never. For thirty-two years I have no t experienced boredom. And I don't see any hope that in the future I will have to experience boredom, because I am never comparing. The same bath, the same bubbles, the same pine fragrance... but it is the same only if you compare with your yesterdays. I never compare anything with my yesterdays."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"I can eat the same food for years. The sannyasins who cook my food -- they get bored cooking the same thing, they want to change. But if I like something, I simply like it, and I like it every day. The same thing for years creates no boredom in me because there is no comp arison. It is always fresh, and I am always excited. You can ask Vivek, she is here. She brings my food, she takes care of my clothes, my bed, my whole routine, that it goes exactly right. She asks again and again, \"We can change to some other sweet....\" I say, \"Wait. If I feel bored sometime, I will tell you.\" But I never feel bored. If sometimes I change anything in my food, it is for her sake, because she is getting so bored. And I am eating -- she is simply bringing the plate. She is getting bore d carrying the plate, it is human -- so change it. Q: HOW IS YOUR HEALTH? YOU SEEM TO BE LOOKING VERY WELL. A: My health is very good and getting be tter. Oregon, its dry climate, its hostile people, all have been tremendously helpful. I am feeling very good. Q: WELL, THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I REALLY HAVE -- UNLESS THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WO ULD LIKE TO ADD. IS THERE A MESSAGE, ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY? A: I would like to say that Oregon is so beautiful that the people who live in Oregon should not behave in ugly ways. It is an insult to this beautiful land. If you have such a beautiful land, it needs and deserves beautiful people, too. So tell the people that I would like them all to come and visit this place, and see that there is a different way of living, too, without hostility, without antagonism, without hatred, without crime. In four years' time, no crime has happened in this commune, no woman has been raped, nobody has been murdered, nobody has committed suicide. People are so happy and relaxed and rejoicing, who wants to die? And who wants to waste time quarreling, fighting, ki lling? Who wants to steal? Their very blissfulness prevents them from everything the world is full of. My people work hard, but they call it wo rship. It is worship. Working on the farm, digging the earth, if you are sensit ive enough you will feel it as worship. And if you feel it as worship, you will no t get tired. They work ten hours, twelve hours, whatever is the need -- it is their responsibility -- and still nobody is complaining. Nobody is saying that this is too much. And these are not average, common people . There are Ph.D.s, D.Litt.s, almost everybody is highly educated. Doctors are there, professors are there, engineers are there, architects are there, legal experts are there. Perhaps we have the biggest legal firm in the world: four hundred sannyasins are legal experts. Everybody is doing, but nobody is being coerced to do anything."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"So tell the Oregonians: I love this land and I am not going to leave this place.

Q: IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED, WOULD YOU PERHAPS NOT FEEL THREATENED IF OREGON WERE YOURS AND A SMALL UNKNOWN GROUP CAME IN, WOULD YOU NOT MAYBE FEEL THREATENED? A: No. We don't feel threatened even when we are a small group. So it is unimaginable that we own the whole Oregon and a small group is there, and we feel threatened. We will enjoy that group, we will absorb that group. We will not leave it alone, we will not be hostile to it. They will be our guests. And it is beautiful to have different kind s of people, strangers. It gives richness. It is simply ugly that the same type of people, the same churches, the same Bible... it makes life dull. I would like any small group, there is no question of being threatened. One feels threatened because one feels one is not happy where he is, what he is, and these people are happy. Their dance is threatening. Otherwise, such a small commune... what is the fear? But just a few days ago, a secret docume nt has been discovered and it has been on television. The governor and all the bi g officials, the secretary of state, the attorney general, the head of the police and all the government agencies had a secret meeting. And the governor lied. Be cause they did not allow any journalists in.... This is ugly: in a democracy why should they try to hide things from people? They did not allow any journalists, and the governor said, \"I will have a press conference after the meeting\" -- and he li ed in the meeting. Everything he said was a lie. Now that secret document has been foun d. He had the idea that it had been destroyed -- perhaps he had ordered it to be burned, but somehow it was not burned and somebody discovered it. The document says that in that secret meeting they decided that the army should be put on alert, against us; that the military should be ready. At any notice, within three hours they have to reach Rajneeshpuram. So it is not a few Oregonians who are threatened.... I am simply amused at the foolishness of this man, Governor Atiyeh . We are not a nation, we don't have an army. You can simply throw a few bombs on the commune and finish it. Just one airplane bringing half a dozen bombs -- small, old fashioned bombs -- and that will do. You don't need an atom bomb. It is not Hiroshima -- Hiroshima was big -"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"- it is not Nagasaki. And there is no need to waste so much money. You can bring just any old-fashioned, out-of-d ate bombs and just finish us. But remember, while your bombs will be falling on us, we will be dancing and singing. We will celebrate it. We cele brate everything. We are celebrants. Q: HOW OLD ARE YOU? A: I am ancient. Q: COULD YOU BE A BIT MORE SPECIFIC? A: Very ancient. You can see in me, in my eyes... you will see the whole past of humanity. I am as old as existence itself -- because I have alwa ys been here. I am part, just as you are part, of this existe nce. And I have been in so many bodies that now I cannot get identified with an y body. When you have to change so many trains, you are bound to feel that no train is yours; at the coming junction again you have to change the train. In this body I have been fifty-four years. But in fifty-four years I have lived a life which is not possible to live even in tw o hundred years. I have lived intensely, totally. Whatever I have been doing at whatever time, I was doing it with my whole heart, as if the next moment is death. Q: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH? TH AT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. YOU WILL COME BACK IN ANOTHER BODY? A: No.... No more. This time is the last time. I have been coming into bodies again and again, but this time it is the last time. After enlightenment, you cannot come back to the body. That is the only disadvantage. Q: WHEN DID YOU BECOME ENLIGHTE NED? HOW OLD WERE YOU? WAS IT THIS LIFE FOR YOU? A: Yes. When I was twenty-one years old. Q: WHAT ABOUT OTHERS? WHAT ABOUT THE SANNYASINS: WHEN THEY DIE, WHEN THEY LEAVE THIS LIFE, WILL THEY COME BACK AS HUMANS? A: A few will not come. A few are bound to come. It all depends on them. If they die unenlightened, they will have to come back. This is an existential condition, that existence sends you back again and again and again unless you have passed the examination. Enlightenment is the exam ination.

Q: SO THEN, IS THE ULTIMATE EX PERIENCE TO BECOME ENLIGHTENED, SO THAT WHEN YOU DO LEAVE THIS LIFE YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO CARRY AROUND THE PRISON OF YOUR BODY? A: Right. Q: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

WHY IS THE UNITED STATES -- A COUNTRY THAT PRIDES ITSELF AS A LAND OF FREEDOM -- SUCH A VIOLENT PLACE? IS THERE A RELATION BETWEEN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA AND ITS SO-CALLED FREEDOM? ANSWER: Violence in America has deep r oots. It is the only continent in the world which is being ruled by foreigners. The native red Indians, to whom this continent belongs, are almost finished ; and the people who think they are Americans, none of them are American. They have all come from other countries, invaded the poor country, invaded the poor innocent natives. The roots of violence are there. The people who had come into power over this continent through violence have remained in power through violence. Unle ss the continent is given back to its people, this violence is going to remain. It is a strange phenomenon that the fo reigners who are ruling the country are trying to prevent others from living here. We are not trying to rule the country. We are not invaders. They are trying to call us foreigners just because they came here three or four generations ago. Time makes no difference. They are all foreigners. We not rulers. We have no t invaded the country. We have not killed its people. We have not destroyed its people's integrity and spirit. We have purchased the land and we have purchased it for the ri ght price. Do you know how much the invaders paid the red Indians for the wh ole of New York City? -- thirty dollars. The whole of New York was purchased for thirty dollars. This is not purchasing, this is cheating innocent people. The people who came in the early days of America were really criminals. They were thrown out of their countries, expelled. Those criminals became presidents, became chief justices of the Supreme Co urt. They were expelled from their own"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"countries for crimes which were so big th at the countries coul d not tolerate them. They would either kill them or throw them out. Then people from Africa were forced, bribed, persuaded and given great promises, hopes that they were going to a rich world where they would receive all the facilities. What they found here was that they were sold in the marketplace just like cattle. Slavery had disappeared from the whole world, and it appeared just three centuries ago in America. And the slaves, although no longer called slaves, still are not first-class citizens. This continent is based on violence. It ha s repressed the red Indians in such ugly ways... it is difficult to imagine what ma n can do to man. Red Indians are living almost in concentration camps. Of co urse, they are not called concentration camps. They are called reservations, especially reserved for red Indians. Why should red Indians not be allowed to mix in society? It is their land. They have lived here for thousands of years, bu t now they are confined to forests and mountains, on reservations, and they are being given pensions. On the surface it look humanitarian, as if we are ruling over their continent and we are paying them. For generations we have been paying them but to pay them salaries for no work is not humanitarian. What will they do with that money? They will get drunk; they will take drugs. They will gamble; they will fight, kill each other. What else do they have to do? Money comes without any effort. They will go on creating more and more children because with each child comes more money. To give people money without work is to reduce them into dr unkards, gamblers, murderers. You have taken their dignity. On the surface everything looks so whitewashed, clean. It can be claimed that you are giving them money because you are using their land. But the real purpose is to keep them drunk, fighting , gambling, rowdy, and to keep them in such a state that they never again think of being free, that they never think of getting rid of all the invaders of this continent. The whole society is interwoven wi th violence. The black people are downtrodden. There are thousands of peop le on the streets wi th no home. What do you expect them to do? They will do every kind of crime, they have nothing to lose. And America goes on pretending to the whole world, that wherever there is any trouble, we are going to help. You can't help your own people. Twenty-five percent of Americans who are able to work are unemployed, and America goes to help Ethiopia! In America, Ethiopia is spread everywhere -- just thinly, but it is there -- and violence will come out. These people who have lost everything, respect, humanity, integrity, they have been treated like animals. You cannot expect the country to live without violence. Basically, America is one of the greatest destructive powers in the world. The whole government is working with only one object, to win the third world war. But they are simply fools, because nobody can win the third world war, neither"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"the Soviet Union nor Americ a. The difference may be at the most ten minutes. Whoever attacks first, it will take only ten minutes for the other party to attack back. Nuclear weapons are ready on both sides, so it is not a question of somebody getting defeated and somebody el se becoming victorious. It is simply suicidal. Both will be destroyed, and with them all life on earth will be destroyed. If your great leaders, political, religious and others, are bent upon having a third world war, if all your scientific and military efforts are just ai med at one point -- how to destroy the Soviet Union and ho w to destroy communism in the world -- who are you to take responsibility for th e whole world? Who are you to decide that the Soviet Union should not be comm unist? It is none of your business. Your government is utterly violent. The whole structure of society is violent. There are the superrich and there are the su per-poor in this country. The distance between the rich and the poor is too big. Naturally, the poor man becomes violent -- he is angry. Your priests and bishops go on teaching the poor to be contented, but how long do you th ink you can keep them contented? Now old strategies won't work. You have used this strategy for thousands of years in the whole world, but it is not going to work in America. It is a new country. It has only three hundred years ' civilization, which is nothing compared to countries like China or India with histories of thousands of years. This country is new and its poor have seen clearly that they have been exploited. In India they have never s een it clearly -- they have been exploited for thousands of years. They don't remember any time when there was not poverty. They have accepted poverty as the law of nature, the will of God. But you cannot deceive the American poor. He has seen with his own eyes that those who were cunning and clever have exploited him and become rich. He has seen people who were criminals becoming rich; and he has seen simple, innocent people who were not criminals becoming poor. You cannot deceive the American poor. You cannot tell him that he is suffering from his past lives' actions, because he knows perfectly we ll that he is suffering from other Americans and their actions. In such a small period of history -- thr ee hundred years -- things are very crystal clear. They had all come to America. They were all equal. Nobody was rich, nobody was poor. Then, suddenly, a few people started becoming richer and richer and richer, the riches t in the world, and a few people started falling down. They have seen with their own eyes ho w one becomes rich. It is not by right means. It is by exploiting, by cunning, by every kind of means -- good or bad does not matter. The American poor have a very different attitude from the poor in any other country, because all those countries are ve ry ancient. They don't remember their beginnings; they don't know what happened in the beginning so that a few people became poor and a few people beca me rich. They think it has always been so. But the American poor have a uniq ue situation. They know what has happened. They cannot forgive it. They cannot forget it. That brings violence."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Violence is the religion of America. And America is despised and condemned all over the world -- even those countries receiving American help are not sympathetic towards America. I know it. In India you will not find a single person who is sympathetic towards America. And America has been helping: whenever there is a famine or floods or no rain for years, and people are dying, America is always ready to help. But American help does not create sympathy for America. On the contrary, it offends, because they know what you are doing to your own poor. Why are you helping others when you yo urself are not doing anything for your own downtrodden? It is not compassion th at you go on helping Ethiopia, India, wherever there is poverty and sickness. It is an effort to make ground for your armies, for your nuclear weapons. All thos e countries understand perfectly that this is simply business, not help. America is the most condemned country in the whole world. America has no friends anywhere, for the simple reason that it is the most destructive power today. When your whole government and the energy of the people and the intelligence of your scientists are moving in only one direction -- destruction -- how can you avoid violence? There is only one way, which is really difficult. Give the country back to its native people. If they want you to rema in here, you can remain here, but you will have to remain on reservations. If you do n't want to live here, that is far better. Just go back to your own countries. Somebody is from England, somebody is from Spain, somebody is from Portugal, somebody is from France, somebo dy is from Italy, somebody is from Greece. The whole of Europe has to accept the responsibility to take these people back. Give the country to its own people. If they allow you to live here, you live, but you live under their rule, and vi olence will disappear. I don't think red Indians can even imagine about nuclear war. When you are in power, and you are the gr eatest power in the world, you are not going to be human, considerate. So it is not a simple phenomenon, it is very complicated, and the violence has many aspects. In America, more rapes happen than anywhere else. Strange. In a countr y which is educated, rich, why should there be so many rapes? It is because your priests go on talking stupidities to the people. They go on talking about monogamy , they go on saying that if you are not married any sexual relationship is sin. I wonder how a marriage license transforms a sin into a virtue? Just a license, a piece of paper, signed by a judge who ma y be committing adultery himself. In fact, sometimes I wonder from where this word adultery comes. It looks so simple -- any adult must be capable of it ; the moment you are capable of adultery you must be an adult. What other meanin g can it have? From where can it come? American women still are not free. Protests go on happening in the name of liberation, but the woman is not free, not equal. The woman is angry, and her anger is turning into a perversion. Th e American woman is educated enough."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"You cannot keep her repressed like the women of the East, of Arabia, who are uneducated, not knowing anything abou t the world. The American woman is educated. If you want her to be a depe ndent partner in a marriage, she would rather move into lesbianism than become a slave of man. In America there are more lesbians than in any other coun try, and naturally, when women become lesbians, men start becoming homosexuals. These are all different shapes of violen ce. Your priests are responsible, your politicians are responsible. Do you know what happened in Vietnam? You forced your young people to fight there without understanding the fact that they are not soldiers as they exist in other countries. They were educated, highly qualified, and you forced them to kill innocent, poor Vietnamese for no reason. Who are you to interfere in the whole world? You want to put your nose in everywhere? It is Vietnam's decision whet her it wants to be communist or not. And what happened there? Thirty percent of the American soldiers did not kill anybody. They could see that this Ame rican violence was absolutely ugly, uncalled for. They could see that the poor Vietnamese have difficulty to arrange even two meals every day and you are bo mbing them, destroying their houses, burning their houses. Many American soldiers went insane for th e simple reason that they could not believe that this was what their coun try stands for. Many of the American soldiers had to be treated psychologica lly when they came back home from Vietnam; they were so much disturbed they had to be rehabilitated psychologically. They were not like other countries' soldiers -- uneducated, unaware of what is going on -- who wh en they come home, come with great pride. The American soldiers came back home with guilt and, you may or may not know, many who were in Vietnam ha ve never moved back into American society. They are hiding in jungles an d mountains, in Alaska, living a very primitive life. Many of them have been approached by their families and friends to come back home. They said, \"We are finished with home, country, nation, flag, American Constitution, democracy, all that nonsense . Just leave us alone. We would like to live here in complete isolation. At leas t we will not feel guilty. We will not be forced to do something violent, unnecess arily. Back home, they're going to put us back into the army, prepare us again for the third world war. We are not going.\" There are hundreds of young America n men who were professors, doctors, engineers, living in the forest like primitiv e people, in caves. They don't want to come back to America for the simple reas on that this whole society is basically wrong. It is based in violence. Twenty pe rcent of American presidents have been murdered. This is a record! In no othe r country has this happened. Once in a while a person may be murdered, but no t twenty percent of the presidents. And if the president is so much unprotecte d -- remember, the American president is the most protected man in the world -- if the most protected man in the world"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"can be killed by his own people, who else can be at ease? Even the president is not at ease. Every moment, violence! It is not something superficial. If we want to change the violent structure of America, there are three things to be done . One, the country should be ruled by its native people. It belongs to them. An ybody who wants to remain here should remain here, but he cannot remain here as a ruler. Secondly, America should stop bothering about other countries' poor peop le. It should help its own poor people. Thirdly, America should stop piling up nuclear weapons. They are pointless, and so costly, so meaningless. You already ha ve enough to destroy the whole world, what more do you want? America should declare, \"We drop the wh ole idea of war. We destroy all our nuclear weapons. We drown all those weapo ns in the Pacific, in the Atlantic. We're finished with it.\" America should declare, \"We will not have any defense department any more -- it is just pointless.\" If America can do that, its people can be immensely rich, happy. And people who are happy do not do violence. It is out of misery, suffering, anger, that violence comes. When you are comforta ble, happy, at home, and all that you need is available to you, you don't wa nt to be violent -- because your being violent will destroy your cozy home, your beautiful surroundings, your love life. Your children, your wife, your parents will be lost. It is the people who have nothing to lose who become violent. An d one cannot say to them, \"Don't be violent.\" I, personally, cannot say to them, \"Don't be violent.\" On what grounds can I say it? They have been cheated of all that a man needs, and if they are revengeful, it seems logical. America should take c are of itself Then unemployment is impossible, everybody can be comfortably rich. You just have to stop piling up nuclear weapons, and you can make this country actually, literally a new world by declaring that you are not going to defend. Defense is meaningless. Even with all your nuclear weapons you can be destroyed, so what is the point of having all those nuclear weapons? It is a very strange fact that in the past weapons were significant; now they are not, but idiotic politicians go on following past po licies of politics. They don't understand that the whole thing has changed. Only a nation which is not burdened by the past can become the first nation in the world to declare, \"We are no longer a separate entity. We are open and available to the whole world. We declare that we are not enemies to anybody. We declare friendship to be our basic po licy, and we are ready to lose everything rather than be violent.\" If these three things can be done, it wo n't harm America in any way. It would give America prestige, pride. America wo uld gain sympathy from all over the world. America would become the beginning of the new world. Other nations would follow just as they are following America now. They are starting to make nuclear plants, atomic plants; if Ameri ca stops it, they will stop it too."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"And the whole world now has become free. The British Empire has disappeared. Only America has not been capable of freei ng the people who are the real owners of this country. Give it back to them. You have reduced them to such a situation that they cannot even struggle for freedom . They are doped, drugged. They are almost asleep. They cannot fight for freed om, they don't know what freedom is. And they don't want it either, because this is going so well: no work, and money is available; no work, and alcohol is available; no work, and all drugs are available. Even those drugs which are prohibited to other people are available to the red Indians, to destroy th em, to destroy their spirit. I say these three things: the land has to go back to the real owners -- those who are capable of living here under the red Indians as rulers can remain, otherwise they should go back to their own countr y; America has to stop all interference with other countries, and put its whole energy into changing the conditions of the poor, of the blacks, of the women; and third, it has to drop the very idea of war, to become the first country in the hi story of the world to drop war, defense departments, armies, to become a precedent -- for others to follow.... I am perfectly convinced that if America can do that, soon other countries would have to follow, would certainly follow, be cause they are also suffering. Under the pressure of war effort, their whole econ omies are going down and down. But out of fear they cannot stop creating more weapons. These simple things just need a little understanding, and America can open a new dimension for the whole of humanity. Q: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE SAID THERE IS NO GOD, ONLY GODLINESS; AND THERE IS NO RELIGION, ONLY R ELIGIOUSNESS. IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A MASTER, OR IS IT MASTERLINESS? PLEASE EXPLAIN. A: There is no such thing as a Master, but there is certainly something you can call masterliness. Everybody cannot manage -- even all the people who have become enlightened have not been Masters. To be a Master, different qualities are needed than just enlightenment. You can become enlightened and perhaps nobody will ever know about it. To give the message you have got, you need to be articulate, immensely articulate, because you are going to do something which is almost impossible -- you are going to transform the experience of silence, wordlessness, into words. You have to be a charismatic persona lity so that people are automatically attracted towards you. No need for advert isement: mouth to mouth, people start hearing about you, that something i mmense has happened to a man... and not only that, the man is capabl e in some strange way to re late it to you. Through words, through silence, just by his presen ce, just by looking into your eyes, just holding your hand, something transpir es. Something starts happening to you which you have never thought about, never dreamed about."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Yes, there is a certain quality which make s a man a Master. But I say that there is no need of a Master because people in th eir ignorance, in thei r unconscious state, start becoming dependent on the Master. He becomes a father figure, and that is where everything goes wrong. He himsel f unknowingly destroys what he is doing. I am here with you, and I say that I am not your Master and you are not my follower -- and you know perfectly well, I know perfectly well, that I am your Master and you are my follower. But I go on insisting that you are not my follower and I am not your Master -- you are my fellow travelers -- just so that you don't become dependent on me, just so that you don't start thinking it is my responsibility; you need not be worried: the Master is there, he will take care, he is the savior. He will save you, you need not do anything.... No, I want you to be responsible. I want you to take all your responsibility on yourself. I can impart whatsoever has happ ened to me, and it is no obligation to you. I am not obliging you; I am simply enjoying sharing. To have enlightenment is tremendous bli ss, but it is nothing compared to sharing it. When one starts seeing the same flame in thousands of eyes, the same luster and glory around thousands of faces, no enlightenment can be compared to it. It transcends all bliss that you have kn own in enlightenment. That was an individual affair, small; a window had opened and you had looked through the window. The sky, the stars... but the frame of the window was there. Your experience was framed. You have never been out of the house, so naturally you will deduce that this is the sky -- the frame of your window. Yes, you are seeing real stars and the real sky, but you are confined, limited. Your window is giving a frame to your experience. If you want to share with others, you will have to come out, you w ill have to seek people with whom you can share. You will have to go and knock on many doors to find people who are almost ready to receive it. And when you go out of the house searching for seekers and disciples, then you know th e whole sky, the infinity of it, the unlimited number of stars. Now you know that sky you had seen was framed. There is no frame, there is no boundary to existence. Sharing your enlightenment, you come to know there is no boundary to en lightenment, either. It is not yours or mine, it is existential. This I call transcendence of enlighten ment. This is the moment when the enlightened person becomes ordinary: he has transcended even that speciality of being enlightened. Now he is at ease with himself and his ordinariness. But this ordinariness has an immense impact of its own, it has the charisma I am talking about. It makes the man a magnetic force. He becomes the very center of the whole existence, and all those who are in search -- even groping in darkness - - start moving towards him. But don't give it a frame. When you call it a Master, you have given it a frame. Let it remain a quality -- masterliness. There is no God, there is godliness. There is no religion, there is religiousness. There is no Master, there is only mast ery, masterliness. And as the Master"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"becomes a quality, immediately the discipl e becomes a quality. Then there is no disciple, only discipleship. Discipleship is a totally different thing. Disciplehood, or to come to the exact right word, discipline. The word disci pline means learning, the process of learning. There is no disciple, no learn er, but there is a process of learning. There is no Master who teaches you, but there is a Master -- being who shares that which he has found. And his treasure is infinite, inexhaustible. Q: BHAGWAN, IN THE PAST , MONARCHS, STATESMEN AND POLITICIANS ALWAYS LOOKED TOWARD THE WISE ENLIGHTENED MEN FOR THEIR ADVICE IN AFFAIRS OF STATE. WOULD IT BE A BOON TO MANKIND IF RONALD REAGAN SO UGHT YOUR ADVICE? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM? A: In the first place, the politicians of to day are not so wise as some emperors in the past have been. The emperor was bo rn, so sometimes there were idiots who became emperors, mad, crazy people wh o became emperors. Once in a while, there was a person who was wise enough and yet became an emperor. Augustus in Rome and Ashoka in India were such emperors. They went to seek advice. They knew there were people who kn ew much more; they knew there were people whose word is truth. But today's presidents and prime ministers are going to be just third-rate cunning politicians. It is impossible for a wise man to become the president of a country, for the simple reason that he is wise. He cannot lie, he cannot give you promises which he knows can never be fulfilled. He will tell you things which will hurt you. Just think of me: in the first place I cannot run for the presidency of a coun try, because I don't like running. I can drive in my Rolls Royce, so my campaign for the presidency will not be running for president, but driving for president. My whole life I have been practicing a certain art: how to influence people and create enemies. This is not a way to become a president or a prime minister. No wise man can even think of it, because he cannot fulfill the basic conditions of a politician. And you are asking me that if a president -- for example, Ronald Reagan -- came here for my advice, would I give it to him? Of course. If I can give advice to you all, why can't I give advice to Ronald Reagan? But he will have to come not as a president, but as a disciple, because unle ss you come to learn, I cannot teach you. If he comes as a president, he cannot ge t an appointment from Sheela; but if he comes just as a human being he is welco me. Any politician from any country is welcome, but he should come just as a human being; otherwise it is useless, wasting my time and wasting his time. So from my side, I am clear. But your qu estion is only \"if\" -- you should not forget. No president is going to come. No president has the guts to come. It is my"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"whole life's experience, I am not just sa ying something without any support from my experience. I knew Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, personally. He was a man of great aesthetic, poetic qualities, but still he had not the guts to accept my advice. He said, \"You are right, but you don't kn ow this dirty politics. If I start doing things the way you are suggesting, I will simply lose my premiership. I will not be able to do what you are saying -- I will just lose my power, my prestige. I will look crazy. And I say to you that what you are saying is right.\" His successor, Lalbahadur Shastri, was immensely interested in me. He died with one of my books on his chest. He was reading it and must have fallen asleep, had a heart attack, and died. He was in Tashkent, Russia, for a summit meeting -- the American and Russian presid ents, the Pakistani president, and he. These four were there to settle matters ab out Kashmir, because a part of Kashmir was occupied by Pakistan. Pakistan's army had been standing ready there for almost for ty years. The Indian army was ready -- confronting Pakistan's army for forty years. And the UNO's representative army was just standing in between at the cease-fire line. Now, how long is it going to be there, this ceas e-fire line? Forty years is too long a time. They had gone to settle it, but Shastri died. He lived just to be the prime minister fo r one year. He was very simple in a way, and it was by chance that he was chos en prime minister. No one could have thought that he could win the race, bu t in the political game it sometimes happens. He was the most unexpected candidate. The commanding, ruling party of the co untry was very much afraid of Morarji Desai because he was the most stubborn type of person. Once he became the prime minister, he would not care a bit about the committee who had chosen him. The committee was afraid to choose hi m for the simple reason that they knew that man. Once he had power in hi s hands, he wouldn't care even about those who had given him power. So on the one side was Morarji Desai, on the other side was Indira Gandhi. They were afraid to choose Indira Gandhi beca use in the whole political atmosphere there was the idea that India is not a de mocracy, but a monarchy. Jawaharlal was the first prime minister; now his daughter will be the second prime minister. They wanted to avoid Indira, because turnin g it into a family affair would bring condemnation to all of them and wo uld make the opposite parties more powerful. And certainly it has turned into a family affair. After Indira, her son became the prime minister. For forty years one family has been ruling, except for that one year when Lalbahadur was chosen. He was chosen because he was a very simple and weak person. The committee knew perfectly well that even if he were the prime minister, they would remain"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"the masters, the kingmakers. He would be only a puppet. Whatever they wanted, he would do. Morarji Desai could not be chosen. He want ed to be chosen; he was forcing the committee -- \"I am the most experienced, the most senior person, why are you not choosing me?\" Against him was standing Indira Gandhi. She had her reasons: she had lived with her father, she had seen the whole freedom struggle, its problems. She had seen the beginnings of the independence of India, its complexities, its problems. She knew every in and out of all the politicians of the country. Nobody else had such knowledge. She claimed that Morarji Desai might be senior, but that he knew nothing about all the chief ministers of the states, all the governors. He knew nothing. She had all the files of her father and his whole experience, and she had been living with him. She knew everybody -- who was dependable, who was not, who was reliable, who was not, who was certain to betray the country. Both had their claims, but the committee persuaded Lalbahadur. He was a very small-sized man, and he was very afraid: \"Forgive me, I cannot manage, I am a simple man....\" He had never been in the pu blic eye, he was not a national figure. Just because Jawaharlal loved him for his sincerity, truthfulness, reliability, he was in the supreme commanding committee of the ruling party. Jawaharlal had put him there. The committee unanimously chose Lalbahadur. It sometimes happens.... He was very available to me, but even he was no t courageous enough to come to see me. He managed a lunch, in a political way, in the house of one of his cabinet ministers. This man, Karan Singh, was interested in me -- he was the king of Kashmir, and because Kashmir became dissolved into In dia, he was immediately taken into the cabinet. Naturally he had to be given something; he was the first to join India and give his whole country to the union. He was very much interested in me, so Lalbahadur said, \"This would be good. Yo u call him and me for lunch, so just casually we meet and discuss. My going to him will be dangerous to my career.\" And he confessed it to me that this is how diplomacy works. Nobody knows -- just a casual, accidental meeting. And befo re lunch, after lunch, for almost three hours he was listening to me about every problem that he was facing. But I told him it would be good if he ca me to my place and lived a few days with me. Everything could be cleared. He said, \"That is impossible. If people come to know that I have gone to you for advice, I am finished. You have so many enemies in the country, in my party, in my cabinet, that I cannot take that risk. And I am simply a weak manI have been chosen for my weakness.\" But he was sincere. Indira, the third prime minister of India, was very much interested in me, but not courageous enough to come to Poona. She was continuously telling Laxmi, \"I want to see Bhagwan, I want to come. An d next time when I come to Bombay or anywhere nearby, I am going to come to the ashram."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"And she came twice to Poona itself, but she never could gather courage to come to the ashram. Political fear.... Just to be associated with a man like me needs courage, because all those who are my enemies will become your enemies. And all those who are your friends may stop being your friends just because you are associated with me. The last time she came to Poona, she told Laxmi, \"This time, whatsoever happens I am going to manage and come.\" But when Laxmi went to see her, she said, \"There are so many engagements, I cannot find time.\" And this was a lie -- because she went to Kohlapur, four hours driving, to meet the shankaracharya, the head of the Hind us, like the pope is the head of the Catholics. She found time to go to the shankaracharya -- four hours going, four hours coming, and just two minutes to to uch the feet of the shankaracharya. But that was politically helpful. Thousands of Hindus had gathered for the shankaracharya. He was an old man from th e south, very much respected by the Hindus because he was absolutely fulfilling all their demands of how a religious person should be. He was an ascetic, a masochist -- those were the qualities that Hindus were asking. Intelligence has never been asked. Scholarship, yes -- he could recite Hindu scriptures without re ading; he knew them by rote. He was very much respected and he was very old, eighty or eighty-five. Now Indira lied that she had no time; but the reality is that she had no courage -- even to meet the person who was the on ly one who supported her when she was defeated and lost her premiership. The whole country was against her, it was a tremendous defeat, and when she stood in a by-election, I was the only man to bless her. No shankaracharya blessed her, not even Vinoba Bhave, who was her political guru, blessed her. Now they were afraid that to bless her means to lose many friends. She went to the shankaracharya again to get his blessings. He did not speak a word. She was told that he had taken silence for the day. This was simple diplomacy: if he has taken silence, good ; when she touches his feet he can bless her with the hand -- that is not breaking your silence. But no, he remained sitting just like a statue -- because it was a pr oblem for him too. If he blessed Indira, then all the Hindus who were against Indira would be against him. It is a simple rule. The enemy of your enemy is your friend. So I would like to say to you that your qu estion is only if. Ronald Reagan cannot come, cannot have the courage. But from my side I have no ifs, no buts. If he wants to come, he is welcome; but he has to remember that here he is not the president, that he has come here to seek advice, to learn something. He has to be here like a disciple. If that much humble ness is there, then certainly my advice can reach to his heart. Otherwise, it is meaningless. Okay?

THEY ARE TRYING HARD TO SEE YOU AS ANOTHER HITLER. WHAT DOES THAT TELL ABOUT THE GERMAN MIND, FORTY YEARS AFTER HITLER'S DEATH? Answer: The ghost of Adolf Hitler, his long shadow, is still present. And Adolf Hitler is not something that you can conf ine to one person. It is something deep down in the German mind itself. Adolf Hitler would not have existed if the German mind had not been supportive of him. And not only ordinary people -- who can be easily influenced, impre ssed -- but many exceptional people: geniuses like Heidegger, who is certainly the most important philosopher of the twentieth century, he was a follower of Adolf Hitler. What these people were seeing in Adol f Hitler was something that was in themselves. In Adolf Hitler it was magnifie d. In themselves they could not see it, but Adolf Hitler became the mirror; th ey could see it, and he became the representative of the collective uncon scious mind of Germany. Hence, the influence that he had. Although forty years have passed, the Ge rman mind is still the same.

All they know is that thousands of young Ge rmans are ready to die for me. To their knowledge, this phenomenon had happened only with Adolf Hitler. In the same way, thousands and thousands of people were ready to die for him, to do anything for him. So they see a certain simi larity. But there is no similarity at all.

And certainly millions have died for idiots. They died, they killed, all kinds of neurosis was released by these so-called leaders. I am not a leader. I am not a politician. I in sist to my people to live long, to live happily, to rejoice. Even if I die, celebrat e it. Nobody has ever said to his people, \"When I die you rejoice and celebrate, sing and dance.\" In thousands of years not a single man has been there to say this. They were just saying, \"Be ready. If you love me, be ready to die for me, becaus e we are going to conquer lands, conquer the whole world. If you are not ready to die for me, you are a coward, and then how are you going to conquer the world?\" I have a different way of conquering th e world. I don't need nuclear weapons, atom bombs. I have a different approach totally. And they have all failed. None of them could conquer the whole worl d, neither Alexander the Great, nor Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mussolini, nor Mao Tse-tung. They all have, without exception, failed, because this is not the way to conquer. Hate is not the way to conquer. It will destroy the other, and in consequence it will destroy you too. Your victory is going to be just a very passing phase. I say to my people: Yes, we are going to take over the world -- by our rejoicing, by our love, by our peace, serenity, by our meditation. We are not politicians. We are not going to rule them. In fact, we are going to teach everybody not to be ruled by anyone and not to rule anyone. Only then are you really an authentic human being. My influence on German people is exac tly the opposite of Adolf Hitler's. But influence is there, and those who don't know me can find a certain similarity. Those who know will find that the influence is there, in fact it is far greater than Adolf Hitler's. And it is not me who is saying it. One of the most important Western journalists, author of many significant books, Aubrey Menen, wrote a book almost ten years ago about the new mystics. He put my picture on the cover. The book was published by Thames and Hu dson in London. What he said inside, even I could not believe. He said, \"I have seen Adolf Hitler, interviewed Adolf Hitler, I have listened to Adolf Hitler in a meeting sittin g in the front row, and I have seen his tremendous influence on people, but it is nothing compared to Bhagwan.\" His influence, he says, was only that of orat ory, there was no substance in it. Those people were enchanted because their egos were fulfilled. He was saying to those people that you are the highest race am ongst human beings. You are the purest Nordic Aryans. It is your birthrig ht to rule all over the world. Naturally, all those who had ambitions, eg o trips, were influenced. Here is a man who can manage to fulfill their hidden desire. They themselves, of course, cannot manage, it is too big. Aubrey Menen says that people were influenced, but that influence was something sick. It was fulfilling their egos. The people who are influenced by me are totally different. I am making every effort to destroy your ego. And to dest roy the German ego is the hardest thing!"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"In fact the intelligent, German, young ge neration is influenced by me against Adolf Hitler and against any possibility of Adolf Hitler ever happening again in Germany. I am the greatest enemy of Ad olf Hitler's anywhere. And any country which is influenced by me, particularly the young generation -- I don't care about the graveyards, I only trust the young bloo d, fresh blood -- if they are in love with me, that means Adolf Hitler is impo ssible, destruction is impossible. And it is true about other countries too. If all over the world the intelligent youn g people become attuned with me, fall in love with me, not only Adolf Hitler but even the third world war is impossible. To create a third world war you will need all kinds of geniuses, talented people, young. And if they have in some way fallen in love with me, they are not going to serve any destructive cause at any pr ice. They are going to simply refuse. My influence is diametrically opposite to Adolf Hitler. The older generation may be afraid. They have seen Adolf Hitler, th ey have seen his great influence, they have seen people becoming almost mad after him. And he himself was a retarded mind. He himself was not intelligen t at all, just a third-rate person. He was refused admission to schools, college s. He was refused admission to the university -- he wanted to learn architectur e. Then, seeing everywhere rejection -- nobody could think him capable of an ything great -- he joined the army. That was the last resort of all the idiots, of all the fools, of all the stupid minds. The army is the last resort: you don't need intelligence. In fact, intelligence is a barrier in becoming a good soldier. Just as a retarded person cannot become a sannyasin, an intelligent person cannot be come a soldier. What does it mean to become a soldier? It means you have a ccepted death as your profession. You don't have any sensitivity for what you are doing. For a little salary and employment you have accepted to murd er innocent people, children, women, old people who have done no harm to you, to whom you are not even introduced. This needs something of a very low kind of person, almost the animal. Physically he looks like a human being, mentally he is not. And these people have fought all the wars. Of course, when you want to ki ll people you have to be ready to be killed any moment. They have not only so ld their intelligence and their freedom into the hands of some dictator, for just a little employment they have become murderers. And simultaneously they have accepted for that little salary to be suicidal also, because in war it is not necessarily so that you will only kill and you will not be killed. So those leaders were emphasizing, \"Be re ady to kill or be killed. The stake is great: the nation's pride, the race and it s ego, the religion and its messiah.\" All these people have been teaching you just death, either somebody else's or your own. I am simply amazed when people start comparing me with people who are absolutely opposite to me. In anything, my influence is to live more, to allow others to live more, to love more, to al low others to love more. Let this whole"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"earth become a celebrating planet. There is no reason to kill and be killed, and just for some fool like Adolf Hitler, Musso lini, Joseph Stalin. If they want, they can commit suicide, they can hang themselv es from any tree, but why spread this poison? They spread this poison because it fulfills their ego. The name of the nation, race, religion is just a facade, just a curtain, a mask. Behind it is some monster who looks like a human being. My message is for love, life, laughter. But not only in Germany, everywhere there is fear, because it has always happened that whenever there was a man of charismatic influence who can attract people so much that they become identified with him, there has always been difficulty. That's why, because of th eir past experience, they are afraid. All over the world there is great fear. And the strange thing is, their fear is absolutely baseless. I am a totally new kind of man, the beginning of a new humanity. But I can understand them. They have only their past, and their past is long, and their experience is wrong. And whenever ther e has been a man of influence, he has created trouble. Adolf Hitler created th e second world war. Now they are afraid; if their younger generation is being influenc ed by me and is ready to do anything that I say, naturally fear arises. Again the same situation may happen. But just tell them, with me it cannot happen. Without me it can happen. They are so afraid in Germany that perh aps sometime I may be coming to visit my communes, they have already put a bo gus law case against me. Just in case I want to enter the country I can be imme diately arrested. I have never been in Germany and I have never done anything in Germany. But they can file a case against me. That case will help them in many ways. Fi rst, they can refuse my entry. Secondly, they can allow me to enter but refuse to let me out of the country. Thirdly, as long as the case is not finished, they ca n force me to remain there. And they can put other cases. If I win in one case, they can put another. There is no problem in it. Somebody simply goes to the court and says that what Bhagwan has said hurts my religious feeling. That is enough. It is a very strange world in which we are living. If your religious feeling is hurt, then it is your problem; get treated, or drop that religion which cannot help you to be strong enough not to be hurt by a small criticism from anybody. And if your heart, your religious feelings are disturbed, that simply shows they are superficial. You need a new religion whic h goes deep to your roots and nobody can hurt you. Can any of my people be hurt? None of my people have gone to the courts, filing cases, and had their religious feelings hurt. I have been condemned all over the worl d, in all the newspapers, in all the media. They have called me all kinds of names. You could have easily gone to court. In every country you could have foug ht that your religious feeling is hurt, but none of my people has even thou ght about it. They simply laughed and ignored it. Filing a lawsuit means giving a ttention to idiots. And whatsoever they are saying, they are saying without an y argument. They have no argument."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"In India once there was a case against me -- of a similar type -- that I have hurt the religious feelings of Hindus. That is enough in any country. This is very strange. And why was the case accepted by the court? It went for almost one year and I had to come back to Ahmedabad ag ain and again for that case. They were simply wasting my time, and the case was utterly stupid. Speaking in Ahmedabad, amongst fif ty thousand people, I had said that Mahatma Gandhi used to listen to the story of Rama every day. Vinoba Bhave, one of his disciples, but a very scholarly person, used to read the Ramayana, the story of Rama. It is read in every house in India. The drama of Rama is played in every town, city, village, every year. Rama is in every Hindu heart's center. I said in the meeting that Vinoba was re ading the story of Rama, and there comes a passage where Rama's wife, Sita, is stol en. Just to leave some clues as to what direction she has been taken, she went on throwing her ornaments on the way. Indian women have many ornaments, an d she was a queen, so she had enough ornaments. And it was bound -- she felt it was certainly logical -- that Rama would find these ornaments and they would give him a clue to the direction, and if he found more, that made it more cert ain. If he found more he could reach to where she was being taken. And he found -- precious diamonds, em eralds, rubies.... He asked his brother Laxmana, \"Do you recognize? Are these ornaments my wife's? I cannot recognize them myself because whenever I am with Si ta, she is so beautiful that I get lost into her. I don't pay attentio n to her ornaments, so I cannot be certain that this ornament belongs to her. But in this thic k forest, who is going to throw rubies and diamonds and ornaments made of a ll kinds of precious stones? Laxmana, perhaps you can find.\" Laxmana said, \"P lease forgive me, because I have never seen Sita, except her feet, because I used to touch her feet every morning.\" Your elder brother's wife in India is thought to be equal to your mother. \"And I have never seen her face, I have never seen ab ove her feet. Yes, if we come across the ornaments she used on her feet, I will recognize them immediately.\" Gandhi was a little puzzled. He said to Vinoba, \"I don't understand. First, I cannot understand Rama, that he lived for so many years and he could not recognize the ornaments of his own wife. But perhaps he was still on his honeymoon. Sita may have been very enchanting -- but why Laxmana never saw Sita?\" Vinoba produced an argument -- whic h is not in the story, the argument is Vinoba's -- he produced an argument that Laxmana never saw Sita's face because he wanted to remain celibate. He wanted to remain unimpressed by Sita's beauty because he was under a strict discipline. And Gandhi accepted the idea that it was because of a strict discipline; that Sita was so beautiful, perhaps looking at her he may get passionately interested in her. Gandhi accepted the idea. Not only that, it was because of this argument he gave Vinoba the title of Acharya. Acharya means the master mind. He said, \"The explanation that you have given makes yo u a master. I could not have conceived that this would be the explanation.\""},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"I told this whole thing to the people, fi fty thousand people -- and they were all Hindus, followers of Rama, followers of Gandhi, followers of Vinoba -- and I told them that Laxmana's explanation is ugly. It simply shows that he was afraid to see the face. This fear is already part of desire and passion. He was perfectly aware that if he saw her, he would like to have her. All this must have been going on in his mind. He must have been dreaming of Sita, because it was not that he had never seen her. Before th e marriage, Laxmana and Rama both had gone to see her. In those days in India, the king's daught ers used to have a certain ceremony. It was called swayamvara. The princess chooses her husband by a certain device. Sita was the daughter of a very big em peror. Hundreds of kings had come to marry her. The device was that Sita's father had one very long bow, which was known as \"Shiva's bow.\" And the condition was that anybody who could just by hand break the bow into pieces, he would be the person to marry Sita. The bow was so heavy that many kings trie d to take it up fr om the platform, but they fell themselves. They could not move the bow. There was no question of breaking it just by hand. Sita was sitting there ready with the garment. Whoever breaks the bow.... And Laxmana was getting very eager. They had gone with their teacher, Vashishtha. The father of Rama had sent Vashishtha to take care of the boys and see that they were not de feated, that no cunningness was being used. Laxmana was getting so excited that he was asking again and again, \"Vashishtha, just give me permission and I will break it.\" Vashishtha said, \"You just keep quiet. Rama has the first right, he is your elder brother. If he fails, then you have a chance.\" Of course Rama broke the bow. Laxmana had seen Sita, seen the beauty of the woman. She must have been a rare woman. Now he had to treat her as if she were his mother. You can imagine his mind. I explained to those people that Vinoba's explanation simply shows Vinoba's mind. It has nothing to do with Laxman a. Vinoba was a celibate, and he knew perfectly what celibacy means. Your dreams are full of girls, your whole day is continuously a fantasy of sexuality. The repressed sex tries in every possible way to break your unnatural idea of celibac y. Vinoba was afraid of meeting women, seeing women. He used to live isolated. He never lived in Gand hi's ashram itself, because there were women there. He lived a few miles away. He used to come every day at the prayer time, reading the story of Rama or some other scripture, and would go back. But he lived in is olation. Around Gandhi's ashram was dangerous: there were women, beautiful women, and he was a celibate monk. The explanation that he gave was his own mind, and the explanation is a condemnation of Laxmana. It makes him a repressed sexual person. It is a condemnation, it is not appreciati on. Neither Vinoba understands the psychology, nor Gandhi understands the psychology, because he confers the degree of Acharya for this stupid explanation!"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"A case was filed against me, that somebody 's religious feelings were hurt. I said to the court, \"This is strange. I have no t said a single word against Laxmana. I was criticizing Vinoba's explanation.\" Vi noba was alive then. I told the court, \"You call Vinoba, and I am ready to argue with him that his explanation is wrong -- not only wrong, but condemnatory. \"And from where does this man get the idea that his Hindu feelings are hurt? Vinoba is not yet a Hindu incarnation of God, and I am trying to save Laxmana, that this is not the right explanatio n. In any Sigmund Freud's hands this explanation will mean Laxmana is sexually so much repressed, so much afraid of his own repression that he cannot look at the face of the woman.\" The court finally agreed with me, but the court was also Hindu, so they were not daring enough to call Vinoba also into the court. I said, \"This is unfair. I criticized him, this man says I have hurt his f eelings. Now the court gives the judgment that I am not speaking against Hinduism, I have spoken against the explanation. Now it is the duty of the court to call Vinoba. Vinoba has hurt the Hindu mind and the Hindu mind's religious feeling.\" But Vinoba was a great Hindu leader, so naturally he was never called. The case was really against him, not against me. But one strange thing happened. Whenever the case was in the court, thou sands of people would be there, inside the court, outside on the verandas, on th e lawn -- thousands of people, at least ten thousand people would come to liste n to what I was saying. And they were all Hindus. And when I won the case, the man who had filed the case against me told the magistrate that he needed polic e protection. I said, \"For what? I need police protection because I have hurt the feelings of the Hindu religion, religious people, and these ten thousand people are Hindus. And I have to go out of this room -- these ten thousand people can kill me. And this fellow is asking police support and police protection -- for what? Are these Hindus against him?\" They were. They could see the point clea rly, they could see that this man is simply a Hindu chauvinist. They coul d see that I had been unnecessarily harassed for the whole year. And they were really angry, they were shouting and screaming and asking that the man should be delivered to them, so they could teach him what it means to be \"religiously hurt.\" The magistrate himself was afraid that the situation was dangerous. He told the man to go inside, behind, which was the magistrate's private room, and just remain there until everybody was gone. \"No police protection will help, because these ten thousand people.... From where can I bring the whole army to prevent these ten thousand people? The court has a few policemen, but they are not enough to protect you. You just sit.\" An d he went inside the room and waited. I left, so naturally other people left by and by. Perhaps he must have left just when the court was being closed, or he must ha ve left with the magistrate in his own car. Exactly that type of case they have pu t in Germany. And soon they will be putting it in every country. Because I told the Australian media, \"Get ready, I am"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"coming,\" now the whole of Australia is agog, afraid. Newspapers have started coming, saying that people are very mu ch disturbed, afraid that I may remain there, may not leave Australia. But the man himself who was here was an intelligent man. I really loved the man, he was not just a journalist. He is answering the phone calls continuous ly coming to his studio. He informed us, \"I have never answered myself, my secretary answers, but this time I am answering myself because I can say to them that I have been there, I have seen the man, I have seen the commune that is there, and they are beautiful people, and you need not be afraid. And don't get unnecessarily excited by rumors. There is no danger.\" But it is now all ov er Australia, a great wave of fear. I have not gone there and there is not much possibility. But my people are there, and my people are growing in every country. And in every country my people will have to face the same problems. They cannot believe, the politicians and others, that I am not going to use my influence politically. It is something inconceivable to those retarded people, that there can be a man who has great influence and is not going to use it in any way. My influence is that of love. I love my people, and I would not like to put my people in any kind of destructive situation. But what can you do with people who are so afraid that they cannot even come to visit the commune to see and experience themselves that there is nothing to fear? My people are peaceful and wher ever they will go they will bring the peace, the silence, the rejoicing. They will bring songs to every country and ecstasy to every land. Our war is totally different. They don't understand. We are spreading a certain kind of atmosphere around the worl d which can prevent wars, which can prevent Adolf Hitlers, which can pr event nuclear weapons being used. Q: BHAGWAN, IN YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD BEING ONE COMMUNE, IS IT STILL SO THAT THE ITALIANS SHOULD BE THE COOKS, THE FRENCH THE LOVERS AND THE GERMANS THE ORGANIZERS? A: Most probably, because who can cook better than the Italians? And in my commune everybody is to do the best he can. Yes, the Germans will be the organizers. They have proved -- and I have a greater number of Germans than from any other country -- they are the be st organizers, the most reliable people. You can trust them, they can never betray . They certainly have a very strong spirit. But nobody is going to force them. If they want to change places they can change, and that is how it is happening in my communes all over the world. People don't remain stuck to one job, they want to learn many more things. The doctor wants to learn plumbing, the plumber wants to be a mechanic, the mechanic wants to be a cook. The commune is also a university. It is so many things together. It is a religion, it is a university, it is the birth place for the new man."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"So my feeling is that Italians will try to learn how to organize, although in the beginning their organization will be greasy, lousy, spaghetti all over. Nobody is going to condemn them, that's natu ral. The Germans cooking, you can understand, Koran Grove will be full. If we can survive German cooking, that means a miracle has happened, but we will tr y. We are open to all possibilities. And it is already happening that way. In fact the moment you enter a commune nobody recognizes you as Italian, as Ge rman, as Indian, as American. All those things simply disappear; you are just my people -- the red people. A new identity comes up and throws out all old identifications. I don't know who is a German, who is an Italian, who is Greek, who is Spanish. I don't know myself, except for a few peop le who had come to me in the very beginning, so I know them more person ally. That's why when I want to say something about Germans I will use Hari das, because except Haridas I don't know any German. If I have to talk ab out the English, I have to talk about Teertha because I don't know anybody else. If I have to talk about Italians, then Asheesh is the only Italian. But there are many and now there is no possibility for me to be acquainted the way I am with Teertha or Haridas or Asheesh. That way is not possible any more. I will love you but I will not know your name. I will do everything for you but I will not know your name, your rac e, your country. And the thing has become so enormous and big, and it is expanding with such speed, you cannot expect me to. In the beginning, when th ere were only a few people who could be counted on fingers, naturally I knew their name, their country, their background and they had the chance of being more in timate. In the beginning it was possible. But don't feel that those who have come late are deprived of anything, because my work has really begun now. After I st arted speaking again, those three years that I remained silent were just to give a gap. All that I had done before that was only a preparation; then a three years' gap so that all those who want to escape can escape before my real work starts. So those who have come just now, they should not feel deprived. My work has begun just now. Now I am talking directly to you. There is no Krishna between me and you and no Jesus be tween me and you. I am cu tting their heads right and left and creating a direct passage. I am not allowing even people whom I love -- Bodhidharma, Chuang Tzu -- I am not goin g to let anyone stand between me and you. I am going to chop their heads. Of course, lovingly. I can ask them, \"Forgive me, but I have to chop your head beca use now nobody stands between me and my people.\" However beautiful is Heraclitus, and however much I have loved Pythagoras and Zarathustra, it does not matter. That is my personal affair. As far as you are concerned I am not going to let anybody else stand between me and you. So nobody needs to feel that he has missed something -- no! My work has begun just now and you have all come in the right moment. Those who have remained in the preparatory period , in the silent peri od, of course, are"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"more fortunate. But if you have courage enough you can take a long jump and be in the front line with the old sannyasins. It only needs courag e. They had enough time to go slowly, step by step. The n ew sannyasins will have to jump four steps at a time. Soon you will be all in the same line. And that's my effort, that's why I am giving you so many shocks. Shocks are particularly good to keep people jumping. I don't let them stand in one place. Another electric shock and they jump four, five steps immedi ately. A day or two I may let them rest there, but not more than that. Q: BHAGWAN, WHY IS THE MEDIA SO NERVOUS AROUND YOU? A: Because they have never come ac ross a man like I am. The media knows politicians, popes, other kinds of leader s. They are all afraid of the media and nervous. The politician is nervous, he has reasons to be nervous. And the journalist is assertive and aggressive, and the politician is simply dodging and trying to save his skull. A few days ago I saw an interview with Rajiv Gandhi, who has become now the prime minister of India. He was here in America. The interviewer goes on continuously hammering and Rajiv Gand hi looks almost frozen, as if any moment his breathing is going to stop . And I can see the reason, because the interviewer tried in different ways to ge t Rajiv Gandhi to say something against Russia. That Rajiv Gandhi cannot do. Before coming to America, first he had gone to Russia. In fact, he must have b een prepared there in Russia, what to say and what not to say, because India is al most in the hands of Russia. It is not a communist country but on the very verg e. Any day it is going to become a communist country. The interviewer was also trying to forc e Rajiv to say something against America. That he cannot do. In America, he has come to create more friendship, he has come to get more uranium for nuclear wea pons in India, he cannot say anything against America. He cannot praise America, either, because Soviet Russia will get upset. He cannot praise Soviet Russia because America will get upset. So, naturally, the politician is nervous before the media. I have no problem. I can say exactly what I want to say. All the media become nervous because they know they will not be able even to report the things I say, because if they take all these things to the editor, perhaps they may be thrown out of the job. They are nervous because what I am saying is also hurting their prejudices. They are human beings. First they are human beings, then they may be journalists; first Christians, then th ey may be journalists. And when I am hitting on Jesus they want to scream, but they cannot do that. Naturally, it becomes a nervous feeling. They forget to ask what they wanted to ask. They have never met a man like me who has nothing to lose, who can say anything, who does not belong to your society, who does not care about respectability."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Now the pope is continuously concerned that his respectability as the greatest religious leader in the world should not be affected by any statement. All his statements are prepared by other bishops, looked at by a committee, everything is edited. He is simply a spokesman, he is not speaking himself The whole church, the Catholic hierarchy is decisive . He has just to speak what they teach him, what they tell him to say. Another fundamental reason they get nerv ous is that I am an absolutely free man. I don't care about contradicting myself, so they cannot put me into a corner by saying, \"You said this fifteen years ago, now you are saying that.\" They cannot put me into any corner. I say forget it, to hell with those fifteen years. Whatever I am saying now is true now. Tomorrow I do not promise I will say the same thing, because I don't bother about consis tency, about respectability, about what people will think. I have no reason to be nervous, I simply enjoy their nervousness. It is strange, something new. The table with the water is placed by the side of the person who is being interviewed. When he feels nervous he can start drinking just to do something: get busy, forget nervousness, and meanwhile he has time also to think what to say next. Here it is just the opposite. The water and everything is placed by the side of th e media. And I see them plucking grapes, taking water, tossing and turning in their chair, sometimes looking at the photographer, sometimes at the director. They will never forget the interview, because that kind of interview is never going to happen to them unless they come here again, to have another nervous breakdown. But my work is first to give you a nerv ous breakdown, because only from there is there a possibility of a spiritual breakthrough. Breakdown to breakthrough, that's the whole story.

MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE IN MY TOWN HAVE HEARD OF YOU AND RAJNEESHPURAM HAS BEEN ON TELEVISION AND IN THE NEWSPAPERS. NONE OF THEM HAS BEEN HERE THAT I KNOW OF AND I KNOW THE TWO DAYS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED.

CAN YOU STATE IN ORDINARY AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS TERMS WHAT YOU STAND FOR? ANSWER: It is very difficult for me, almo st impossible, because I never adjust to speak with you or anybody. I speak, you have to adjust with me to listen. It does not matter whether your readers are middle cl ass, higher class, or lower class. I will say the same thing. If they are middle, they will have to raise their heads up a little to understand, for the simple reas on that whatever I am saying, I have brought to its simplest form. To make it more simple is just not possible. I am not a philosopher. The philosopher thinks about the truth. His approach is rational. Reason is his instrument, and here just the opposite is the case. I am an irrational man. And the people who ha ve gathered around me -- around the world -- the appeal to them is my irrationality, because reason has failed so utterly. For three thousand years in th e West, ten thousand years in the East,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"philosophers have been struggling to find the truth, and not a single philosopher has been able to find it. The way of philosophy does not go with truth at all. It is just rational gymnastics. So one philosopher can argue against another philosopher, and they go on arguing for centuries, but they have not come to agreement on a single point. Philosophy is the worst wastage of human intelligence that is possible. When I say I am not a philosopher, I simply mean that my approach towards reality is not through the head, it is through the heart. I also say that I do not preach a religion because religion is something like love -- you cannot teach it. There is no way to teach love, and if you teach love and somebody becomes trained under your te achings, he may go to Hollywood and become an actor, but he will never become a lover. Your very teaching, your very discipline will be the barrier. So I say I do n't teach religion. Religion is something that passes heart to heart, not head to head. The moment religion passes head to head, it becomes theology. It is no more religion. I compare it with love because that is the only human experience that comes a little close to the experience of truth. The only difference is that in love, you need somebody else... at least two is a basic necessity. Whom are you going to love? Who is going to respond to you? So love is a dialogue; religion is a monologue. You don't have anybody there -- God, some messiah, some prophet. There is no one with whom you can have a dialogue. You, in utter silence, feel it. It is simply a state of mind at rest -- and the he art throbbing in a deep harmony with existence. So I cannot call it a religion the way Chri stianity is, the way other religions are. They can manage to give you a catechism which the middle class people will understand. For example, middle class people can even understand the atheist who says God does not exist. They ma y not agree with him, but they can understand what he is saying. They can understand the priest who says God exists. They understand, the statements are simple. My position is a little more delicate. I say there is no God, but there is godl iness. So I destroy God as a person. He becomes more like a fragrance than a flow er. I am not a theist because I don't believe in God as a person creating the world. I am not an atheist because I am taking God higher than he has ever been . From a quantity I am transforming him into a quality. But I am not a theist and I am not an atheist. And for people to understand godliness is certainly a little difficu lt. It is as difficult as if you tell me that you come from a town where ever ybody is blind, and ask me to say something about light so th ose people can understand. What can I say about light to people wh o are blind, who have never experienced light? There have been preachers around for centuries telling blind people what light looks like, what light is. And ther e are three hundred religions and three hundred different definitions of light. They all cannot be true, but they all can be false. In the first place to try to make an endeavor explaining light to the blind is"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"stupid. What the blind man needs is not a priest, but a physician, not a teacher, but a surgeon who can give him eyes. It is not a question of giving him the definition of light. The question is to gi ve him eyes. If he can see, he will never ask what light is -- he will know. But the priests have been preventing people because they go on supplying defi nitions of light to the blind. And of course, nobody wants to be ignoran t. That's why people believe. It is not coming from their hearts, because it is no t their experience. Anything that is your experience is bound to have its roots in your heart. But people cling to beliefs about things which they don't know. They cling for a simple reason: they cannot accept that they are ignorant. And the first step to understand is to accept the fact that, \"I do not know.\" Those middle class people about whom yo u are asking, they are all knowers. You may think they are middle class, but they all know God exists. What kind of God... Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Moha mmedan.... They know the holy book. They know the holy Koran, the holy Gi ta. And everything is known to them, that's what they think. They know nothing -- knowing should be your experience, and they confuse knowledgeab ility with knowing. And my effort is to prepare the ground for knowing, not for faith, belief. So only the very intelligent people can come to me. But remember one thing: the greatest intelligent people have come from the middle class. The poor man is so hungry and starving, he has no energy for thinking and inquiring about truth. He is searching for bread and butter. His basic physiological needs are not fulfilled, so no genius has ever come from the poor. It is impossible. From the rich it is also impossible, for a totally different reas on. The rich man has everything that he needs. He misses all the challenges of life. He is too much protected, and if you protect a child to o much you will cripple him. What does he need intelligence for? When I was a student in the university, I met a student who had been in the same master's degree class for ten years continuously! I could not believe it. I asked him and he said, \"Who cares about passing? I enjoy being among the students. I have money, I have time, I have a car. I can get the most beautiful girl any time. I don't come here to learn ge ography and history and psychology. I am not concerned, I am not interested. What can they give me? If I pass and I have a degree, that cannot make me richer. I am already too rich.\" Geniuses have never come from the supe r-rich people, they are born in the middle class. The middle class has been the source of all great scientists, mystics, philosophers, so don't take middle class in a derogatory way. And what is the reason why the middle cl ass brings intelligence to its climax? The reason is simple: the middle class is continuously struggling to reach higher. There is a possibility for the middle class to enter into the richer class. It is just there, a little more effort and he will cross the boundary of being a middle class person. There are only a few rungs on the ladder. It is not impossible for a"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"middle class man to conceive himself beco ming super-rich. This is one side, he goes on sharpening his intelligence. On th e other side, he is always afraid of falling down among the poor. So he is fighting a double fight. First, not to fall into the poor class, not to become a proletarian; second, he is fighting, competing, because he can see the goal is not far away. Just a few steps more and he has arrived. This gives him a double chance of sharpening his intelligence. That's why all the geniuses have come from the middle class. So don't be worried about the middle class in your city. They are fortunate to be in the middle class. To be poor is ugly; to be super-rich makes your life closer to vegetation. The rich man is almost a cabbage, perhaps a cauliflower. The difference is not much: the cauliflower is only a cabbage with a college degree. I am absolutely certain they will unders tand what I have to say, but I will not adjust, because I don't compromise on an ything. I say the way I feel to say. Whether anyone understands or not, it is their business. I will not come down and compromise and say things which are appealing to them, which they can understand. What can they understand? On ly that which they already know, for which they have been conditioned. They can understand absurd, idiotic things. Just now, I saw a newspaper cutting that the prophet Mohammed teaches Mohammedans that the woman has only one chance of reaching paradise, no other qualification is needed from her. Only one chance, one simple chance, and that is to make her husband entirely sati sfied as far as sex is concerned. Great! This is the qualification to enter into paradise, just to satisfy the husband sexually. Mohammed says that the woman cannot say no any time the husband wants to make love to her, because her no is a sin. And, you may believe or you may not believe, he says that even if th e husband and wife are riding a camel and the husband wants to make love on the ca mel's back, the wife should not say no. And these people have been teachers, masters, prophets, God's messengers. Great messages God is sending: make love on the back of a camel. Just to sit on the back of a camel is so difficult! Lovema king itself is such gymnastics, and to do those gymnastics on the camel's back.... It will be really a scene! And these are the messages that are being sent, and thes e are the messengers. He is simply a male chauvinist, just trying to make women into complete slaves. But Mohammedans have never questioned it. Mohammed himself married nine women. Nobody told him that the quanti ty of men and women on the earth is equal, almost equal, that to marry ni ne women means you are depriving eight men of having wives. And these eight men are not just going to be sitting and waiting. They will do something. They will become homosexuals. You may not know that in Mohammedan co untries homosexuality is thought the biggest crime. And for homosexuality, the only punishment is the death sentence. Now, I cannot see the logic. On the one hand, Mohammed allows every Mohammedan at least four wives. Of course , he is a prophet, so he has nine, but his followers, because they are his followers, are entitled to have only four wives."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"This is so unscientific, unbiological, th at the remaining men are bound to become homosexuals, perverts. But nobody, not a single Mohammedan in the fourteen centuries since Mohammed, has even bothered. Christia ns can understand perfectly well any absurdity that is Christian. They can acce pt that Jesus was born out of a virgin mother. They know perfectly well it is not the way of nature. The whole story that the holy ghost makes her pregnant is a cover-up. Who is this fellow, the holy ghost? And why did he stop making othe r virgins pregnant? He has done a great job, giving Jesus to the world. He should be continuously making virgins pregnant. The more Jesuses, the better. Bu t he did it only once -- never before, never after -- just a single act and th e holy ghost has disappeared. Nobody bothers to ask. If he is a Christian, he will accept the virgin birth. He will accept the resurrection of Jesus after death. People understand easily what they have been conditioned for. And my work is unconditioning people, deprogramming people. There are other deprogrammers, but they are not really deprogrammers, they are reprogrammers. If some Christian starts becoming a Hindu, they will deprogram the person and reprogram him back into Christianity. I simply deprogram, and then leave you alone. I have no program to give you. I want you to be totally alone, fresh, without any borrowed know ledge. Because only then there is a possibility of experiencing the beauty of this existence, the ecstasy of being alive, the meaning, the truth. If anybody really wants to understand, he should come here. For a seeker, an inquirer, Rajneeshpuram is not far away. People are coming here from all over the world. If a person is here for a certai n period of time, experiencing the people who are here, the way they relate, the clim ate of love, the serenity of the place, the silent communication between me an d my people -- if they can come and dance, sing, and be part of us -- then pe rhaps they will get something, a taste that you cannot describe. Nobody has been ab le to describe what sweetness is. The only way is to drink a Coca-Cola. I am a drunkard. I am drunk twenty-four ho urs. The source of my drugs is inside me, so no government can catch me. There is no way to find out from where I am getting my champagne. And my people slow ly, slowly start getting drunk. So it is a question of taste. If you can simp ly provoke those people that there is something worth tasting, that they should not miss it, then it will be possible for them to understand whatever I am sayi ng. I use simple language, I have no jargon. I am not an expert about anythin g. To understand me is very easy. The problem arises that you cannot understa nd me just through words. And it is not a new problem, it has always been so. The person who experiences something in his innermost core finds it difficult to translate it into language, because language is created for mundane affairs. What can lovers say to each other? At the most, \"I love you.\" An d if, unfortunately, the woman has a philosophical mind and asks, \"What is love , what is it that you are proposing?\""},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"explain that first you have to understa nd what love is, only then can you understand whether to take it or not. Fortunately women are not philosophers. Th ey don't ask what love is. In fact, they know more of love than men. It is men who have created all kinds of violence on the earth, and are preparing to destroy the whole life on earth. It is absolutely men's responsibility. Women have not been participants in it. But if a woman has a philosophical mind, then no lover can explain. Then the only way is, rather than saying, \"I love you,\" he st arts making gestures of love, holding her hand, dancing with her, looking into her ey es, singing with her, listening to the music, or just sitting silently together l ooking at the night, the stars. Perhaps just being together something will transpire. And that is love. It is a transfer of so me invisible energy, and exactly the same thing is religion. One who has known hi s own being is capable of sharing his being with you, and in that sharing, some thing will be triggered in you. And the moment you know the truth, it will not be the truth of the Master, it will be your own. He has never given you truth. He has never talked about it. He has not said a single word about it, because no thing can be said about truth. All words are futile as far as truth is co ncerned. No word has the potentiality to express values like truth, joy, blissfulness, ecstasy. There is no way. But one thing you can do. You can give them a chal lenge: if there is something worth experiencing, at least don't condemn it before you have experienced it. And I know that anybody who comes here open and ready to learn puts his conditioning aside and forgets that he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. It is a very simple and natural phenomenon. It starts happening to you. It is happening, and that's the purpose of cr eating communes around the world. So that anywhere there is a group of a thou sand or two thousand people vibrating with their meditative energy, dancing to abandon, singing madly, ecstatic for nothing, a man is going to get drunk just being in an open contact with the commune. There have been teachers, grea t masters, but what they were doing was theology, not religion. Religion needs a human lab, and that's what the commune is; because religion is the highest human engineering. It is said -- and perhaps it is true.... In India, music is a very ancient tradition, and Indian music has qualities of its own, its beauty, its silence. It is not sexual the way jazz is sexual or the Beatles are se xual. It is somethin g totally different. Listening to the classical music you will feel something coming from a different world. In the history of Indian music it is said, and perhap s it is true, that if in a silent room a master sitar player plays th e sitar and you keep a few other sitars in the room, soon those other sitars start vi brating. Nobody is playing on them, but they start getting in tune with the master player. And I see every possibility that it is not just a story, because vibrations can hit those sitars; just a master player, a maestro is needed."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"In Indian music there are ragas. A raga is a certain type of music for a certain period of time. For example, for the morn ing, one raga; for the evening, another; for the middle of the night, another. Arou nd the clock those ragas are played, but each has its own time. And it is really st range, that if you play the raga that is meant to be played in the early morning, in the evening, it does not create the same climax within you. The same man is playing, but something is missing. It is just like at sunrise when the birds start singing and the flowers open up. At sunset the birds stop singin g, the flowers start closing. Existence is going into rest, so there is a different music for this moment which will be in tune with the whole existence. There is a different tu ne for the morning Because the sun is rising, your music should be harmonious with the rising energy, the wakening energy of existence. I am not a musician, but I have meditate d around the clock, and I was surprised that a certain method functions at a ce rtain period, perhaps in the morning. Another method opens the doors in the evening, and you cannot use the same method for the morning. In a commune where five thousand medita tors are living, working, being, you will get drunk. It is bound to happen. So the people were really right when they told you, \"Don't go there, we are afrai d you may not come back again.\" It has happened to many, and I can see the po ssibility that it can happen to you. Because who would like to leave this beau tiful commune for that ugly world that exists outside with all the politicians, with all the rapes and murders, and everybody trying to cut everybody else's throat? Who wants to live there? Here there is no competition, no struggle, no crime. People don't have time. Either they are meditating or they are working or they are loving. There is no time to do anything stupid. I have no philosophy, I have no religion; yet, I inspire people for a different kind of life which is religiousness, divineness, godliness. But my emphasis is that all nouns are wrong, only verbs are right. Wh en you say, \"Look at this tree,\" when you say, \"This is a tree,\" you are not stat ing exactly that the tree is not a noun, and cannot be a noun, because it is growing. It is treeing. In existence there are no nouns at all. The river is rivering, the tree is treeing. Each moment you are somebody else. Each moment you are growing. The growth never stops, and if you are consciously helping the growth, then you will not only grow old, you will also grow up into wisdom -- which brings peace to the heart and which brings the light which reveals to you the immortality of your being. And at the same time it reveals the immortality of everything in existence. Things go on changi ng their form, but nobody dies. Death is illusory, it has never happened; only consciousness is transmigrating into other bodies. And I don't want people to believe me, I don't teach transmigration of the soul. I simply help them to come to that space where they will be able to know it on their own. If a person can see his past lives, which is"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"very simple, if he can see his thousands of past lives stretching to eternity, the logical conclusion is that he is going to continue in the futur e also to eternity. Eternity to eternity. With that experience, all fear disappears, because all fear is somehow rooted in death which is coming closer every day. We try to deceive ourselves and others in every possible way. We make our graveyards outside the city so that we are not reminded of death agai n and again. Whenever you pass by the graveyard, the thought is bound to come that sooner or later you will also be lying down in some grave. Perhaps the next grave that is being dug is for you. Nobody knows. It is certainly for someone, and that someone can be you. We have tried to deceive ourselves with the belief that the soul will not die. But that is a belief, and belief is just useless. It won't he lp you to any transformation. You are believing it because it is helpful. You can keep your eyes closed to death, although you know that this is only a belief, that life is eternal. So I don't teach any belief I teach methods of how to enter into different spaces which are available inside you. So thos e who are interested, bring them. Perhaps what they have not found in their whole life they may find here in this small oasis in the desert of Oregon. And don' t think at all that those middle class people will not understand me. Q: I APPRECIATE THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR ANSWER. I DON'T REMEMBER MY QUESTION, BUT I'M SURE YOU ANSWERED IT. A: That's good. Q: SINCE AMERICANS, AND ES PECIALLY OREGONIANS, PRIDE THEMSELVES AS HAVING THE LAND OF THE FREE -- WE HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME AT GRADE SCHOOLS, NATIONAL ANTHEMS AND SO ON -- WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY PEOP LE ARE SO OPPOSED -- I MEAN NOT JUST OPPOSED, BUT REALLY ARDE NTLY OPPOSED -- TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO? A: I'm not surprised by it. If I was not opposed then certainly I would have been surprised. It is just a natural phenomenon. If you have been miserable your whole life, if you have lived in a society where everybody is miserable -- they all have their styles of being miserable, different co lors, different shades, but basically everybody is miserable -- then you don't see people just laughing for no reason, or just dancing because the moon is fu ll tonight. Your society condemns such people as crazy. So when they have to encounter a commune like this, their first reaction is that if such blissfulness has not happened to them, these people and their existence prove to them that they have missed the train."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"It will be good that these people are re moved, destroyed, because they become a question mark. It hurts that there are people who are happy: Why am i not happy? If others have been able to manage it, then what is wrong with me that I cannot manage it? A great inferiority complex arises. And whenever you are under the impact of feeling inferior, there are only two ways to think: either think that these people are mad, perhaps hypnotized, or that so mething is wrong with them. But this explanation cannot stand long, because these people are doing everything so intelligently, they cannot be mad. They are so conscious and alert, they cannot be just moving like robots, hypnotized. Th ey are not sleepwalkers. So condemn them, that they are immoral, that they are against God, that they are not religious. Just condemn them so you can feel a certain guarantee that you have not missed life. Whatever life has, you have: televisi on, a car, a good job, a wife, children. This is what life gives, so you have got it. But these people have got something else, and that hurts. Condemn them. Find out bogus, false charges against them. I invite these people just to come close an d see, but they are afraid to come close, because deep down they kn ow they will be infected by these people, and they will be left in a limbo. All their investments are there in the wo rld. Here, they will be coming into a strange space where they have no idea even what is happening, where these people are going. And there is the conflic t in the mind of leaving the old world, where you had all your acquaintances and friends and family. They also were all miserable, so there was a certain affinity, a family feeling, a certain equality; there you cannot risk. Those who come here only come if they have the guts to risk. You mentioned that they can tolerate Olympics, they can tolerate boxing, they can tolerate every other thing, and aske d, \"Why are they against you?\" The reason is clear. The boxing does not make them feel inferior. In fact, the boxing helps them to release their violence. California University has been studying why, after a boxing match, violence in creases immediately fourteen percent. They have studied only violence. They should also study other things after boxing -- how many more rapes happen, how many more murders happen, how many more suicides happen -- and you will find they are all increased. The society is so violent, so full of violen ce that just a football match, and people are ready to kill each other. A boxing match is simply ugly, barbarous. People enjoying two persons hitting each othe r like animals, breaking their noses, hurting their eyes, bringing blood... and people are clapping and shouting and enjoying. They get in some way identified with one of the fighters. Everybody in the stadium is identified with one wrestl er, boxer. His victory is their victory. When he hits the enemy they are hitting th e enemy. It is unconscious, but it is a release."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Those who have too much violence, when ju st the identification won't help, they raise the percentage of actual violence af ter the match is over. For four days the percentage remains higher and then slowly it goes down. The same is true about football matches, about Olympics. They fit perfectly in their violent society. Even war fits perfectly. Nuclear weapons fit perfectly. I am nonviolent and I stand for love, not for war. And I don't see that there is any need... things like boxing should be abso lutely prohibited. They are ugly and barbarous. People can go there, thousands go, and millions of people are sitting glued to their chairs before the TV. It is strange that violence is so much appreciated, enjoyed. These people must be all carrying some violence in them, otherwise I don't see it, I cannot enjoy boxing. It is disgusting. The phenomenon of the commune is just the opposite, and that's why it is so troublesome to them. If we were also boxers here, eating meat, doing all kinds of crime, they would have been perfectly ha ppy to accept us. We are strangers to them. It hurts their egos. We are creating civilization. Up to now it has been only a word. The Romans thought they had come to the peak of their civilization, and at the peak, what were they enjoying? Throwing Christians to hungry lions. I think they must have been very compassionat e people. They could see lions hungry, and they provided the best food th ey could find. Why were they against Christians? The same reason: in the beginning Christianity was a stranger. Now nobody is against Christians beca use Christians have compromised with the society. They are only nominally Chri stians. Sunday morning religion is their whole religion, and their church is nothin g but a club where they go to gossip. And nobody listens to the priest. There is nothing to listen to. That man has been repeating the same sermon again and agai n, but he can repeat the same sermon because nobody is listening. I have heard that a Christian minister was very much disturbed by one old man who was the richest man of his congregation . Of course, he used to sit just in front of the priest, but he was old and he had heard these sermons so many times that they were like sleeping pills for him. The moment the priest would start he would fall asleep. That was not a proble m; the problem was he snored. But he was the richest man, the richest donor. In everything, he was helpful to the church. In fact, he was the only ma n who was keeping the minister paid, otherwise the congregation would disa ppear. So the minister could not say anything to the man; but complaints start ed coming to him from other people. They were saying, \"We are not against his sleeping, he can go to sleep for good. What troubles us is that he disturbs ou r sleep by snoring. And just a beautiful Sunday morning and one feels so good to have a little nap. But this old man....\" The old man used to come with his grea t-grandson. The boy enjoyed sitting there by the side of the old man. The priest took him away from the old man and told him, \"I will give you one dollar every Sunday if you keep hitting the old man with your elbow so that he does not fall asleep. That is your work.\" The boy said,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"\"Done! There is no problem. I will not le t him sleep a single moment, but I don't believe in priests and I don't trust them. Pay me in advance.\" The priest gave him one dollar, and the next Sunday morning the boy continued pushing the old man with his elbow. The old man was very angry, and looked at the boy again and again, but he could not say anything. The priest was there, the whole congregation was there, bu t he did not allow him to sleep. Outside, the old man was enraged. He said , \"You stupid. What happened to you? Why did you go on hitting me with your elbow and waking me up? I'm old, in the nights I don't have any sleep. This is the only place where at least for one hour, one and a half hours, I can have a good time. Doctors have failed. In fact, doctors have suggested, 'Why don't you start going to Sunday sermon? When we fail to give sleep to any patient we send him to the church, and it always succeeds without exception.' \"So, you rascal,\" he said to the boy, \"you disturbed my whole jo y; now I will have to wait one week again. But what wen t wrong, why were you doing this? You were always sitting silently.\" The boy said, \"It is something concerning business.\" The old man said, \"What business? What business have you started doing?\" He showed him the dollar. \"The priest is pa ying me one dollar to keep you awake.\" The old man said, \"Then you should have told me before. I will give you two dollars every week. Don't disturb me.\" The boy said, \"So far, so good. The business is going good. Tw o dollars, in advance.\" He got the advance, and the next Sunday morning he was sitting silently. The priest made many hints, but the child would not look at him at all. He would look here, there, everywhere else. The priest said, \"What has happened to this boy? Last Sunday was so peaceful.\" After the service, the priest caught hold of the boy and said, \"You are cheating me. I am giving you one dollar per sermon. Why have you stopped hitting the old man? \" The boy said, \"He is giving me two dollars for not hitting him. Now if you wa nt, the price has gone up. If you give me three dollars I will keep him awake.\" The priest said, \"I cannot co mpete with your old man. He is so rich he can give you any amount of money. I am a poor priest. Three dollars per sermon, I will go bankrupt.\" These people who go to the churches are no disturbance to the society. It is their society. Jesus was a disturbance, hence they crucified him. After Jesus, his apostles started compromising with the so ciety, and what a coincidence. He was crucified by the order of the emperor of Rome, and later on Rome became the capital of world Christianity. Existence works in strange ways. Thes e people who are against me, hostile towards me and my people, one day you will find them in red clothes. I just have to manage to be assassinated. Then everyth ing will be good, th en I will gain their sympathy. Right now I am such a disturba nce. They have neve r conceived such a religious man, one who has ninety Rolls Royces, hundreds of diamond watches, and a 126-square-mile ranch, three times bigger than New York. Naturally they"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"should be offended. I am re sponsible for their being offe nded. And I am trying to introduce a totally new religious phenomen on which goes against their morality, their etiquette. Everything that they have, my commune go es against it. Because I have seen one thing clearly: every society is an organic whole. If there is rape, murder, theft, and all kinds of crimes and perversions, then whatever good is there is so interconnected with the bad that we stand even against those things that appear good. We can see the interconnection be tween the good and the bad. They are two sides of the same coin, and we have renounced both. We are amoral people. We are not immoral, we are not moral. We are amoral people. This is their problem. They can deal with moral people, they can deal with immoral people, but th ey don't know how to deal with us. It is so new to them, they are puzzled and co nfused. But this is really the shock of the beginning of a new man. These are the birth pangs. The society is going, but we are going to continue to grow -- not in spite of them, but because of them. If they are hostile and they hate us, we are already connected. We have a certain relationship already. Sometimes frie ndship is not so deep as enmity. Just the other day I received a letter from a sannyasin: \"I love you. My wife likes you but does not love you. I love my wife. I want to move to a commune, and now I am in great difficulty. My wife likes you but she is not ready to move to the commune. She does not love you that much. I love you so much I want to move, but what will happen to my wife an d children? I am in a dilemma.\" When I heard the letter I said, \"This man is going to be in great difficulty.\" If the wife hated me, things would have been simple, but she likes me. Like never changes into love. Hate has the capacity to change in to love. In fact, it is love standing on its head. I am really happy that people are host ile. How long can they remain hostile? And they are unnecessarily wasting their time and energy, and having nightmares, and we don't care a bit. We are not bothered. We are enjoying the time that is available to us. Tomorrow is uncertain, so we are not going to sacrifice today for any tomorrow. We are existential people. Just this moment is so much, who cares whether the next moment we survive or not? But they will have to change their atti tude. You cannot carry hostility long. It starts disturbing your stomach, raises your pulse beat, and gives you heart attacks. We have not done any harm to anybody. They are doing it on their own. They are creating it for their own death. If they understand just a little psychology, before becoming hostile, plea se come and become acquainted. I am not a missionary and I don't convert anybody. If a person wants to be converted, wants to become a sannyasin, that is his responsibility. We are not making any effo rt to change any man, because I think that is trespassing, and I respect the indivi dual as one of the highest values in the world.

A: I am living in the Soviet Union. Or egon is a state in the Soviet Union. Q: WELL, IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT, WHY ARE YOU HAPPY HERE? OR ARE YOU HAPPY HERE? A: I am happy anywhere. Q: EVEN IN A PLACE AS OPPRE SSIVE AS THE UNITED STATES? A: Yes, even in Oregon. "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Q: HOW ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS? HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ONES THAT YOU'VE MET, THAT YOU'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH? OR THE ONES THAT YOU'VE READ ABOUT? A: I know only the Americans who are with me, but they are no longer Americans. I don't come in contact with other Americans, because I never go anywhere. Q: BUT MANY AMERICANS COME HERE TO SEE YOU, DO THEY NOT? THE PARENTS OF YOUR SANNYASINS, AND OTHERS? A: I don't meet them. Thousands of Ame ricans are my sannyasins, but the man who becomes a sannyasin drops all hangovers: American, Christian, Hindu, Indian, Mohammedan, communist. He throws all that crap away. That is the essential thing for a sannyasin to do, to be just a human being without any labels. Man is not a commodity that you can label. To label human beings is ugly. So there are people who were once Americans who have become sannyasins. I can tell you about them; they are in contact wi th me. They are some of the best and most beautiful people in the world. Q: I WONDER IF I MIGHT ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD IN INDIA? WHAT WAS IT LIKE? HOW DID OTHER CHILDREN RELATE TO YOU? HOW DID YOU RELATE TO THEM? HOW DID THEY FEEL ABOUT YOU? HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF AS A CHILD? A: I was a little strange as a child. I neve r played with any ch ildren because deep down I never felt that I was their age. In my childhood I was discussing with adults, old people, but my relationsh ip with my own age group was nil. Q: YOU FELT YOURSELF A TEACHER EVEN THEN, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? A: Yes. I have always felt that I have something to give, and as I grew up, that thing became more and more clear. I had always related with people who were at least twenty, thirty years older than me, only with them could I argue and discuss things in which other children were not interested. Q: DID THIS MAKE YOU AN OUTCAS T WITH CHILDREN YOUR OWN AGE? DID THAT MATTER TO YOU? A: I was an outcast, and I am still an outc ast. Perhaps that's my fate, my destiny - - to be the outsider -- but I have enjoye d it my whole life. I don't remember a single moment when I have felt badly about whatever I am. I have rejoiced in my being and I have kept my freedom comp letely intact. Nobody has been an"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"influence on me -- neither a teacher, nor a professor, nor a saint, a religious leader, a political leader. In fact, as I grew up and my arguments became sharper, teachers and professors were afraid of me . And I was not just an outsider; I was expelled from many colleges for the simp le reason that the professors felt embarrassed. They were not able to an swer my questions, and they were not courageous enough to accept my answers. Q: DO YOU THINK THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMIC THERE, THOUGH, IN YOUR FEELING AN OUTCAST, THAT LED YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF FORMING A COMMUNE OF WHICH YOU ARE THE CENTER? A: I have not made the commune. I start ed on the way alone. People started coming to me and it became a vast c aravan which is now spread all over the world. And people are still coming. I have not made it, it has happened. It was not a planned thing, not something considered. I don't have any discipline, any rules, any regulations. Somebody coming and becoming a fellow traveler is welcome. If he leaves at some crossroads, we say goodbye to him with the same joy, ecstas y, as we had when he joined us. And we tell him, \"Whenever you want, the doors will always be open for you.\" But I have not made the commune. Certain ly, when five thousand people are living here, so many arrangements have to be made; but all that credit goes to the sannyasins. I have nothing to do with it. Q: THE ADULATION THAT IS OBVIOUSLY FELT FOR YOU HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY, DOES THAT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HUMILITY OR A SENSE OF OMNIPOTENCE? A: Just ecstasy. Q: I BEG YOUR PARDON? A: Just ecstasy, it gives to me. It does no t give me a bigger ego; it does not give me the opposite, the humble ego. They are both egos. Sometimes the humble man is more egoistic than the straightforw ard egoist. As far as I am concerned, it is not adoration. They rejoice. They love me. I am not higher than them; they are my friends, my lovers, on an equal basis as far as I am concerne d. Now it is up to them whether to listen to me or not to listen. Q: ONE OF THE THINGS I'M ASKING, I GUESS, IS WHAT DOES IT DO TO YOUR HEAD, AS THEY SAY, TO FEEL ALL THIS LOVE? -- I MEAN, AS A HUMAN BEING TO BE THE CENTER OF SO MUCH WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, LOVE, ADORATION, ADULATION?"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" A: I rejoice. It is beautiful to have so many hearts beating in the same tune as my heart is beating. Q: DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE AS HAPPY IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE SANNYASINS AND THERE WAS ANOTHER LEADER? A: I cannot be more happy; I cannot be less happy. Happiness is something that is within me, it is not dependent on anyb ody. If all the sannyasins are gone, I will be happy with the trees, I will be happy with the stars. And I can dance with the trees and the stars; it does not matter -- I can dance in my bathroom. I am a happy person. Q: IN REGARD TO THE REMARK S YOU MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD GATH ER THAT YOU DO COMMENT ON POLITICS. I WOULD LIKE TO AS K YOU WHAT YOUR FEELINGS ARE ABOUT RAJIV GANDHI AND THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. A: Rajiv Gandhi is just an amateur po litician, knowing nothing about politics, and he is going to be destructive. He is going to impose the same emergency that his mother did. All that he knows is hi s mother and he simply will be repeating what she has done. Q: SO YOU FORESEE ANOTHER EMERGENCY? A: Another emergency, another assassination. And this time it is going to be worse than before. Q: WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS OF SIKHISM AND OF THE SIKH EXTREMIST ELEMENTS? A: Sikhs are beautiful people. Perhaps the community of the Sikhs is the only community in the whole of India you can rely upon for something. They are simple, courageous people -- most trustworthy, reliable, not cunning. They are unafraid of anything; otherwis e, the Indians are cowards. Q: DO YOU FAVOR SEPARATE STATEHOOD FOR PUNJAB? A: India has never been one nation and ca n never be. It is something forcibly put together. In Gautam Buddha's time, India was divided into two thousand independent nations. It was the Mogu ls who conquered India and started making other states dissolve into the Mogul empire. They created the background for the British raj. When the Br itishers took over, India for the first"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"time became one country -- but forcibly , under slavery, because there was no other way. Once India became independent, all the troubles started. Even before independence, Mohammedans were asking for a separate country of their own. And I think they were not wrong. In a country in which Hindus are a majority, Mohammedans will have no chance. They will be suppressed and Hindus will take the revenge of thousands of years. It was good that Paki stan was taken apart from India. I am in favor of freedom at any cost. If Sikhs want to be free, if they want their own nation, they have every right to have it. To prevent them is undemocratic , against freedom, against the dignity of people. Who is Rajiv Gandhi to prev ent them? Who was Indira Gandhi to prevent them? I have been a friend to Indira Gandhi, and she had immense respect for me. But when she was assassinated, I didn't feel sorry. I simply felt it was her own doing. It is a simple thing: if Sikhs want independence, give it to them. Why enforce? -- and othe r provinces are also asking. Assam is asking for independence. Their leaders have been crushed, jailed, or they have escaped from the country, but the fight continues. The same is going to happen sooner or later to the south Indian states, because they don't belong to the north in any way. They are not Arya ns as the northern Indians are. They don't have any language derived from Sanskrit as are all the languages of northern India. In color they are differe nt, in culture they are different. Why should they be forced? Everybody should be given independence. Even if India disappears completely, it is perfect. It is disappearing in favor of freedom and democracy. Q: YOUR STATEMENTS ABOUT MRS. GANDHI SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT YOU WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT WHEN YOU LEFT INDIA. A: I was with Indira Gandhi no t with the Indian government. Q: HOW DID THAT WORK? WHAT WE RE THE DYNAMICS OF THAT? A: Because she was interested in my ideas, she was read ing my books, and whenever I was passing through New Delh i, she always tried to meet me and discuss with me. She always agreed with what I said to her, but she said, \"I know what you are saying is right, but I canno t do it\" -- because this whole political game is so dirty that if you want to be at the top, you have to follow the whole cunning, hypocritical style. Q: WERE THERE PROBLEMS BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER MINISTERS OR DEPARTMENTS OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT? "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"A: Yes. With Morarji Desai I have been enemies for many lives. Q: WAS THAT A KEY FACTOR IN YOUR LEAVING INDIA? A: No. I remained in India until he was no longer the prime minister. I had made it a point that while he is the prime mi nister, I was not going outside India. I was hammering him every day, hitting him every day, for the simple reason -- I am not a politician, I am not a competitor to anybody -- that I can't see stupid things happening. Q: WHAT WAS YOUR QUARREL WITH DESAI? A: Everything -- because I was against hi s political master, Mahatma Gandhi. I am against the whole philosophy of Gandhiism because it drags people backwards. It is not a forwards movement; it does not take account of the future. It adores, and teaches people to adore, th e dead past. He was not ready to accept anything that was invented after the spi nning wheel. For him the spinning wheel was the last human invention, for him time had stopped there. This is stupid. On the spinning wheel you cannot keep your country clothed. If a person spins for eight hours every day, then he will be able to have enough clothes just for himself. Now this is an idiotic ideology. If a person spins eight hours, then when is he going to earn his food? How is he going to take care of his children, his wife, his old parents? How is he going to have a roof? Gandhi was against simple things: telegraph, telephone, railway. Just think.... Q: BUT HAVEN'T YOU YOURSELF SAID THAT IT'S THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE DEVELOPED THAT' S GOTTEN US INTO TH E POSSIBILITY OF A HOLOCAUST? A: I have said it, but I have said it from a totally different direction. I say it is technology that has disturbed the whole ha rmony of nature. Now it is the duty of technology to put it back. Nobody else can do it. I am not against technology; I am simply against the technology which has been growing blindly, unconsciously, unaware of its effects. I would like a better technology, superior to the technology we have, which takes care of nature an d human beings. Our whole technology has developed as an effort to destroy. Q: BUT NO ONE'S EVER FOUND A WAY TO PUT A CAP ON SCIENCE, HAVE THEY? I MEAN, IT HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN. A: It has NOT a life of its own. It is politically dominated. No scientist can manage a nuclear plant. The nucle ar plant is owned by the American"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"government or the Soviet Union or some other idiots, and the scientist has to work under the direction of the politicians. This technology has not developed independently. Scientists are simply th e servants of the politicians; and the moment they start just a little to do so mething on their own, their careers are finished. In the ancient days it was diffi cult and different. It was difficult to create all that technology is now creating because it needed a certain background which was not available. Second, it was simpler for a scientist to work independently in his own small lab. Ga lileo was independent, Copernicus was independent, but not Albert Einstein. Q: BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT, DO YO U REALLY SEE A WAY TO PUT THE NUCLEAR GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE WHEN EVEN GRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE A NUCLEAR BOMB TODAY? A: There is no need to put it back. An y energy which can be destructive can also be creative. It is only a question of a pplication. The nuclear weapons are meant to destroy. The whole science is motivate d towards a third world war. The same energy that is being put into making these weapons and these new discoveries can be put into creative ways. There is no need for Ethiopia to starve and die. Q: DOES THIS PUT YOU ON THE SIDE OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS? A: Not to destroy -- but the energy can be used in a creative way, and the sooner we realize it, the better. All governments sh ould be forced by the people to see that atomic, nuclear, or any kind of energy that is in the service of war, has to be released into the service of huma nity to destroy hunger, poverty, unemployment. We can make this earth for the first time a paradise. It will be really so foolish to have so much ener gy in our hands and destroy the earth, destroy all life. Q: HOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN GO ABOUT CHANGING THE PRESENT ATTITUDE IN THE WORLD TO CREATE THIS SORT OF FUTURE THAT YOU SEE? A: The people just have to be made more alert and aware. They have to be made conscious of what their politicians are do ing. And once the politicians see that the masses are no more for war, they will immediately jump ahead of the masses. That's a necessity for being a political le ader -- you have to be ahead of the crowd. It is not that the crowd follows you, it is just the opposite. The politician has to keep alert to where the crowd is going, and the successful politician is one who always keeps himself ahead of the masses. The unsuccessful politician is"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"one who goes on without lo oking back to see that th e followers have taken some other route. It is very simple. Just the people -- the media, all kinds of newspapers and magazines, the universities where intelligence exists -- should start a campaign for consciousness raising. It is not a question of one person, it is a question of life being destroyed. Q: AND HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT CREATING THAT CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGHOUT MANKIND? A: I am trying. I am trying in my ow n way. I have more than half a million sannyasins around the world who are tryi ng in every possible way to raise human consciousness. Perhaps nobody el se is doing what I am doing and on such a vast scale. My methods of meditation are in reality sabotaging the political structure that exists anywhere today. If people meditate, they become more rebellious, they become more understandin g. Their eyes see more clearly. Their consciousness is on a far higher level. Th ey can become teachers to those who are lagging a little behind. They can help them. Within ten years it is possible we can make humanity alert and aware of their own politicians. American politicians are making Americans aware of the danger of Soviet Russia; Soviet politicians are maki ng Soviet citizens alert to the danger that America is. Americans have to be made aware of the danger of their own politicians. Russians have to try to become aware.... I have my sannyasins there -- of course, they are all underground. Q: HOW MANY IN RUSSIA? A: I cannot give you the number. I ca nnot give you the names. The Russian government is already persecuting the peop le they have found with my books. A few Russians have escaped and they are here. Q: ARE THERE OTHER LEADERS TODAY THAT YOU FEEL ARE WORKING IN THE SAME DIRECTION YOU ARE? OR DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS ALONE? A: There is nobody. Political leaders canno t do it; it would be suicidal on their part. They would lose all power. The so-c alled religious leaders have been in deep conspiracy with the politicians for ce nturies. They are afraid that if people become more alert, more co nscious, then who is going to bother about their God? And who is going to believe that there is a God? There have been two religions in Indi a devoted to meditation: Jainism and Buddhism. Both deny the existence of God, for the simple reas on that when your consciousness becomes clear, you can see th at this God and the creation of the"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"world is all fiction. The religious leader s are afraid of a person like me. They are afraid of my sannyasins. They are afrai d because among my sannyasins there are Hindus, there are Mohammedans, Sikhs, Christians and Jews. And of course the moment they become my sannyasins, they have to leave their Jewishness, their Christianity, outside. They cannot bring it in. Naturally the religious leaders will be afraid. I am the only person who is condemned by all religious leaders, all political parties. Strange: a single person is bein g condemned by all those who are against each other. Even communists are agains t me, socialists are against me. A few days ago, I received a letter from the president of the American Nazi party: \"You are hurting our religious feelings by spea king against Adolf Hi tler.\" He told me in the letter that Adolf Hitler was not a politician, he was the reincarnation of the ancient Old Testament prophet Elijah. No w do you think these are the people who are going to raise people's consciousn ess? They are exploiting people in the name of religion. Q: AS I RECALL YOUR PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK, YOU MENTIONED EUGENICS AS A WA Y IN WHICH WE COULD AVOID CREATING OTHER MONSTERS SUCH AS HITLER, STALIN, AND GENGHIS KHAN. IS THAT CORRECT? A: Yes, it is right. Q: BUT WHEN YOU INTRUDE INTO PE OPLE'S LIVES TO TELL THEM WHEN AND HOW THEY CAN HAVE CHILDREN, ISN'T THAT SOMEWHAT FASCISTIC, SOMEWHAT HITLERIAN IN ITSELF? A: No. If you can operate on their cancer, is that Hitlerian? When the doctor says, \"Take this medicine for your tuberculosis,\" is he intruding in your life? Is that fascist? You are entering in everybody's life in every way, but because eugenics is something new, people freak out. In fact, a couple making love has no idea what kind of a child they are going to produce. This is blind biology. It is bette r to be in the hands of scientists than to be in the hands of blind biology. We can conceive that there can be exploitation, but that is true about any invention, any discovery, any n ew thing. But I am totally in favor of it, because I see it ca n really change man even though he has not changed in thousands of years. Sinc e the first monkeys jumped on the earth and started walking on two legs, man is the same. Yes, he wears better clothes, flies in airplanes, but just scratch a littl e bit and you will find the monkey there. Q: IF YOU'LL PARDON A COUPLE OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS, HAVE YOU NEVER WANTED TO HAVE A CHILD YOURSELF? "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"A: No, for the simple reason that I don't wa nt to burden this earth. It is already burdened too much. There is no religio us reason why my sannyasins are not giving birth to children. In the four ye ars we have been here, not a single baby has been born. And nowhere is so much love being made as is made here. Q: THERE'S BEEN A STORY RECENTLY THAT YOU PLAN TO RETURN TO INDIA AND TO MOVE THIS COMMUNE BACK TO INDIA. IS THERE ANY TRUTH IN THAT? A: I go on creating many kinds of rumors ; they are part of my work. But I am not going anywhere. I am going to remain here. Q: WHY ARE YOU DETERMINED TO REMAIN HERE, INASMUCH AS YOU SEEM VERY CRITICAL AND UNFAVO RABLY DISPOSED TOWARD THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND TH E UNITED STATES IN GENERAL? A: Because I want to spread that idea. I need to be here. Q: IS THERE ANY REASON THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY INDIAN SANNYASINS HERE IN OREGON? A: Only a few are here... not many. There were not many even when I was in India, for the simple reason that what I am saying goes against their conditioned minds, and they have the oldest condit ioned minds in the world. They are so much conditioned over thousands of years that they have beco me incapable even of listening to anything new. They believe that everything that is true is in their scriptures, that there is no need for anyth ing new. The old is gold. The older it is, the golder it is. Q: WERE YOU EVER A PRACTICING HINDU? A: Never, never. I have never been practici ng any religion. I have been trying to remain an individual on my own, right or wrong, heaven or hell. I have never considered about anything. I want to rema in completely myself. It gives a certain strength, freedom, dignity; and that's my teaching to my people. It is not a religion -- it is just the gathering of people who feel some similarity, some synchronicity. But each is respected as an individual. This commune is not an organization, it is an organism just like the body. They are all working on their own responsib ility. There is nobody higher, nobody lower; there is no hierarchy. The professo r and the plumber are equally respected and loved. In fact, nobody even bo thers whether you are a plumber or a professor. Nobody even asks anyb ody, \"What are you doing?\" because"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"everybody is doing what is needed. So all are equal; they are fulfilling the needs of the commune in different ways, in the way they can fulfill. Q: WELL, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRI BE THE THING THAT BRINGS YOU ALL TOGETHER? A: I had not come here to stay. I had come here because my health was bad. My back was so bad that we tried everything.... Experts from England were called but they could not fix it. I was suffering from asthma so much that sleep became difficult. I am allergic to all kinds of perfume, smoke, dust; any small thing immediately triggers my coughing and then it goes on for hours. Otherwise, why should I choose Oregon ? It is a desert, dry. Humidity is dangerous for me. Whenever I went to Bombay, attacks of asthma would immediately increase. And whenever I went to the desert part of India, Rajasthan, it would settle down. That gave me the clue that it is not a question of medicines; I had to find some desert pl ace, and big enough. For simple reasons.... If I was living in the city and at somebo dy's house they were having a fire or celebrating a Hindu festival with firec rackers, that was enough to trouble me. You cannot stop them just for my allergy. So I needed a big place, and this place is big enough. It is 126 square miles. My sannyasins know what my troubles are , so they don't do anything that can trouble me. And the climate is dry. I had never come here with the intention to stay. I came only so that I could get healthier, and I have been getting healthier. I am far better than I was there, but my troubles are such that they can be triggered any moment. You just come here and you have been smoking, that is enough. You are not smoking here, just talk ing, and if I get the smell of tobacco, you have done it. So it has become a problem. My Indian commune is there. They are waiting for me; but I know that if I go back the same problem will arise again. I was 180 pounds when I came; now I am 132 pounds. Just the dry climate helped me to reduce the weight without any difficulty. So I am going to be here. And I am not a person to just sit and watch whatsoever goes on, because I don't think America belongs only to Americans and India belongs only to Indians. This whole eart h belongs to us. I am feeling perfectly good here, healthwise, so I am not going to leave. Secondly, I am feeling immensely interest ed by the hostility of Oregonians. For thirty years in India I had been hamme ring people. By an d by they became accustomed to me, to my criticism. Th ese people are new and they are really getting disturbed, and I am getting great joy out of it! Q: YOU APPARENTLY ARE THE HEAD OF A VERY RICH WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION. WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON ANY OBLIGATION YOU MAY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD CHARITY? TO THE FAMINE"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"COUNTRIES? TO POVERTY IN INDI A? TO THE MANY OTHER PLACES THAT NEED HELP? A: First, I am not the head of a worldwide organization. I am not even a sannyasin. Nothing is in my hands; it is my sannyasins' business. I am simly a guest. Q: WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL FEELING ABOUT IT THEN? A: My personal feeling is that there should be no more preparation for future war. And all the nations who are putting se venty-five percent of their energy and income into making new weapons, should move all that energy to help those who need it. I don't have anything to gi ve to Ethiopia, beca use I don't possess anything. Q: DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WISHED TO HELP ETHIOPIA, YOUR SANNYASINS WOULD COMPLY WI TH YOUR WISHES AND RENDER HELP? A: No. I would not wish it either. This should be the work of the politicians and the religious leaders. They should take the responsibility -- I have nothing to do with it. In fact, if people had listened to me, India would not have been poor. For thirty years I was saying to them, \"Go for birth control. Abortion should be made legal\" -- and I was condemned for that. They were throwing stones and shoes and knives at me for te aching them immorality. So I don't feel responsible if they are st arving. It is their doing. Anybody who is dying and starving should remember that the whole crime is due to people like the pope, Mother Teresa, and other religious leaders who are against birth control, against abortion. They are increa sing the population of the world, and they are getting Nobel prizes. Mother Teresa should be hanged! Q: WELL, EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE WORLD HUNGER IS A RESULT OF MISGUIDED POLICIES ON THE PART OF WORLD LEADERS, WHAT ABOUT HUMAN COMPASSION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STARVING? -- SIMPLE HUMAN COMPASSION. A: If you really want to know the truth, I say just send medi cal groups to help the Ethiopians die peacefully if you cannot provide food and clothes. And how long are you going to provide? Ethiopia has been starving and dying for four years continuously, and those dying Ethiopians are still creating children. The people who have increased the popula tion of the world by their teachings should take the responsibility and feed thos e people; or, if they are incapable, my suggestion is that rather than starving, suffe ring, dying, it is better to give them"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"an injection so they can go peacefully into eternal sleep. An d I know the soul never dies, so I am not worried about anything. They will be incarnated somewhere else, and next time they w ill find something better than Ethiopia. Q: YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION, THEN? A: I know. I don't believe. Q: WOULD THAT BE PART OF YOUR INDIAN HERITAGE, SINCE IT IS A STRONG BELIEF AMONG INDIANS? A: No. It is not because they believe. I have tried to find it. It is not my belief, I never accept any belief. It only covers your ignorance, it never makes you wise. I have meditated; I have come to a poin t where I can see my own past lives, and that's proof enough. It is my knowing, my experiencing; it is nothing to do with Indian heritage, beliefs, or anythin g. I speak on my own authority. Q: YOU'VE OFTEN EXPRESSED A VIEW OF A COMING WORLD APOCALYPSE IF MAN DOESN'T CHANGE HIS OUTLOOK. IS THAT VIEW OF AN APOCALYPSE SOMETHING THAT'S RATIONALIZED FROM AN ANALYSIS OF HISTORY AND CURRENT EVENTS, OR IS IT A VISION? A: It is an analysis of man's whole past. The way man has been functioning -- continuously unconscious, fighting, violent -- one day it will come to its ultimate logical conclusion. And it is coming. After the second world war, you cannot have the first world war -- you can only ha ve a third world war. It is not a vision, I am not a visionary. I can calculate th e way nuclear weapons are growing. In 1945 the first atom bomb was used in Hiro shima and Nagasaki. Within just forty years our power of destruction is seven hundred times more, and it is growing every day. Q: YOU WOULD CALL YOURSELF A RATIONALIST ABOUT THIS, THEN? A: Absolutely. Q: AND YOUR ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS A WORLD EPIDEMIC OF SOME DISEASE -- POSSIBLY AIDS, I BELIEVE YOU SAID. A: Yes. It is also part of all that man ha s done to nature, to man, to animals, to everything. He has created the situation. For example, in my childhood in India -- an d it is not long, just fifty years ago -- the seasons used to come exactly the sa me day each year. India has three clear- cut seasons. Every year winter starts at the same time, disappears at the same"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"time. Since 1945 it has not been so. Now the seasons are not predictable. Some great disturbance has shaken the routin e of millions of years. The water is polluted, the air is polluted; it is really a miracle that we are st ill surviving. So it is simply a rational analysis that if we don't change human consciousness by the end of this century, the chapter of life on this earth closes forever. Q: I BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE ALSO PREDICTED A TERRIBLE FLOOD. WHAT REASONS DO YOU SEE FOR THAT? A: That, too.... All around the world even poor and small nations are experimenting with atomic energy, even India. People are starving, dying, and India is exporting its wheat -- for what? Yo ur people are dying. They have been producing the wheat, they will not ge t even one meal a day, and you are exporting wheat. Naturally, the government will have to impose an emergency, because how long can people tolerate that they are dying and their food is being exported? But India is exporting becaus e money is needed for more nuclear plants, atomic bombs. All that India has is farming. Eighty percent of Indians are farmers; they can only sell their raw prod uct. And they will be purchasing death. So if great explosions go on happening, it is scientifically estimated how many explosions will start melting the eternal snow of the Himalayas. And even just the Himalayas melting is enough to drow n India completely, because the height of the ocean will rise fifty feet, and citi es like Bombay will have no future. And this is only about the Himalayan ice. If the ice of the north pole and the south pole starts getting heated and they st art melting, then you can understand.... It is a man-made calamity. And there is still time to stop, because it has not happened yet. I am not a pr ophet in the sense that I am a visionary. I don't support all that rubbish. Q: YOU DO HAVE SOME FAITH IN TH E PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS, THOUGH. IS THAT CORRECT? A: I don't have any faith in him. The fact is that the man was crazy, and what he has written can be interpreted in any way you want. I found this rational analysis and managed to look into Nostradamus, and found similarities, which was very easy. There are many books of that kind in the world. In India there is an ancient scripture thou ght to be written by Vyasa himself, five thousand years ago. Everything about you is written in it. You just have to go to the priest, you have to give your name, your birth time, your birth chart, and he will figure it out and find the right page where Vyasa has described you. And it is possible because in the Sanskrit lang uage, each word has at least one dozen meanings. So looking at you, watching you, talking with you, the scholar will figure it out, and he will start reading from the scripture. And he will be very much correct."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Copies of the scripture exist all over India; so you have it done in Delhi but if you are not satisfied -- who knows if it is right or wrong? -- you can go to Madras or Calcutta, and they will find the same page again. And because in the process of finding the page the clue is given by you, you can just change your name.... Go to Delhi, tell one name, one date of birth; in Madras, tell another name, another time of birth and you will know what is going on. He will not be able to find the same page. He will find some other page. But ordinarily, the type of people who go will not do this. They are immensely impressed. Nostradamus can be interpreted in an y way you want. The sentences are not clear, the grammar is not correct. The word s are such that you can fit them into any context you want. Q: BUT HAVEN'T YOU USED HIM AS THE SOURCE OF THE PREDICTION THAT THIS DREAD DISEASE WOULD SWEEP THE EARTH? A: No. I use all kinds of devices. If pe ople are foolish, I can use even their foolishness to raise their consciousness. I don't feel any problem in it. If I was predicting on my own they would not liste n to it, so I drag in Nostradamus. And that's what I have been doing my whole life. If I speak to Christians -- I have been speaking to Christians in India; they have the biggest theological college in Jabalpur where I was for twenty years -- and I was speaking on Jesus, I was simply speaking on myself. Just here and there I would have to put Jesus' name, and they were immensely happy; not only happy, they said, 'We have never heard any Christian, any theologian, find ing the true meaning of Jesus.\" I said, \"Yes, how can they find the true meaning of Jesus?\" Q: YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE EX ISTENCE OF A GOD, IS THAT CORRECT? A: I don't believe in anything. Belief is simply not part of my vocabulary. Belief simply means you don't know, yet you believe. A blind man believing in light -- what can that belief do? He does not need a prophet, a messiah; he needs medicine, a surgeon, perhaps an operation on his eyes, so that he can see. And do you believe in light? Nobody asks such questions -- you know light is there. The question of belief is asked only when the thing is non-existential. You cannot see it, you cannot touch it, you cannot feel it. God is a belief, heaven is a belief, hell is a belief The reason why you believe in these things is within your psychology; the priest is only exploiti ng. You have greed for immortality, you have greed for paradise and all the pleasu res there. You have fear of death, you have fear of falling into the darkness of he ll and all the tortures there. Naturally you start believing, because you don't want to go to hell, you want to go to heaven."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"It is because of this psychology that an idiot like Reverend Jim Jones managed the suicide of his whole commune. He persuaded them to die with him, because if they died with him, they would all enter into heaven. This is the logical conclusion of Jesus' telling his disciples, 'I will take you into heaven.\" Jim Jones went a little farther. He was really a great Christian! -- after Jesus only he is the prophet. Q: SO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF GOD EXISTED, GOD WOULD REVEAL HIMSELF IN SOME TANGIBLE WAY? A: There is no God, and there is no qu estion of his revelation. I don't see any possibility of God's existence. I can unde rstand the existence of consciousness, because it is within me and I can experi ence it. And in my silent moments of awareness, I have never come acro ss any God, any hell, any heaven. Q: IS RAJNEESHISM A RELIGION? A: No. It is a religionless religio n. It is simply religiousness. Q: DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A PROPHET? A: No. I am not so stupid. I don't consider myself in any way special, extraordinary, a messenger of God, a pr ophet, a messiah. No. I am just an ordinary human being like you and everybody else. Q: I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR ULTIMATE AIMS HERE IN OREGON? A: I never think of tomorrow... and you are asking about the ultimate aim! Q: WELL, SIR, I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR LETTING ME COME HERE TO VISIT YOU. A: I loved it. Q: IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE, AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.... A: Whenever you feel like coming, come.

WHAT WE WOULD LI KE TO DO IS WRITE A STORY PROFILING YOU. THERE ARE A GR EAT NUMBER OF READERS IN THE SEATTLE AREA WHO ARE NOT AS FA MILIAR WITH THE COMMUNE OR WITH YOU AS THE NEWSPAPER READERS ARE IN OREGON, AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT RAJNEESHISM. I GUESS WE COULD S TART WITH: WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK, AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK TO REPORTERS? ANSWER: I have never asked any \"why\" in my life. I simply do anything that I feel like doing. I am not a man of thinki ng. I function through my feelings. If I feel to stop speaking, I can stop in the middle of a sentence, I will not even complete the sentence. And if I want to speak, even from my grave I will continue. Q: I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF THAT.... A: Even from my grave, I will continue to speak. Q: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THE MEDIA THAT YOU COULDN'T SAY THROUGH YOUR DISCOURSES OR BOOKS? DO THE REPORTERS CARRY A MESSAGE TO THE AUDIENCE IN AMERICA FOR YOU? A: Certainly. Whatever I can say to my people, I say to them; but that is not going to reach to the people outside the commune. I would like them to be acquainted with what is happening here , and not to depend on rumors. I would like to invite them to be our guests, see our people, and see that there is a different way of life, too."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" Q: IS THERE ANY WAY SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT COME HERE COULD UNDERSTAND THIS WAY OF LIFE? A: It is almost impossible, because there are things which can only be experienced and cannot be explained. In fact, if you try to explain them, you explain them away. Q: IS THERE ANY WAY THE PEOPLE IN OREGON.... WILL THERE EVER BE PEACE HERE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN OREGON WHO ARE SO OPPOSED TO THE RAJNEESHEES, AND THE COMMUNE HERE OR THE RANCH HERE? DO YOU SEE THAT EVER HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE? A: I don't think of the future at all. Ri ght now we are enjoying their opposition, their hostility, because this is the beginning of friendship. If they had ignored us, then I would have had to think of something.... Q: COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE? IF THEY HAD IGNORED YOU, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE, THEN, THE HOSTILITY? A: No. I would have created something so that they could not ignore. I can accept their hate, their hostility, thei r opposition; but I ca nnot accept their ignoring us, because it is easier to t ransform the hate into love, hostility into friendship. But there is no way to commu nicate with someone who is ignoring you. The people of Oregon have proved really receptive. Q: IF WE COULD GO BACK TO INDIA, AND WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.... I HAVE READ SOME THINGS ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND, BUT I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT. COULD YOU TELL ME... I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU LIVED WITH SHEELA'S FAMILY FOR A WHILE, AND I HAVE READ THAT YOU LIVED WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS AS A YOUNG BOY. I'M NOT CERTAIN WHICH IS ACCURATE. COULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD? A: Yes. My early childhood, up to six or seven, I was with my maternal grandfather and grandmother. I loved the place. It was a very small village surrounded by lush greenery and the hous e of my grandfather was just on the bank of a beautiful lake. After that, for three years I lived with Sheela's father. He loved me not like a small boy, but just like a contemporary friend. It was a strange relationship -- he loved me, he respected me, too, which is very rare. I loved him, that was nothing new; I respected him, but I respected him more because he could respect a child ju st like a friend. And for three years it"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"was a tremendous experience, because I could never communicate or relate with my own age group. I had never played any game in my life. It all looked stupid. Q: EVEN AS A VERY SMALL CHILD? A: Never. As far back as I can rememb er, I loved only one game -- to argue. Q: TO ARGUE? A: To argue... about everything. So very few grownup people could stand me. Understanding was out of the question. In Sheela's father, I found a man who was ready to understand me, and I never fe lt that he was tired or bored or not ready to answer. He never tried to shut me up. He never told me a single time, \"These things you will understand only when you are grown up.\" If he did not know something, he accepted it: I don' t know it, I am searching as you are searching. If in argument he could not convince me, and my argument was weightier than his, he was able to accept it without feeling insulted, humiliated. He is a man of tremendous understand ing, caring, and ou r relationship has remained the same. Now he is my sannyasin. Q: THIS WAS WHEN YOU WERE TEN YOU LIVED WITH HIM, APPROXIMATELY? A: It must have been nearabout... between six to nine. Q: DID HE SEND YOU TO SCHOOL? WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATING YOU? A: No. Because I was never interested in going to school. That was the worst place. I was forced finally to go, but I re sisted as much as I could, because there were only children who were not interested in things I was interested in and I was not interested in things they all wer e interested in. So I was an outsider. Q: WHAT WERE YOU INTERESTED IN? A: My interest has remained the same: to know what is the ultimate truth, what is the meaning of life, why I am here an d not anyone else. And I was determined that unless I find the answer, I am not going to rest, and I am not going to let anybody around me rest, either. So he was teaching me at home, because he loved me; if I did not want to go to school, then he would teach me at home . After living with him for three years, finally I had to go back to my house, because he -- Sheela's father -- left for England for his further studies."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" Q: YOUR FATHER WAS A MERCHANT, IS THAT CORRECT? A: He was a cloth merchant, and that's how he came in contact with Sheela's father. Sheela's father lived in Bombay, an d my father used to come to Bombay for his business. And they immedi ately became almost like twins. Q: WHEN YOU WENT TO SCHOOL, YOU WERE OLDER? A: I was older than any child. Q: HOW DID THE OTHER CHILDREN IN SCHOOL TREAT YOU? A: Then they were afraid of me. Q: THEY WERE AFRAID OF YOU? A: They were afraid... and since then everybody is afraid. The students were afraid, the teachers were afraid.... Q: BECAUSE OF THE THINGS YOU WE RE SAYING, OR BECAUSE OF YOUR ARGUING? A: My argument was their greatest problem. They never accepted any argument from children. Q: THEN YOU WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY, IS THAT CORRECT? A: Later on I was in the university, but.... Q: WHY DID YOU CONTINUE IN SCH OOL AND GO THE UNIVERSITY IF YOU DIDN'T...? A: I wanted to fight with everyone... from the primary school to the university. And I wanted to know if all these kn owledgeable people have something in them, or it is all borrowed. And I foun d that all they had was borrowed: not a single teacher or professor had any experience of his own. Q: WHEN YOU WERE STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY, WAS THERE ANYONE WHO YOU READ, OR ANY ONE WHO YOU FOLLOWED? -- I DON'T MEAN A TEACHER, BUT PE RHAPS SOMEONE WHOSE WRITING THAT YOU PARTICULARLY READ? "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"A: No.... I have read so much that pe rhaps nobody in the whole world can compete. My own personal library slowly , slowly became so big that the day I left India it had 150,000 rare books. I have re ad VASTLY; in fact, it is difficult to mention the name of any book that I have not read. Q: I THINK I READ SOMEWHERE TH AT YOU STOPPED READING AT SOME POINT. A: For the past five years I have not read anything. Q: FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS? A: Not even a newspaper, no magazine , no book. I simply stopped reading because I understood that all those books are just rubbish. You can be lost in the jungle of words, but you are not going to get any truth out of those books. That was the time when I started feeling to go into silence for a group of years, just to give a gap, so that the life that I had lived before silence becomes completely separated from me. It is now completely separated from me. Now whatsoever I say, I say on my own authority. I say only that which I know. I don't believe in anything. I don't quot e anybody unless he coincides with me. Q: WHEN DID YOU MEET SHEELA? A: Sheela's father was not even married when I started living with him. He got married after three months. Sheela came lo ng afterwards. But Sheela's father has been trying to bring all his children to me, he wanted them not to miss me. His two sons are sannyasins, all his daughter s are sannyasins. Sheela was studying in America for about ten years before. She was not interested in any search for truth, she was not aware that there is something to seek in life. When she came to me, she was almost a TABULA RASA, a clean sheet, nothing written on her. That helped her immensely. Once she came to me, she never left. And because she was open, clean, withou t any prejudice, she could understand me immediately. Her understanding has no t been any mental effort on her side... she simply absorbed me. She ate ev ery word that I uttered to her. Q: YOU TAUGHT AT THE UNIV ERSITY, IS THAT CORRECT? A: Yes. Q: YOU TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY? AND YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR TWENTIES? A: Yes. "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Q: DESCRIBE THE YEARS THAT YO U WERE A TEACHER AND WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO TEACH TO YOUR STUDENTS WHILE YOU WERE AT THE UNIVERSITY. A: It was a very difficult situation. I was teaching my students everything that the university prescribed, and I was also teaching them how much in this prescribed teaching is bogus and bullshi t. So it was a difficult job... I was teaching Aristotle and at the same time I was teaching them that Aristotle is not right. So my period was divided in two sections: first I would teach them what Aristotle means, and then I would say that he is wrong, that as far as I am concerned Aristotle has been a great calamity for humanity. So I was complained against because this was a strange way of teaching, and the students were getting confused. They used to ask me: \"What are we going to answer in the examination?\" I said that they had to choose: If you feel Aristotle is right, it is up to you; if you feel I am righ t, it is up to you. If you feel we both are wrong and you are right, it is up to yo u. Choose. And I also recommended to the vice-chancellor not to bother about these complaints, because I am giving them a challenge, and it is the challeng e to the mind that sharpens it. Q: AND WHAT DID THE VICE-CHANCELLOR SAY TO YOU? A: He said to me that those students ha d not come to know the truth, they had come only to earn a degree. I told the vice-chancellor, \"Then accept my resignation, because I have not come he re to make students clerks, teachers, station masters, postmasters... I am not interested in their degrees and examinations. My whole interest is to sh arpen a student's intelligence, make him an individual, unprejudiced, open, available to reality.\" And I resigned. Q: AND THEY ACCEPTED YOUR RESIGNATION? A: They tried not to accept it. They tried to persuade me, but this is not my way. Once I have done anything I never go back. I told them, \"I can feel your concern for me, I can feel your respect and love for me, but once I have resigned, it is finished. Now I will be a wandering teacher.\" Then for almost twenty years I was just a wandering teacher around the country and I found that it was foolish wasting time in the university teaching twenty students. When I can teach fifty thousand people in one single meeting, what is the point of wasting time in the university? So I have not been at a loss. From the university I moved to the universe. Q: I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY READERS UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED WHEN YO U WERE IN YOUR VERY EARLY TWENTIES, AND THEN YOU BECAME A TEACHER AFTER THAT. IS THAT"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"CORRECT? -- AND THEN TRAVELED AF TER THAT. COULD YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHEN YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED, AND HOW THAT OCCURRED? A: Enlightenment simply means an experi ence of your consciousness unclouded by thoughts, emotions, sentiments. When the consciousness is totally empty, there is something like an explosion, an atomic explosion. Your whole insight becomes full of a light which has no so urce and no cause. And once it has happened, it remains. It never leaves you for a single moment; even when you are asleep, that light is inside. And afte r that moment you can see things in a totally different way. After that experi ence, there is no question in you. So for twenty-one years I was continuous ly questioning people, and after that day I have been continually answering people. I don't have any questions. Q: WHAT WAS THAT DAY LIKE? WH AT WAS THE DAY LIKE WHEN YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED? I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN TH E DETAILS TO PEOPLE WHO, AS I SAY, ARE NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH BECOMING ENLIGHTENED. A: It will be difficult for them to un derstand. Because when that experience happens, there are no words, no thoughts; and when you want to express it, obviously words are needed, thoughts are needed. Q: WERE YOU A STUDENT AT THE TIME? A: I was a student. Q: DID YOU SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE? A: No. For seven years, I kept completely silent about it because I was waiting for somebody to recognize it -- perhaps I had gone mad, perhaps it was just insanity. I wanted somebody to recognize it, an d there were a few people who started recognizing that something had ha ppened which is ra re and unique. The first man to recognize was an old ma n who was almost silent for his whole life. Once in a while he would utter a word -- meaningless, you could not make anything out of it, but he was respected immensely. His name was Magga Baba. People used to come to him from faraway places, and he never spoke. To have a contact with that man people used to ma ssage his feet and just sit around him. He might be sleeping and people would be sitting around him, because there was something radiating from that man, something that they could feel like a fragrance. The first day I went to see him, he imme diately hugged me and whispered in my ear, \"My boy, so you have got it... and it is good that you have not told anybody."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Wait for the right moment to tell, beca use it immediately creates opposition, antagonism, and you are too young... you may not be able to fight. So just wait a little.\" Q: COULD SHEELA'S FATHER TELL? A: No. Q: DID YOU SEE HIM AFTER YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED, BUT BEFORE YOU HAD TOLD PEOPLE? A: Yes. The moment I met him afterwards, he immediately became a sannyasin. Q: YOU SAID THAT THE OTHER MAN TOLD YOU TO WAIT UNTIL THE RIGHT MOMENT. WHEN WAS THAT MOMENT? WHEN DID YOU TELL? A: When he told me, it must have b een... I must have been twenty-eight. And once that old man had recognized it, I sl owly started speaking about it. And soon I was in the world fighting, arguing agai nst anything that prevents people from becoming enlightened. So I have been fighting all the religions, all the politicians, all the educationists; and the more I have fought them, the more I have attracted intelligent people around the world towards me. My people are not like Jesus' apostles. My people are professors, engineers, doctors, writers, poets, musicians, painters, dancers.... I have the most talented gr oup in the whole world. Q: DESCRIBE FOR ME WHEN YOU WE RE TRAVELING AROUND INDIA LECTURING.... WHERE DID YOU GO, WHAT WAS THE RECEPTION THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM THE GROUPS...? A: It was different in different places, in different groups. For example, I was lecturing in different universities in India -- and India has almost one hundred universities. The students were the ones who got the point most. I was teaching in religious conferences. The people who ga thered to listen got the point, but the organizers, the religious leaders, became my enemies. So any conference, any gathering of religious people I have visited only once, I was not invited there again. Just in one visit I had disturbed their people so much, stirred so many doubts and question s in their minds. Because this is one of my basic standpoints: the way to truth is not belief, but doubt; not faith, but inquiry. Because of this I say religion and science start from the same point, although their directions are different. Science mo ves towards the object ive world, but its basic foundation is doubt. Doubt ever ything unless you come across something"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"which is indubitable. And religion move s inwards; but the basic point remains the same: Doubt, and go on doubting unless you come across something that even when you try to doubt it -- it is there in front of you -- all your doubts disappear. So to me science and religion both meet at a certain point, the beginning. And if it is understood, it will not be difficult to help them to meet at the end, too. And it will be a great day of rejoicing wh en science and religion become fellow travelers. Q: WHEN DID YOU START THE AS HRAM IN POONA? DID THAT COME MUCH LATER? A: Much later in '73. Q: SO YOU TRAVELED AROUND INDIA FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS? A: Yes. I continuously went.... Q: WHY DID YOU STOP TRAVELING AND START THE ASHRAM? A: Traveling, I was trying to find people who are ready to go wi th me to any end. The moment I became aware that I had enou gh people in India, that I need not bother to go on traveling, I could now settle in one place and let people come to me.... As I became settled, Indians came ... and soon people from around the world slowly, slowly started coming. In Poona, there were ten thousand sannya sins living with me. It was a strange place, almost like an island; ten thousa nd people of different nations, races, colors, languages, and Indians themse lves became a minority group. The moment they saw that what I am teac hing and saying is not propagating Hinduism, I am not propagating anybody's religion, I have got my own experience.... The Hindu mind is the oldest mind and the most rotten, of course; it is so full of conditionings. When the people from the West came to me they were less conditioned -- particularly the young people. To have a communion with them was far more easy. So I don't see any difference between P oona and Rajneeshpuram. In Poona, I was among non-Indians; in Rajneeshp uram, I am among non-Indians. Q: WAS THE ASHRAM LARGE ENOUGH? OR DID YOU WANT TO EXPAND AT THAT POINT? A: I wanted to expand it. It was larg e enough, but not large enough for the people who were going on coming. Ther e were two thousand sannyasins living in the ashram itself, and the remaining eight thousand were living in hotels, guest houses, in other people's houses. The whole of Poona was overflooded"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"with sannyasins, and I wanted all of them to live together because they had been continuously cheated by people. Indians proclaim themselves very religious .... That is just nonsense; they are the most materialist people on the earth. Rent s went ten times higher as soon as they saw many foreigners coming. Prices of ev erything went high. In the market, if an Indian was purchasing a thing there was a different price; and if a sannyasin, a foreigner, was purchasing the same thin g, it was ten times more. When I had started the ashram a huge bungalow wi th two acres of garden around it was available at $20,000. Soon it became impossible... even $100,000 was not enough. People were asking absurd prices. Q: FOR ADDITIONAL LAND? A: For land, for houses, for food, for ev erything We were searching for land in India somewhere else; but the Maharasht ra government would not allow me to leave Maharashtra. They had found a strategy to prevent me: one, that any property, any land, any house that we purchased was never allowed to be transferred into our names. Even now.... Q: SAY THAT AGAIN...? A: Any property, any land, any house that we purchased, the Maharashtra government did not transfer it to our name. Q: WHY NOT? A: Simply so that we could not sell it. And we had invested so much money there that unless we could sell, it was difficult for us to move. So this was their one strategy. Now, even now, those pr operties are not in the name of the commune -- because still the commune exis ts there. And the second strategy was they were forcing the central government that we should not be allowed land anywhere else. The reason was that th ey were earning so much out of the visitors, Poona became the biggest tourist place in the whole of India. The people who now have gone to Poona say it look s a deserted place: hotels are empty, houses are empty, prices have fallen. And you will be surprised to know that the people who were against me had arranged a Hindu ritual -- a fire ritual, which one hundred brahmins have to perform for seven days continuously, twen ty-four hours of continuous prayer to God that I should be brought back. An d these were the same people who had even made an attempt on my life! Q: WHEN DID THEY PERFORM TH IS RITUAL? RECENTLY, OR...? "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"A: Just two years ago. Q: HOW DID YOU GET THE FINANCING TO START THE ASHRAM IN POONA? A: I had so many rich friends all over the country. I don't have a single cent, and now I have people all over the world who have money and who have guts to risk that money with a dangerous man like me. Q: WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WO ULDN'T ALLOW YOU TO GET ADDITIONAL LAND, IS THAT WHEN YOU MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE INDIA? A: No. They were not allowing for seven years, so that was not the problem. I had no intention to leave India. If th ey would not allow us land outside, we would have gone on purchasing more and more properties in Poona without changing it into our name. The law in India provides that if somebody has occupied a house for nine months, you cannot throw him out, so it does not matter... who cares in whose name the property is? -- we are the users. So we went on purchasing properties. Still our people are growing there. Since I have not been there, the oppo sition has died down. In fact much sympathy has arisen, so our people have purchased four hundred acres of land near Poona, and they are developing a new commune there. Q: DID YOU WANT TO LEAVE POONA? A: No. For me it makes no difference: wherever I am, I never go out. Rajneeshpuram may be in the Soviet Union, or in America or in India. It does not matter to me, I don't know who is living outside. Q: HOW IS RAJNEESHPURAM DIFFE RENT FROM POONA, PHYSICALLY? A: In many ways. First, it is 126 square miles of land; the Poona ashram was only six acres of land. It differs because all the sannyasins can live together here. In Poona it was difficult, they were living in separate places. Now they have their own home, and all are living together, working together, producing, creating. The Rajneeshpuram commune is no longer dependent on anybody -- we are self- sufficient. Right now five thousand sannyasins are here, but it changes. People go on coming, living here for three or four months, as much as they can afford. Each thing is made by sannyasins: the food, the clothes, everything is created by sannyasins with great love."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"In Poona it was sad -- they were cheated, exploited. They were falling sick continuously because India is dirty, the water is polluted. Here we have pure water, we have pure ai r, we don't have neighbors -- it is easy to love your enemies, but it is not easy to love your neighbors. We are alone here, in our own world, totally independent. In Poona, everything had to be done so that the old conditioned mind was not disturbed too much. Here, there is no problem. Even if people want to go to the lake and have a sunbath naked, nobody is bothered by that. If people want to dance and sing, nobody is bothered. In Poona it was a difficult prob lem: if people wanted to dance, then there were so many complaints from th e neighbors, and soon the police were there, saying that they are disturbing the neighbors. Now, at last, we are not disturbing any neighbors. And those who are disturbed, they are far away. Let them boil up within themselves. Let them enjoy... if they enjoy hostility. But they don't have even the guts to come here and see. They may be just thirty miles away, but they don't have the guts to come and see. Deep down they are afraid that perhaps we are right and they are wrong. That is the threat. Anybody who has come here has gone away with a different attitude, with a new attitude about the commune. Q: YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DE SCRIBED THE POONA ASHRAM TO ME AS HAVING MANY LUSH GARDEN S, AND WHEN THIS RANCH WAS FIRST PURCHASED IT WAS ALMOST WORTHLESS DESERT LAND. A: Yes. Q:... WHAT DID YOU THINK, OR WH AT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION WHEN YOU FIRST CAME AND SAW THE LAND HERE? A: I did not like it, because I have always liked greenery and this was a desert, so I was not impressed. I told my people that they have to change this place into an oasis, and in these four years we have do ne much. Just four years more, and it will not be a desert anymore. We will make it lush green. Q: ALL OVER? YOU WILL TURN THE WHOLE RANCH INTO AN OASIS? A: No. There is no need. Just Rajneeshpuram , the city. An over, I would like it as it is, as a remembrance; all over I will keep it as it is, as a remembrance of how it used to be and what we have done to it. Mountains have also their beauty, naked. The juniper -- that is the only tree around here -- has its own beauty and strength. We will make many lakes... we have already made one, one was already there. We will make many lakes, and we have created a small river just with rain water. We are growing our food , we are working in the fields, we have"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"our own vegetable gardens, our own flo wer gardens, our own greenhouses. So whatsoever we want to do we can do. And now I can see that it was good to have a desert. It has given us a challenge, and challenge brings creativity to function. And it is far more enjoyable that all the trees and all the lakes and all the greenery have been made by us. It is our creation, it is not second-hand. Q: IT HAS BEEN SAID TO ME THAT YOU LEFT POONA IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. IS THIS TRUE? A: Certainly true! Q: THE IMPLICATION BEING THAT YO U SNEAKED AWAY, AS OPPOSED TO ANNOUNCING IT.... A: That is wrong. Q: CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR ME HOW YOU LEFT POONA? A: I left in my Rolls Royce, and not in th e dead of the night. I left Poona in the day, in the midday sun, with two Rolls Royces, three Mercedes Benz. With five cars I left in the middle of the day. I left BOMBAY at midnig ht, because the plane leaves at midnight. What could I do? Q: DO YOU ENVISION RAJNEESHPURAM BECOMING A CITY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE MORE PERMANENT SANNYASIN RESIDENTS THAN THERE ARE NOW? A: Certainly. Q: IN A SELF-SUSTAINING WAY, I MEAN; A LARGER VEGETABLE FARM AND...? A: Yes. Q: HOW DO YOU ENVISION RAJNEESHP URAM GROWING AS A CITY? BY HUNDREDS, OR THOUSANDS, OR...? A: Nothing can be said about that. But it is growing, and I don't see any reason except a third world war to prevent Rajneeshpuram from growing. Q: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT YOUR DAY IS LIKE? GETTING BACK TO.... I'M SERVING READERS WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT..."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"NONE OF WHOM, EXCEPT FOR A FEW, HAVE EVER BEEN HERE, AND THEY ARE CURIOUS ABOUT YOU. A: It is all over ecstasy. Q: I'M SORRY? A: It is all over ecstasy. I enjoy ever ything. I enjoy my breakfast, I enjoy my lunch, I enjoy my supper, and I enjoy my sweets before I go to sleep. Just please don't tell my physicians. Q: WHAT DO YOU DO DURING THE DAY? A: I am completely engaged. In the morning I speak to my sannyasins for two and a half hours. In the night I meet medi a people as long as they want; and after the media has left, Sheela has her work -- she is my secretary -- for one hour, two hours, as much as she need s. A few things I have abso lutely private: three hours in my bathroom, one and a half hours in the morning, and one and a half hours in the evening. That's my luxury. So metime you should come and see my bathroom. Q: I'LL ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION ANY TIME! A: Good! Because it is almost a temple to me, and my people have created such a beautiful bathroom because they knew I lo ve big things! I have a swimming pool only for myself, olympic size. You should see my garage -- almost one hundred Rolls Royces. And my people have improved upon them. Q: HOW? A: They have painted them better. They have changed many faults that were there. Even the president of the Rolls Ro yce company in America was here to see, and he remarked that there is no other garage where a Rolls Royce is treated in this way. Just because I use them, my pe ople take care of them. They have painted my Rolls Royces in psychedelic colors. Q: IF I COULD BACK UP FOR A MINUTE.... WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND WHEN THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TO OREGON AND WHEN YOU ARRIVED HERE, DID YOU HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS OR WERE YOU SURPRISED AT THE KIND OF RECEPTION THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM OREGONIANS, WHO ARE AMERICANS, WHO ARE CITIZENS OF A COUNTRY THAT WAS FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM?"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" A: I was not only surprised, I was utterly disappointed, because I have always respected America. I had always thought that democracy really exists here. I have been always against the Soviet Un ion and its dictatorial government, but when I came here I found it is another So viet Union -- perhaps the dictatorship is more sophisticated, the democracy only a mask -- because our people have been treated so badly, and they are continuous ly harassed for no reason at all. Their ways of harassment are really ugly, fascist. Democracy exists only in the Constitution. Perhaps for Christians there is democracy and freedom of religion, but not for us. And I want the whole world to know that there is nothing much to choose between the Soviet Union and America, only that the Soviet Union is straightforward, frankly accepting that it is a dictatorship of the proletariat. America is a hypocrite. Q: CAN YOU ENVISION YOURSELF EVER RETURNING TO INDIA? A: No, for the simple reason that that 's not my lifestyle. I never return to anything. What is past is past. I have ch anged places many times, in India too, but once I have left a place, I have never visited it again. So, seeing my pattern of the past, a logical conclusion is that I'm not going anywhere -- particularly because of this hostility, this hypocritical democracy I have to fight here. We are fighting in so many courts, and we will go on fighting up to the Supreme Court. Either they have to be fair with us and democratic, or we are going to expose them all over the world as another dictator ship -- not of the proletariat, but of the super-rich. Q: YOU DESCRIBED YOURSELF, I THIN K IN AN INTERVIEW, AS THE RICH MAN'S GURU. A: I am. Q: CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR ME WH AT THAT MEANS? AND HOW THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM, SAY, A POOR MANS GURU? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A STATE OF MIND, OR A STATE OF THE POCKETBOOK? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT STATE OF MIND -- THAT THE RICH HAVE A DIFFERENT STATE OF MIND THAN THE POOR -- OR ARE YOU MERELY TALKING ABOUT ECONOMICS? A: I am talking in all the dimensions. A man can be reached in many ways, and economics is not excluded. He can be re ached in music, he can be reached in poetry, he can be reached in wealth. All need a certain kind of intelligence to create; and when I say I am a rich man's guru, I mean I am the Master of all those who are creators in any dimension of life . Of course, the poor man cannot create,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"he cannot even manage his physical survival. You cannot expect him to understand Van Gogh or the theory of relativity or Bertrand Russell. And if he cannot understand Bertrand Russell, he cannot understand me. I have doubts whether Bertrand Russell woul d be able to understand me or not, most probably not, because he never medi tated in his whole, long life. He lived almost a century, and he went on denying the existence of God without even bothering to look into himself Not a sing le moment in a cent ury-long life did he sit down and look into himself to ask if he is only a body or there is something more to it. And if the body is just th e outer shell of something which is not material, that means this whole existence is full of life. Even the soul has to be in a tree, if the tree is alive. To me, life is God. There is no other God th an life. And to experience life, there is no other way than meditation. So, naturally , it is difficult for the poor people. You cannot hope that Ethiopians will come to meditate here; nor am I going there to teach them meditation. Their need is different. I fulfill the needs of those who are hungry for something higher than bread and butter. And you ask me what it means to be a poor man's guru. It means Mother Teresa, Pope the Polack, these are the people who are the gurus of the poor, because those poor people can be converted to Ch ristianity very easily. Just give them a little support economically, financially; give them schools, hospitals, free food, free milk for their children. Th at is enough, but that is no t religion. That is simply purchasing people, making them Christians on financial grounds. They are simply playing a politics of numbers. They want that poor people should go on existing, because that is from where they can get Christians. In India, I have not seen a single rich man who has converte d to Christianity. I have seen beggars, poor people, hungry people, dying people, sick people being converted to Christianity, but I have not seen a painter, a musician, a poet, a wealthy man turning to Christianity. In fact, exactly the opposite is happening. All the great painters of the West, all the musicians, all the dancers, all those who can think intelligently have dropped out of Christianity. With them I can have a communion -- very easily. The pope cannot have a communion with Je an-Paul Sartre, it is impossible. The pope will look retarded before Jean-Pau l Sartre. He will not be able even to understand what Jean-Paul Sartre is talk ing about: anguish, meaninglessness -- these are the poor man's guru. Up to no w, the world was only divided into the poor and the rich. I have made a new divi sion: the poor man's guru and the rich man's guru.

Q: I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE, AND I HAVE SEEN THE DRIVEBYS, AND I THINK I HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT SANNYASINS ARE EXPERIENCING DURING THE DRIVEBY.

Perhaps I start feelin g: I am certainly the Blessed One -- so much love I don't think anybody has rece ived ever. Jesus had only twelve fools around him. Q: DO YOU HAVE DOUBTS THAT YOU ARE THE BLESSED ONE? A: Not doubts... I am a perfectly Blessed One. I was just joking a little bit. Q: YOU DON'T GO OUT DRIVING ANYMORE AROUND HERE, IS THAT CORRECT? A: Not every day now. When I was not speaking, when I was in silence, I wanted to see my sannyasins every day... that's why the driveby was invented. Now I am seeing them in the morning for two and a half hours every day, so there is no need. But we have four celebrations aroun d the year.

I'VE DONE MANY ARTICLES ABOUT RAJNEESHEES; I DID SOME ABOUT G EETAM ASHRAM, AND I'VE DONE SEVERAL ABOUT UTSAVA IN LAGU NA BEACH, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET THE CHANCE TO COME HE RE! THAT TAKES CARE OF MY QUESTIONS! THEY SAID IT WAS SAFE TO T ELL YOU THAT I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS! ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE RE AD THAT YOU'VE SAID, AND I'VE HEARD YOU SAY IT ON VIDEOTAPE, IS THAT YOU TELL A FEW JOKES TO WAKE THE WORLD UP. WHEN DID THE WORLD GO TO SLEEP? AND IS IT WAKING UP? ANSWER: It has been always asleep. Only a few individuals in the whole history of man have been awakened. Their names can be counted on the ten fingers, not more than that. And it was natural. Man has evolved out of the animals. Animals are in a deep sleep, but they don't know that they are. That is the meaning of sleep: one is, but one is not aware that one is. No animal is aware of himself. I agree with Charles Darwin on different grounds. His grounds are ordinary, mundane, and can be criticized, have been criticized. In fact, he is no longer an accepted scientist about the evolution of humanity. The majority of scientists have deserted him. But I support him on a totally different ground. My ground is looking at man's sleep. This is the only possibility, that he has grown up from the animals -- monkeys, chimpanzees, what soever, whosoever was there in the beginning. Man's sleep proves it. And only rarely, once in a while, a Gautam Buddha, a Bodhidharma, a Socrates.... Once in a while there has been a man who has the guts to come out of sleep. It needs tremendous courage to come ou t of sleep because we have so much invested in sleep. It is just like a man who is dreaming that he is living in a"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"golden palace, with a great kingdom, with all the luxuries, and you try to wake him up. He is just a beggar on the street . Only beggars dream of being emperors; emperors never dream of being emperors. That will be simply illogical. The beggar has so much investment in his sl eep and his dream that he will resist being awakened in every possible way. He will get irritated, he will oppose you, \"Who are you to interfere in my life? Can't you even tolerate a man who is having a sweet dream?\" And even if you force him to be awakened, he is going to fall asleep again, because waking he is only a beggar... asleep he becomes an emperor. The investment in psychological sleep is tremendous. That's why all those people -- Gautam Buddha, Bodhidharma, Chuang Tz u, Plotinus, Heraclitus have failed. They did their best; they struggled agai nst the sleep of man, but still man is asleep, and whatever he is doing proves that he is asleep. The two world wars prove that he is as leep. The coming third world war can be prevented only if we can awaken enough pe ople so that they become infectious and go on awakening other people in a ch ain. And it has to be done so fast, because there is not much time. Otherw ise, the sleepy people are going to destroy this earth, this life. Politicians are asleep. No awakened person can become a politician for the simple reason that he cannot lie. He canno t give you promises that he knows can never be fulfilled. No awakened person will be a politician, because he has no desire for his ego to be fulfilled. Ther e is no ego any more. Ego exists as a substitute self in sleep; the moment you are awakened, ego has no function, it is useless. You are there, now you don't need it. And the man who knows himself has no inferiority complex. Unless you are suffering from some inferiority complex, you will not be involved in any kind of leadership, political, religious, social. Yo u don't have the base. The inferiority complex is the cause of everybody becoming ambitious. If they don't become somebody in the world, in their own eyes they have failed. They want to prove themselves: \"We are here! We have been here!\" They want their names to be recorded in history, although they know that even the greatest names in history, by and by, go on slipping from promin ence, become footnotes, move into the appendix and out the door. Naturally, ho w many people can we go on carrying? -- but they want to make their names. That, too, proves something animal. All the animals of the world have an in stinct; scientists call it the territorial imperative. The dog pissing on the tree is simply making his signature. He is saying, \"This tree belongs to me.\" He won't allow another dog to come near. Other dogs will smell his urine and will know that this tree is not free, not available, that somebody possesses it. Th ere are animals, particularly lions, who will go on urinating on a vast territory just so that everybody is aware that if they come there, they will be getting into danger. Man also works in the same way. All these nations are nothing but people pissing and making a boundary: this is Ame rica, this is Soviet Union, this is"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"India. You can smell it is a different co untry, so don't enter without a visa, without a passport. Otherwise, there is no need for any nations on the earth. What is the need? Can't we all live as one humanity? It would be tremendously beautiful and tremendously beneficial... be cause if the whole world is one, you cannot create wars. Unless you find some planets and start creating wars with them, there is no possibility of war. The only way to let war disappear is to make the world one, with a functional world government, with no political pa rties in the world, each individual choosing on his own, nobody propagating, nobody trying to get more votes. If we can create a functional world government which only takes care of things like railways, post office, telegraph, telephone -- things which are essential and should be taken care of by the whole commune around the e arth -- seventy-five percent of all the nations' income will be freed. It is now being poured out for weapons: atom bombs, nuclear weapons and other weapons. People are dying. In Ethiopia they are dy ing, thousands a day. In India they are starving, and soon other countries will foll ow. This third world of poor countries is there because of your politicians. A man who is awake cannot be a politician. He cannot be a religious leader, either, be cause these are all ego claims: I am the prophet of God; I am the messiah; I am somebody special sent from God; you are just ordinary human creatures, I am divi ne. This is simply sickness of the mind. These people are suffering from inferiori ty complex and covering it by fictions. Q: WHO ARE YOU? A: I am just myself. No prophet, no me ssiah, no Christ. Just an ordinary human being... just like you. Q: WELL, NOT QUITE! A: That's true... not quite! You are still asleep -- but that is not much of a difference. One day I was also asleep; on e day you will be able to awaken. You can wake up this moment, nobody is pr eventing it. So the difference is just meaningless. A person who is capable of being asleep is capable of being awake. Q: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS GOD? A: No. Q: WHAT IS WITHIN US? YOU TALK ABOUT TURNING INWARD. WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN? A: First, let us finish God; otherwise, he will interfere again an d again. God is just a projection of the ego. As ego is false and a substitute for a true self, God is the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"ego of the whole world -- a substitute se lf, because our egos cannot exist without support. They need universal suppo rt, and God gives immense support. When I say go inwards... you are not going to find God at all. You are going to find a pure, silent consciousness, and yo u are going to realize immediately that the same consciousness pervades all. I call it godliness, not God, because this is a quality. Don't give it a personality, don' t confine it into a person. Let it remain free, flowing. It is more like a fragran ce than like a flower. A flower can be painted, a flower can be photographed; a fragrance can only be experienced, you cannot photograph it, you cannot paint it. It is a quality far superior to the personal God. It is an impersonal co nsciousness, universal consciousness. Q: DOESN'T THAT SEEM SORT OF BORING? A: Boring? Q: YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE SAME. A: Yes. To an asleep person, it is boring . The person who is asleep needs colorful dreams, changes -- every night, marriage, divorce, job change. The asleep person becomes bored very easily for the simple reason that his joy is derived from something, it is not coming from his own inner source. I have never been bored since I came to kn ow myself. I have been trying in every possible way. Eating the same food for years, I don't get bored. Sleeping at the same time, waking at the same time, doing the same thing round the clock for years, I don't get bored because there is no comparison with the past, there is no comparison with the future. Boredom needs comparison. You have to reme mber that this rose is nothing new: you have seen it yesterday, you have s een it the day before yesterday. You are bored. And slowly your boredom create s a barrier between you and the rose. You cannot smell it any more, you cannot see it any more. Although you see it, you cannot see its newness, its freshness. The rose that you had seen yesterday is not the same rose. It has the same quali ty, the same fragrance, but it has its own individuality. When you feel a cosmic consciousness, you are not lost like a dewdrop in the ocean. For the first time your individuality is revealed to you. For the first time you know the luminous being that you al ways have been; that you will always be immortal, that now there is no death. There is a tremendo us insight into the beauty and the grace of things, and it goes on becoming bigger and bigger, fresher and fresher. It is not that it remains the same -- the universal energy is a constant growth. That's why I wanted to finish with Go d in the first place, because God cannot grow. Where will he grow? He is perfect. Now perfection cannot grow. He"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"knows all; what more is there for him to know? He is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent... and don't you get bored with God? My godliness is imperfect; it is an opening, always bigger and bigger. It is expanding, and there are no limits to its expansion. And each moment is a discovery for the awakened man. In sm all things -- sipping the tea in the morning,the smell of the tea.... The taste of th e tea is so new, it is as new as the sun rising outside the window. It depends on how conscious you are to make the world new every moment. It is already new every moment; nothing is stat ic, everything is changing, in a flux. The tree that you had left at home, by the time you go back a few leaves may have died, the wind may have taken them. A few new leaves may have come up, a few flowers may have fallen to the ground, a few new buds may have opened. It is only to a sleeping man that the tree is the same. To the aw akened man, it is new every moment. Heraclitus said, \"You cannot step in the same river twice.\" And I say to you that you cannot step even once in the same river, because while your feet touch the surface of the river, it is flowing. Your feet go into the river, and it is flowing. By the time your feet have touched the botto m, it is not the same river you touched on the surface. Heraclitus is wrong. Many people have sa id Heraclitus is wrong, that the world is permanent. I say it from a totally di fferent direction -- and I know Heraclitus will have to agree with me, because I am not contradicting his basic standpoint, I am refining When he says you cannot step twice, he is trying to say that everything is changing, the wife is not the same, the husband is not the same. If people are awake, I don't think there will be so mu ch despair, gloom, grumpiness, so many complaints about everything. The husband is bored because it is the same wife, the same geography he has to explore ev ery day. The wife is also bored; the moment the husband starts making an approach, immediately she has a heart attack, a headache, anything will do, but somehow...\"at least one holiday. Just go to sleep silently. Don't disturb me.\" And this is the same woman who had been dreaming about this man one day, writin g beautiful poems and letters to him -- and this is the same man. What has happened? What went wrong? Wh y are they thinking to divorce each other? They have become bored, and they think that the othe r is responsible for the boredom. My point is that your sl eep is responsible for all boredom. No divorce is going to help. The other person will bore you just the same. Q: WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO WAKE SOMEONE UP? A: It needs people who can shock you. Your sleep is deep; it is no ordinary sleep, it is spiritual sleep. You need people who can shock you and break all your shock"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"absorbers. Every person has grown buffers around his sleep. Even if a shock is given, the buffers absorb it. It never reaches to the person. The real function of a religious man is to teach how to break the buffers, how to come out of the shell of darkness in which you have been living for many lives. No prayer is going to help . Only a Master can help yo u -- and by a Master I mean a craftsman who has broken his own b uffers, who has somehow sneaked out of the shell of sleep. That is the function of a Master. But all the so-called religious leaders go on putting more buffers on you. Q: I JUST SPENT TWO WEEKS COVERING BILLY GRAHAM, WHO IS A SOUTHERN BAPTIST EVANGELIST. A: I know him. Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM? A: Just worthless, and dangerous to peop le's spirituality, because these people like Billy Graham, who are helping people , comforting people, consoling people, are making their buffers thicker and thic ker. These are not the people who shock you. You need a Gurdjieff, you need a Krishnamurti, not Billy Graham. Billy Graham is simply a good salesman amon gst sleepers. And, of course, sleepers will be very much impressed. This ma n is giving them what they want. When you come to a person like Gurdjieff, he is not going to give you what you want, he is going to give you what re ally is your need, because the wanting comes from your sleep, and your need comes from your real being. So, a man like Gurdjieff will not have gatherings lik e Billy Graham. He will shock you so much that you will never come near him again. Billy Graham is good entertainment, with nothing spiritual in it. Q: WELL, RAJNEESHEES LOVE YOU. ARE YOU GIVING THEM WHAT THEY WANT? A: No. NEVER! I am giving them what they need. Q: THEN WHY ARE THEY STILL HERE? A: Because they have started lovi ng the shocks that I give them. Q: DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY ARE AWAKE? A: Getting.... Taking time.... Turning this side and that side, pulling up the blanket, but I am after them! No blanke t can help, no tossing and turning can"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"help. I will do everything to force them to jump out of the bed. And I have all kinds of devices so they cannot sleep. Q: LIKE WHAT? A: Like my methods of meditation. You have to breathe so heavily for ten minutes that not only will you start awak ening, but somebody else sitting near by will start wondering what is happening . In the dynamic meditation, they have to scream for ten minutes. Whatsoever it feels like: shouting, roaring, screaming. These are methods to break their buffers. I have lived in many cities and finally I de cided that I cannot live in a city. It is impossible, because every day the neighb ors were complaining to the police that they cannot sleep in the morning: \"T his man gathers people who scream and jump and dance and sing and do all kind s of crazy things. And we are tired and we want to sleep. Even on Sunday mornin g, these people won't leave you alone. Just at five o'clock they start....\" I have 112 methods of hitting you. If one misses, another will do. Q: DO YOU ONLY HIT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HIT? A: Certainly. I never hit anybody who does not want to be hit. That's why I never go anywhere. You have to come to me, because otherwise that is against the freedom of the individual. If he wants to sleep, it is his decision, and he is completely free to sleep. If he wants to hang around Billy Graham, who am I to create any disturbance and tell him that he is hanging around an idiot? Q: WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFRAID OF YOU? A: Just because of the way I hit and shak e and wake you. They don't want to wake up, they want to go on sleeping. They really want only consolations, not revolutions in their lives. They want to be consoled, \"Don't be worried, Jesus Christ will take care of you. Just have faith in Jesus Christ, and that's enough. Don't be worried. Have faith and you will be saved -- he is the savior.\" This is a consolation. You start feeling yo u have to do nothing, only at the most go to the church on Sunday morning and have faith in Jesus Christ, which costs nothing. Yes, one day it used to cost. That time it was significant. Q: WOULDN'T JESUS BE PRETTY UP SET WITH THE SCENE THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING? I MEAN, HE SAID THINGS LIKE, \"TAKE UP YOUR CROSS, \" AND \"LOSE YOUR LIFE TO FIND IT , \" WHICH ISN'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

I READ ALL THESE WIRE STORIES THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY ASKED YOU IF YOU'RE THE GURU TO THE RICH. AND THERE ARE ALL THESE ROLLS ROYCES AND THERE'S ALL THIS MONEY, ALL THIS STUFF... THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, AND IT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T COME FROM NOWHERE. WHAT DOES WAKING UP HAVE TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD? A: That, too, is giving a shock to the whole world. I can manage even with the oldest model of Ford -- the same mode l in which God drove Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden -- but that will not shock anybody, not even the Oregonians. Even they have better four-w heelers. All my efforts are to shock people. My ninety Rolls Royces have shocked millions of people around the earth. Can you see the joke? And I am going to make them 365, one for every day. That will give heart attacks to many people -- but I wonder what it has to do with them. It has nothing to do with them, but they are certainly shocked. Q: WHY DO YOU CARE? A: I care out of my compassion. It comes with the cosmic consciousness itself. It is a quality of cosmic consciousness; you cannot separate it. Q: A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE WORLD COMING TO AN END -- EARTHQ UAKES, FLOODS AND WARS AND THINGS. IS THAT STILL HAPPENING ? DO YOU STILL SEE THAT COMING TO HAPPEN? A: I will go on saying yes, it is going to happen, because if it is emphasized continuously that it is going to happen, it can be prevented from happening. If the whole world becomes alert that it is coming close, something has to be done to prevent it. Politicians go on saying, \"Don't be worried , nothing is going to happen.\" It is the same as they were saying before the se cond world war, before the first world war: \"Don't be worried, we will take care; and God is with us.\" The third world war can happen only if people are not alerted beforehand. If people are alerted in every country, in America and Soviet Russia, then these same people will hang their politicians rather than have a third world war. This will be far better, when I see the presiden t of America hanging from the tree, and by his side the Soviet prime minister an d the queen of England.... Just hang all"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"these people on one tree, make it a great memorial, and be fini shed with the third world war. I have been saying those things becaus e they are possible; but if you say to people that they are only possible, then they think there is nothing to be worried about, it is only a possibility, far away. People don't see that far ahead; they don't have that farsightedness. They are too much occupied in their day-to-day affairs. They have to be hammered continuously to realize that the war is coming closer, that the holocaust is coming closer and something has to be done to prevent it. My prediction is not the prediction of an astrologer. I don't mean that it is bound to happen, that it is destined to happen, no; I am not an astrologer. My prediction comes from a man who wants that it shou ld not happen. And the only way is to emphasize that it is going to happen -- it is almost certain -- unless you wake up. Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ODDS ARE? A: Not much. I am here. My people are around the world. We are going to make a great fuss. And we are not going to pray to God -- that I can leave to Billy Graham -- God has never helped. For five thousand years the wars have been continuing, an d in every war God has been asked to help. And sometimes it is very hilarious: the Germans were asking the Christian God to help th em; the English were asking the same Christian God to help them, the French were asking the same Christian God to help them, the Americans were asking th e same Christian God to help them, Mussolini was asking the same Christian God to help him. I have heard a story that after the war ended, one German general was staying with an English friend. Just at the tea ta ble the talk drifted towards the second world war. The German said, \"I have al ways wondered what went wrong. We were strong, we had a rare leader, we had unity, we had a strong nation. What went wrong?\" The Englishman said, \"Perhaps you forgot to pray to God.\" The German said, \"No! We were praying to God every day. All our armies were praying to God every day.\" The Englishman laughed and sa id, \"Then I know what is wrong. You must be praying in German, and God unde rstands only English! Next time, don't do that... pray in English, and then see.\" We are not going to pray. There is nobo dy to whom prayers can be addressed. But we can create a great fuss among the masses around the world. And we are going to, if the moment comes. Right now I am gathering my people and they are coming in thousands every day. Around the world I have communes just like this. Even in the Soviet Union I have my sannyasins. Of course, they have to be underground there, they have to meet in basements. The Soviet government is already persec uting my sannyasins, although they are not wearing the red clothes, not wearing the mala, so there is no reason for them to find out. But even if somebody ha s one of my books, that's enough; or"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"somebody has my picture in his house, th at's enough. One person is caught, and they persecute the person, they harass the pe rson to the point that he has to give addresses of others, other contacts. But, strangely enough, the more they are persecuting, the more new young people are becoming sannyasins in the Soviet Union itself. We will create as much disturbance as po ssible to prevent the third world war, because it is not only a qu estion of some nation bein g victorious and some other nation being defeated. If it was only that, I would not have cared. It is a question that nobody will be victorious, nobody will be defeated, and all life will disappear from this beautiful planet. Q: IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TALK TO THE PRESS, AND ALSO TO START TALKING AGAIN? BECAUSE IT'S SOMEHOW THE MOMENT? A: Certainly! That is one of the most impo rtant reasons I have started to talk to the press. I want the word to be spre ad through all possibl e media. And I don't belong to the past and past methods; I am a contemporary man -- perhaps belonging to the twenty-first century. I will use every way of approach ing people in as many directions as possibl e, because we don't have much time. The decisive moment will come by the end of this century. In the coming fifteen years, the nuclear wea pons will have piled up so much that the politicians will be under a great pressure -- what to do now? Except a nuclear war, they will not be able to see any othe r possibility. Already so many nuclear, atomic and other weapons exist on the e arth that they can destroy this earth seven times. They can kill each person seven times. And the poor people in the world are not Jesus Christ that they wi ll be resurrected. Once dead, they will remain dead. Even Jesus Christ was never resurrected. It is a fiction. Once a man dies, he dies. Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, th at is true, because he was brought down from the cross within six hours, and to die on the Jewish cross in those days a person needed to hang at least forty- eight hours. Because the blood would ooze slowly out of his hands and legs, it took twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Jesus was brought down after six hours... and then he disappeared from the cave. This was a simple conspiracy between a rich disciple of Jesus' and Pontius Pilate. Jesus escaped from Israel, and died in India, in Kashmir. I have been to his grave. His grave is there. It is a strange coin cidence that Moses also died in Kashmir, not in Israel. When they found Israel, Mose s was already out of date. It took forty years for him to find a third-rate place lik e Israel. In forty years, almost all his contemporaries were gone -- it was a tediou s journey, hungry, thirsty -- only one- third of the original people remained. Meanwhile, children were being born, and by the time he reached Israel, he could not feel any connection with his own people. The first generation gap was"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"felt by Moses. A new generation had come which had no idea of Egypt, of their slavery. That all looked like mythology. He found a way out because one of the tribes of the Jews was lost somewhere on the journey. It was just an excuse, \"Now that we have found the holy land, yo u settle and I will go in search of the lost tribe\" -- and that tribe had reached Kashmir. Kashmir is completely Jewish, although there are no Jews. They have all been forced to become Mohammedans, but you can see from their noses that they are nobody else than Jews. Moses died in Kashmir. He must have been ancient by the time he reached Kashmir. His grave is th ere; Jesus' grave is there. Jesus lived long in India. When he was crucified, he was only thirty-three, and he died at the very ripe age of 112. That is inscribed in Hebrew on his grave, but in India nobody knows Hebrew. These are the only two graves in which the head of the dead person is not pointed towards Mecca. The other graves are Mohammedan. When Mohammedans make a grave, the head has to be pointed in the direction of Mecca. If the feet are put towards Mecca, it is a great sin. So all the graves are directed towards Mecca; only these two graves are not. And both the graves have Hebrew inscripti ons. Of course, Jesus' grave is not inscribed JESUS CHRIST, because that is a Greek translation of the Hebrew, JOSHUA, THE MESSIAH. Messiah means Christ, in Greek, and Joshua got changed to Jesus in Greek. On the grave it is absolutely clear, but Christians are not interested. I talked with prominent Christians -- I talked one time with Stanley Jones, a world famous Christian theologian -- but th ey were not ready even to go there. I said, \"On my expense you come with me and I will show you the grave of Jesus.\" And it is strange that Christians are taking no interest in it -- but if it is proved that this is the real grave of Jesus Christ, then there will be trouble. Their whole Bible will be upset. Q: THIS MORNING IN DISCOURSE YOU SAID THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS A SLAVE IS A SLAVE TO THAT SLAV E. AND I WONDER, WATCHING THE TWO MEN WITH GUNS AND READIN G ABOUT THE THREATS ON YOUR LIFE AND THE THREATS ON THIS COMMUNITY, WHAT PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THAT KIND OF HARM ARE ENSLAVED TO? AND I WONDER IF YOU'RE AFRAID? A: I am not afraid; otherwise, I would be carrying the gun. But the people who love me are concerned, and I don't prev ent anybody. I don't prevent any assassin even. If he comes I will say, \"Hi! Do your job the best you can.\" I will not prevent him, so why should I prevent my people if they want guards? Let them have them. Those guns in a nuclear age are only toys; they mean nothing. Why should I prevent them? They are not carrying nu clear missiles on each side, just toy guns."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"I respect their love. Whatsoever those people can do they are ready to do it. It is out of respect for their love that I don' t object to those guns, and I know that those guns mean nothing. In this world a bomb can just be thrown on this small commune, and you can create an American Hiroshima. What will those guns do? And it will be good that America al so has one Hiroshima, otherwise you are missing something. Japan has two, Hiroshima and Nagasaki; you should at least have one. And my commune is here, available. I don't object to their guns. They have not done any harm to anybody in four years, and they are not going to do any harm to anybody. Perhaps this is the only place in the whole world where there is no crime, no fighting, no theft, no rape, no murder, no suicide. We have the poli ce sitting uselessly. I have my guards, but they must be getting bored with thei r guns. I don't think they will have any chance to use them, but my people are co ncerned.

A: I don't have any relationship with human beings. Q: THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED, ALTHOUGH.... A:... And that is not what I have answered . I know what you have asked. First, get over your nervousness. Q: I THOUGHT IT WAS GONE. A: No. It happens to every journalist, so don't be worried. I love mankind, but the way they are, they need immense changes. Because I propose those changes, they become hostile. They think I am ta king away very precious things from them. I am taking away only their chains, but they have been in those chains for centuries. They have already accepted them as ornaments, so my compassion and my love and my concern only create hostility in them. In the French Revolution it happened th at there was in France a castle, Bastille, where they used to imprison people who were sentenced to remain in prison till they die. Their hands and legs were ch ained with heavy chains, and they were put in dark cells with no light. Even in the day it was night. When the French Revoluti on happened the revolutionaries thought that those people should be freed. They went to free them, but those people fought against the revolutionaries, saying, \"We don't wa nt to go out of the prison. We are comfortable here, and now to get into the world again, to thin k of earning your bread again.... We have been here for forty years and may be living just a few years more. At this stage we are not in a po sition to come out. In fact, even the"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"sun makes us afraid. We have lived these forty years in darkness. Have mercy on us. Just leave us where we are.\" But revolutionaries are always fanatic people. They forced them, they threw them out of the castle and took away thei r chains. You will not believe it, but half of those prisoners returned to thei r cells in the night and asked the revolutionaries who were holding the castle, \"Please, chain us again. We miss our chains. That weight has become part of us . We cannot sleep. If we do not feel the chains, we cannot sleep\" That is the situation of humanity, so many chains: God, heaven, hell, Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, communist. All kinds of chains are there -- political, social, psycho logical, spiritual -- and I am speaking against them all. I want to cut them. Naturally, they feel offended. They canno t understand me, but I can understand them. I'm not hostile towards them; they are hostile. I don't feel badly that they are hostile towards me. The hostility went so far that efforts were made on my life in India. But still I can understand thei r problem, so I will not go to them; I will wait here and spread the message. And I particularly depend on the youn g generation, the intelligent people around the world. And they are getting in terested in it. I don't have anybody retarded, average. You can meet my pe ople and you can meet Billy Graham's people and you can see the difference. Most of these people have been professors, doctors, engineers; they have degrees, Ph.D., D.Litt. Almost everybody is at least a university graduate. These are intelligent people, not gullible. Billy Graham cannot impress a sing le sannyasin; and, of course, I cannot impress anybody from Billy Graham's audience. Anything I say will create hostility, enmity. That is the art I have been practicing my whole life, how to influence people and create enemies. So I have stopped influe ncing... I am just here, and if anybody feels thirsty the well is available. If you do n't feel thirsty it is your business, but I'm not preventing you from drinking from my well. I'm available, but I will not even call you to come and drink from my well. The well is there, open, available, so those who are intelligent are going to be caught in my net sooner or later. And I want only the intelligent people, because they are the people who will be able to prevent what is going to happen to humanity. The ordinary masses and the crowds, the cr ipples and the blin d and the sick who go to Billy Graham for some spiritual miracle, to be healed, they are not my people. If somebody is sick, we have a ho spital. I don't think there has ever been any miracle in the world, or that there can ever be. Everything happens according to existential laws. If someti me you see something like a miracle, you have to do some research and find how it happened. Mostly it is psychological. There is psychological blindness."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Now it is a known fact that if a person does not want to see, somewhere deep down in his psychology he has come to the conclusion that he does not want to see. Perhaps he loved a woman who de ceived him, and sh e was the one for whom he wanted his eyes always to be there. Now he does not want to see anybody, and a miracle happens: he goes blind. Nothing is wrong with his physiology; the eye specialist cannot find anything wrong with his eyes, the eye hospital cannot help him. Billy Graham can help him. But he was not blind, and that is why he has started seeing again. He was simply psychologically blind. He really needed a great crowd of believers around him shouting hallelujah, the glory of God, the miracles of Jesus. This whole atmosphere around him makes him courageo us enough to see again. The credit should simply go to the crowd, but it goes to Billy Graham. Nothing happens in nature which is against the universal laws. Q: DO THOSE LAWS CHANGE? A: No. The universal laws never change . Everything changes according to the universal laws, but the universal law itself never changes. Q: WHERE DID IT COME FROM? A: It is always here. It does not come from anywhere. Why should it come from anywhere? The question is absurd. If I sa y it comes to New York, you will ask me from where it came in New York. The qu estion is absurd, because whatsoever answer is given, the question will remain the same: from where did it come, from where God came? Nobody asks such a simple question: from where God came? From New York? New Jersey? I have co me from New Jersey, but from where God came? Universal law is to me exactly what God is to the believer, to the faithful. But calling it universal law makes a tremendous difference. You cannot worship a law, you cannot pray to a law; the law has no ears, no eyes. The law goes on functioning the way it has always functio ned. It won't change for any prayer. All prayers are simply asking that you should be treated as an exception. Somebody is praying to God, \"I am blind, please give me eyes.\" In the first place he is distrusting God... because God made him blind. He wants to change God's mind: \"Please give my eyes back\"and he is ready to bribe God, \"I will believe in you, I will worship you. I will go every Sunday to the church. I will donate to the church, to the congregation.\" These are all bribes: \"Give me my eyes back.\" These simple people -- most of them simpletons -- who gather around Billy Graham and people like him can be easily exploited. All the religious leaders of the world have been doing that for ce nturies in the name of God. All the religions... not only Christianity."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"My religion is more a science than a religion . If somebody is sick, he should go to the hospital. We have a beautiful hospital here. If somebody needs education, he should go to the university. We have our own university here. If somebody is feeling anxiety, anguish, tension, nervousness, he should go to the meditation classes. If somebody is having some problems about relationships -- wife and husband and children and friends -- we ha ve therapy groups for him. For every need we have a scientific process. But a miracle is not possible here... beca use I don't want to exploit gullible people. And what is the point? The worl d is on the threshold of committing global suicide, and somebody makes a small miracle, gives some solace to one human being, when the whole of humanity is on the brink. It is stupid. These people should think on a larger scale. I am absolutely concerned because I see what is going to happen if humanity remains the way it is. But the problem is that if people are not going to listen to me, then it is their business. As far as I am concerned, my work is finished. If this earth simply dies out, it makes no difference to me. I am making an effort with my people that whether the third world war happens or not, you get enlightened! Be awake! -- because this earth may not be able to survive after this century. Only fifteen years are left. It is a great device, too. When you are challenged with global death and the gap is only fifteen years, you have to thin k about yourself. For the first time, you cannot go on living the same old way, doing the same old stupid things. Something essential that can bring a transformation to your being before the world comes to an end becomes significan t. So if my people are awakened, I don't care. If those people don't unders tand, let them have the third world war. Let them be satisfied to their hearts' content. Q: DO YOU THINK THINGS LIKE BIOENGINEERING WOULD PRODUCE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO WANT TO BE AWAKE? A: I believe in bioengineering. I want science to create a better man in every way, but the problem is that all the governme nts are forcing the scientists to create more and more destructive weapons. They are forcing them into the service of death. I would like all the scientists to be in th e service of life. Then bioengineering certainly can create far superior men, he althier, more talented. In fact, we can fill the whole earth with geniuses; there is no reason why not. We have all the basic things in our hands. We can make man live at least three hundred years very easily without getting old, without having cancer, without having AIDS. This is all that your old past has given as a heritage. We can have people we need: we need mo re Albert Einsteins, we need more Picassos, we need more van Goghs, and bioengineering can make it available. All kinds of artists, scientists, geniuses, myst ics, philosophers, scientists -- we can fill"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"the whole earth with such intelligence an d glory that people like Billy Graham will have to commit suicide. Nobody will go and shout around them. Q: ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORLD POPULATION? A: Certainly. I am very much concerned about the world population, because if somehow we can postpone the nuclear war, th e world population is going to kill humanity. It is growing with such a speed that unless science is diverted towards human needs, it is very difficult not to ha ve many Ethiopias. And it is a sad thing that all around you there are people dyin g and you cannot do anything, you feel almost helpless. Everything can be done, but all science is geared towards death. Who cares about Ethiopia or India? Who bothers? Thei r whole concern is how to be more powerful than the Soviet Union. The Sovi et Union's scientists' whole problem is how to be more powerful than America. An d small, stupid nations also are lined up either behind America or behind Ru ssia. There are a few fools like India, too, who think that by remaining unaligned, th ey will be in a better position and can have the friendship of both sides. They are wrong. They don't understand the ABC of politics. Unaligned, they are enemie s of both parties, not friends. Nobody can trust them, and nobody can help them. The world is almost cut into two parts, and the population is growing in the poor countries more because the poor man has no other entertainment than sex. The rich man has many other things. He can afford many other entertainments. He can listen to music, he can enjoy Mozart, he can see a great dancer, he can go to the theater, he can have the best wine av ailable. He has all the beautiful books to read, all the beautiful statues to collect. But the poor man has nothing other than sex as his entertainment. So he goes on producing, and the religious leaders help him to go on producing, because they want more numbers. Q: DO YOU ADVOCATE ENFORCED BIRTH CONTROL OR STERILIZATION? A: Certainly. Absolute birth control for t wenty years... because it is not a question of small importance. If for twenty years ther e is absolute birth control, it will give two things to humanity. One, the population will start disappearing. I want the world to come to one-fourth of its popu lation; only then can it be a beautiful garden of life. Second, if people become accustomed to birth control for twenty years, sex will not remain a serious pr oblem. After the pill, sex has no significance at all -- it is just fun. It has nothing profane about it and nothing sacred about it. It is just a biological game. And if two persons feel like playing tennis, let them play. Q: WHAT ABOUT DISEASES LIKE AIDS?"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" A: They are also contributions of your religions, because your religions first forced celibacy on monks and nuns an d people. Now, celibacy is absolutely against the laws of biology, against your body. Nobody has ever been celibate, unless he was impotent, and nobody can ever be celibate. He can pretend he is celibate, but from the back door he will find all kinds of perversions. Homosexuality was born in the monastery. That is why I say it is a religious contribution. Monks living in separation from women, nuns living in separation from men -- what do you expect? Those monks are going to start homosexuality. It is now a well-recognized fact that animals in the wild never become homosexuals, but in zoos they do. It is ve ry revealing. In the zoos, if there are no females the animals become homosexuals. And your monasteries are nothing but zoos. They converted men into homosexuals, women into lesbians. AIDs is the ultimate outcome of homo sexuality, and the pope should take responsibility for it. Mother Teresa sh ould take responsibility for it, the shankaracharya should take responsibilit y for it, Ayatollah Khomeini should take the responsibility for it. These are the people. My approach is: Stop this nonsense of celibacy! Let your monks also have fun with their biology -- it is a gift of nature , beautiful. Let your nuns also enjoy their bodies. Why are you making them dead before they are dead? If I am listened to, I will make nunneries and monasteries mixed, and I will take away all barriers which prevent people from ta king sex just as fun. It is not a sin. It is not something to be repressed. That is as stupid as somebody repressing urination. I wonder why there has not been some religion preaching celibacy as far as pissing is concerned? -- and believe me, there will be people who will follow that ideology also. Of course, they will have to piss somewhere, hiding, but before the world they will be celibate. This AIDS is certainly one of the major problems, just as much as a third world war. Unless homosexuality and lesbianism disappear completely, we cannot prevent it from spreading. So heterosexuality should be preached from every pulpit; it should be rewarded, praise d, and the people who do not follow heterosexuality should be put under trea tment. They are psychologically sick. If we want AIDS to disappear, then ho mosexuality and lesbianism have to disappear. Otherwise, there is no way. Medical science has not been able to figure out any medical cure for it. It is a sure killer. Once you have it, you can live at the most two years more -- that is at the most. More probably you will live not more than six months; and it is good if you die sooner, because the longer you live, the more you will spread it. Now the rich people who have AIDS are hiding it. Only the poor people become exposed to the public. The rich people have their private physicians; they can manage that the physician keep his mouth shut. They don't want their families to"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"know that they have AIDS. They don't want anybody to think that they have AIDS. I know senators in America who have AIDS. I know senators who are homosexuals. But the trouble is, these people are in power; the doctor cannot say anything, and they go on and on spread ing it. There have been great artists, painters, poets who were homosexuals. We should look to stop every homosexual from having any further contact with any man or woman. If we cannot stop them.... We have found two persons having AIDS in our commune. We immediately put them into isolation far away in the mountains with everything comfortable provided for them. All that we can manage, we give to them; but they should not mix with the other people of the commune , because AIDS can be caught not only by sexual intercourse, it can be caught even by kissing. Kissing should be completely prohibited all over the world. Of course, people will feel a little awkward, they will need so me substitute. My substitute is that lovers should start changing from kissing to rubbing their noses together. And enjoy it... what else can be done? There are aboriginal tribes where this already happens. They rub their noses, they don' t kiss. They are far more scientific. Kissing is not hygienic at all; rubbing noses is perfectly hygienic. Q: IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COLD. A: That is not much of a problem. A cold is such a small problem that even if you catch it, nothing is wrong in it. It last s for seven days if you don't take any medicine; if you take medicine it lasts one week -- so what is the problem in it?

The people who talk about tolerance are the most into lerant people. I never tolerate; either I accept, or I simply forget all about the person. Why should I tolerate? He has the right to be himself.

It is just out of necessity th at my people have used that word; otherwise, there is no ism here, no organization here. We are living in an organic unity. But it is always a problem with language: language is old, language is coming from thousands of years, and you have to use that language. An ism needs a certain dogma; we have no ne.

But it is not an organization, and I don't think that there is any spirituality in the color red. You can see me: I hate the color red! Q: (INDICATING HIS FEET) THESE SOCKS WERE GIVEN TO ME! A: I hate them! I have put my people in red because that is the only color I will not use. Q: I TAKE THE POINT, BUT I MEANT NOT REALLY THE CHOICE OF A CERTAIN COLOR -- FAIR ENOUGH, OR VARIATIONS ON IT -- NO, THESE PEOPLE THAT I SAW WERE WEARING ID ENTICAL CLOTHES. THEY WERE CUT THE SAME WAY, THE SAME SHIRTS. THEY MATCHED, IN OTHER WORDS, IDENTICAL... LIKE AN ARMY. A: If they love to have identical clothes, it is perfectly okay. Q: DO YOU THINK THEY DO? HAVE YOU ASKED THEM? "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"A: I have never asked. That is their busi ness. And if you look closely, they are using different shades of red. That is up to them what they do. And they are using different kinds of clothes, not sim ilar. Yet there are a few uniformed people that belong to the police department of Oregon. They want them to be in a certain uniform, so we have to put them in a uniform. But they belong to the police force of Oregon; you must have seen their caps and everything. Q: BUT THEY'RE IN RED.... A: Here they have to be red. Q: THEN THE POLICE DON'T MIND IF THEY WEAR RED? A: Here they have to be red. Even if the governor wants to be the governor of Rajneeshpuram, he will have to be in red. This is just to shock the people around the world. And it has proved of great significance. For example, thousands of people have come to me in all these thirty years. Those who became sannyasins remain some how related with me. Even if after thirty years they come, I recognize them, I remember them; and they also feel a certain connection with me. Others ha d also come, had loved me, but never became sannyasins. They are lost in the big world. I cannot recognize them, and I don't think there is any communion exis ting between me and them. This has been immensely helpful. I know where my people are and I know whether they are increasing or decreasing. I know what they are doing, and I know that I can suggest to them -- I never order, I can advise -- to take it or not to take it is their business. I am happy both ways. And, secondly, my red people around th e world have shocked everybody. That is of great importance. The moment yo u shock somebody, he starts thinking about you, he starts inquiring about you. He becomes curious what is the matter. He starts reading my books. So many people have come here and become sannyasins and told me that the first experience was of a shock. But that shock led them to inquire, to read, and finally they ended up here. So this has been of tremendous significance, useful. And it has ma de my people also strong because moving in red clothes in society you immediately become the focus, the center -- you need some guts to face all kinds of hostility. It creates something like steel in you. My people ha ve been expelled from universities as professors, from schools as teachers, from businesses, simply because they were wearing red clothes. Q: THAT'S KIND OF A HARSH PENA LTY FOR WEARING RED CLOTHES. A: But a person who is ready to renounce the job, a good salary in the university, just to be himself, becomes stronger. I don't want my people to be ignored."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Hostility is perfectly okay. Hate I accept, opposition I welcome. Even if they start shooting my people, there is no problem. But I would never like my people to be ignored. Q: I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT VERY MUCH. TALKING ABOUT NOT WEARING RED, IT WOULD BE TRUE, OF COURSE, WOULDN'T IT, THAT BY YOUR NOT WEARING RED, EVERYBODY LOOKS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON NOT WEARING RED? AND YOU DID SAY THAT YOU'RE THE GREAT SHOWMAN, AND THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE SHOWMANSHIP, WOULD IT? A: Certainly. Q: VERY GOOD! AND YOUR ROBES , THEY ARE ALSO PART OF THE SHOWMANSHIP? A: Part -- everything is part of my showmanship. Q: DO YOU DESIGN THEM YOURSELF OR DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE...? A: My people design everything for me. Q: OH, IT'S NOT YOUR CREATION, THEN? I THOUGHT YOU CHOSE THEM YOURSELF. A: No. No need, because I have so many intelligent people from every profession. We have the best legal experts, we have the best professors, scientists, carpenters, seamstresses, tailors, we have every kind of people. Our commune is absolutely self-sufficient. So I have my seamstresses who design, and they are doing so well that I need not interfere. I love whatsoever they are doing. I have my own jewelers -- you just look at my watch! Q: I SAW, YES. I'VE EVEN READ ABOUT IT. A: My own people made my watch. Q: OH, REALLY? A: And these are real stones, remember. They are not diamonds, they are real stones! Q: GLASS, CUT GLASS?

Then they start thinking it is a fake watch. It is not a fake watch, it is as authentic, existential, as any diamond can be. Q: DOES IT TELL THE TIME AS WELL THEN? A: The best! My people don't do anything less than the best! Q: AND YOU WEAR SILK. IS THAT YO UR PREFERENCE? I THINK WHEN I WAS HERE LAST, YOU WERE WEARING MORE WOVEN, SORT OF NATURAL -- LOOKING FABRIC. A: My people were doing that. Q: HAVE YOU GONE UP IN THE WORLD, TO SILK? A: My people were weaving those clothes. I liked them, but then my physicians were not ready for me to use even synthetic wool, because I am allergic. Q: OH, SURE. I KNOW THAT. A: So I had to drop those beautiful dresses, and I had to move to other clothes. So this is my physicians' change. Q: ROTTEN OLD SILK. A: Yes. Whenever we change, we go higher. Q: AND I ALSO READ THAT YOUR CA RS -- YOU DON'T OWN THESE, OF COURSE; THAT YOU ARE A GUEST HE RE, IN FACT; AND THAT... SO REALLY, YOU DON'T OWN ANYTHING. A: I don't have anything. Q: IT STRIKES ME THAT IT'S COSTIN G YOUR FOLLOWERS A FORTUNE TO KEEP YOU IN POVERTY. A: That is true, but they enjoy it and th ey love it. If I refuse it, they will have heart attacks! Q: I WAS WONDERING -- ALL THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE MEDIA ABOUT YOU AND THIS PLACE AND SORT OF AGONIZED APPRAISALS OF THE SPIRITUALITY AND THE RELIGION AND ITS"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"CONTENT, AND HOW RELIGIOUS IT IS OR IS NOT... AND YOU SAY, WELL, YOU'RE A SHOWMAN. IT STRUCK ME THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE OUGHT TO TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. A: Every religious Master has been a showman, and I have defeated them all. Q: BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE TO BE SHOWMEN? WHY DO ALL THE RELIGIOUS MASTERS HAVE TO BE SHOWMEN? A: It helps their work. It attracts people to them, and those who come close, they know that the showmanship is just on th e outside. Inside there is immense work to be done. Q: IMMENSE WORK? WOULD YOU LIKE TO ELABORATE ON THAT? WOULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THE IMMENSE WORK... YOU DON'T MEAN IN A PRACTICAL WAY? A: That means meditation. That they have to become more conscious, more alert, and finally they have to come to a po int where their unco nsciousness becomes completely conscious. Sigmund Freud divides consciousness into three layers: consciousness, subconsciousness, unconsciousness. Medi tation moves in the same way, from conscious to subconscious: the consci ous overwhelms the subconscious and finally it overwhelms the unconscious. If Sigmund Freud was to look into one of my sannyasins, he would be surprised.... Q: EVEN HE, EH? A: Yes. Because there is no division, ther e is only single consciousness. There is no shadow, no darkness around. So that is the inner work -- and showmanship certainly helps. The other religious lead ers never said they were showmen. They had no guts to say the truth. Do n't you think Jesus was a showman? Q: OH, YEAH. MIRACLES, THAT'S PRETTY.... A: Yes, miracles and walking on water, and bringing dead back to life and proclaiming himself the only begotten son of God. I don't do any such stupid things. But all religious leaders of the world have been showmen in different ways. The founder of Jainism, Mahavira, remained naked. Now, that is great showmanship, without clothes... you canno t think that he is a showman, but what is the point of being naked? He never used any razors, blades. Every year"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"he would pull out his hair, and thousands of people would gather there, tears in their eyes because their leader is pulling out his hair. Every year it was a great congregation of his followers. And what wa s he doing? Because he said that he would not use any mechanism -- even a razo r is technology -- he made great showmanship out of pulling hi s own hairs. And this needs only a little practice, nothing much; once you have learned it, you can do it. I am the first religious man who is tellin g you exactly what is the case. I am exposing myself totally, I am not keepin g any secret, no private life. All your religious leaders were somehow ch eating, exploiting, deceiving. Q: I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE. I PERSONALLY AM AN ATHEIST, SO THIS IS MUSIC TO MY EARS. BUT THEN, YOU'RE SAYING YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE WHO IS NOT? A: Certainly. Q: I BELIEVE YOU, BUT WOULD YOU LI KE TO EXPLAIN THE VALIDITY OF THE CLAIM? A: For example, no religious leader will accept that he is not celibate. All religions require celibacy, and celibacy is impossible. It is scientifically impossible. Q: WELL, THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE, IS IT, BECAUSE... I MEAN THE ORIGINAL MORMONS WERE POLYGA MOUS, WEREN'T THEY? AND SO THEY MADE A VIRTUE, THE MEN AT LEAST, OUT OF MANY WIVES -- AND MUCH SEX, I PRESUME. SO NOT ALL RELIGIONS -- I MEAN MANY, BUT NOT QUITE ALL, SURELY...? A: There have been a few religions who ma de that, too, a virtue, and that was for the same purpose. For example, Mohammed had nine wives. Now that too is showmanship. He allows Mohammedans to have only four. Only the prophet can have nine, he keeps himself special. So what other religions were doing with celibacy, he was doing with the number of women. The basic thing is the same: that he is special, higher, holier than thou. Q: BUT YOU'RE SPECIAL TOO, AREN'T YOU? A: No. Q: I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONLY MA N OR WOMAN HERE WHO ENTERS A BUILDING ON A PATH STREWN WITH ROSE LEAVES. I THOUGHT THAT WAS FAIRLY SPECIAL."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" A: That is their joy. I am not special. I have not asked them. If they don't put the flowers, I will never inquire what happened to the flowers. If they don't dance, I will not inquire what happened to the dancers. I can dance alone. Just I need the camera.... Q: SHOWMANSHIP, YES! I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. A: No, I am not. Q: YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO DOESN'T WEAR RED, OR A SHADE OF RED.... A: Because I am not a sannyas in. I am nobody's follower. Q: NO, BUT IN THIS CONTEXT, THAT'S ANOTHER SPECIAL THING ISN'T IT? A: No, it is not. You are here also. Q: TWO OF US! YES, WELL INDEED I AM SPECIAL FOR SOME OF THOSE SAME REASONS -- BECAUSE I AM NOT A SANNYASIN, I'M NOT DRESSED IN RED, IN WORKING.... A: No, you are not special. Every day jo urnalists are here, you are not special. You are a guest only for one day or two da ys; I am a guest for a little longer time; that is the only difference. I can leave th is place any moment. I don't even live in Rajneeshpuram, in the city. I live outside. Q: IN WASCO COUNTY, EH? A: In Wasco County. Q: SURE, BUT I MEAN AS I SAY, YOU MAY NOT ACTUALLY SEEK BEING SPECIAL, BUT NEVERTHELESS THAT'S THE CASE, ISN'T IT? A: No. Q: I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN DENY THAT, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. EVEN JUST AN EYEWITNESS WOULD LOOK AT THE CROWD AND SAY, \"HE'S SPECIAL, HE'S WEARING BLUE.\" "},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"A: Anybody will get that idea that I am sp ecial.

Even if I have to leave this place, somebody will have to arrange a ticket for me because I don't have anything. I think, I hope, the American government will do it. Q: I AM REMINDED OF ANOTHER CLASS OF PEOPLE, VERY SELECT AND SMALL CLASS OF PEOPLE, WHO DON' T CARRY MONEY, LIKE YOURSELF, AND THAT'S ROYALTY. THE QUEEN NEVER CARRIES MONEY, AND THAT IS A SORT OF MARK OF BEING SP ECIAL, BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO DO IT FOR HER, WHICH ELEVATE S HER IN IMPORTANCE, DOESN'T IT? -- SO IT MAKES HER SPECIAL.

I DON'T KNOW; I MEAN, I'VE NEVER GONE INTO IT BUT THEY WISH TO DO SO, PRESUMABLY. A: She is special. She belongs to the roya l family, she has the special blood that is only stupidity -- and everything that she gets is ordered. If it is not given to her there will be problems immediately.

HE THOUGHT GERM ANY AND BRITAIN WOULD BE THE PLACES WHERE THERE WOULD BE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION. A: Karl Marx proved wrong on all the counts.... Q: ON A LOT OF THINGS... RIGHT, SU RE, RIGHT -- ANOTHER ISM. YOU'VE SAID SOME REALLY CRITICAL THINGS ABOUT COMMUNISM. DO YOU MEAN COMMUNISM AS THE SYSTEM IN THE SOVIET UNION AT THE MOMENT, OR DO YOU MEAN THE COMMUNISM ENVISAGED BY KARL MARX AND ENGELS? A: I mean both. Karl Marx, Engels, th ey were simply bookworms. Karl Marx spent his whole life in the British Mu seum. He knew nothing about the real humanity. He knew nothing about the mechanics of how evolution goes on. He was only concerned with the British Mu seum. Before the museum opened he was there, standing, and many times he was carried out of the museum unconscious, because he worked so h ard on the books that he was found unconscious and had to be taken in an ambulance. Q: MAYBE HE MEDITATED TOO MUCH... LAPSED INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS. A: He never meditated for a single mome nt. If he had meditated for a single moment, communism would have a different quality and flavor to it. He was simply the mind. And meditation is a state of no mind. You don't go for meditation to the British Museum. He was a scholar, a great scholar, but whatso ever he said did not prove right. He was thinking that communism would happen in the rich est countries, which was a logical conclusion of his philosophy, th at where the division between the poor and the rich is bigger the revolution will happen. And the revolution has happened in Soviet Russia -- which he had never dreamed -- revolution has happened in China. If he wakes up in his grave, he will not be able to believe what has happened. Soviet Russia was a poor country, China even poorer; his whole idea of class struggle went wrong. In America there is no possi bility for communism for the simple reason that most of the Americans are middle class. The su per-rich are few, on one hand, and the super-poor are few, on the other ha nd; and the middle class is never for revolution The middle class has too much to risk. Revolution is possible only when you have nothing to lose. The mi ddle class has much to lose, and the middle class also has the hope that sooner or later they are going to enter into the higher, the super-rich. They cannot lose that hope by creating a revolution."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"I am completely against Karl Marx for the simple reason that no two human beings are equal. Equality is psychologically wrong, physiologically wrong. Every individual is unique and incomparab le. I am not saying that somebody is higher and somebody is lower. I am simp ly saying it is absurd to compare a marigold with a rose flower. It is not that the rose flower is higher and the marigold is poor; they are different . People are so different and unique. I believe in the individuality of human beings, and I don't want them to be counted in a class that makes numbers of them and destroys their individuality: you are the proletariat. Then the dass is im portant, you are not. That's what has happened in Russia. All individuality has been erased, and if anybody tries to be individual, like the man Sakharov, then immediately he is punished. You cannot be individuals. The nation , the society, the communi st party -- you can be a member, but you cannot assert your indivi duality. Now, Sakharov is one of the best physicists of the contemporary world, and he is suffering in Siberia. And he had not done anything.... Q: EXCEPT DISAGREE.... A:... Just he had signed a few petitions for other scientists who were suffering, and this was enough to finish that man completely.

DO YOU ACCEPT THAT? IS THAT A CONSEQUENCE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LIVE WITH? A: Just wait. You have asked so many th ings.

Secondly, when the American government recognizes that thirty million people here are poor, you should remember that that is according to the American standard. Those thirty million people in India will not be poor, they will be middle class. Q: YES, SURE. IT'S RELATIVE. A: It IS very relative. To be poor in Ameri ca is far better than to be richer in India.

HERE, IT'S THE CONSTANT TA UNTING, ALMOST, THE CONTRAST OF THE TWO, THAT MAKES FO R A LOT OF VIOLENCE AND DISSATISFACTION, DOES IT NOT? A: It is good; it is healthy, because it keeps them going on, bringing their intelligence, their potential. America allo ws them to struggle for themselves, and the contrast is there so they know people can make it, people have made their mark, and if they are failing th ey are responsible themselves. In the Soviet Union they will not feel lik e that because there is nobody to be compared with. The Soviet Union is a poor country, still. It is not that the poor have disappeared and the poverty has di sappeared from Russia. On the contrary, the rich have disappeared, and poverty ha s been distributed equally, so all are equally poor. And man has a psychological necessity to have somebody ahead of him; otherwise, he is a lazy animal. If there is nothing to achieve, nobody to compete with, he relaxes into whatsoever situatio n he is in. Russia will never become rich for the simple reason that the Russians are all poor.

I would like them to struggle and prove their mettl e, I would not like them to become numbers. That is out of my love. And I am not a politician, Republican or Democratic. I am not a politician at all. But the poor has to be given a chance to rise. Opportunities should be made available to the poor; but communism give s no opportunity. It forces equality, which is wrong. In that equality, the pe ople who are genius creators of wealth disappear. Henry Ford cannot be born in Soviet Russia. Even Karl Marx cannot be born in Soviet Russia; impossible! -- they won't allow such a man. It is my compassion. It is not my politics; it is my love. And people have the potential, you just have to give th em the challenge. And if the American government is failing with thirty millio n people, it is not the philosophy of individuality; it is the American governme nt's stupidity. They should make more opportunities available -- and they can, but their whole energy is going into nuclear weapons. In America there is no need for anybody to be poor, but the American government is interested in nuclear weapons. They have another race going on with Soviet Russia which k eeps Russia poor, which keeps America's thirty million poor, and small poor countries also joining in the race out of fear. This nuclear race is making the whole world a big Ethiopia. I would like the American government to stop complete ly piling up nuclear weapons. Those thirty million poor will disappear tomorrow.

HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS? A: That too is not a vision. I am not a visi onary. That too is part of my reasoning. For example, in my childhood in India, the seasons were absolutely fixed. On a certain day every year for thousands of ye ars the summer has begun, on a certain day the rains have come -- it was absolutely fixed, there was no question of change. But after Hiroshima and Nagasa ki, that changed. Now in India the weather is no more certain. Somethin g great has happened in the atmosphere. And these explosions go on. They go on tr ying in the oceans, at the poles, and if these explosions go on, there is a po ssibility that the eternal snow of the Himalayas may start melting down. Even if the Himalayas alone melt down, all the oceans will be raised fifty feet.

The dog is not searching you; the dog is searching the Attorney General of Oregon. So you please don't f eel offended. Those guns are not for you; those guns are for those Oregonians who have been saying that they would like to shoot me, that they would like to destroy, burn the whole commune. We will do everything. We are not suicidal people, nor do we hanker for any martyrdom. This is not another Jonestown. They forced the Jonestown people to commit suicide. We are not the people to commit suicide. We love life, and we will do everything that is possible to prevent their doing any harm to us. Even if we have to invite Soviet Russia for ou r protection, we are going to do that! Q: BUT ALL THE ATTORNEY GENERA L OF OREGON HAS DONE TO YOU, IT SEEMS TO ME, IS HARASS YOU WITH LAWSUITS. HE HASN'T SENT ANY PEOPLE WITH GUNS. I MEAN, HE HA SN'T SHOT AT YOU. I MEAN, THE MAN WHO BLEW UP THE HOTEL MAY HAVE BEEN A RANDOM MADMAN.... "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"A: No, he is not mad; because he jumped bail and for one and a half years he has been hiding. Now he has been caught again. He is not mad. Q: WELL, MAD PEOPLE CAN RUN AWAY AS WELL AS SANE PEOPLE. A: No. Mad people will not be so intell igent, the way he has been. But I'm not concerned with that I am concerned with the Attorney General and the Governor. They had a secret meeting. They did not allow any journalis ts -- they talk about freedom! -- and the meeting was about us. They did not even al low one of our representatives so that he could present the case from our side. An d the Governor told the press, \"I will give you the information after our meet ing.\" And whatsoever he said was an absolute lie...! Because the confidential se cret file has been found. They thought that it had been burned, but it has b een found, and it has been shown on television. In the secret file, they say that the army should be kept on alert, that the army should be aware that if they are ordered, then in three hours they have to reach Rajneeshpuram. And you ask me about thes e few toy guns that my people have! And this man, Governor Atiyeh, told the press conference, \"We are trying to cool down the atmosphere. We are trying to get the commune people and the people of Oregon to cool down, not to get too heated.\" This is what he gave to the press conference. An d inside the conference, they decide for the army to be ready so they can reach here in three hours' time. We have now filed a case against the state for conspiracy. Now we have the document, and what have we done that they think they need the army and the military to reach here? So these few toy guns are just ... my people love me and they want to protect me. But you should un derstand that it is silly. What can you do with these toy guns? In a nuclear age, these toy guns should be given to children to play with. Q: BUT I DON'T SEE, PERSONALLY , THAT THERE'S NEED FOR SUCH WEAPONRY BECAUSE THE THREAT HASN'T BEEN OF THAT MAGNITUDE. A: No? You think putting the army on al ert and telling them to be ready any moment...? Q: WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT. I HAVEN'T READ THAT. A: You don't know that. Your ignorance does not mean that you have to make an opinion -- then try to know it before you make an opinion. "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Q: I MEAN, I MIGHT ASK FOR PROOF. THE DOCUMENT ITSELF, IF IT WAS ON A DOCUMENT. THEN I WOULD ACCEPT IT. A: Yes. You can see it. (ASIDE) Perhaps you have the full document? Okay.

A: That you have to ask them. Q: WELL, THEY DENY IT. THEY SAY, AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THAT SOME VARIOUS LEGAL MATTERS THEY FEEL YOU MAY HAVE CONTRAVENED IN THE OPINIONS OF SOME LAWYERS. A: We are in the courts, and we have won almost fifty percent of the cases. The remaining fifty percent we are going to win; because it is so true, they cannot.... Q: BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE THE END OF THE MATTER, IT SEEMS? A: They will appeal if they fail here. Or if we fail, we will appeal. It is not going to end easily. Q: BUT SUPPOSING THEY EXHAUST ALL THE LEGAL POSSIBILITIES TO THE SUPREME COURT IN WASHINGTON, AND YOU WIN EVERY SINGLE CASE, DO YOU THEN THINK THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT? A: No. Q: WHY NOT? A: We will then invite them to drop bombs on us and finish us. Q: OH, COME ON! I KNOW THE POLICE DID IN PHILADELPHIA, BUT SO I SUPPOSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN DONE....

All that will go down the drain with Rajneeshpuram. And it will be a good experiment to do something like Hiroshima. We will enjoy it. We will celebrate it. Q: I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK DR. MARGARET SINGER WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT COMMENT YOU JUST MADE. I ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AB OUT THE SUICIDE, BUT YOU DO HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON WITH REVEREND JIM JONES. HE ALSO SAID, \"WE'LL ASK THE SOVIETS FOR HELP, IF WE NEED IT.\" AND HE WAS REFERRING TO THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. DOES THAT BOTHER YOU IN ANY WAY THAT YOU SHARE THAT SAME...? A: No. He was a Christian, a Christian pr iest, and he had a congregation of the most retarded black people. And ther e is nothing common between me and him.... Q: EXCEPT THAT APPEAL TO THE SOVIET UNION. A: With that appeal I am saying that we are not going to die so easily as they think. We will fight. Although we are such a small community, we will fight in every possible way. If legal ways are fi nished, then too we will fight; because basically we know we are being true, an d they are being fascist. And we are not afraid, remember -- they are afraid. Tell that impeccable lady that we are not living in paranoia. The whole of Oregon is living in paranoia: they are afraid. Jour nalists have been telling me that people are afraid that we are going to take over Oregon. I said, \"Oregon! So small a thing... we will not bother. We would lik e to take over the whole world.\" And our way of taking the whole world is totally different; it is not war. I will just go on spreading my red people aroun d the world. We will take it spiritually. Q: WELL, AS I SAY, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT YOU TAKE SUCH A GLOOMY VIEW OF THE INTENTIONS OF TH E OREGON STATE GOVERNMENT, BUT I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY PLANS THE DEATH OF YOU OR YOUR FOLLOWERS BECAUSE THAT STRIKES ME AS HYPERBOLE, TO SAY THE VERY LEAST. A: You don't know what has happened to me in the past, that's why. Attempts on my life have been made in India. I ha ve been given poison, a knife has been thrown at me before ten thousand sann yasins. And it is a miracle that ten thousand sannyasins were eyewitnesse s; and because the police got the information that something is coming, th ey had reached there before the person"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"who was to throw the knife. So there were twenty police officers -- eyewitnesses. Still we lost the case. Ten thousand eyewi tnesses, twenty police officers as eyewitnesses; still we lost the case becaus e that man was a Hindu chauvinist and the Maharashtra government is a Hindu chauvinist government. Q: BUT ISN'T THERE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE ATTEMPTING TO MURDER A POLITI CAL OR RELIGIOUS LEADER -- AND AFTER ALL, MAHATMA GANDHI WAS ASSASSINATED, WAS HE NOT? -- ISN'T THERE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THE PLANNED BOMBING OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY SUCH AS YOU HAVE HERE? WHAT WERE YOUR MARIGO LD AND A ROSE AGAIN? -- INCOMPARABLE. A: I am saying it because I don't go anyw here; it is very difficult to assassinate me. It was easy in India because I was traveling. It is no longer easy to assassinate me. Because that has become impossible for them, that gives the possibility for them to destroy the whole community with me. But we are not afraid about it -- that you have to remember. Q: OH, I HAVE NO DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR RESOLVE; IT'S YOUR REASON THAT BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THEY HATE YOU SO MUCH TH AT THEY WANT TO MURDER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE? A: Because I am against all the religions, and here, particularly, against Christianity. I am against all the poli ticians because I think the world has suffered for thousands of years because of the politicians. They are the greatest criminals around. I don't agree with any kind of morality in which they believe. I think it is immoral. I have my own conc eption of morality. I don't believe in marriage, I think marriage is an ugly institution which has put the whole humanity in a madhouse. The problem is that I stand for totall y different values and they are afraid because they have no argument. We ha ve been inviting the Governor, \"Come here. Let us have an open argument.\" He would not come. For four years, he would not come. Q: THAT STRIKES ME AS UNREASONABLE, I MUST SAY. A: We are ready to have an open discussi on. Anybody they can find to stand for their values... I am ready to discuss our va lues. That seems to be the human way to decide a thing. But none of them is ready to come here. They are in a paranoia; they think anybody who comes here is hypnotized. So, you be aware! "},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Q: SHALL WE CHANGE THE SUBJEC T? OR DO YOU WISH TO GO?

I ALSO SEE A LOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ORGANIZING HERE ARE WOMEN. IS THAT ANOTHER OF THE THINGS THEY PROBABLY HAVE AGAINST YOU? A: That too, certainly, be cause I am against all that man has done to woman. And in my own way I am trying to do a little compensation. Q. TO SOMEONE OBSERVING THE VA RIOUS VIEWS THAT YOU HAVE -- IT IS QUITE A MIXTURE, BECAUSE SOME OF YOUR VIEWS APPEAR CONSERVATIVE, SOME APPEAR QUITE RADICAL, OTHERS APPEAR REFORMIST/LIBERAL, IF YOU LIKE -- HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO ENCOMPASS SO MANY THINGS WHICH SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER? HOW CAN YOU BE ALL THOSE THINGS ALL AT ONCE? A: I am not a mediocre thinker. My consci ousness is vast enough to contain all, all contradictions, but within me they become complementary to each other. So you can find anything you want in my writings. If you love me, you can find everything that makes your love deeper; if you hate me, you can find everything that makes your hate deeper.

"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #16 Chapter title: The Future Is Always Open 2 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in th e book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 27.] Ma Prem Arup DE RAJNEESH TIMES AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS QUESTION: BHAGWAN, YOU ONCE SAID, \"HOLLAND WILL BE ONE OF MY MOST ORANGE COUNTRIES.\" WHY IS THAT SO? ANSWER: You can see it already happening. It needs guts to be my red people, and Holland is one of the countries whic h has existed all through history with tremendous struggle, because the earth le vel is low and the sea level is higher. Holland has been continuously fighting against the ocean, and it has given a certain strength to the people. Only thos e who have strength to stand with me can belong to the red commune around the world. Holland is certainly going to be my country. My people are continuously growing in Holland. You will be surprised to know the fact that when the theosophical movement decided to declare J. Krishnamurti as th e world teacher, Holland was the country chosen for the declaration. Six thousand topmost leaders of the Theosophical Society had gathered there in Holland. Out of all the countries, why Holland? There is something very essential that the Dutch people have grown within them; ju st somebody needs to trigger it. J. Krishnamurti chickened out, could not take that great responsibility. I can take any responsibility without any problem, be cause basically I am an irresponsible man -- it does not matter. But the Dutch people have grown someth ing in them down the centuries which can have a synchronicity with me; the same with the German people. Germany cannot remain without becoming red, because they have been through two wars which would have destroyed anybody fore ver; but if you go to Germany now, you cannot believe that this country has survived two world wars -- not only survived, but is now the richest country in Europe. They have some guts. I cannot say the same about the French. They are simply lousy. There is no possibility for France. It is doomed; it has no spiritual corner in its being. Yes, a few French people will be coming, those who have still the soul alive in them."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"But about the whole country this cannot be said. Every country grows in different ways on different lines and gath ers a different kind of energy. One of the reasons why Gurdjieff failed and coul d not help humanity was that he chose France to be his headquarters. Germany would have been of much significance, Holland would have been better, but not France. France has become satisfied with wome n and wine. It has no aspirations for something beyond the horizon. It is very limited in its vision and very closed too, because it is a very egoist country. France thinks itself to be the most superior country in the world. Their language is the most superior, their philosophy is the most superior, their paintings are the most superior. These are just ornaments for the ego, and the more a country is surroun ded by egoistic projections, the less is the possibility of its transformation. On the other hand, Germany has given birth to the biggest genuises in philosophy, in theology has produced the greatest mystics, but it has no bragging about it. As I have felt people from almost a ll over the world, I can say certainly that it is hard to bring a Germ an to transformation, hard because he will resist and fight; but if you go on persisti ng, the day he drops his resistance he is forever yours. Then there is no way ba ck. Then he will never waver. You cannot say that about the American. You can predict that he is going to waver. American history is only three hundred ye ars old, and America is not an ancient race. It is not a race at all; it is a ho dgepodge. The French are there, the English are there, the Spanish are there, the Portuguese are there, the Italians are there... it is a marketplace. People don't have root s, and to have strength you need roots. The deeper the roots go... yes, it is ha rder to change you, but once you are changed, it is almost impossible for you to fall back. Once a German is deprogrammed, nobody can reprogram him again. The American can be reprogrammed within two days and you can deprogram him again within two days. He has no roots. In India, we have a certain creeper withou t roots. It simply liv es as a parasite on other trees, from one tree to another tree. It spreads far -- sometimes miles, in the forest -- but it has no roots, it simply lives on those other trees. Americans are simply like that creeper: th ey don't have any roots; they don't have anything to stand upon, their past is so small. That's why they cannot project about the future either, because this is the logical way: the longer the past, the longer you can project the future. The third world war is just knocking on th e doors. This century is going to end, and with the end of this ce ntury either we have the n ew man on the earth or no life at all. But Americans are fast asleep. Many Americans have come to me. In almost twenty years, many have come, many have gone, very few have stayed. And those who have stayed are really not Americans. The American Jew has st ayed with me, because he has no country; he has only his past, but a long past and of tremendous importance. He knows how to deal with people like Moses, Ezekiel, Jesus, Baal Shem."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"And what does America know? Henry Ford , Rockefeller? -- they cannot have a deep intimacy with me. Yes, a few Americans have remained with me. Mukta is sitting there, but she is not really American, she is Greek. The American generation is just changing continuously -- everything is a fashion. Th ey can come to me also as part of a fashionable movement, but they are not going to remain here, because soon they get attracted to something else. They don't know how to grow roots. And different countries have different wa ys. It is not a coincidence that forty percent of my people are Je ws. And I have been hitting hard on Jews -- so much so that rabbis have started writing letters to me saying, \"You seem to be anti- Jewish.\" They don't know that Jews are the majority of my people, and I can hit on them because I love them and they understand my love. In my hit, they receive my love. Not a single Jew has left me. Once he has come, he has come forever, he has found his Israel in me. He need not go to Jerusalem, he need not bother about Moses and Jesus; there is no need. They have found a more contemporary Moses here. Each country can be given a certain chara cteristic. For example, Indians: they pretend to be spiritualists, and that is th e most materialistic country in the whole world, most greedy. They could not be wi th me for the simple reason that I was exposing them -- and unless I expose you totally, you cannot be reborn. Indians started escaping from me the mome nt I started exposing them. They took the hint, and it was right: they are greedy, they are materialist; they don't have any longing for spirituality, only preten sions. Yes, once, twenty-five centuries ago, perhaps they were spiritual, and that idea of the past has followed them like a shadow. But they forget completely th at for twenty-five centuries you cannot go on pretending that the shadow that is following you is alive. Indian spirituality is dead, and I don't see much hope for its revival. But a few Indians have been with me all along, in all the seasons, in all the changes. So when I say something about a country, it does not apply to individuals. Now Avesh is sitting there -- a great Frenchman -- and he is going to sit there forever. I have destroyed his French-ship completely. Arup herself is Dutch. Can she conceive of ever leav ing me? Not even in dreams; it is impossible. I can say that with certain ty, because love is never uncertain. England is so sad and depressed -- obviou sly: they were on the top, they had the biggest empire any country ever had.... It was said that the sun never sets in the British Empire, somewhere or other it is always rising. As far as the whole Empire was concerned, the sun was always rising somewhere; it never set in the British Empire. Neither Alexander, nor Napoleon, nor Hitler, nor Stalin has known such a vast empire. Nobody has b een able to know such immense power, and suddenly all that has disappeared like writing on water. It is natural that they will be so depressed, sad. They would not like to come out of their depression. They cannot accept laughing, dancing, singing. They have lost so"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"much, and you are thinking to dance? Th ey have lost everything, and you are proposing, \"Let us sing a beautiful song!\" England will find it more difficult than an ybody else to be with me. But that does not apply to individuals, let me remind you again. Teertha is there... the moment he entered my room, many years ago, not for a single moment has he left, not even to visit England again. He has dropped his wife, he has dropped his parents, he has dropped everything. He was a well-known encounter leader, he had the best growth institute in Europe; bu t once he looked into my eyes, all that was finished. I knew it, he knew it -- that he was boun d that day and a new life began which had nothing to do with the past. Individuals will be coming from everywhere, but a few countries have more potential. For example, it is very difficult to get into the Mohammedan countries -- almost impossible, because they are still so uncivilized. Civilization has not happened anywhere, but there are countr ies which are a little less uncivilized and there are countries which are more un civilized. Civilization is still waiting to happen. It is waiting to happen for yo u: you are to become the heralds of civilization. But Mohammedan countries are not even contemporaries. They have not moved a single inch from the times of Mohamme d. Fourteen centuries have passed and they are still thinking that the Koran is the holy book. In the Koran ninety-nine percent is just nonsense. One percent you can manage to give some spiritual meaning, with great effort, otherwis e it is not of any importance. And Mohammedans have remained faithful to the Koran. They are not ready even to listen to anybody. A few Mohammedans are my sannyasins, but those poor people ask me, \"Bhagwan, we want to be sannyasins, we wa nt to be contemporaries, we want to have the revolution that you are giving us, but we cannot go in red clothes back home. They will simply kill... they don't argue.\" Mohammedans don't know argument. They don't know any philosophy. Their only argument is the sword: either kill them, or be killed by them; whosoever is killed was wrong. That is strange. It is very easy to kill Socrates, any idiot like Muhammad Ali can kill Socrates without any difficulty. Socrates is not a wrestler, he is not a boxer; just a good pu nch on his nose and he will be finished with all his philosophy. Physical stre ngth or strength that comes through weapons cannot be a substitute for argum ent. Argument needs intelligence, and that intelligence is missing there. In India, I had come in contact with hundreds of Mohammedans. You may not know that India is still the biggest Mo hammedan country in the world as far as numbers are concerned, even after the di vision with Pakistan. When Pakistan and Bangladesh were one with India, of course, half the population of Mohammedans was in India. But even after Pakistan was separated, Bangladesh got separated, still India had a larger Mohammedan population than any other"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"country. Countries which are completely Mohammedan -- even they are far behind. These Mohammedans in India are a littl e better than any Mohammedans in any other country because for centuries they have been living with all kinds of philosophers, all kinds of religions, all kinds of attitudes, approaches. Obviously their fanaticism has become less, but even that fanaticism is enough to kill you. You cannot say anything against one holy b ook -- and that is Koran; one God -- and that is that of Islam; and one pr ophet -- and that is Mohammed. In these three statements, the whole Mohammeda nism is complete. You cannot speak against any of these three... and there is so much to say against all these three. The Mohammedan God does not look like a God at all, their holy book is just rubbish, and their one and only one prophe t is just an uneducated, uncultured man, with no idea of philosophical heig hts, with no knowledge of anything, who has never meditated in his life. He knows nothing about meditation. But the sannyasins who are Mohammedans have asked me, \"Give us permission.... We will keep the mala hidden in our houses, we will keep the robe hidden in our houses, we cannot even let ou r family know about it because that will be just the end. And if you want,\" they have told me, \"that we should be killed, we are ready.\" Now, I am not a fanatic about the color of the dress or the mala. I said, \"Don't be worried about it. I need your heart, and if that has become red.... I need to be within you. If I have reached there, then don't be worried . And I don't want anybody to be killed in my name, I want people to live longer, healthier, happier in my name.\" Mohammed says to Mohammedans, \"If you die in my name, your paradise is certain.\" I say to you, \"If you live in my name and love in my name and dance in my name, you are already in paradise.\" I don't guarantee an ything about the future, how can I tell anybody to die in my name? The earth is so small and it is divided in so many different groups who have grown differently, had different histories -- and their past is significant, that has to be taken into account. So, whenever I have said anything about Holland, or Germany, or England, I was simply indicating the possibility. I have so many Italians -- but not reliable; well greased and slippery! They try hard, nice people, but what can they do about their greasiness? Some thing in them is always slippery. Many Italians have come to me, very few have stayed. Those who have stayed have changed a lo t, but still something of greasiness is there. Now they are not going to slip ba ck, but the possibility remains... they are not absolutely out of it. But if we can get the right people, the pe ople who are not that ripe may start following them. That's how the human mind functions; it is imitative. If we have enough red people around the earth, then more and more Italians will slip into being red people. Slipperiness has no direction, you just have to give them the right place from where to slip."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"And if we can create a rejoicing around the world, how long can England remain depressed? Nobody wants to be depresse d. How long can they go on singing \"God Save the King\"? And what about them? God only saves the queen or the king? -- what about the people? God has not been in favor of the people. Those people are waiting for something to happen in the world that can drag them out of their gloominess, their depr essiveness, and can make them free, free of the glory that they had of th e empire, which they are missing. We can give them a new glory which no body can take away from them. That glory that they had was really ugly: expl oiting people, poor people all around the world -- and your whole joy was de pendent on these st arving people, and you went on exploiting them. If you are sad and depressed today, it is the consequence of your own actions. You have made millions of people sad, depressed, you have killed millions of people around the world to save the empire; now who is going to suffer the consequences? England is now a dark hole. That does not mean that people want to live in that dark hole, but we have to make an effo rt to reach into their darkness with our torches, we have to throw ropes into that dark hole. Somebody is bound to catch hold of the rope and we can pull him out. And it is a question only of a few people starting moving, and others may follow. So in every country we have to work in a different way, seeing the country's characteristic. Now we have communes al l around the world. Every commune has to understand what kind of people you are surrounded with, and what can be done so that they can be pulled wi thin you. It is simple arithmetic. Q: BHAGWAN, WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WERNER ERHARD, THE BUSINESSMAN WHO DISCOVERED THAT PERSONAL GROWTH SELLS BETTER THAN ENCYCLOPEDIAS, YOU SAID THAT THE BUSINESS OF GROWTH IS JUST AN AMERICAN NAME FOR GOD. THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER CHRONICLE, REPORTING THIS, NOTED THAT YOU DID NOT COMMENT ON THE PERSONAL GROWTH MARKETING OF YOUR OWN RAJNEESH INTERNATIONAL MEDITATION UNIVERSITY HERE. WHAT IS THE DI FFERENCE AND WHAT PART DOES THE UNIVERSITY PLAY IN THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNE? A: The difference is great. He was a door-to-door salesman of encyclopedias. Our university is not going door-to-door to sell anything to anybody. Our university is a well. Those who are thir sty can come and drin k out of it. It is available, but we are not persuading anybody. On the contrary, I am making every effort to offend them, to make them angry, become our enemies. Do you think this is business tactics? In business, the customer is always right. Here the situation is totally different: the customer is always wrong. From what soever source he comes, he is always wrong -- and he comes on his own, in spite of all that I go on doing continuously"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"to prevent him from coming. Nobody in the whole world has offended so many people as I alone have done, singlehandedly. But even after all this turmoil that I cr eate, and offensiveness and antagonism in their minds, a few daring people come . These people can be relied upon. Just their coming is significant. Certainly, my university is not part of the marketplace. Werner Erhard was part of the market world. He was taking his est from one hotel to another hotel around the country, then outside the country. And he was neither a philosophical man, nor religious; he had registered est as a corporation, a business corporation. He was paying income tax for all his incomes. Our university is not a business. We don't have to pay any taxes for the university. The degrees that our university gives are of no use in the marketplace, because we don't want our degrees to be recognized by any government or by any university or an y other institution. We refuse to be recognized by them, because just the fa ct that we let them recognize us means they are somebody higher than us, so mebody more authoritative. We don't accept any government's recognition, be cause no government is worthy of it. Our university is absolutely a free phen omenon. Those who want to come, come knowing that whatever we have to offer is of no use in the marketplace. In fact it may make their market world more diffi cult for them, because a person who comes here for three months or four months to do a course in the university... we are not giving him growth the way Werner Erhard was giving. He started from where you are. Our work is first to destroy whosoever you are -- whosoever, without any condition. We destroy you first, di smantle you first, and unless we have deprogrammed you completely there is no growth possible. We don't teach you any growth. To be deprogrammed... you start growing on your own accord. Werner Erhard was teaching you techniqu es of growth, but if you are a monster and you are being taught techniques of growth, you will become a bigger monster. Werner Erhard never offended anybody. That's simply the way of the businessman: never offend anybody. Everybody was happy with him. The government was happy, the churches were happy, the politicians were happy -- not only in this country, but in other coun tries too. He used to go to India to pay respect to the so-called Hindu mahatm as. Muktananda was his guru. He even went to pay his respects to Morarji Desa i, when he was the prime minister of India. And by mistake he even came to me , thinking I also belong to the same category of mahatmas that he has known a ll his life. He must have been shocked. When he was sitting in front of me, I could see how difficu lt it was for him just to sit there. And when I told him he can as k anything, he simply said, \"No, I don't have any questions.\" Laxmi had given him my latest books, just as a present. He went into the hotel -- which was not far away, just a few minutes walk -- and gave those books to one sannyasin, Hridaya, without even looking at them. Some"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"great fear must have arisen in him. Reading those books might disturb his mind. And certainly I was not the person that he had expected. I would have destroyed his whole est first. I have to begin from scratch. First I have to demolish the old building completely, I don't believe in renovation. Howsoever beautifully you renovate a building, it still remains the old rotten thin g; just painted here and there, a little bit supported, but it is just the old rotte n building that you have given a facelift. No, it is better to live in an A-frame, but new, fresh, young. Werner Erhard is a businessman, there are no two opinions about it. And nobody can compare me with Werner Erhard. Our whole approach is totally different. Our approach is first to deprogram the person completely, and then leave him alone to himself. Don't give him another program. Leave him alone, empty, just a pure nothingness. And out of that noth ingness grows everything that existence wanted to grow in that man. We bring the person close to existence, from where he has been taken away. Once we see that you are communing with existence, our work is finished. We don't give you growth, we simply take aw ay all nonsense that is surrounding you and which perhaps you think is growth. Growth comes of its own accord, you just have to be utterly open and vulnerable. I am not a businessman. I could have b een and then I would have defeated all the businessmen in the whole world. But I have chosen to offend everybody, ready for their hostility from ever y nook and corner of the world. A businessman tries to be respectable, and I have been trying my whole life to be notorious. Unless you understand me, you will not be able to see why I unnecessarily create hostility in people. I am not a businessman. I have nothing to sell to them. If they are courageous enough to come nearer to me, I am going to burn their whole personality. I'm going to take their whole skin off their body and then leave them alone so they ca n grow fresh from the very beginning. That growth will not be in any way a credit to me. That growth will be a credit to the person who dared to come, who dared to pass through the fire, who dared to risk his whole life. The whole credit goes to him. Q: BHAGWAN, GOING BACK TO HOLLAND: YOUR COMMUNE IN HOLLAND WAS LIVING IN A PRIS ON AND NOW HAS MOVED INTO A MONASTERY. IS THIS PROGRESS? AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM HAVING A DISCO IN A CHURCH NEXT? A: That's great. I want discos in all the churches and ca thedrals and all the mosques and all the temples around the worl d. They are the best places for disco. So this is a great advance, that they ha ve turned a church into a disco! That's what I want. And if they have moved to the monastery, for the first time the monastery will have real people, not hypocrites, in it. For the first time, the monastery will hear"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"laughter and singing and dancing and people loving each other. The monastery may have seen monks who were simply monsters and nothing else. Now the monastery will see what really the word monk means and what is the meaning of being a monastery. The word monk means one who is capable of being himself, individual, alone, independent. That is the meaning of the monk: alone. It has nothing to do with Christianity. You will recognize the word in other words: monogamy, monopoly -- it is the same word. Monk, monast ery... MONASTERY means people living there totally independent, completely free from any strings and yet they have one thing in common: that they all want to be alone and individuals. This is the common factor that keeps them together. So it is good that our commune in Holla nd has moved into a monastery. We will make it a real monastery because my pe ople are real monks, and the monastery will be really celebrating. My people, even if you give them a graveyard, are going to make a carnival there. The grav es will become tables for drinking wine. They will soon turn the graveyard into such a beautiful place that you would never imagine that thousands of de ad bodies are under the ground. The actual fact is, wherever you are sitting , at least ten persons' dead bodies are on that spot underneath you. So many millions of people have lived down the millions of years, it has been calculated that not a single inch on the earth is not a graveyard. And for all these people who have lived on the earth and died, this is the minimum -- that on every spot at le ast eight persons are buried deep down. So there is no problem: when we can make any place a place of joy, we can change a graveyard into a joy. Just inqu ire of those people.... Because it happens often that by the side of the churches there are graveyards, by the side of the monastery there are graveyards. If ther e are graveyards, transform them into dancing places, playing grounds; fill them with laughter and joy. Perhaps those who are buried there will have for the firs t time a time which they never had in their life. It is just great. Q: DO YOU THINK SOME OF THOSE GHOSTS MIGHT STILL BE KICKING AROUND UNDERNEATH? A: There are no ghosts. There was only one ghost -- the holy ghost -- and he too finished only by making a poor girl pregnant. Then what happened to the holy ghost? He must have committed suicide, thinking of the consequences that followed his making the woman pregna nt, which was illegal, criminal, irreligious, a sin. Secondly, out of that sin, what else ca n you expect but Jesus Christ? People had to crucify him. Seeing his son being cruc ified, do you think the holy ghost would have survived? Since then, nothing has been heard about him. No news... the Vatican is silent."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"There are no ghosts, there are only dead skeletons underneath. The soul goes on moving to new forms. It depends how you have lived. Your whole life essence determines your new form. What you have desired your whole life and have not been able to fulfill, that desire at the la st moment of your life stands as the only thing that determines your life. There is nobody directing anything, it is simply the law. For example, a man goes on writing to me -- obviously he's from California. It is so difficult to find anything right in Ca lifornia. The man goes on writing to me that he loves to dress himself in women' s dresses. When he was in California, there was no problem. There are many wh o are doing that and they are doing it perfectly. It is very difficult to detect that this is a man -- with tits and all! But here he finds it difficult, because everybody knows he is a man. So he goes on asking me what he should do: \"S hould I go through plastic surgery and become a woman?' Now, this man if he dies will become a woman. That is his whole mind, full of only one desire: to become a woman. And it is my experience that this is not an exceptional case, this is the rule. Men get tired in seventy years' life of being men, and every man thinks women are more juic y, enjoying life more , and he has been simply sucked of all his energy. And the woman her whole life goes on th inking that, as a woman, whatsoever she is going to do, she is not going to be really equal to man. Liberation or no liberation, man is going to dominate her. The woman carries the desire to be a man, and my experiments with many people about their past lives even surprised me in the beginning, because th e man was a woman in the past life, the woman was a man in the past life. For many lives you have been human beings, man or woman. But if we go deeper, you have been animal s. If you go still deeper, you have been plants -- but that is millions of lives back. The whole physiological, biological evolution stopped at man. This whole grow th up to now was ho rizontal. At this point, man has come to a crossroad. He can go on horizontally, changing man to woman, woman to man, but there is no growth. Now he has to take a vertical route, not horizontal. And that ve rtical route is my whole effort. Meditation is a way of giving you a vertic al route. Then there is no need to be reborn. Bodies move horizontally, souls have wings. Once you are fully alert, aware, conscious, enlightened, then this is your last body, because only bodies can move on the horizontal line. Now you are a soul. You will have to move vertically. But what a joy! Not to have a cage of bones, muscles, blood vessels, nerve system, a skull.... Sometimes it is good experience to go to a medical college and see a skeleton: this is you, really naked. Not only the clothes are removed... he has gone too far; he has removed everyth ing. Just bones, just the fundamental structure is there, and everyth ing else has been removed."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Once in a while, standing before a mirror, just close your eyes and think that you are a skeleton. Then open yo ur eyes and look into th e mirror. Try to figure out what kind of skeleton you have. That's why I say you should first see a few skeletons. I suggest to Vedant and Siddha that in the university you should have a few skeletons hanging around all over th e place, so nobody can bypass -- and that will prove also that this is no t a marketplace, and everybody has to understand that this is your reality. Wh en the soul is free from all bondage, it moves into the cosmos, it becomes one with the sky, with the sunrise, with the flowers, with the birds, with all that exis ts. It spreads all over. It has no more any limitations, it is as big and vast as the whole universe itself. That's what I call liberation. That is the end, because nothing is more blissful, more ecstatic, than to achieve it. Q: BHAGWAN, EARLIER ON YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND YOU WERE JUST TALKING NOW ABOUT THE LAST DESIRE AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH, SO IF SOMEONE GETS REBORN INTO SOME NATIONALITY , DOES THAT WHOLE NATIONAL HISTORY BECOME PART OF THE BODY, OF THE MIND, OR HOW DOES IT CONNECT? A: Mostly it never happens, or very rare ly. A Dutch is born again in Holland; a Hindu goes on again and again being a Hindu, because his whole conditioning can be adjusted in a Hindu environmen t. Perhaps, rarely.... I have yet to come across a person who was something else in hi s past life; now he is an Italian, and in the past life he was a German. People go on being born in the same race, in the same atmosphere. The only change that happens is from man to woman. Perhaps my people will find it difficult where to be reborn, because now they don't belong to any race and they don't belong to any country. But don't be afraid, we have so many sannyasins throughout the world, you can get born as a sannyasin somewhere -- and there are a few sannyasin women, sannyasin men, who want children. But I have not come across a case where somebody is born from Tibet into India, or from India into China. It is unnatural. The soul flows in the same rut to which it has become accustomed. There are many cases in India of small ch ildren remembering their past lives. It happens only in India, for the simple reas on that that is the only country that believes in rebirth. Christians believe in only one birth, Jews believe in only one birth, Mohammedans believe in only one bi rth. It is only the religions born in India who say that there are thousands of births. It is a long process -- seventy years is not enough for a sleeping person to be awakened. He needs more time. They believe it; I know it. It is certainly true; it is not a hypoth esis. But I don't want you to believe it, because for you it will not be a truth. I would like you to explore. Go back into your past lives -- it is really a tremendo us trick, just terrific -- and as you go"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"backwards, you are simply amazed what kind of person you are and how many forms you have taken before. And this is a great help, to understand that no form has been a contentment to you. From ever y form you have died in discontent and despair, so now don't miss the chance of moving vertically. It is good for animals to move hori zontally. Ordinarily , they also move horizontally, and it is symbolical, really significant. The only animal on the earth standing, against gravitation -- walking on fo ur is easier because it is not against gravitation, the force of gravitation is equally distributed all over the body-you are also vertical, just as gravitation is vertical. That's why in sleep you find so much relaxation, because in sleep you be come horizontal. You get tired standing up, sitting long; then you need lying down. How does that lying down bring you rela xation, rejuvenation? Just being in tune with gravitation. Standing, you are re ally doing a miracle. You are against gravitation, which pulls everything down , and your heart has to pump blood into your head, upwards. It is a miracle that you are performing every second. Your heart is really a rebel, a revolution against gravitation. It is forcing blood upwards. It is now a well-established fact why anim als have not been able to grow brains: for the simple reason that they are hori zontal. In their heads, blood flows so much that the necessary small cells wh ich constitute your brain-seven million cells in your small skull -- are so small that in that flood of blood they cannot survive. They cannot be born, either. Just because man stood on two legs and th e head became against gravitation, a very small blood flow reaches to the head and the head can grow a very delicate system of nerves, a delicate combination of cells. But for that a very small and silent flow of blood is needed. That's why I'm against anybody doing the headstand posture of yoga. More than three seconds is dangerous; your brain cells cannot stand too much blood coming to them for more than three seconds. And you can see the result: not a single Hindu yogi has contributed anything to the world. Those yogis are standing on their heads, they destroy their brain, and the brain is the necessary instrument to create anything. The Hindu yogis have be en the most uncreative people in the world, they have been just the parasites of our society. So, anybody who is interested in standing on the head, it is really a good exercise -- but only for three seconds. Then just be back on your feet. It is good because it refreshes your mind: just a sudden sho wer of blood and the whole mind is refreshed. All the dead cells will go back when you jump again to your feet, the blood returning back to the body will itself take all dead cells that were hanging around in your head. The exercise is g ood, but exact timing... nobody should do it more than three seconds. So, people are continuously born into th e same culture, except a few exceptional people -- travelers, nomads, who don't have any home, who don't have any"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"attachment, who may be born into some new environment. And that's from where the trouble child is born. You know the word problem child. It is not the child's decision to make any trouble, but he is a misfit, he does not belong to your heritage, your conditions, your past. He has some other past, some other conditions, and there is going to be a clash between the parents and the child. Most probably the parents are going to prevail, they will destroy the chil d's heritage and force him to belong to them, to their race, to their religion. But these children who are born into a diffe rent race, into a different country, for some reason, are really very valuable. Any problem child is a very valuable phenomenon. If we allow him freedom to grow, he will bring new richness to your race, to your country. He will intr oduce something that your race has never known. These children prove to be the geniuses. And vice versa: you can look into the lives of your geniuses and you will always find in their childhood their parents had as much trouble with them as human beings can tolerate. All geniuses are a trouble in their childhood, and any child who is not a trouble in his childhood is going to do all kinds of businesses -- Werner Erhard and all kinds of shops an d marketplaces -- but he cannot be a genius. It is difficult... he is burdened with his own past, and his parents have burdened him with their past. He is in a kind of split. Perhaps this will give some insight to you about schizophrenia. Why do some people suffer from schizophrenia? Beca use from two different directions two conditions meet in them, but they cannot mix and become one, they remain two. Sometimes one is up and the person starts speaking in a different way, behaving in a different way; another time the other is up and the person behaves so diametrically opposite to his normal behavi or that all you can do is take him to the psychiatrist. You start thinking he is sick. He is not sick, he is simply suffering because two long traditions have met in him. All that he needs is to be a witn ess of both the conditionings and separate himself, disidentify himself from bo th the conditionings, and the whole schizophrenia will disappear. In fact, the moment he disidentifies hi mself from both the conditions, he will have a richness that you cannot have, because he can use from both the conditions, both the heritages, things which he wants. He is now the master.

AND I WAS HERE LAST WINTER AT THE WINTER FESTIVAL . AND ONE WEEK AGO AT THE OFFICE I GOT A TELEPHONE CALL FROM BHAGAWATI WHO ASKED ME IF I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN INTE RVIEW WITH YOU. SO HERE I AM. I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 QUESTIONS. AND I CHOSE ABOUT TWENTY... I SELECTED ABOUT TWENTY OUT OF THEM. ANSWER: Good, let's start. Q: MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE: BHAGWAN, I HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN A CLIMATE OF CRITICAL JOURNALISM. I AM TAUGHT AS A JOURNALIST NEVER TO BELIEVE ANYONE ON HIS WORD. ARE YOU CAPABLE TO COMMUNICATE YOUR MESSAGE TO SUSPICIOUS JOURNALISTS? OR IS TRUST NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN? A: No. No faith, no belief, no trust is needed. And what you ha ve been taught as a journalist, to be critical, skeptical, is exactly my message. Be critical, be skeptical. Go on saying no until you can find the yes which you cannot deny. My people are not people who have gather ed here because of a certain faith or belief. They are inquirers, seekers with open minds, and they are being taught only one thing: never accept anything unless you can experience it. Critical journalism is just third rate, because it is only the mind, the reason. But the mind and reason can be very easily defeated. Jus t a little sharper intelligence is needed and your criticism will be gone. But the criticism I am teaching to my people is something far deeper and far wider. I am teaching them not to argue about truth, because there is no way through argument to reach the truth. When ever two arguments fight, all that is"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"proved is who was more capable of argui ng. Truth is never proved that way, truth has to be experienced. So deny every belief and deny it absolutely. Not even a lingering shadow of be lief should be within you. Q: SO YOUR SANNYASINS ALSO SHOULD BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY? A: They are. Q: AND WHEN YOU SAY, \"DO THIS AND THAT AND THIS WILL BE THE RESULT,\" THEN THEY ENTER IT WI TH A SKEPTICAL, CRITICAL MIND? A: Certainly. Whatever I say to them is hypothetical, just the way science works. A scientist enters into an experiment with a hypothesis. Hypothesis means not belief, but just that one has to begin so mewhere, so for the moment he accepts a certain concept and enters into it with absolute alertness so that he is not deceived by his own hypothesis. He has to be aware that it is only a hypothesis and not a truth. Q: BUT YOU ALSO SAID, \"TRUST ME, FOLLOW ME.\" A: That is said to those people who have arrived. I have been speaking to millions of people. And when I speak to a person, I cannot take account of the whole world. My statement is direct an d immediate and personal. When I have said to somebody, \"Trust and follow me ,\" that means the person has arrived. Now there is no need of an y skepticism, no negativity. Now there is no need for him to unnecessarily harass himself, he has done enough. But not before that. Q: SO TRUST IS A LATER STATE? A: Yes. Q: MAY I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION? I BELONG TO THE DIMINISHING MINORITY OF DUTCH PEOPLE WHO REGARD THE HOLY ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AS A WONDERFUL INSTITUTE IN WHICH A LOT OF WISDOM CAN BE FOUND. AT THE SA ME TIME I ENJOY YOUR BOOKS AND VIDEOS. IS THIS A PARADOX, AN D IF SO, WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT? A: It is a paradox and you know exactly what has to be done about it. If you could have left me, you would have left . You cannot leave me. So the paradox is dissolved: Catholicism is finished. "},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Q: I MEET IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PERSONS WHOM I SINCERELY EXPERIENCE AS SINCERE. AND I HAVE OFTEN READ THAT FOR EXAMPLE MOTHER TERESA... YOU MOCK HER A LOT. I ONCE MET HER MYSELF AND I FOUND HER A BEAUTIFU L WOMAN. WHEN I ASKED HER, \"SHOULD CHRISTIANS CONVERT PE OPLE OF OTHER RELIGIONS TO CHRISTIANITY?\" SHE ANSWERED, \"NO, LET EVERYBODY GO HIS OWN WAY. YOU GO YOUR WAY TO GOD, I GO MY WAY. \" AND I FOUND HER A SINCERE WOMAN, AS FAR AS I CAN EXPERIENCE. A: First, there are sincere people in ever y religion, but groping in the dark. So if you meet in the Catholic Church sincere s eekers, it is your duty to bring them out of the Catholic Church, beca use there they are not going to find what they are seeking. A seeker cannot seek if he is surrounded by dogma, by a certain attitude about reality -- and that too, two thousand years old, out of date, out of existence. Those Catholic Churches are just gravey ards. Those people may be seekers and sincere. Tell them, \"You are searching in a graveyard. Come where life is. Come where dance is. Come where the fresh wind is blowing. In this stale, closed Catholic Church, you are going to get suffocated and die, you are not going to find it.\" Because they are sincere, that's why you ha ve to be sincere with them too. They need respect -- but not only respect; they also need a shock so that they can wake up and come out of the boundaries of Ca tholicism, or Protestantism or Hinduism or Mohammedanism -- that doesn't matter. My work here is to bring everybody out of his prison; what the name of the prison is does not matter. The person who wants to know the trut h has to be completely deprogrammed. He should not have any belief, he should not have any religion, he should not have any nation, he should not have any race, he should be just a simple human being. From there, with that inno cence, like a child, he has to start. Q: IT SEEMS, BHAGWAN, WHEN YO U ARE AN OUTSIDER -- WHEN YOU ARE A COMPLETE OUTSIDER -- IT SEEMS THAT RAJNEESHISM ALSO IS A PRISON. I WENT INTO IT A LITTLE BI T AND I SEE THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. BUT HOW CAN YOU MAKE CLEAR TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT THIS IS IN FACT AN ANTI-CHURCH? A: Just wait, let me first finish your question completely. I cannot leave Mother Teresa alone. So whenever Mother Tere sa comes in, please don't change the subject. You say she is a beautiful woman. I have no disagreement about it. But what she said to you is not beautiful -- that you follow your path, I follow my path. This is not compassion. If I see you following on a wrong path I will try every effort to obstruct you from going there, and I will try to convince you that what you are doing is wrong. That is compassion."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"And all the paths are not right. There are three hundred religions in the world. All three hundred religions are not right. This is nice to say that you follow your path, I follow my path and everybody follows his path, but that means Mother Teresa does not know at all what is right. This can be said only by an ignorant person. If I know what is right, I also know what is wrong, and I will make every effort to prevent you if you move on the wrong path. To me that will be compassion. You got influe nced by the old woman.... Q: I THINK SO, A BIT.... A:... But things are not as they appear. She goes on co nverting orphans into the Catholic Church. The orphan may be a Mohammedan, may be a Hindu, may be a Jaina, may be a Buddhist. She does not think those orphans should follow their path. Just because she has been feeding them, she has purchased them for the Catholic Church. She wants more and mo re orphans, she wa nts more and more poverty, because without poverty and with out orphans, the number of Catholics cannot increase. It is power politics, the politics of numb ers. And when you l ook deep down into the whole thing, you will not say that she is a beautiful woman. She is a politician and her answer was diplomatic. It consoled you, that you go on your path, I go on my path. It gave you certai n strength, but that strength is going to be given to your ego. I cannot say, \"You go on your path.\" You don't know what your path is, where you are going. I know there is only one path, there are not many paths. So the man of compassion will try in every way to persuade you, to convince you; rationally he will make the effort. And if there is a possibility of an open heart, he will make a heart to heart cont act too. When somebody is drowning and you are standing on the bank of the river, you don't say, \"You go on your path and I am going on my path.\" Do yo u think that is beautiful? You have to jump and save that man who is drowning. And now Catholics need to be saved. Je sus started saving people, although he could not save himself; and for two thou sand years these people are trying to save people. They have not been able to save anybody. On the contrary, they have been fighting crusades, burning peop le alive. These are the saviors of man. And if Mother Teresa has any intelligence left -- I suspect not, but if she has any intelligence left, the first thing would be to get out of the Catholic Church. Q: AND BECOME A SANNYASIN.... A: Certainly. Because I can say on my ow n authority that I can save her. She cannot say on her own authority anything. She can quote the dead Bible, she can quote Jesus Christ. I am not quoting anybody. I am saying it myself. "},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Q: AND YOUR PATH IS OBJECTIVE? A: Absolutely objective. Q:AND ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWS YOUR PATH FINDS THIS TRUTH? A: Certainly. Q: MAY I PASS TO ANOTHER QUESTION? A: Is Mother Teresa finished...? Pass on. Q: READING YOUR DISCOURSES, BHAGWAN, ONE MEETS WITH CONTRADICTIONS CONSTANTLY. I DID NOT STUDY ALL YOUR BOOKS OF COURSE, BUT BASING MYSELF ON THE ONES I DID READ, I THINK THERE ARE NOT MANY STATEMENTS OF YOURS WHICH ARE NOT COUNTERED BY OTHER STATMEN TS. AM I RIGHT THAT YOU CONSTANTLY UNDERMINE YOUR OWN TEACHINGS? WHAT IS THE UNCHANGING NUCLEUS IN YOUR VISION? A: You are right. I am a man of contrad ictions; and my understanding is that only idiots are consistent. The higher your intelligence, the more contradictions will be in your life, because you are constantly growing, expanding. Every day new facts arise in your consciousness, and then the question arises to go with the reality that has been revealed today or ju st to remain consistent with your past, dead statements. I am not such a coward as your philoso phers and theologians are. I don't bother about anything that I have said, ever. My whole concern is this moment. If it contradicts my whole life, it is perfectly okay, there is no harm, it is good. And I am not saying that I will remain tomorrow with the same statement. Tomorrow will bring its own light, tomorrow will bring its own experience, and only tomorrow will decide what statement I am going to make. Q: BUT IS THERE AN UNCHANGEABLE NUCLEUS, THEN, IN YOUR VISION? A: Yes, my consciousness, my awareness. But that you cannot find in the books. That you can find only in yourself. I am absolutely alert. Whatsoever I am sa ying, I am not saying according to some dogma, according to my own philosophy up to this moment. No, I am simply responding to this moment, to you. And I don't care about an ything else for the moment. I am a man who lives moment to moment. And whatsoever happens in the moment, I am available to it."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" Q: AM I WRONG WHEN I SAY, WHEN I TRY TO DESCRIBE YOUR NUCLEUS, THE NUCLEUS IN YOUR VISION, AS CELEBRATING LIFE? A: No, that is just a by-product. Th e nucleus is consciousness, absolute consciousness. Out of it many things wi ll be there: celebration of life, love, laughter. Out of it so many branches and so many flowers... but the nucleus remains consciousness. And that I have never contradicted in my whole life. I cannot, because whatsoever I have said, I have said with full consciousness. But that was in that moment. For example, I may fall in love with a woman, and in that moment I may say to the woman that I will love her forever. And I am not cheating, I am not deceiving; that's my response in that mo ment, and I am absolutely clear about it. But that does not mean that tomorrow I will not change. I am not saying that I will never change; I am simply stating my response to the moment. The next moment nobody knows what will happen, and the next moment I will not find myself chained by my own past. So my approach is to go on dying to the past moment continuously so that you can be alive in the new moment that is coming. Death to the past, life to the present. And the future is going to come to you as present, never as past. Q: THAT MEANS, I THINK, TRY TO LIVE WITHOUT TRADITION. A: Certainly. Q: AND NOW MY QUESTION IS: THIS IDEA THAT YOU TRIED TO DESCRIBE OF LIVING OUT OF THE FULLNESS OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS AND IN THIS MOMENT, HERE AND NOW -- IS THIS IDEA NOT ALSO A PRODUCT OF TRADITION? A: No, because nobody has said it before. No tradition exists around this idea. Buddha was very consistent. Forty-two year s' teaching... you cannot find a single contradiction. In Buddha, Mohammed, yo u cannot find any contradiction. In Jesus you cannot find any contradiction ei ther. These people lived according to a certain dogma. They were prisoners. I am a free bird with no cage around me . And I want to break all the cages of everybody, so the whole sky is yours. So metimes it is sunrise, sometimes it is sunset. Sometimes it is day and sometimes it is night. Things go on changing in existence, and a man of consciousness re mains in harmony with existence, with the continuous flux of existence. My statem ents in the past are as dead as I am to the past. "},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Q: BUT WE ARE ALL STILL READIN G THE BOOKS YOU SPOKE IN THE PAST. IS THAT SENSELESS THEN? A: It is significant. But don't trust those books against my present. Perhaps reading them you may be able to unders tand what I am saying now. All those contradictions and all those books will help you to understand my present state and my present statement about existence. That is their only use. If you can understand it without them, burn them. There is no need of all those books. I have never read any of my books, and I am not ever going to look at them -- because past is past, gone is gone, an d I don't live in a g raveyard. Only dead people can be consistent, because they cannot contradict anymore. I am alive, and I am going to be alive to the very last breath of my life. My last breath will also be a statement, perhaps contradicting all that I have done and said before, so wait. Q: SO, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE THAT AT THE END YOU WOULD SAY, THE VERY NOTION OF ENLIGH TENMENT -- FORGET IT! A: I can. I can say anything, I am so fr ee. Don't you see the beauty of freedom? You can say anything, you can live anything. There is no bondage on me. At the last moment I can say, \"All this busine ss of enlightenment is simply bullshit. Forget all about it\" -- and perhaps a few people may get enlightened only when I say that. Nobody can make a dogma out of me; no body can be a pope after me, because he will be in so much trouble. Nobody ca n be a successor to me because he will not be able to manage all the contrad ictions, thousands of contradictions. Q: SO THE ONLY NUCLEUS IN YO UR VISION IS BHAGWAN HIMSELF A: Certainly. I am the center of my circ us and when I am gone, who bothers what happens to the circus? Q: YOU SAID JUST A MOMENT AGO, \"I WANT TO SHOCK PEOPLE AWAKE.\" AND I HAVE THE FEELING THAT VERY OFTEN YOU SHOCK WITH SUCH A HEAVINESS THAT YO U PROVOKE A LOT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST YOURSELF, AGAINST YOUR SANNYASINS. IS THIS PRICE WORTHWHILE? A: It is absolutely necessary -- no ques tion of its worthwhileness. I want their hostility, I want their aggressiveness, because their hostility and their aggressiveness is going to work in tw o ways. If my sannyasins are simply ignored, nobody takes any offense, that simply means I have nothing to offer to the world, no contribution, nothing new. It can be ignored. The only thing that I"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"hate is to be ignored. Be aggressive -- that I accept, because at least a certain relationship has started happening between me and the person who is aggressive. Hostility is emotional and the beauty of the whole game is that the hostile person is burning himself. I am not hostile; I have simply triggered something in him and he is burning himself. And nobody can remain hostile for long. It is a sickness. He ha s to find some way out of it. Either he has to forget all about me -- which is impossible because I have hurt him so deeply.... Neither can he forgive me nor forg et me -- the only possible way is to come close to me and tr y to understand what I am doing. \"Is it really right for me to be hostile to these pe ople? Is it right for me to be so full of hate with these people?\" And anybody who comes closer is going to change. This has been happening every day. In Ahmedabad a man came and fell at my feet. I said, \"What is the matter?\" He was crying. He pulled out a big knife and he said, \"I had come to kill you because what I have heard about you, that you are destroying the whole tradition of Hinduism, made me so angry, but wh en I heard you something suddenly changed in me. I could see that you ar e not interested in destroying any tradition. You are simply interested in helping people to find the truth, and if something has to be demolished on th e way, removed from the way so the person can reach to the truth, you are doing that.\" And he wanted to be initiated into sannyas. Hate can very easily turn into love, just as love can turn into hate. They are two sides of the same coin. So it is with full awareness that I am continuously creating enemies around the world. I don't want anybody to go on sleeping without being disturbed. Perhaps a few of them may wake up. Most of them will take a turn, pull over their blanket and go to sleep again, but that is not my responsibility. If out of a hundred even one person wakes up and sees what has happened, that my hit over his head was not against him but was against his sleep, he will be grateful to me. Those who are hostile to me can be grateful to me if they wake up. If they don't wake up, they are already asleep, let them sleep. And what harm can anybody do to me? At the most they can kill me -- that is nothing, because I have known everything that can be known and I have experienced everything that can be e xperienced. Now I am almost living a posthumous life. As far as I am concer ned, I have come to the point beyond which there is nothing. And I am so.blissful that if somebody wants to assassinate me I don't see any harm in it. People are afraid of death because they ha ve not lived yet and death is coming closer. I have lived, I have tasted the ne ctar of life. Now there is no problem for me, so I can create as much hostility as possible in the hope that perhaps a few, out of thousands, may wake up. And they are waking up. "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Q: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IS ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD AS \"MENTAL HEALTH\" IN SOCIETY... WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS AS SLEEP? A: The society that exists today is retarded . Its mental age is below thirteen. It is worse than asleep. What do you expect of a seventy-year-old man, carrying a small intelligence of a thirteen-year-old boy? The distance between his intelligence and his life is so big. This is sleep. The awakened person move s together almost as an organic unity. With his physical age, his mental age goes on growing. With his mental age, his spiritual awareness goes on growing. If a person really goes on growing simultaneously on all levels of life, then only you have a perfect Master someday. Otherwise, the so-called masters are mast ers just for those retarded people; the so-called saints, saints only for th e retarded. And nobody wants -- your politicians, your priests -- nobody want s man to be intelligent because it is against their vested interests. An intelligent man cannot be Catholic, an intelligent man cannot believe in the boundaries of nations, an intelligent man cannot conceive that white and black colors make any difference. An intelligent man will have a totally different vision of life. These vested interests cannot allow this e arth to become awake. Before it wakes up, they are ready with all their nucle ar weapons to destroy it. It is such a calamity. To me, the destruction of life is not the real problem. The real problem is that man is now at a point where thou sands of people can become enlightened, and the politicians are preparing to dest roy this whole living beautiful earth. Q: YOU MEAN WITHIN THE COMM UNITY OF SANNYASINS, THESE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BE ENLIGHTENED? A: There are many who are not even sa nnyasins... they can be awakened. Man has gained a certain maturity.... Sannyasins certainly, but there are many who are potential sannyasins, like you; I can see yo u in the orange robe any day. It all depends on your courage. But I can see a man of intelligence in front of me, who can understand, and he would like to ha ve his consciousness blossom to its fullest. Q: YES, BHAGWAN, BUT IT WOULD BE, FOR ME, A BLIND GAMBLE. A: Every search is a blind gamble. Those who are afraid of blind gambles remain stuck and starve, they never grow. One ha s to take the risk. One has to stake everything. And as far as I have known, anybody who has taken the risk has never been a loser."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"I don't play the game of being a loser in any way. And if I tell my people to stake everything, I can say it with certainty, ca tegorically, because I know that if they can stake and risk, they will be reborn. There is an old story. A man was traveling and got lost in the night, in the mountains. He was really very much af raid, alone. The place was unknown, the road was lost, there was no light. As far as he could see, there was no village, no lamp. But still he tried to find his way, and then he slipped from a rock. Holding the roots of a tree, he was hanging. The night was becoming colder and colder and he knew that soon he would not be able to keep a grip on the roots; the hands were becoming frozen. His death was near. He looked, and by the side, there was abysmal darkness. He knew there was a big valley by the side of th e mountain and there was no chance of surviving. Finally, his hands started slipping. There was no way to prevent it. But he was in for a great surprise. When the hands slip ped and he thought, \"This is my last moment,\" and he prayed to his god in whom he believed, the roots slipped out of his hand and he was standing on the gr ound. There was noth ing, and the whole night he had suffered. And it was getting to be sunrise and he could see that this was strange, he was standing on the road! Risk is there, but I know the path. I know that if you are ready to lose your grip, you will be immediately on the clear grou nd, on the way; you are not going to lose anything. This is the whole funct ion of the Master. The function of the Master is not to give you beliefs, is not to give you philosophy. His function is to give you confidence in yourself, to make you a gambler from a businessman. Q: BHAGWAN, WHEN I GET AROUND YOUR SANNYASINS -- I GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH THEM, IT'S PLEASANT TO BE WITH THEM -- BUT I VERY OFTEN FEEL THAT TH EY FOLLOW YOU BLINDLY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I AM WRONG OR RI GHT BUT I VERY OFTEN GET THIS FEELING. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAID TH E OTHER DAY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PRODUCE TEST-TUBE BABIES. NOW I'M SURE, IN SOME DAYS, ALL YOUR SANNYASINS KNOW THIS IDEA OF YOURS AND THEY AGREE WITH YOU. NOW, IN TWO WEEKS YOU SAY SOMETHING OPPOSITE -- ALL YOUR SANNYASINS AGREE WITH YOU. A: That means they are also growing with me. That does not make any problem. Q: BUT WHERE IS THEN THE DO UBT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF? I CANNOT, EVEN IF I WOULD LOVE YOU DEEPLY, I COULD NOT FOLLOW YOUR OPINIONS EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY YOU CHANGE YOUR OPINIONS, DON'T YOU? "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"A: That means you are not growing with me, you are lagging far behind. My sannyasins are my fellow travelers. Sometime s I walk fast, they have to walk fast. Sometimes I dance, they have to dance. Sometimes I just relax and they have to relax. They are just my fellow travelers. There is no philosophy, no belief, no faith. They are love, pure love towards me, just the way I am pure love towards them. It is a love affair. Q: BUT YOU CANNOT DECIDE TO HAVE A LOVE AFFAIR. A: Nobody decides. I am simply love. I never fall in love. I am in it, I am it. Others go on falling in love with me. But they don't lose anything; the moment they fall in love with me, they have di scovered their life's juiciest moment. They could not have even dreamed about it. Your question is very relevant. In the beginning, a sannyasin is baffled, confused that I said one thing yesterday and I am saying another thing today. Now what am I supposed to do? In the beginning, it happens to every sannyasin . Soon he starts understanding that what I say is not the point. Somewhere between my statements there is a gap. Between my words there is a gap. Between my lines there is a gap. That is my real statement. Soon they start learning it, then they don' t care what I said yesterday and what I said today. They don't compare. The gap is the same, the words have changed. The lines are different but between the lin es.... The moment they start seeing me between the lines, between the statements, all their trouble disappears. And it is not belief Q: THERE IS OBJECTIVITY BETWEEN THOSE LINES? A: Yes Q: MAY I ASK QUITE A NOTHER QUESTION? ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND IN THE NETHERLANDS ALSO, WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH YOUR ROLLS ROYCES, OF COURSE, AND I DECIDED I HAVE TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS. A: You ask anything you want. Q: SO I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAI N THAT I, MYSELF, AM THE HAPPY OWNER OF A CAR OF THE JAPANE SE MAKE, TOYOTA COROLLA. NOW, I WOULD RATHER HAVE TWO OF TH EM, SO I WOULD HAVE ONE IN RESERVE BUT I COULDN'T IMAGIN E WHAT TO DO WITH THREE TOYOTAS. YOU HAVE, IF I AM RIGHT, SEVENTY-FIVE ROLLS ROYCES AT YOUR DISPOSAL. THEY'RE NOT.... "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"A: You're not right. One has just arrive d -- and I have no problem. There are ninety Rolls Royces, and I have no problem; and you are having problems, even with three? Poor guy! And that, too, To yotas, a third-rate car... just a toy. And just with three you are.... And I am soon going to have 365, and still there will be no problem. I don't see any problem. I never go to the garage. I don't even know what car they are going to give me today. My people are there and they are intelligent enough, they can take care of anything. If they can take care of ninety Rolls Royces, they will be able to take care of 365. This is their problem, not mine. And I don't think they are troubled either... they look so happy. A new car arrives and they are rejoicing. There is no problem in having two or th ree cars. The problem is somewhere else which, out of respect, you are not asking me. Q: WHERE IS THE PROBLEM? A: Yes. It is not the number. Your ques tion is not Rolls Royces but Ethiopia, India, poor countries, poor people around th e world. I am making it clear to you, because I can see it is there within you. A Rolls Royce is just to bring the question out, but you love me so you cannot ask directly. You are going around about... there is no need. Q: MAY I PHRASE THIS QUESTION? A: That's what I was doing. You can ph rase.... I was phrasing your question. Q: MY QUESTION, WHICH I HAD WRITTEN DOWN FOR THIS, IS WHY, IN YOUR VISION, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK ON YOUR OWN PERSONAL GROWTH AND AT THE SAME TIME HELP YOUR NEIGHBOR? WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE A SANNYASIN AND AT THE SAME TIME HELP ETHIOPIA? A: Nobody is preventing anybody. I am no t saying to my sannyasins, \"Don't help the neighbor.\" I am telling them, \"Help the m!\" And the only way to help them is to hit them. They are asleep, they have to be awakened first. Any other help will be coming later on. Set their houses on fi re so they have to wake up and escape out, then we will catch hold of them. I'm not preventing my people from he lping, but again the same problem. Because you love me, you cannot say it di rectly -- I have to phrase it for you. Q: PLEASE DO. "},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"A: You want that the poor should be gi ven bread, butter, clothes, shelter, that there are sick people who need hospitals, that there are beggars in the world... something has to be done for them, and this should be my sannyasins' responsibility. I don't consider it my sannyasins' responsi bility. If there are poor people in the world, the priests and the politicians, and the scientists and the educationalists all are guilty of it. They have created a world which has to be poor and they exploit the poverty in many ways. For ex ample, this beautiful woman, Mother Teresa. I don't think her face looks beautifu l, but tastes differ. Your taste is a little strange. Would you like to get married to her? -- then you will know how beautiful she is. These people who have been serving the poor, catering to the poor, are helping the poor to remain poor. Otherwise, th e poor either would have died out of poverty or would have gone through a great revolution and changed the whole society. Only two things are possible if no help is given to them. I want no help to be given to these people; they should take their own responsibility. If they are poor and they don't want to go through a revolution, change the whole structure of the society, destroy the whole status quo, throw these governments away... and if you cannot do that, then at least you can die. Don't unnecessarily be a nuisance around. For example, in Ethiopia where thousand s of people are dying every day, the priests and the bishops and the popes and politicians are all just sympathy for Ethiopia. And they are trying to send fo od, medicine, but their whole effort is very hypocritical. On the one hand they wa nt to save the poor in Ethiopia, on the other hand they are piling up nuclear weapons. For whom? They are not lifeloving people, they are showing symp athy to Ethiopia just as part of diplomacy. It has nothing to do with service to humanity, because their small support that they are sending is not going to help, it has not helped. It is almost like dropping a teaspoon full of sugar in the ocean to make it sweet. Great responsibility you are fulfilling: you destroyed one cup of tea! I am not in favor of sending any help to Ethiopia. Only one thing is possible: if these big dodos around the world, presid ents and prime ministers and kings and queens, if they are really concerned with Ethiopia, then there are two alternatives for them. Stop piling up weapons an d divert the whole money and energy towards Ethiopia, and Ethiopia will be saved today. Or, if you cannot do that, then at least do one thing: send your medical people to inject these people with something that take s them into eternal sleep. It is better to die than to starve for ninety days and th en die. It is compassionate. And there is no harm if there is no Ethiopia... what harm? Q: SO, IF I UNDERSTAND YOU WELL, BHAGWAN, YOU SAY THAT THE MISERY IN ETHIOPIA IS VERY REAL. "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"A: Mm hmm. Q:... AND THIS REMINDS ME OF ONE OF YOUR DISCOURSES IN WHICH YOU SAID, \"YOUR MISERY IS BOGUS.\" AND THIS AT THE TIME MADE RATHER AN IMPRESSION ON ME, AN D I BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT MY PERSONAL MISERY IS BOGUS INDEED. A: Mm hmm. Q: BUT THEN I WONDERED, IS TH E MISERY OF THIS ETHIOPIAN MOTHER, SEEING HER CHILD DYING OF STARVATION, BOGUS ALSO? A: It is a totally different context. When I said your misery is your responsibility, I meant your anxieties, your anguishes, your expectations, your frustrations, your aspirations, your ambitions which are not going to be fulfilled. I meant your mental anguish. That statement was in a totally different context. But in Ethiopia, it is not that the mother is imagining that her child is dying. He is really dying. The child is not imagining that the mother is dying; the mother is really dying and soon she will be dead. And fortunately in Ethiopia there are no t Christian Scientists. There has been a movement in America of Christian Scienc e. Christian Science has as one of its fundamentals that whatsoever you think becomes sooner or later a reality. Thoughts are the beginning of a certain reality. I have heard the story that a young boy met an old Christian Scientist lady. The lady asked the boy, \"I have not seen your father for many days. Is he not coming to the meetings of our group?\" The boy sa id,\"He's sick. He's in his bed.\" The old woman said, \"Nonsense. This is just mind. You just tell your father that he is only thinking he is sick:'Just think you are healthy. Think positively that you are healthy. Get out of your bed, be positive.' Don't fall into negativity -- this is our whole philosophy: positive thinking.\" After three or four days, the boy meets the old woman again in the market and the old woman says, \"What happened? Did you manage to convey the message to your father?\" He said, \"Now my fath er thinks he's dead. And not only my father -- everybody thinks he is no more in the house, he is in his grave!\" The misery in Ethiopia is real, objectively real, and these sympathies are not going to help. They are simply keeping peop le starving, dying. And it is better to die instantly rather than to wait and suffer all kinds of torture that this hungry man is bound to suffer. And this is a thing to be understood , that a normally healthy man can live without food for ninety days, then he w ill die. Now, making these people suffer for ninety days does not seem to be compassionate. To me it is more compassionate that they are given injectio ns so they go into eternal sleep. And"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"anyway the soul does not die, so what is the problem? All these religions believe that the soul does not die, so what is the problem? Communists believe that when you die, ev erything dies. Then, too, there is no problem. I don't see a problem from any si de. And if Ethiopia is not there, who bothers? What has Ethiopia contributed to the world? Q: DO I UNDERSTAND YOU CO RRECTLY, THAT YOU SAY NOBODY SHOULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT ETHIOPIA? A: I am saying either do -- that means stop piling nuclear weapons, that is my first alternative. If you are really sy mpathetic towards dying people, then why are you creating weapons for death? That is simple hypocrisy. Stop! If you are really concerned with dying people, then whatsoever is happening in Ethiopia is nothing to what has happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those few moments, the people of Hiro shima and Nagasaki have suffered as much as one can suffer in the Christian hell. And you have now seven hundred times more nuclear weapons than there we re available at the time of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And they go on piling up. On the one hand, seventy-five percent of the income of every country goes to war; and on the other hand, these politicia ns really have beautiful masks. And they must be having many because they have to change again and again. When Ethiopia is there and people are dying, you are so sympathetic and you want to save Ethiopia.... These two things don't go together, they are inconsistent. So my first alternative is that the nation s should stop creating more war, and the poverty not only from Ethiopia but from the whole world will disappear today. The poverty is there because our whole energy is involved with war, with the preparation for war. And if you cannot do it, then at least don't be a hypocrite. Be direct and say, \"Let Ethiopia die. We don't care. We are goin g to make more nucl ear weapons and we are going to have a third world war, and what does it matter?\" The whole world is going to end in the third world war. Ethiopia will be saved from nuclear weapons, they will die before that. That's perfectly good. Let them die, but don't be a hypocrite. Q: BHAGWAN, IF PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD DECIDE TO ASK YOU TO BE HIS ADVISOR, WHAT WOULD YOU AD VISE HIM IN REGARD TO THESE NUCLEAR ARMS? A: Just tell your scientists to find some creative use for all these weapons, because you cannot throw them into the Pacific; sooner or later they will explode just by accident. You cannot throw them into the Atlantic, you cannot throw them and bury them under the earth. Anytime, anything can trigger them and they can explode your own country or somebody else's. But energy is neutral,"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"energy is never decisive whether it can dest roy or it can create. It depends on the direction that the human mind gives it. If the human mind can create nuclear weapons to destroy, it can change nuclear power into construction. It can create more electricity, it can give better rains, it can give better earth. It can do miracles. So much energy is piled up in these tw o nations, and smaller piles in smaller nations, that if they all simply thin k once, \"What are we doing? Our scientists should be together....\" My advice is that the scientists should not be under any national regime. There should be a world academy of scientists who can decide how to convert nuclear weapons and energy into positive things. It is possible. Q: BUT PRACTICALLY, SHOULD THE UNITED STATES DISARM? A: I am not saying disarm. Changing nuclear weapons into creativity does not mean disarm; because you have many mo re arms than just the nuclear weapons. You could fight the first world war with out weapons, you could fight the second world war -- you had already won befo re you threw the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Germany had al ready surrendered and Japan was on the verge of surrendering. Atomic and nuclear weapons should be co mpletely converted to serve humanity. And go back before the first world w ar: those bombs and those airplanes are good. Whenever you feel an itch to fight, fight! Up to the first world war I allow; then figh t. It is perfectly good once in a while, good exercise. But I am not ready to accept the third world war. Every effort should be made to prevent it -- and this is a beautiful chance. Ethiopia, India and other countries of the third world are on the verge; any moment there will be more Ethiopias. It is good we start transforming that energy into something positive and creative that can help these people who are dying. If you cannot do it -- remember my cond ition -- if you cannot do it, then don't unnecessarily try to pretend that yo u are Christians and Catholics and Protestants, and you are sending money and you are sending blankets, and you are sending clothes and food. It is not go ing to help, it has never helped before. This has been happening again and again through history. Just be very clear and send medical teams so all Ethiopians in one night go into eternal sleep. At least they will not be hungry tomorrow morning. Q: YES. A: And you will be at ease, Ethiopia w ill not be a troublesome problem for you. So I am giving two alternatives. And re member my first priority is to stop"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"nuclear weapons piling up more and more , and divert the whole money that you are wasting on nuclear weapons. My second alternative is: if that is not po ssible, then just simply accept the fact that we cannot save Ethiopia, but we can at least help them to die peacefully. We cannot help them to live peacefully, at least we can help them to die peacefully. And that will be really great compassion on the part of politicians. Rather than leaving them starving, dying, getting to rtured by hunger.... For four years there have been no rains. Water has become almo st impossible to get. Not only food is not available, water is not available. And it is only in one coun try right now, but soon India will be joining it, because half of the Indian continent is starving. And you will be surprised to know that the Indian prime minister is selling wheat to other countries. Fifty percent of his own nation is starving and the wheat is being sold because he wants a nuclear plant in India. Can you see the stupidity of this whole thing? Q: MAY I CHANGE TO A SUBJECT WITH A BIT MORE FUN? A: You can change. Q: IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU DESCRIBED YOUR COMMUNE AS A CIRCUS AND YOURSELF AS A GREAT SHOWMAN, THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD. WERE YOU MOCKING YOUR SELF AND YOUR COMMUNE? WHY DID YOU SAY IT? A: Again, you are bringing the past here. Forget all about that nonsense. I am a showman? And my people a circus? I contradict it completely. Q: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT NOW? A: Yes... there is no circus here. This is the only place where a circus is not happening. Q: AND YOU ARE A SERIOUS TEACHER? A: I am a very non-serious teacher! An d I have already forgotten about what news conference you are talking! I just respond to you. Why drag the dead unnecessarily out of their graves? Let th em sleep silently. You are alive, I am alive, we can have an existential encounter. And I see the potentiality in you, that's why I am saying that. I would not have said it to another person. I have been interviewed every night, every evening -- and now this is going to be continuous -- but I would not have said that to another journalist. I don't see you just as a journalist, I see you more as a seeker. I see you more as a human being. And I see your heart throbbing with me, in tune"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"with me, that's why I am saying it. Otherwise, I can go on answering about the past, anything that comes to my mi nd, there is no problem about it. I love jokes. And to joke on other people 's account is not very good, not nice. So, once in a while, I joke upon myself, upon my people. And it was simply a joke, and those idiotic newspaper journalists th ought it is something serious. Do you think a showman will sit here in the desert? Is this the place for a showman? Then I would have chosen Hollywood. On the contrary, I have pulled all my Hollywood people here. In this desert, 126 square miles, I am si tting the whole day in my room. I only come out twice: in the morning to talk wi th the sannyasins, in the evening to talk with any interviewer. What kind of a sh owman do you think I am? This is not the way of being a showman. The showman has to be always running -- like Mother Teresa. She is in New York, she is in Chicago, she is in Washington, she is receiving a Nobel prize in Norway, she is in India, Calcutta. I wonder when she gets the time to serve the poor people. All the time she is moving around the world, becoming a bigger and bigger celebrity. The more she is be coming senile, the bigger a celebrity she is becoming. And when does she serve the poor people? She is inaugurating colleges, schools, hospitals.... I don't have any time for showmanship. I will tell you my routine and you will see: from where can I get the time? Six o' clock in the morning, I wake up. That too, my caretaker, Vivek, has to wake me up, otherwise I will not wake up. Who cares to wake up again? I have been waking for half a century again and again. It is enough. But she wakes me up, gives me a cup of te a. Just to be respectful to her, I drink the tea. My tea is not much, it is just water and tea le aves. No sugar, no milk. If that kind of tea is served in heaven, a ll the saints will start moving towards hell. Then -- I have always loved water, from my very childhood -- one and a half hours in the morning I am in my bathro om, enjoying the bathtub, the shower; and the same in the evening, one and a half hours again. After my bath, immediately I have to ge t into the car and move to the Mandir where my people are waiting. Back to my place, it is lunchtime. I take my lunch at eleven, and go to sleep again, which I have done most of my life. I had to miss my classes when I was a student, and my teachers allowed it because if they did not allow, then I used to sl eep in the class. I said, \"The re is no way ... I have to sleep these two hours.\" When I was a professor, I was sleeping two hours and I had told the vice- chancellor that during these two hours no classes should be given to me; otherwise I would be sleeping there. At two o'clock I wake up, and for one hour I go for a ride. That is the only time I come in contact with the Rolls Royces. I love driving, and I have certainly one of the most beautiful roads, because it is ma de by my sannyasins only for me. There"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"is no traffic, so I need not bother whethe r I am driving on the right or on the left. The whole road belongs to me. One hour there and back home. One and a half hours I simply sit silently in my chair doing nothing and let the grass grow by itself Then my bath. After the bath, I take my supper; and af ter the supper, I am here. I will be back there nearabout nine, nine-thirty. Then comes my personal secretary -- with letters from all over the world; news cu ttings about me from all over the world, anything that the personal se cretary feels I need to know -- because I don't read. Since five years I have stopped reading anything: books, newspapers, magazines, anything. The clippings that my personal secretary brings she has to read; I simply listen. Nearabout eleven, I go to bed again. Now, where will I find the time to be a showman? Yes, you can look at my dress and think it looks like the dress of a showman. It is not, it is the love of my people. I am dressing for them. They make beautiful dresses, they enjoy maki ng them for me. I cannot refuse them. And to whom am I going to show? I never go out of this place. You see my watch? I have hundreds. My people are really intelligent people -- no Master in the whole history can claim such an intelligent group. Now, this is made by my sannyasins. It has already defe ated Piaget -- and it is made of real stones, not diamonds. Q: REAL STONES? A: Real stones, not diamonds. So don't carry the idea that it is a fake watch. Real stones are as real as real diamonds, there is no question of its being fake. I just heard on television one stupid journa list saying that I have been using fake watches. I cannot understand: so authenti c stones, and you call it a fake watch? Its time is absolutely perfect; in a year only one second will be the difference, and that is the best any watch can do. It is as beautiful as any diamond. The same watch from Piaget is a half million dollars , just because of an idiotic idea that diamonds have some value. This watch co sts nothing, but I will not sell it even for ten million dollars because it is invaluable. It is made with such great love that it is not a saleable thing. Love cannot be sold. But to whom am I going to show the watch? My people know my dresses, my people know my watches, my people know me. I don't mix with anybody else, I don't go anywhere else. As far as I am concerned, the third world w ar has happened, and only Rajneeshpuram is saved. There is nowhere else to go. I was simply joking. And my people are working hard, twelve hours, fourteen hours a day, transforming a desert into an oasis -- and do you think these people constitute a circus? You will not find anywhere in the world such hardworking people, and they are not being paid, because we don't believe in any way inside the commune that money should be used. There is no need. We fulfill our needs, our food, our"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"clothes, everything, so nobody needs an y money. Whatsoever he needs, he can get. These people are working so hard, and for what? To entertain somebody? These people are creative people. They love me and now they want to materialize my vision into reality. And they are ready to do anything for it. In festival times, they are working fourteen, sixteen hours a day with no complaint. Nobody is telling them or forcing them. Q: YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THEM? A: No. Not at all. I never talk to them about these things. I never talk about the commune, about any mundane things. They are intelligent enough that they can manage themselves. And they are doing so well that it cannot be improved. Q: IT WAS THEIR IDEA, IT WAS NOT YOUR IDEA, THIS COMMUNE? A: It is my vision, and their love for my vision, but the idea to materialize it is theirs. I am a dreamer: I can give you beau tiful dreams, and I give for free -- I don't charge for them. But then if you ge t caught up in the dream and you start trying to materialize it, that is your responsibility. I simply watch from the outside. It is not a circus. The Vatican may be a circus, and with Pope the Polack it is bound to be a circus. Nothing more can be expected of this thick head. I was just joking, laughing. And our people were th ere in the press conference and they enjoyed. You should listen to the video of the press conference , then you will see how much our people enjoyed and how si lly the journalists looked. They could not manage to ask any significant question. But you need not bother about those pe ople. You have a certain acquaintance with me, so I know these answers will be enough for you. If you want to add something, you can add -- I give you the au thority. I love you and I trust you. I know you cannot do anything that will be against me. Okay? Q: THANK YOU.

I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT; THAT THE PEOPLE ARE COLD AND DISINTERESTED IN THOSE OF US WHO LIVE OUTSIDE -- AND I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT. AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT I HAVE NOT FELT IN MA NY ROOMS IN MY LIFE AS MUCH LOVE AS THERE IS IN THIS R OOM RIGHT NOW. AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE MAY REALIZE THAT. I WANT TO TALK FIRST ABOUT THE CITY OF RAJNEESHPURAM WHICH I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW AN D VISIT IN A VERY QUICK WAY TODAY, AND ASK IF THIS DEV ELOPMENTAL PROCESS, THAT MAYBE THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH AS I NOW BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE, COULD IN YOUR MIND DEVELOP INTO A PROTOTYPE OF WHAT CITIES POSSIBLY COULD AND SHOULD BE? "},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"A: Yes, that's exactly my idea. This lo ving commune should become a prototype, because in the vast world, even though you are in the crowd, you are alone. Here, even if you are alone, you know and you feel the warmth of people all around you. Love is something which is nobody's monopoly. A loving person is simply a love-radiating energy. And when there are thousands of people radiating love, there is a certain energy field. I calle d it the Buddhafield. Anybody who comes will receive the love, the friendship, the hospitality... but people are afraid to come. Q: WHY? A: For the simple reason that we are st rangers. This is animal instinct. Animals are afraid of strangers. Every animal has its own territorial prerogative. If you keep out of the territory he will not get di sturbed or upset, but if you enter into his territory, then immediately he is hostil e. That instinct is still alive in man. We are outsiders. In many ways our ways of thinking are different, our values are different, our priorities are different . We are for a better man and for a better humanity, and their fear and hostility is natural. Q: ARE THE HOSTILITIES CREATED OR PERPETRATED BY THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND THE ABSENCE, AS IT WOULD APPEAR TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, OF A WILLINGNESS FOR THE RAJNEESHEES TO GO OUT, RATHER THAN ACCEPT IN, SO PEOPLE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM? A: No. This is my basic standpoint: not to go out, because that is interfering into somebody's world. I am not a missionary and I hate the word. I don't want anybody to be converted, and I don't wa nt anybody to be convinced that we are right. In fact the people who try to convince others that they are right are basically, deep down in themselves, not convinced that they are right. Convincing others, they are making an effort to convince themselves. When they see they have a crowd convince d, then they feel at ease. Then they know, \"I cannot be wrong. If so many pe ople are converted by me, then I cannot be wrong.\" This outgoing is impossible for me or my people. We are here, we do no harm to anybody, and we don't want to interfere in anybody's thinking, way of life, his style, his religion, his politics -- we do not want to interfere. We accept him as he is. But if he wants to be acquaint ed with our world, he is welcome. Q: BUT TO BE EXPOSED TO YOUR WORLD, TO HAVE SOME POSITIVE EXPOSURE -- THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO hate THIS PARTICULAR GROUP, THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THE GROU P, I WOULD IMAGINE, WHO FEEL"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"THAT AND REALIZE THAT HATE OU TSIDE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT GOES ON HERE -- WOULD IT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA, not AS A MISSIONARY, not REACHING OUT TO CONVERT, BUT IN FACT TO INFORM? A: I will wait, because if they are hating me and my people, they are on the way towards Rajneeshpuram. Hate is a relation ship, and sometimes far stronger than love. And once they come here, then we will see.... Q: BUT IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THIS HATE -- USING THAT WORD, SINCE I BROUGHT IT UP -- IS BRED BY FE AR, WHICH IS BRED BY SOMETHING UNKNOWN. THIS IS A MYSTERIOUS WORLD INSIDE THIS VALLEY. A: Yes, that is true. That mysteriousne ss in this valley will attract only those people who are ready to go on an advent ure, who want to explore, who want to know the unknown -- and those are the only people who have any worth. Q: WHAT KIND OF WORTH? A: They are adventurers -- they are on a pilgrimage to know the unknown -- they are the real people. Others are just liv ing like animals, without exploration. Q: SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TH AT SELECT GROUP OF RISK-TAKERS? A: Yes. With me, only that select group can have a communion. Q: WHAT IS... WHAT IS THE FUTURE -- AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OR ADDRESS YOURSELF TO IT -- BUT WHAT IS THE FUTURE OFRAJNEESHPURAM? WE GOT OFF THE TRACK A LITTLE BIT. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TH E DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY, THE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT I'VE SEEN TODAY -- AGRICULTURALLY, CERTAINLY THE COMMUNAL WAY OF LIFE. WHAT DO YOU VIEW AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS VALLEY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS TRAVEL WITH YOU? A: I'm not concerned with it. My concer n is with people and their growth. The city is their concern, not my concern. And I have so many intelligent people here, architects, engineers, doctors, professors -- from all the professions, daring, adventurous people have come to me. Now it is up to them, a mundane affair, I don't care about it. I trust them, they will be able to manage, and they are managing. And they will be able to develo p it technologically, but it is not my concern at all. "},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Q: WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN? A: My concern is their spiritual growth. Their intelligence should come to its highest peak. They should be deprog rammed from all past, rotten and dead, meaningless and harmful.... My work is not to create the city, but to create the man, and then the man will take care of the city and the houses. That is a totally different matter. I don't bother about it. But my basic concern is the individual. Th e individual is to me the highest value in life. And all the religions of the wo rld have repressed the individual. They have all made him feel guilty, they have all made him somehow think himself unworthy, a sinner. All the religions, in different ways, have forced everybody into a corner where he is no more human. They have humiliated humanity. It was their vested interest. They needed a world of slaves, not a worl d of rebels. And you can make a person shrink if you make him guilty. You can make him afraid of hell, you can make him greedy for heaven, and this way you can make him completely forget this moment, this life. All the religions have been trying... either they are focusing you on the past, or they are focusing yo u on future, beyond death. No religion bothers that you should be alive, laughi ng, living, loving, flowering -- here and now -- and that's my purpose. Q: DO YOU THINK THAT THEY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE BIG BUSINESS AND THAT IS THE WAY TO CONTROL PEOPLE? A: It is a great conspiracy between the polit icians and the priests. It has been for thousands of years. The conspiracy is that the politician rules people as far as worldly things are concerned and the pr iest rules people as far as their psychology, their mind, their souls are co ncerned. And they have enslaved man in every possible way: the politician fr om the outside and the priest from the inside -- they have destroyed all potential of human beings. My work is to bring that potential back , make the person aware that he is not guilty if Adam and Eve disobeyed God -- that is their business. You cannot be guilty for Adam and Eve disobeying God. Th is is so stupid! In the first place, disobedience is not always bad. And as far as Adam and Eve's disobedience is concerned, it was certainly beneficial to humanity. In fact, God was the enemy, because he was prohibiting Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of knowledge and the tree of eterna l life. Now, who is the enemy? Wisdom, knowledge, science -- all that we value in life -- paintings, poetry, sculpture, nothing would have happened if Adam and Eve had not disobeyed. They would have been still naked animals in the garden of Eden, chewing grass! Q: MY GOD, I HOPE THAT... I CAN'T PICTURE ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM CHEWING GRASS!"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" A: You cannot picture it because of Adam and Eve. You should feel grateful to Adam and Eve! Q: I DO NOW! A: Yes! Q: YOU KNOW, PSYCHOLOGISTS T ELL US ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS ARE DIRECTED BACK TO OUR MOTHER, BUT NOW YOU'RE TAKING IT SO DAMN FAR BACK, I CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND IT! A: They take all the problems to the moth er and they forget the real father. That is male chauvinistic psychology. The whole psychology is created by man, just as all the religions are created by man. Th e woman is condemned by the religions, and she is condemned now by the psychologists. In fact the psychologist is slowly taking the place of the priest because the priest is becoming out of date. Younger generations are no more interested in the priest. They have seen five thousand years of human history, what these priests have done. The younger generation is more interested in psychotherapy, in psychoanalysis, in other different methods of psychic expl oration. The priest is no more in the powerful position that he has always been. So you will be surprised that all the priests in the world are now studying psychology, to become psychotherapists . It is going to become a necessary qualification for every bishop, every prie st, to have some degree of psychology, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, because they are aware that their power is slipping away and the psychologist is replacing them. He is becoming the new priest. But the trouble is, the new priest is also serving the old vested interest; he is not revolutionary. Q: IS NOT THE PROCLIVITY TOWARD PSYCHOLOGY APPOINTMENTS OR PSYCHIATRY APPOINTMENTS -- WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY, AS THEY STATE IT, FIND OUT ABOUT THEMSELVES -- SOMEWHAT THE SAME PARALLEL AS TO WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM? A: No! Because your psychologists, even the founders -- Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung, Adler, Assagioli -- even they knew nothing about themselves, so how can they help you to know yourself? Jung had been to India. He went to see the Taj Mahal, he went to Calcutta, to Bombay, and everywhere he was told, \"You being a great psychologist, the place you should go first is to a man in sout h India, Maharishi Raman.\" That man was conceived by the whole country as one wh o knows himself \"You should go there"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"and see whether it is true or not. And if he knows hi mself, perhaps you can learn something from him; if he does no t know, you can help him to know.\" But he would not go there, and in his diary he wrote: \"I was afraid to go there, to face the eyes of a man who knows himsel f, because I don't know myself.\" He returned without going to Maharishi Ra man. And when he was back he must have been feeling guilty, that this is no t right. Going to see the ruins of palaces was worthless for a psychologist. He was no t a historian. Going to see big cities, what was the point for him? He must have started feeling guilty, that everywhere he went, every friend he knew, all the professors in all the universities, in all the psychological departments, were pointing towards one man -- and he did not go there. Out of that guilt he started writing agai nst Indian mysticism. He started saying that Westerners should remain aloof to the Eastern tradition of mysticism, because it is dangerous for the Wester n man. Western man's development is different, Eastern man's development is different, their psychologies are different. This he said for the first time after coming back from India. Psychologies are not different. There may be minute details which are different, but the basic psychology is not different , cannot be different. He projected his own fear over all history. So I don't think these psychologists are helping anybody in any way. They can't help themselves. Do you know, the suicide rate of psychologists is double that of average human beings. Q: I THINK IT'S EVEN WORSE.... A: Yes. It may have grown higher, becaus e for five years I have not been reading a single word, of any book, of any n ewspaper. For five years I have simply stopped... so perhaps it may have gone hi gher. But five years ago, it was double. And the same was the situation with madness -- it was double any other profession. And the same was the proportion of all kinds of perverted acts. These people -- suicidal, insane, committing perverted acts, finding excuses to do them through psychology -- do you think they can help anybody to know himself? Q: IF YOUR THINKING AND YOUR BELI EF IS AS YOU STATE IT -- AND I ASSUME CERTAINLY THAT IT IS -- AN D THE WORLD IS IN THE CHAOS THAT IT'S IN... I MEAN, THIS IS ABOUT AS SCREWED UP AS IT CAN GET.... A: Yes. Q:... MAYBE A LITTLE WORSE DOWN THE LINE, BUT I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO MAXIMUM. "},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"A: It is. Q: WHY THEN DOES NOT BHAGWAN STEP FORWARD, NOT AS A SAVIOR OF THE WORLD, NOT AS A GOD, BU T AS A MAN WHO HAS RECOGNIZED WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, HAS AN IDEA OF THE SOLUTION, AND MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW? GRANTED, IT'S AVAILABLE IF THEY COME HERE, BUT IT IS A MASSIVE JOURNEY TO COME HERE, AND THE ROAD IS TERRIBLE, BY THE WAY, WHICH DOESN'T HELP, EITHER.... A: It is a massive journey. That's why you are here: you take the message. Q: BUT I'M NOT A MISSIONARY EITHER. A: No, you are not a missionary. Q: AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A MISSIONARY. A: No. I don't want anybody to be a missionary.... Q: BUT YOU'VE BECOME A MAN OF THE WORLD. A: No. Q: YOU HAVE BECOME A MAN WHO IS VERY VISIBLE. OH, BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE. A: Mmm? Q: THE WORLD PRESS KNOWS ABOUT BHAGWAN. YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE GREAT SHOW BUSINESS TEACHERS OF ALL TIME. A: That's true! Q: AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT AT THE SAME TIME, ON A SERI OUS NOTE -- WELL, AM I CORRECT OR AM I NOT? -- IF YOUR MESSAGE IS AS YOU STATED, WOULD IT NOT BE TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL MANKIND IF BHAGWAN WOULD TAKE HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD? A: No, not on the road. I can manage fr om here! And I am managing it well! "},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Q: WELL, I'M SURE YOU ARE. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH, GETTING BACK AGAIN.... YOU KNOW, I WAS IN TIMIDATED.... I READ IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES, A RECENT ARTICLE -- AND ON THE BACK PAGE IS THE KIDS' CORNER WHICH WAS THE ONLY ONE I UNDERSTOOD. AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT COLUMN , A YOUNGSTER HAD TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS VERY EXCITE D ABOUT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS HELD HERE TWO WEEKS AGO AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WORLD PRESS TO GATHER AND MEET WITH YOU, AND TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY, BUT A LL HE HEARD WAS THE SAME OLD QUESTIONS. NOW I HAVE BEEN RACKING MY BRAIN SINCE THE PRESS KIT WHICH CONTAINED THAT PARTICULAR EDIT ION CAME TO ME, TRYING TO THINK OF SOME OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT I'M JUST A PRETTY SIMPLE GUY. WHAT I SEE IS, VERY SIMPLY, THAT YOU HAVE SOME THINGS TO SAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THIS POINT DON'T BUY, WHICH YOU MAY NOT CARE ABOUT. WHY DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT IT? A: Why should I care? Q: BUT WHY SHOULDN'T YOU CARE? ... AND WE CAN PLAY MONOPOLY WITH THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. A: No. Q: YOU STATE THAT YOUR INTEREST IS IN THE INDIVIDUAL. IS THAT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS HERE, OR WITHIN THE RAJNEESH GROUP? A: No. The individual is everywhere, whethe r he is here or not, because only the individual exists. Societies are just names, collectivities are all names. The reality is only of the individual. And I am tryi ng my best, sitting in my room. That's why You can see in all the papers, on the radio, on the television, a man who does not go out of this small valley. And I will go on hammering all over the world from here. What is the point of traveling? Q: WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS: YOU DO NOT GO OUT OF THE VALLEY, BUT IS IT NOT CORRECT THAT YOU SPENT THREE NIGHTS IN BEND AT THE RIVERHOUSE MOTEL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO? A: No. Q: THEN SOMEONE IS PAYING YOU THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPERSONATING YOU."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" A: Hmm! Q: BECAUSE IT WAS TOLD TO ME TH AT YOU SPENT A SUNDAY NIGHT, A MONDAY NIGHT AND A TUESDAY NIGHT, WITH A NURSE AND A BODYGUARD. AND YOU WERE SEEN IN THE JACUZZI AND IN THE LOUNGE AND YOU WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME. SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHY THEY KEPT SNIFFING MY HAIR TODAY BEFORE I SAT DOWN TO TALK TO YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DIDN'T SNIFF EVERYBODY'S HAIR AT THE RIVERHOUSE IN BEND, OREGON. THOSE KINDS OF MISDIRECTED IDEA S -- IF IN FACT YOU WERE NOT THERE -- SOMETIMES BREAK DOWN A LITTLE CREDIBILITY FOR BHAGWAN, AND I WONDER IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING -- GETTING BACK TO IT SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY -- TO BE PROJECTED TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. A: First, the nonserious part. Q: DON'T TRY TO GET A BIGGER LAUGH THAN I DID. A: I was not in the hotel, but I can be. Q: WELL, YOU PROBABLY COULD BU Y THE HOTEL IF YOU WANTED TO. A: In fact, I have... and I have everything that any hotel in America can have. You have just to see my bathroom. Perhaps it is the best in the whole world. Q: YOUR BATHROOM? A: My bathroom. Q: IS THAT AN INVITATION? A: Yes. Q: I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE. I'VE BEEN TOLD I BELONGED IN THE BATHROOM BEFORE, BUT NEVER INVITED TO ONE. A: I am a rare and a unique person in ev ery way: I invite you into my bathroom! Q: THAT IS UNIQUE. BUT WHERE DO WE GO FROM THERE? "},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"A: There is nowhere to go. Enjoy the jacu zzi there, enjoy the shower there, enjoy the hot shower, enjoy the ice-cold shower.... Q: AND THEN GET OUT... L UNDERSTAND! I NEED TO KNOW THIS FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION: HAVE YOU EVER INVITED A MEMBER OF THE PRESS TO YOUR BATHROOM BEFORE? A: No... Q: THANK YOU. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. A:... because I never liked any man the way I like you. Q: I WONDER IF THIS COULD BE LOVE? A: This is! Q: INVITED TO THE BATHROOM.... W ELL, I'M SURE THE LISTENERS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE THINKING YOU AND I ARE GOING TO START A NIGHTCLUB ACT. WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL -- SINCE YO U WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS A MOMENT AGO -- OF UNITING THE WESTERN PHILOSOPHY, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT MATERIALISTIC, AND TH E EASTERN PHILOSOPHY, WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY NOT MATERIALISTIC BUT IS MORE AN INNER -- WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT -- AN I NNER RECOGNITION OF ONESELF? NOW YOU HAVE DONE A MAGNIFICEN T JOB IN MANY RESPECTS -- THAT DIAMOND WRISTWATCH OF COURSE IS CERTAINLY NOT AN EASTERN PHILOSOPHY -- AND YET TH E REST OF YOUR PRESENTATION IS SOMEWHAT EASTERN. IS IT POSSI BLE FOR THOSE TWO CULTURES TO UNITE? A: That's what I have been doing! And that's why both sides of the culture are angry at me. The Easterners are angr y with me because they think I am materialist.... Q: AND ARE THEY RIGHT? A: No. Q: YOU'RE NOT MATERIALISTIC? A: No, not in their sense. And the Wester n people -- particularly the materialist, the communist -- they are angry with me because I am bringing spiritualism."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"My approach is that man is both together . This existence is not split into matter and spirit. This existence is one organic un ity, just as your soul and your body are an organic unity. Your soul cannot exist without your body, and your body cannot be alive without the soul. I am destroying the whole idea of the separation, of a split between matter and mind, body and soul, materialism and spiritualism. I call myself Zorba the Buddha. My restaurants, my discos are a ll named after me: Zorba the Buddha. Now Buddhists are angry. The ambassador of Ceylon in America wrote me a letter saying, \"In my country people w ill be angry about it. Please don't use Buddha's name with Zorba.\" I replied to him, \"We don't mean your Buddha; your Buddha's name was Gautam Siddhart ha. Buddha is not an ybody's name, it is a quality. It means the Awakened On e. It can be used for anybody who is awakened. So don't get upset about it.\" My effort is that Zorba and Buddha have to be bridged. Zorba represents the materialist's life in all its luxury -- he nce this diamond wristwatch, hence all my Rolls Royces. I live the most luxurious lif e that any man has ever lived, with no worry. People have much more money -- I do n't have a single cent -- but they cannot live such a luxurious lif e as I am living, with no worry, no bank account, no income tax... and having everything that anybody can have! Q: WHAT IS YOUR SECRET, BHAGWAN? I REALLY THINK YOU'RE IN THE WRONG BUSINESS. I MEAN BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE JUST DOCUMENTED, YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CON MEN, IT WOULD SEEM. A: I am! Q: AND IT TAKES A GREA T MAN TO ADMIT THAT. A: Certainly! Q: AND IT TAKES AN EQUALLY GREA T MAN TO SIT AND ACCEPT IT AND REVEL IN IT, BHAGWAN. A: Right! Q: I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE FORMER DEAD CITY OF ANTELOPE. THIS HAS OF COURSE CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF CONTROVERSY. I HAVE ONLY LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL OREGON AREA FOR ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS. THIS IS MY FIRST TRIP TO THIS PARTICULAR AREA. IT WAS MY FIRS T TRIP THROUGH ANTELOPE, AND I GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD HA VE TO ASK IS: WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT ANTELOPE? I MEAN WHAT IS THE PURPOSE AND"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"WHAT ARE THE PLANS? I DON'T SEE IT BECOMING A RESORT AREA. I DON'T SEE IT BECOMING AN INDUSTRIAL AREA. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE FOR THEIR OWN PARTICULAR REASONS, WHO OF COURSE DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT MAN -- AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE. WHAT WAS THE POINT? A: In fact, again you bring me to someth ing in which I have no interest. Just not to be impolite to you, I am answering it. When we came here four years ago ther e was 126 square miles of land, just desert, and that one house there, for a gu ard to take care of the land -- what could he do with 126 square miles of land ...? And the owners ha d been trying to sell it for almost half a century, but who would purchase this desert, for what? When we came here I wanted a big place. That big a property was not available anywhere else. When we came here we need ed our people to stay in Antelope, because there were no houses here. Be fore we made houses and roads and restaurants and eating places, they had to remain in Antelope. The population of Antelope was less than my sannyasins. And the Antelope population started behaving with great hostility: they woul dn't allow any permit, they wouldn't allow them to purchase any land, they wouldn't allow change of zone -- small things. My people told them, \"We don't want your city or your government. We are simply here for the time being, an d we will be moving to our own city. But we have to create the city, and before we cr eate it we have to be here. This is the nearest place.\" And because they wouldn't listen, and they tried in every possible way to hinder, naturally my people thought that the best way was to take over the government. What is the need of asking permission from these people when we have the government and we give the permission? -- so they took over, there was no problem in it. If you had come four years ago and seen Antelope, you would not have believed it. Q: I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT TODAY. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT ALL THE FLACK WAS ABOUT. A: Four years ago it was absolutely a cemetery. Q: WHAT IS IT NOW? A: Now it is a dancing place. We have made a dead city alive. Now hundreds of sannyasins are living there. And since we took over the government, we have done many things there: we have made be tter roads, we are trying to make new houses, a big housing colony, we are going to make a big hospital there, we have"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"taken the school and raised the standard of the school. We are doing everything there, and now it is part of us. No w nobody can take it over from us. Q: BUT THEY ARE TRYING? A: They are trying and we are enjoying . They are trying to collect 84,000 signatures so that in the next election they can ask the governor to dissolve Antelope into Wasco County. They certainly know they cannot win, be cause only eight or ten old Antelopians are there and one hundred sannyas ins are there. They cannot win democratically, and this is absolutely unco nstitutional. If it is done, then we are going to fight up to the Supreme Court. Q: WAS IT CONSTITUTIONAL TO TAKE IT OVER IN THE FIRST PLACE? A: Taking over is not the problem. Th ey are the majority; the majority should rule. It is not a question of taking over. Q: IS IT AN IMPORTANT ENOU GH QUESTION THOUGH, NOW THAT YOUR CITY IS ESTABLISHED? A: Not yet. They are not allowing it to be established yet. Our city is under litigation. And we have been telling them that if you allow us whatever we need, if you help -- and we are creating a beauti ful place for you in a desert -- we can leave Antelope. That was our basic proposal to them. Q: AND THAT STANDS NOW? A: No. No more. Q: NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE? A: Now we are not going to leave! Q: AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INVITE ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE INTO YOUR BATHROOM? A: No. Q: YOU WILL FIGHT THIS AS HIGH AS IT MUST GO? "},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"A: We will fight it, and I know constitution ally it is absolutely wrong to dissolve. So let them.. and then we go to the Supreme Court. And it has been so in many cases; we have never been losers. Last year we brought thousands of street people to share our homes with us, and the Oregon government got simply mad ab out it. They started thinking that we were going to take over the county or we were going to take over Oregon. Q: THEIR FEELING WAS THAT YOU WERE CONTROLLING THE ELECTION, I THINK, IS THAT NOT CORRECT? A: No, not at all. Q: NO, I MEAN their FEELING WAS THAT. A: Their feeling was that. Q: AND THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE ELECTION COMMISSION LAST WEEK. A: Yes. That has been rejected. Q: BUT, IN DEFENSE OF YOUR ACTIONS, IS NOT THE OREGON ELECTION LAW, RESIDENT LAW -- I MEAN YOU CAN WALK IN AND TEN MINUTES LATER YOU CAN VOTE -- SO ANTIQ UATED THAT, ON THE BOTTOM LINE, IF YOU WANTED TO CONTROL THE ELECTION -- WHICH PROBABLY YOU DID... A: No. Q:... THAT YOU COULD BRING THES E PEOPLE IN AND THAT THEY COULD HAVE VOTED LEGALLY IN THAT ELECTION. IS THAT NOT CORRECT? A: We were not concerned with taking ov er the county. What will we do with the county? It is unnecessary, taking the burd en of the county, which is bankrupt -- why should we bother? We have to develop our own place! Q: WHAT DID YOU BRING THE PEOPLE IN FOR? A: We had surplus money. After every festival we have nearabout two to three million dollars and we want to share it. This time we will be bringing some other group. Each year we are going to bring different groups of people -- perhaps we may invite the blacks!"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":" Q: MY GOD, I DON'T KNOW IF OREGON'S READY FOR THAT! A: Get ready! But every year we are going to invite somebody or other. Q: WELL, THE COMPLAINT THOUGH, IN THE BEND AREA AND IN OTHER AREAS, WAS THAT YOU BROUGHT THEM IN AND THEN YOU TURNED THEM LOOSE. A: No. Q: AND THAT THEY THEN BECAME WARDS OF THE VARIOUS VENUES THAT THEY LANDED IN, FOUND TH EMSELVES IN... FOUND THEMSELVES INTENTIONALLY BREAKING LAWS SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE.... A: No. That is absolutely wrong, because we had brought people first with a contract that whenever they wanted to go , we would give them the ticket, return ticket. Q: YOU PROVIDED THEM ALL A TICKET? A: We provided all those people with whom we had the contract. After two weeks, we dropped the idea of the contrac t, because the idea was... how would these poor people dare to come here on a one-way ticket ? So we gave them round trip tickets -- they co uld go back -- but once they settled here, they started sending messages to their friends. Then we told the people, \"If they want to come.... Your people are there, you can contact them. You know what the situation is here -- if they want to come , we will give them only a one-way ticket\" -- and that was the contract. So those pe ople who had the contract for a one-way ticket got a one-way ticket, and that was their responsibility. We have nothing to do with it. And we were giving them three months to be here, every facility, but the Christians -- particularly Christian chur ches and associations around -- became very much troubled about that. The fe ar was that perhaps we would turn them into sannyasins. Christians started coming here, Christian priests started having demonstrations in Madras, in Portland, and they persuaded them to go back. Here they were receiving everything free, here they were living better than they had ever lived before, and many of them are still here. After three months it was a free choice for them: if they wanted to go back, their ticket was there; if they didn't want to go back, they could rema in here. They HAVE remained here, and we have been receiving hundreds of letters from the people who have left saying that it was wrong on their side to liste n to the Christians and leave the place. They would love to come back again."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"It was not our responsibility letting those people loose in Oregon. It was the State of Oregon and the Christian churches of Oregon who created the whole paranoia. The state created the paranoia about the election, and the churches created the paranoia about religion. But the people who are here -- nobody has tried to make them sannyasins. If th ey wanted to become, that was their business. And sannyas is such a nonserious phenomenon. It is not a fanatic type of group; it is very loose and free. If you want to become a sannyasin we don't make any conditions, we don't ask for any qualifications. You simply become a sannyasin. If you want to drop it, goodbye, you dr op it. When you drop nobody stops you, when you want to become a sannyasin nobody stops you. So those people who are still here are never going to leave. And we had no intention about the election. That's what the commission has found, that we had no intention at all to bring those people for the election. Q: IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THIS SEGMENT OF THE GENERAL SOCIETY TO COEXIST WITH THE GOVERN MENT AND THE PEOPLE OF OREGON UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THINGS? CAN YOU GUYS GET ALONG WITH THE FOLKS OUTSIDE? IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF THAT? A: I don't think so. Q: I MEAN, I DON'T CARE WHETHE R YOU WANT TO OR NOT, BUT NO MAN OR NO GROUP IS AN ISLAND, AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH. AND AT SOME POINT THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME COOPERATION IN SOMETHING. I KNO W YOU ANSWERED AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE IF THERE WOULD BE ANY POSSIBILITY FOR COEXISTENCE, SAY WITH THE PEOPLE OF WHAT US ED TO BE ANTELOPE, AND YOUR ANSWER WAS NO. BUT MY QUESTION IS: IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE RAJNEESHEES CAN BECOME COEXISTING, NOT SUBSERVIENT, BUT COEXIST WITH THE PEOPLE OF OREGON? A: No. To me the word COEXISTENCE is political, and it does not carry any good connotations with it. Coexistence me ans that we are enemies, but -- what to do? -- we have to get along. Q: CHOOSE ANOTHER WORD THEN, WHERE THE PEOPLE OF OREGON, WHERE THE STATE OF OREGON IS CONCERNED, THAT THE RAJNEESHEES COULD IN FACT ACCEPT. A: I don't compromise on anything.

That's why I said \"Neve r.\" When the question was asked about coexistence, I said, \"Never.\" But the woma n did not even wait for me to explain what I wanted to say. She did not ask about the implications. She simply left. That was enough. Coexistence finished! That woman immediately left the mike, and that was really symbolic. Q: WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE, BECAUSE I KNEW THAT YOU AND I WOULD GET ALONG VERY WELL, AND I'D PROBABLY DOMINATE THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS. AT THE... AT THE RISK OF BEING REDUNDANT -- AND THESE ARE THE MECHANICAL THINGS, SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE TALK TO ME FOR A MINUTE ABOUT GOD, AND THE FACT THAT YOUR ANSWER OR RESPONSE WAS, I BELIEVE, PARAPHRASING \"HE IS MAN'S GREATEST LIE.\" A: Right. Q: OR SHE IS MAN'S GREATEST LI E -- WHICHEVER THE CASE MAY BE. A: Right! Q: THAT'S IT? A: Yes. Q: LET'S TALK AGAIN ABOUT YOUR BATHROOM! WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION THAT CAME UP AT SOME POINT.... I HAD READ SO MUCH ABOUT RAJNEESHE ES AND BHAGWAN. FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS IN THIS AREA, I HAD NOW BECOME SO INUNDATED WITH INFORMATION.... YOUR CHA MBER OF COMMERCE, YOUR PUBLIC"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"RELATIONS DEPARTMENT, SENT ME TH E WORLD'S LARGEST PRESS KIT. IN SIXTEEN YEARS I COULD NOT READ EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THERE, BUT I TRIED! THE QUESTI ON THAT HAS COME UP IS THE JIM JONES PROBLEM, THE PARALLEL THAT HAS BEEN DRAWN THAT THIS IS IN FACT A RELIGIOUS FANATIC WH O IS CONTROLLING A CULT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL DO ANYTHING TH AT HE DECIDES THAT THEY SHOULD DO -- WHETHER OR NOT HE DECIDES THAT. I BELIEVE YOUR ANSWER WAS SIMPLY THAT THE CHRISTIANITY FACTOR IS NOT IN EXISTENCE HERE, THAT LIFE AFTE R DEATH IS BETTER THAN LIFE DURING LIFE. IS THAT THE COMPLETE ANSWER, AND IS IT NOT PROBABLY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT IN SOME RESPECTS THE TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED AT JONESTOWN WAS A RESULT OF PEOPLE FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL BLINDLY, AS OPPOSED TO A CHRISTIANITY QUESTION? A: Wait! It is not only that he was a Christian pr iest. There is great implication in it. The whole Christianity is death-oriented; the cross is its symbol. And if Jesus was not crucified, there would have been no Chri stianity at all. The Jews simply missed the point. The man was nuts! They should have ignored him, he was doing no harm to anybody. To crucify that nut created Christianity. I call Christianity, CROSSIANITY. It is not Christianity. Q: HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO SAY BHAGWAN IS NUTS, AND IF THEY WERE TO CRUCIFY YOU WOULD THE SAME THING HAPPEN? A: It will happen again if they cr ucify me. Again there will be another Christianity, so better tell them.... Q: LEAVE YOU ALONE! A: Leave me alone! Q: OKAY. A: It is in their favor if they leave me al one. If they assassinate me, it will be in my favor. Reverend Jim Jones had no similarity at any point with me. All his disciples were mostly black, illiterate. All my disciples are white.... Q: I SAW THREE BLACKS TODAY. "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"A: Yes, three you can see in five thousa nd people. That does not make even one percent. These white people have come fr om all over the world, they are all well educated, most of them are graduates, a large number of them have master's degrees, many are Ph.D.s, few are D.Li tts. His group and my group are poles apart. Those people were blindly following him, be cause that is what Jesus teaches. He was simply repeating Jesus' drama. Jesus is responsible. Q: FOR JONESTOWN? A: Yes. And the pope should be hanged! Q: WHO SHOULD BE...? A: For Jonestown -- the pope. Q: WELL, HE WASN'T IN OFFICE THEN. THE POPE AT THE TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANGED...? A: Any. Q: JUST PICK ONE OUT. A: Any will do, because he represents Jesus Christ. Q: BUT THEN WHY NOT HANG ALL THE PRIESTS AND THE BISHOPS AND THE CARDINALS AND THE ARCHBISHOPS...? A: That will be great! But that's what Jesus was doing with people, his followers: \"Believe in me, have faith in me, follow me.\" And that's what Reverend Jones was doing: \"Whatever I say you have to follow.\" Here I am saying to my people, \"Don't believe in my statements. Think over them, argue over them. You love me -- th at is another thing. That should not become your belief.\" Q: BUT ONE OF THE GREAT PLOYS IN THE HUMAN MIND AND MANEUVERABILITY IS FOR SOMEONE TO SAY, \"DON'T DO THAT,\" WHICH MAKES THEM WANT TO DO IT EVEN MORE. A: So what do you want? I should say, \"Do it\"? "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Q: NO, NO. DOES THAT NOT PUT AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU TO HAVE THIS KIND OF DEVOTION? A: No. Because I have been consistently denying to them, telling them, almost every day for thirty years, that I am not your leader, that I am not a prophet, that I am not a messiah, that I am not the on ly begotten son of God -- I am just an ordinary man as you are, with a slight difference: you are asleep, I am awake. But that is not much of a difference. I can just shake you a little and you will be awake. I have been telling them that I don't have any dogma to give them, any belief system to give them. Christians have told me that I should publish a catechism in which my whole doctrine is presented in sh ort, but that is impossible. I have 360 books and I have contradicted myself thousands of times, because to me, consistency is something that belongs to the stupid, unintelligent, retarded. A consciousness which goes on growing is bo und to contradict at each step the step that preceded it. They cannot make any belief out of my book s, out of my teachings. They can love me, and love is not adoration. Adoratio n is for somebody who is higher than you. Now I am doing my hardest to tell them that I am not higher, but I don't take any responsibility if they don't liste n. If somebody adores me, that is his responsibility, not mine. If somebody thin ks he is my follower, that is his idea, not mine. I am not responsible for anybod y. I am only responsible for myself, and I want my people to be responsible for themselves. Q: IS ANYONE HERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE ELSE? A: No, nobody is responsible for anybody else. Q: IS ANYONE IN THE WORLD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE ELSE? A: In fact they should not be. Only polit icians and priests have been exploiting people and saying \"We are responsible for you. We take the responsibility.\" That is a strategy to make them enslaved. The pr iest says, \"Don't be bothered. You just follow the Christian dogma, have faith in Jesus Christ and you will be saved.\" They are taking their responsibility. Jesus was taking the responsibility for saving the whole of mankind, and he has not been seen for two thousand years -- what a great savior! I am nobody's savior. I have saved myself, that's enough. Q: QUITE LUXURIOUSLY TOO. "},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"A: Quite luxuriously, because I don't belie ve in any ascetic ideas. My idea about asceticism is that it is a psychological si ckness, it is masochism. It is torturing yourself, and in a sick mind you can enjoy torturing yourself There are two kinds of torturers: the sa dist who tortures somebody else and enjoys, and the masochist who tortures hi mself and enjoys. Both kinds of people fit together very beautifully. The best couple in the world will be a sadist husband, a masochist wife, or vice versa. Both will be of great.... Q: A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN, RIGHT? A: Yes, a marriage made in heaven, be cause one will enjoy torturing the other and the other will enjoy being tortured. So that is perfect, the best marriage I can conceive. I am not a masochist, hence I enjoy everyth ing that life can give to me. And I am not a sadist, so I don't tell any of my pe ople to torture themselves in any way: enjoy to the fullest. And I don't give them any promises. Just see the difference: I don't give any prom ises for their future, after death, that they will be benefited, rewarded -- I do n't even talk about the future, I simply talk about this moment. I cannot believe how people can even think of me in reference to Reverend Jones and Jonestown. This is just the opposite place. Here we love, we live, we live to totality, and we try to squeeze every moment to the very last drop of its juice. I have never ordered them in anything. And as far as death is concerned, I am lif e-affirmative. I want death to disappear from the earth, and there is a possibility if the idiotic politicians don't go on wasting scientific genius in piling up nuclear weapons. There is a possibility, very commonly accepted by biologists, that a man can live for three hundred years very easily, and without any old age. In India I have seen people, in a sma ll part of Kashmir which is now under Pakistan -- they have invaded that part; it is a very small place, a few thousand people -- who live for 150 or 160 years. The oldest man in that community was 180 years old when I went there, an d he was working in the field! I asked him, \"How long have you worked?\" He said, \"I don't know how to count. People say that I have been working he re for at least 150 years. When I was thirty, my father died, and since then I have been working.\" And he was still young! There are hundreds of people in the So viet Union who have reached beyond 150; they also are middle Asian, from the other side of the Himalayas. Scientists think that three hundred years is very easily po ssible, and if more efforts are made, we can postpone death as long as possible. Unless a man wants to die -- because wh o would like to live for one thousand years? Perhaps....

Q: THEN WE'D HAVE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THIS PLANET. THE ENTIRE PLANET WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANGED. A: No, nothing. All that we have to ch ange is the way we have been producing children -- only that has to be changed, no thing else, because the father's cell and the mother's egg have the program for th e whole life. The meeting of those two decides the whole life of the person: how lo ng he will live, what kind of nose he will have, what color of hair, what color of skin, what kind of diseases he will have, when he will die. The whole program is in the first two genes. The only thing that bioengineering has to do is to change the program. And they ARE capable, they are saying they are capable of changing the whole program, that the child will not have any old age, that the child will live three hundred years, that he will not be vulnerable to a ll kinds of diseases, infections, that he will have the highest I.Q., intelligence possible. Q: WOULD THAT BE, IN YOUR MIND, A HEALTHY WORLD? A: It will be for the first time healthy. Up to now it has been just a sick and mad world. It will be really healthy when there are no diseases.... Q: WELL, WOULD YOU DO AWAY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CONSTRUCTING GENES AND THE DNA PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE, AND PROCREATION AND THE ENTIRE PICTURE -- WOULD YOU DO AWAY WITH EGOS, WOULD YOU DO AWAY WITH THE COMPETITIVE FACTOR? COULD YOU DO AWAY WITH ALL OF THE NEGATIVES LIKE JEALOUSY, LIKE GREED AND THINGS LIKE THAT? A: Yes. That can be done. Q: SO YOU'RE REALLY TALKIN G THEN ABOUT A GENEALOGICAL, BIONIC PERSON, CONSTRUCTED? A: Certainly. And that will be the dream of all those people who for centuries have been thinking of a superman. Q: DOES THE WORLD REALLY WANT A SUPERMAN? A: This world does not deserve it."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":" Q: BUT THIS IS WHERE IT HAS TO START, OR AT LEAST WHERE OUR LIFETIME IS CONCERNED. A: It needs it. Q: THIS IS NOT \"THE PRICE IS RIGHT\" AND YOU SUDDENLY OPEN THE CURTAIN AND THERE IS A SUPERM AN -- IT'S THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS, THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS.... A: Very simple. Within twenty years -- because one generation of twenty-year- old young people, supermen moving ar ound, not hippies -- you will see the difference. Within twenty years -- it is no t a question of a very long time. And when we can give the child the intelligence of an Einstein, we can give him the aesthetic sense of a van Gogh, we can give him a face as beautiful as Alexander the Great or Cleopatra, why should we go on living with this mediocre, biological, accidental world? And it is strange that whenever I mentio n it to people, they raise the question that it will be something inhuman, mechan ical, but about other things they don't bother. When you have cancer, then you don't say,\"It is natural. Leave it, don't do anything, because that operation is go ing to be mechanical, that operation is going to be technological, and this beautiful cancer in me is natural.\" When we are ready to take man-made medi cines for our diseases -- and diseases come from nature -- nobody bothers abou t it, everybody is willing for medicines, operations, surgeries.

A: We closed it not because we are shri nking; we closed it because we wanted our people to be here. Q: DIDN'T BUSINESS GET A LITTLE BAD? A: No, our business is increa sing so much in Europe that we have to send people from here to Europe. Q: DIDN'T YOU HAVE A BUSINESS THAT JUST WENT BANKRUPT SOMEWHERE? A: Nowhere!

THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID ; THAT'S WHAT I SAID. A: It will help, but it will kill that woman.... Laughter is good medicine, but you should take as much as you can absorb; ot herwise it can kill you, it can drive you mad. Life is a very mysterious phenomenon where laughter is part and where tears also are part. Once in a while to be sad, really sad, is not bad. Sadness has its own beauty. You have just to learn to enjoy the beauty of sadness, its silence, its depth. Life is everything all together, and we allo w our people to live in all dimensions. If somebody is crying and weeping, nobody is going to stop him here. Somebody may give him a hug and go on his way. That hug was not to stop his tears, but just a spontaneous response. We believe in life in its totality, in its days, in its nights, the sunny days and the cloudy days. We believe that everything in life can be enjoyed. You need just a little more awareness, more consciousne ss of what is happening. You are not your mind, you are not your body. There is a witness somewh ere inside you who can go on looking at the mind, at the em otions, at the physiological reactions. That witness is you. And that witness is capable of enjoying everything, once you get centered there. My whole method of meditation is to get centered at your witness, and then let life and its games go on. Enjoy, laugh, cry, but whatever you do, do it totally, with no shame, with no guilt. And, as you said, I am certainly a man who enjoys being controversial. I cannot conceive a man who has any guts not being controversial. The people who are not controversial are simply hypocrites -- just goody-goody, nice to everybody, just changing their masks the whol e day, to fit with everybody.

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT, BY COMPARISON, TO CREATE ENEMIES? A: Because if you can create an enemy, yo u have created a potential friend. I will tell you one old Hassidic story. Hassids are not traditional Jews. Jews do n't accept Hassids as religious for the same reason that nobody will accept my people as religious: the Hassids sing and dance and enjoy and eat and drink. This Hassid sent one of his disciples to the chief rabbi of Jerusalem to present him the first copy of his book that had ju st been published. And he said to the disciple, \"When you give it to him, remember, give it to him, not to anybody else. You have to be very alert and watch what he says, remember exactly every word; what he does, remember exactly his acts.\" The disciple went. The chief rabbi was sitti ng in his garden -- it was a beautiful evening, the sun was just setting -- and the wife of the rabbi was also sitting there. He presented the book of his Mast er and said, \"It is my Master's book's first edition and this is the first book th at has come off the press. Out of great gratitude he sends it to you.\" The chief rabbi said, \"That Hassid? He has some guts to send me his book.\" He took the book from his hand and threw it over the fence into the street. The wife said to him, \"This is not right. You could have thrown th at book when the disciple had gone, or you could have put it in the library where you have thousands of books. What harm coul d that book have done to you?\" The disciple came back and he said, \"That chief rabbi is just a rotten man! He is not even a gentleman. You send him a pres ent and he throws it with such hatred over the fence into the street. But his wi fe is certainly a woman worth respecting. She suggested to him,'You could have th rown it afterwards. Why hurt him? Or you could have just put it in your lib rary where there are thousands of books. What harm could that book have done to your library?' \" The Master said to the disciple, \"I am going to convert that rabbi one day, but his wife is beyond me.\" Q: WHAT KIND OF A MAN ARE YO U? NOT WHAT YOU BELIEVE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT -- WHAT YOUR THINKING IS. A: Just crazy, nothing. Q: JUST A CRAZY OLD MAN? SO MEHOW I FELT THAT YOU WOULD ANSWER SOMETHING LIKE THAT. A: It is a fact!

A: No. Q: WELL, IN THE INTERPRETATION OF CRAZY, TO SOME, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. A: No. Crazy simply means one who has gone out of his mind. Now, two types of people go out of their minds. One is the madman that you know ordinarily as crazy; another is the meditator. He also go es out of his mind, but going out of his mind he goes higher, to the witness. The madman going out of the mind goes lower, to the mind. Both are crazy! I belong to the first category.

SINCE IT IS THE FIRST TIME ANY ITALIAN JOURNALIST HAS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU, WE WILL HAVE QUITE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ALL OF THEM FOR OUR READERS. THE FIRST QUESTION IS: YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT A PROPHET, YOU ARE NOT A MESSIAH, YOU ARE NOT A GOD, YOU ARE NOT A SAINT. SO WE WANT TO KNOW, WHO ARE YOU? ANSWER: Is it necessary for anyone to be a messiah, to be a prophet, to be a son of God? Cannot one just be a human being? I am simply a human being as everybody else is, with a very little diffe rence: I am awake and others are asleep. It may look like a great difference to the person who is asleep, but to the awakened there is no difference at all. Just a little shaking, shocking, and the asleep one will be awake and they both can laugh at the whole stupid game of Master and disciple, of messiah... of the savior and the saved. Except laughter there will be nothing, because they will kn ow that they are both exactly the same. And because these names -- prophet, messiah, incarnation of God -- have been used in the past to exploit people, to create bondage for their spirits, for their psyches, these names have divided people into different religions and the result was thousands of wars. Five thousand w ars in three thousand years... crusades in the name of God, people killing th ousands of other people, burning people alive in the name of God, and with the authority that they are the representative of the messiah or the prophet or the successor.

Power is desired by those who are incapa ble of love. Only the loveless become politicians, power hungry. They think that if they have power over people perhaps their desire for love will be fulf illed. It is never fulfilled. No politician dies contented. It is impossible -- he ha s gone wrong from the very beginning. The path of power leads farther away from yourself, and from love. The path of love brings you closer home to yourself I have immense love to give, inexhaustible love to give, but no power to order or command or tell somebody to be th is, be that. I don't give any ten commandments. Q: WHY HAVE YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE A GUEST HERE? DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE, TO TRAVEL? A: No. I have always been a guest wherev er I was, because I belong to the whole universe. So anywhere I am, that particul ar place is only a guest house. I am not planning to leave -- I never plan. I can leave any moment, I may not leave ever. Q: YOU SAID, \"I MUST CHOOSE, I PREFER TO BE ZORBA RATHER THAN BUDDHA.\" WHAT DOES IT MEAN? A: It means that Zorba is the foundation and Buddha is the palace. Buddha is the peak, but the foundation stones are laid by Zorba. It will be foolish to choose to be a Buddha without having the foundation stones. I am absolutely mathematical about it: Zo rba should be there and the stronger a Zorba is there, the better a Buddha is possible. So I can become Buddha any moment, Zorba is absolutely needed as the basic energy out of which the Buddha is going to be carved. Zorba is the marb le rock out of which the Buddha statue has to be carved. I choose the rock... and Buddha is easy. It is just a question of opening your eyes. I don't bother about Buddha; I am worried about people who are not Zorb as. How will they become Buddhas? They don't have the basic material out of which a Buddha is made. And this poverty has been given to people by our religious leaders. They have been told not to be materialists. They have been told to be celibate. They have been told to live in poverty. They have be en told that life is out of sin. All these things have destroyed their Zorbas. Othe rwise, every man is a born Zorba the Greek. And if everything goes according to me, every man will die as Zorba the Buddha. Between the Greek and the Buddha th ere is not much distance, but first you must be the Greek.

There is not a single thing that I possess. For thirty years I have been the poorest man in th e world. And on the judgment day, if there is a line you will find me in the front, ahead of Jesus Christ. But my people who love me are there. That is my possession, that makes me rich. Their love is more to me than power ov er the whole world. I would not like to become Alexander the Great. Out of their love, whatsoever they want to do, they do. If they want me to have Rolls Royces, they are free. If they want me to have diamond watches, they are free. They know my taste, and for that simple reason my people can manage to offer me everything that not even a king or queen is capable of having. The reason is very simple: whatever I te ach can be understood only by the very intelligent and creative people. So only the cream of intelligence comes close to me. I am against poverty and against the poor. I don't want any poverty, any poor people in the world.

Politicians would not like that there are no poor people in the world. If there are no poor people in the world, communism will lose all hold immediately. If there are no poor people in the world, it will not be easy for the capitalists to exploit anybody. In the capitalist countries, the capitalist wants there to be poor people because they can be purchased easily. In India you can purchase any vote for two rupees; that is the highest price for an y vote. Now what kind of democracy can exist where you can purchase a vote for two rupees?

Q: WE'VE BEEN HERE A FEW DAYS NOW AND THE COMMUNE LOOKS SO PEACEFUL AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY BEAUTIFUL. YOUR WORDS ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL, TOO. WHAT I AM ASKING MYSELF NOW IS, HOW COME THE PRESS AND THE OREGONIANS ARE SO UNUSUALLY AGGRESSIVE AGAINST YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE? A: Because I want them to be aggressive . They are simply following my wishes. If they are not aggressive, then there is not much hope. If they are aggressive, we can put them right. Their being aggressive is their first step towards friendship. They may not understand, but I understand it. For my whole life I have been creating enemies and turning enemies into friends. And in fact it is better this way, rather than vice-versa: you put all your energy into creating a friend and then he becomes your enemy. That is sheer wastage. The better thing is to put your whole energy into creating enemies, and then let them turn into your friends. And they are bound to turn, because what soever they are carrying is absurd. The moment they come to know the truth, they will become your friends. And it is a simple psychology: the deeper their hate, the deeper will be their love, in the same proportion. I do not believe in people like Dale Carnegie. I work just in the opposite way, and you can see my business is succeeding. And where is Dale Carnegie? And how many people has he turned into friends? I want the whole earth, the whole humani ty to be divided in two camps -- no more Russian, no more American -- either th ey hate me or they love me, but both ways they are connected with me, and I lo ve both of them. They are like the two wheels the bullock cart moves on; they are not aware that they are playing into my hands. Q: YOU SAID, \"I AM A SIMPLE MAN.\" BUT WHY DO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, SIMPLE MEN, FOLLOW A SIMPLE MAN? A: Because it is very difficult to find a simple man. Nobody is simple, everybody thinks himself extraordinary. He may not ha ve the guts to say it -- that's another matter -- but everybody, deep down, thinks himself to be the most superior, the most beautiful, the most intelligent pers on in the world. And if he is not succeeding, it is because the whole wo rld is hostile to him, everybody is preventing him. Otherwise, he would be on top of Everest.

Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF PE RSONAL STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE, ANY MESSAGE TO LEAVE? DO YOU HA VE ANY IDEA OF RAJNEESHISM AND RAJNEESHPURAM AFTER YOU? DO YOU HAVE ANY SUCCESSOR? A: No, because all the religions who ha ve followed those lines have turned poisonous, have turned into curses on humanity. I don't want to be a curse to humanity. I am a blessing and I want to remain a blessing. So nobody is going to succeed me. And my message for my people is that the moment I am gone, your religion is gone. Then whatever remains is just a co rpse. Don't start worshipping the corpse. I am a free man and I want every sannyasin to be a free man. My love is the only binding force between them; otherwise, ther e is no theology, no belief system, no agreement on anything. Only one thing is keeping them together ar ound the world, and that is their love for me. When I am not there, nothing can keep them together. There is no bridge. Each sannyasin is individually connected to me.

And there is no need to go on making a church, popes, successors... because they have done so much harm. I will not allow my people to do that. When I am gone, then you disperse. What is the point? my love was keeping you together, and I am no more there. It is good that I am no more, because now your last attachment is also dropped. I was the last attachment to be broken, now you are totally free. You were free from your family, from your nation, from your religion, but a small thin thread of love was binding you with me. Now I am no more there; I give you the last, the final taste of freedom. And then whatever happens, happens. I am not responsible for it. The people who will be coming after me will have the responsibility. And I never think about the future. I am so totally involved with the present...

I am not even a member of this commune. I live outside the City of Rajneeshpuram. And I am not a sannyasin, as you can see. It is the commune's responsi bility. I am very irresponsible. When I was leaving the university, one gi rl used to love me. But just the way girls are -- and particularly in India -- she was shy, and I am not the one to chase anybody. I do chasing sitting in my chair... I am just a lazy man. She loved me; and continuously she was sending messages to me. She wanted to get married to me. Then the day of departure came and we were leaving. We had passed our final examinations and then she could not contain it any more. She pulled me aside and told me, \"I have loved you for two years, but I had not the courage to say it. And you are a strange man... I made so many efforts and so many messages, and you just remained as if I am not here.\" I said, \"You do not know. It is just out of compassion that I have remained that way, because I am a very irresponsible man. I may marry you, and tomorrow morning I may forget all about you. I may give birth to children and then I will not bother at all what happens to you and your children.\" Just out of compassion, I kept out of it.

I was introduced to him by India's very old seniormost parliamentarian, who had been a member of parliament from 1916 up to 1976. He was known as the father of the Indian parliament. Jawaharlal used to stay at his palace -- his father was given the title of rajah, king, so his house had become the palace, and it was palatial. And Jawaharlal was a man of tremendous in telligence. He talked just for five to ten minutes with me and he said, \"You'd better join politics. You don't waste your time here and there, you have a gr eat future and I am with you and I will support you.\" I said, \"Thank you for your generosity, but I am not going to be in any position where I am responsible for anybody.\" Politics means responsibility, and if you are not responsible you have to become a hypocrite. That's what all the politicia ns have become. They talk about being responsible and nobody is responsible. Now, millions of tons of food in Europe have been thrown in the ocean, but they will not send it to Ethiopia. One hundred thousand dollars were needed to take it to the ocean, and they dumped it there -- fresh fruit, fresh food. But its presence was going to bring the prices down, and that they would not like. And who cares about Ethiopia? And why should anybody care? In speeches, everybody will talk about Et hiopia and responsibility, but the real face is totally different. The prime minist er of India, Rajiv Gandhi, is one of my friends. He is Jawaharlal's grandson. If I had accepted Jawaharlal's offer, perhaps I would have been in his place. He is selling wheat to other countries while half of India is starving and dying. And they go on talking about sympathy and compassion for the poor... but he needs nuclear weapons. For that he n eeds money, and India has only raw materials to sell. It has no technology, no high technology. The poor man works his whole life producing wheat and dies st arving while the wheat will be sold to purchase uranium to make nuclear weapons. I don't take anybody's responsibility. In this way I help whoever comes close to me to be responsible for himself. Peo ple who take others' responsibility are responsible for creating retarded, dependent slaves all around the world. If nobody had taken their responsibility, they would have taken the challenge of life and struggled for themselves. I have heard about a very super-rich wo man. She had come to a holiday resort, to the best hotel. Her boy, who looked perfectly young and healthy, was carried from the car on a stretcher. Even the hote l manager and others thought that there must be something wrong. The young man looked perfectly healthy, in the best of health. They said, \"What is wrong with this young man?

When there is no challenge intelligence goes out of function, it is not needed. It is strange. It should have been otherwise. The richer people should have given birth to better geniuses, better Einsteins, better painters, musicians, poets, but they have just given birth to buffalos. I don't take anybody's responsibility, because I love people and I have compassion enough not to take their resp onsibility on my shoulders. They have to take their own responsibility. Q: I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO OUR READERS WHO THE SANNYASINS ARE. IS THE SANNYASIN A SORT OF NEW MAN? YOU SAY THAT THE SANNYASINS ARE INNOCENT CHILDR EN. YOUR CRITICS SAY THAT THEY ARE YOUR SLAVES, SLAVES OF YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS WORK, LIFE, LOVE, SEX. MAY WE HAVE YO UR OPINION OF THE SANNYASINS? A: I don't care at all what the critics say. They all can go to hell -- the sooner the better. But I can tell you about my sannyasins. I don't have any dogma that they can follow. I have no philosophy that they can live. I don't have any catechism that they have to repeat and cram. Being with me, all that happens is a very delicate deprogramming, and once a person is deprogrammed I don't have any program for him. In fact, my sannyasins are simply losing what they have, and I am not going to replace it with with anything. They will lose Christianity, they will lose Hinduism, and I will not replace it with another program. I will leave them to themselves. They are not my slaves; neither am I their slave. Slavery is a very strange phenomenon, it is a double-edged sword. The master is dependent on the slaves as much as the slaves are dependent on the masters. I am nobody's slave, nobody is my slave, because I know that if you create a slave, you become a slave immediately. My sannyasins cannot even expect anything from me for the simple reason that I never expect anything from them. When I said that I am not celibate because I am not unnatural, a few sannyasins were shocked. They started writing letters to me, and I informed them that they cannot have any expectations about me. I can do anything I want. We don't have any contract that I will follow your expectations or you will follow mine. I have no contract of any kind. My sannyasins cannot expect what I am going to do tomorrow. I can do anything, and they also are absolutely free. They can do anything they want: they can be here, they can leave. It is their freedom."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Out of freedom they have become sannyas ins, out of freedom they can become non-sannyasins. There is no problem. It is not a church and it is not some contract which has always existed bet ween the leader and the follower, the Master and the disciple. But this delicate thing is rarely understood -- that they both become dependent on each other. I am reminded of a beautiful story about Diogenes. Greece has given a few beautiful people to the world, but none comparable to Diogenes. He is not much mentioned in the history of philosophies or ev en if he is mentioned, it is only in the footnotes -- for the simple reason that the man was so rebellious and such an outsider that the professors of philosoph y would find it difficult to explain the man and his behavior. He lived naked. Now, in India it is a tradition, there are many naked sannyasins. But in Greece, he was the only one in th e whole of history who lived naked. Just like Buddha in India, he used to carry a begging bowl to beg food or to drink water. One day he was thirsty. It was hot and he was rushing towards the river to fill his begging bowl with cool water. Just be fore he was going to dip his begging bowl, a dog came running in and started drinking. He stopped, for a moment he thought, and he said, \"This dog seems to be more independent than me. I have to depend on this begging bowl. If a dog can manage without a begging bowl, then Diogenes is going to manage it, too.\" He immediately threw the begging bowl into the river. Even in small things -- what to say about human beings -- when you make human beings your slave, you are entering into a mutual slavery, a mutual dependence. I have no contract with my people. I have not promised them that I should be this or that, so they can never question my behavior. I remain individual; and that's what I want them to remain, individual. Now, the persons who were shocked when I said I am not celibate had carried the idea for centuries that a religious pers on should be celibat e -- and particularly nobody has heard that an enlightened man had made love to any woman after his enlightenment. Naturally they were shocked. It is up to them. They can think that pe rhaps I am not enlightened. Perhaps it is time for them to leave this place. Perhaps they have come to a wrong person. But as far as I am concerned, I am going to be totally free, absolutely frank, no secrecy, no privacy. I know for certain that celibacy is unna tural unless you are impotent; and I don't think any impotent person has ever beco me enlightened. No, there is no mention of it. In fact, just the opposite is th e case. The people who became enlightened were really too much sexual, that's why I call them Zorbas; they were really too much sexual -- so much that finally they understood that there is nothing much in it. They experienced it through and th rough and found nothing in it. And that was the point from where they started searching for something else. That led them towards Buddhahood, enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"But once they had become enlightened -- they were fulfilling people's expectations because they wanted to be great enlightened Masters, prophets, messiahs -- they could go on fooling wi th women. Buddha would not even look at a woman. What cowardliness! Buddha would not allow any woman close to him, she had to remain eight feet away. Is this enlightenment? so afraid, so sh aky that even a woman coming close and you become afraid? This is repression, this is not enlightenment. I want to declare to the whole world th at unenlightened people can have only sexual relationships, which they call love . This is not right. They should stop calling it making love; they are simply making sex. Only an enlightened person can make love, because it is no more his need. He can be without it for years and not even for a single moment will he feel its need. But he can enjoy it as fun. I can play cards; it is not a need. I can drink once in a while; it does not disturb my enlightenment. I can make love. I don't see... but it can disturb people's idea of enlightenment. That is their business. My enlightenment is not made of such fragile matter. It cannot be disturbed by an ything. In fact, they have been asking whether enlightened people transcend sex, and I have sent the answer to them that the enlightened person finally transcends enlightenment, too. And I have transcended enlightenment, too. Now I am again the same old ordinary man I was before all this round trip jet journey. I am back home. I have passed through everything, all meditation, all enlightenment, and come back home, with new eyes, new clarity, new vision. It is almost like living continuously on LSD. Q: WHY ARE SO MANY WOMEN SANNYASINS? A: Because I am a man, and it is natural for women to be attracted to me. You can see my grey beard. This beautiful grey be ard is the work of the ladies. The whole credit goes to them; otherwise, I would be having a black beard by this time. But so many ladies... but I don't bother about the color of the beard -- the grey is so beautiful! Q: IT SEEMS THE WHOLE COMMUNE IS RUN BY WOMEN. IS THERE A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR STRATEGY TO THAT? A: Certainly there is a particular strategy. Man has dominated women for centuries and forced the idea on them th at they are the weaker sex, that they cannot do anything that man can do. They can do small homely things -- that is their world. I want to destroy that id ea completely. And you can see I have destroyed it. My communes are run by women, and they have proved far superior to men in every possible way. My sannyasins are doing better business than any man can do, finding better bargains than any man can find. I wanted it to be a solid"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"argument before the whole of humanity that women are not inferior, that if you give them a chance, they can even prove superior in many matters. At least they are going to prove equal. And this is a strange way: to keep half of humanity in a downtrodden state. How much is the loss? -- half of humanity me ans that women, if they were accepted equally, would have produced a Dostoevsky, a Turgenev, a Chekhov, a Gorky, a van Gogh, a Picasso, a Nijinsky. They may have proved a Buddha, a Jesus.... Half of humanity! -- it is a vast ocean to wh om you have denied all possibilities of creation, expression. And you have behaved with women as if th ey are cattle, not human beings. It is not going to be so in my commune. But I do not agree with the liberation movement of women, because that is going in a reactionary way, creating hate fo r men -- so much so that their basic approach is now that no woman should love any man, that they should all be lesbians. Here, women are running the whole commune, everything, but no man who is here has ever felt that he is inferior. In fact, for the first time he feels a respect for women. He can see the dignity of women. Every day I receive letters from my male sannyasins asking, \"What is happening? The commune sannyasins, the women, are becoming juicier and juicie r, more and more graceful, more and more beautiful. And they are working so hard!\" For the first time, they have been given the chance to show their mettle. It is not a loss to men: they have found a companion, equal to themselves, side by side with them. You were missing half of humanity .... And remember, because you have repressed that half, that half was trying to take revenge in every possible way. Of course, the woman has her own ways of taking revenge, and every man knows how the woman can take revenge. Every wo man has been taking it for centuries. She will be nagging the husband, she will be spying on the husband. She will make the husband just a henpecked person. All husbands are henpecked! I have neve r come across another category. Outside they may roar like lions, but that is no t to be believed. Just look through the keyhole in their houses -- the woman is ro aring and the husband is hiding like a rat behind this chair, behind that table. It is natural, because if you repress their energy, somehow they are going to revolt against it. Here, men also are feeling tremendously relieved because no woman is nagging them. Women's liberation is automatically me n's liberation. Women's slavery is automatically men's slavery. They go together. But this is only a transitory period.... On ce I have proved my point, all around the world in different countries and diffe rent communes -- even where I am not present -- women will be on the top, once the point is proved and people can see. Just four years ago, when we came here , we did not have a single dollar. My women sannyasins managed to purchase 126 square miles, an area three times"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"bigger than New York. In four years we have poured almost two hundred million dollars into creating this oasis, and all has been managed by women. They have proved their mettle -- and wi thout insulting men, without putting them down, without in any way taking revenge. And they are not lesbians. So it is, in fact, a tremendous revolution which is needed, which has been needed for centuries. And the sooner the wh ole world goes the way my communes function, the better, because I don't think women will be ready to use nuclear weapons in the third world war. Women won't want to kill; that is not part of their feminine psychology. They would lik e people to come closer, to be more loving. If the world is run by women -- and man ca n take his place more significantly in scientific research, in the service of life and creativity -- and the governments and all other functional things are run by women, we will have a tremendous balance. It will take a little time for women to produce Einstein and Picasso and Michelangelo. It will take a little time to bring a Mozart, a Leonardo da Vinci, because for thousands of years -- in fact, for the whole history -- they have been repressed, so it will need a little time . And once the repression changes into expression, it will be just like land which has been lying fallow for thousands of years gathering all kinds of fertilizers, rain water, and nobody cultivating it. When you cultivate it, it is going to give you a bumper crop. All other fields will look poor because they have been expl oited every year; they have lost their energy to produce more. The same is the situation of the human mind. The feminine mind has not been used, has not been allowed to function. If it is allowed, it may take a quantum leap. And it will be a blessing for all. An intelligent woman, respected as equal to men in the society, will not become a lesbian because it is unnatural, absolute ly unnatural. She will be heterosexual. And if all women turn to heterosexuality, we will be declaring war on homosexuality, too, because from where are they going to find men? They will chase the homosexuals to their deaths. Th ey are chasing them here. We have got a few homosexuals, and they go on writ ing letters of complaint to me: \"We are homosexuals and women are chasing us. We are not interested, but we do not want even to declare that we are homosexu al.\" I say, \"What can I do? Drop your homosexuality.\" We can make a better world together. Men and women should be really half- and-half of a whole. There are qualit ies which men have and women do not have; there are qualities which women have and men do not have. Both together, the human being will be richer in every possible way. Just think of a woman pilot dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I cannot conceive of it. If there had been a woman pilot, she would have refused to follow the order. She woul d have preferred to be shot dead, but she would not go to kill innocent peop le who have nothing to do with war."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"And anyway, the war was ending. German y was already on its knees, it was only a question of a week or two until Japan would surrender. There was no need of an atom bomb to create a hell for two beautiful cities. I don't think a woman could have done that. A woman would rather have said, \"You can court-martial me. You can shoot me. That seems to be easier than killing 100,000 people in one city, and 120,000 people in another city.\" But what did the man pilot do? He droppe d atom bombs on both the cities, came back to his base, had a good dinner, sm oked the best cigar, joked with his friends, and went to sleep with a woman. In the morning when the journalists reached him, they asked the man if it had been very difficult for him to sleep having caused 220,000 people's deaths. He said, \"No, I slept beautifully. I did my duty, and once the duty was fulfilled -- and it was a great duty to be fulfilled -- I was feeling so happy that I managed to do it that I went to sleep with a woman and had a beautiful sleep.\" Because it had been his orders, Presiden t Truman was asked early in the morning the next day, \"How was your night?\" He said, \"I felt immensely relieved. Now there is no question of the war being prolonged any more. Not only that, we have made a point to the whole world: Don't come in conflict with America, otherwise the result will be more Hirosh imas, more Nagasakis\" -- not a single word of sympathy for those innocent people. They were civilians, they were not in military camps. I have seen a picture that I cannot forget. One friend from Japan sent me a photograph of a small child, maybe eight or nine years old. His bag hanging on his shoulder, his books in the bag, he wa s going upstairs into the attic which was allotted to him as his place to study an d sleep. And just when he was on the middle of the staircase, the atom bomb fell on Hiroshima. The boy simply got burned and got stuck into the wall -- just a burned body with a burned bag, burned books. When I saw that picture, I could not believe that man can do this to man. If a woman was president of America, I don't think this could have happened. Man has been given enough chance; now let the woman come up, and man can pour his energies more into scientific fields . Meanwhile, women will pick things up. Yes, there is a certain basic strategy why my communes are run by women. But you can meet my male sannyasins. They are not in any way thought to be inferior. No woman is treating them as inferior in the way they have always treated women as inferior. Perhaps it is that the male ego functions in that way: unless it makes somebody feel inferior, it is not satisfied. The woman functions in a different way: unless she feels somebody needing her, desiring her, she feels frust rated. A man's need seems to be to dominate, and the woman's n eed seems to be to be needed. That is a far better need -- to be needed. And I am doing an experiment, I am not a philosopher. I hate philosophy because it is simply a wastage of ti me. My commune is my experiment, and"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"everything that I have envisioned has co me true in it. The same can happen all over the world. This is a prototype. Q: YOU HAVE ALSO SAID, \"WE AR E NOT MISSIONARIES.\" WHY? DON'T YOU WANT MORE SANNYASINS? A: We are not missionaries because we don't want anybody to be converted into sannyasins by us. We are available for anybody who wants to join us. He is welcome. We are receptive to anybody wi thout conditions, but we are not going after people like the Christian missionaries or the Witnesses of Jehovah, forcing their Bible on you, knocking on your d oors every morning. We are not going to knock on anybody's door. Yes, we will spread the message -- that's why I am talking with you. We will spread the message and if anybody wants to come with us and join our caravan, we are perfectly happy. But this is a very different approach from missionaries. It is not aggressive, it is receptive; it is not masculine, it is femi nine. That is the difference I make between these two psychologies. The male psychology is to go after the woman -- that is the missionary. The woman's psychology is to escape from the missionary, but remain receptive. She never escapes t oo much. She always remains within the boundary so you can catch hold of he r, but she lures by running away. By running away she becomes more beauti ful; by running away she becomes a dream girl a very homely girl can become a dream girl. I trust in the feminine psychology beca use these missionary types of people around the world are aggressive . They are in a kind of war; very subtle, but it is a war. They are in politics -- very subtle, bu t it is a politics of numbers. What has the pope got that he should be respecte d? I have seen his statements, which are not even his statements, his secretary goes on writing them. Even then, all those statements prove only a thick head. Noth ing of importance ever comes out of these popes. And the missionaries I have been in touc h with in India were of a very high caliber -- men like Stanley Jones -- but the whole effort is how to convert people into Christianity. What did Stanley Jone s do? He created a Christian ashram. To exploit Hindus, he used the word ashram . He managed his ashram just the way Hindus live in their ashrams: getting up early in the morning, going to the Ganges for the bath, then go ing to the church to pray. Every ritual of the Hindus was copied. The only difference was that Krishna was missing, and ther e was Christ. And that is not much of a difference becaus e there are scholars who say that Christ never existed, it is just another name for Krishna. I was looking at how Krishna can become Christ in Indian languages, and then I came across Bengali: in Bengali, Krishna is called Christo. Now that comes very close to Christ."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"There are scholars who think there has neve r been any Christ, it was just that the story of Krishna, changing through many forms, finally took this Aramaic transformation; and Christianity wa s born out.of a borrowed myth. I asked Stanley Jones, \"Can't you see your diplomacy? Whom do you want to deceive?\" He used to wear Hindu clothes. In his ashram, everybody used to wear Hindu clothes. Nobody could smoke th ere. No alcohol was allowed. But the whole point was somehow to attract Hi ndus there, and then convert them. This is aggression, violence. It is interfer ing into your inner being. It is far worse than cutting off your head. At least I cu t off your head without changing you. I respect you as you are and cut off your he ad. They don't cut your head, but they destroy your mind, they reprogram you. They replace Krishna with Christ, they put a cross in place of a flute -- which is an ugly replacement. The flute is life-affirming and the cross is death-oriented. No Jonestown could have ever happened under Hinduism, Buddh ism, Jainism. It is impossible. A Jonestown needed absolutely a Christ ian context. It needed a cross. And Reverend Jim Jones was doing exactl y the same foolishness that Jesus did. He was simply following step by step. Je sus had told his people that they would be coming with him into the kingdom of God. Of course, he would be going first to make arrangements for them. And for tw o thousand years he has been making arrangements -- and the idiots are still waiting. Jim Jones was more contemporary. He though t it better to take the whole lot, the whole congregation with him. Why should he go first and prepare the ground? -- and then Jesus has not been heard from for two thousand years. Perhaps people are not allowed to come back here; it seems to be better to take everybody with.... This could happen only in a Christian context. If women are leaders in politics, leaders in science, leaders in poetry, painting, they will bring a totally new perspective to everything. Women should be professors, educationists, they should be everywhere. They are half of the world -- they own half the world. And my experience here is that they are tremendously capable, reliable. You can trust them more because they connect with you not from the head, but from the heart. Q: YOU SAY YOU CAN'T COEXIST WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. DO YOU WANT A RED OREGON, A RED WORLD? AND ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT FOR THIS PURPOSE? A: We never plan anything, but we are always ready to fight for human rights. Whatever the consequence, we will fi ght for democracy. We will fight for freedom. We will fight for respect tow ards the individual. We will fight for America and will not allow Americans to destroy its beauty, its Constitution, its Declaration of Independence. We are on th e side of America, and the Oregonians are not. That is my basic standpoint."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"We have not committed a single crime, we have not done anything illegal. We have not done anything against the Cons titution, and the State of Oregon has done everything against the Constitution , against the law. Th ey have used the law in a way it has never been used agai nst anybody. They have taken advantage of the loopholes in the law. But my commune is not Reverend Jim Jones' uneducated black people. My commune has four hundred law experts. There is no other firm in the whole world which has four hundred law experts. We are going to fight to the very end. And remember, we are fighting for the values America stands for, and they are fighting against their own values, their own Constitution, their own law. They are fascists, and I don't think fascism can win. We are a small minority, but we are not threatened by them; they are a big majority, and they are threatened by us. You can see clearly what is the reason. The reason is that we are standing for their Constitution, and they are going against their own Constitution. In the courts they are getting defeated everywhere. In the lower courts perhaps they may succeed, because they belong to the state, they are under the pressure of the state; but as we move higher, our number of wins gets bigger. The moment we are in the federal co urts, we immediately win. And I am absolutely certain I myself am going to stand in the Supreme Court of America to save the Constitution of America agains t all those who want to prostitute it. Is it a Constitution or a prostitution? We are not threatened, we are re ally enjoying the whole game. Anything more? Q: THE LAST QUESTION! ONCE YOU SPOKE ABOUT A HOLOCAUST BETWEEN 1984 AND 1999. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? A: It means nothing. Eat more spaghetti! There will be no holocaust.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH PENNY ALLEN, FR EELANCE JOURNALIST, SISTERS, OREGON QUESTION:* I HAVE READ THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO MAKE ENLIGHTENMENT AVAILABLE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. NOW I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU'RE SAYI NG THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS NOT ALL ITS CRACKED UP TO BE, AN D THAT YOU WANT TO BE NORMAL. WHAT'S HAPPENING? ANSWER: Enlightenment is only the beginning; there is infinity to go for. Enlightenment is only a door, and then there is an unending existence, an unending evolution, expansion. The people who are unconscious, for them enlightenment is the goal; they are not aware of the fact that enlightenment is only a door. Once you have reached it, then a new kind of pilgrima ge starts. Up to this doo r, you were an entity. Beyond this door, you will not be an entity. You will be just pure consciousness without a body, without a mind; you will be just a fragrance which will go on spreading all over existence. And the fragrance is luminous. It is fu ll of awareness. It knows itself and it knows the whole existence aroun d it -- not as separate, but part, a kind of at-one- ment. It is the universe, and the universe is it; there is no division, no duality. Now the observer becomes the observed; the seer becomes the seen. He is both. It is difficult to explain to people who have not even thought about the door, whose lives go on like sleepwalkers, somn ambulists. They live, but at the very minimum level without any intensity, without any totality. And this calamity has happened because of a few vested interests. The priest, the politician, all those who have been in power. They never wanted man to be awake, because if humanity consists of aw akened individuals, there is not going to be any Christianity. There is not goin g to be any Hinduism. there is not going to be any American, and Russian, any Germ an. There is not going to be the white man and the black man; there is not goin g to be man the superior and woman the inferior. All these stupidities will disappear."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"For the awakened man, the whole existence is one. Not only this earth, but now he is joined with the stars, too. And in hi s vision the smallest blade of grass is as significant and important to existence as the biggest star millions of light years away. The priest does not want people to be awake because they can be exploited only when they are asleep. The politician do es not want people to be awake; otherwise, they will not be democrats, republicans, socialists and communists. They will be individuals intelligent and conscious enough to decide for themselves. They will not need partie s and religions and cults and all their struggles and squabbles. The vested interests have kept man almost drugged. I don't agree with Karl Marx on any other point, but on one point I absolutely agree with him -- religion is the opium of the people. On that poin t also I have my reservations. First, he was only aware of Wester n religions: Judaism -- he was a Jew; Christianity -- which is an offshoot of Juda ism; and a little bit of Islam -- that, too, is an offshoot of Judaism. He had no knowledge about the Eastern religions: Buddhism, Jainism, Tao, Zen. They were unknown dimensions to him. Secondly, he was not aware he could not be aware, of me and my people -- we were not yet there -- and a totally ne w quality of religion which I call religiousness. Not religion, but religiousness; no God, but godliness. I change every noun, every pronoun into a verb because existence is a verb, it is not a noun. It is continuously growing, flowing, expanding. Now physicists say that the stars you s ee in the night are continuously running farther away from the center. We don't know where the center is; we don't know where they are going, and the speed is immense -- 186,000 miles per second. With that speed, although the stars are going farther and farther away, this continuous growth needs not static things but growing things. That's why you will find so many cont radictions in me. I have never stopped anywhere. I have been going in absolute tu ne with existence, wherever it leads. And if it contradicts my yesterdays, it is perfectly okay. They are dead anyway. I am happy that I am in tune in the pr esent moment. I am happy that I know the secret of being in the presen t, because time has no other tense. It is always now. And once you know the secret of being in the now, you have known the greatest mystery of existence. But the people who are in power would like human beings to remain involved and occupied with very stupid things -- communism, socialism, this party, that party, Christianity, Hinduism. The pe ople are burdened with their own problems. They, too, are mostly created. For example, marriage is a problem created by the priests. It is unnatural, it has not happened naturally. Now the man is be ing nagged by the wife; the wife is being continuously put down by the man. Then there are children. And the Pope and Mother Teresa go on telling people that these children are sent by God, so don't use any birth control methods -- that's sin."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"So people have dozens of children, thou sands of worries. How to bring them up? How to educate them? We have made a wo rld for human beings so difficult, and on top of it there is hell. If you just slip a little bit, you fall into eternal hell. For small things. And there is paradise luring you with all those things every religion condemns here on earth. And the saints are enjoying all those things there. I have heard a story of a Zen Master. He was always teaching his disciples that celibacy is categorical. Without it, you cannot enter into nirvana, the kingdom of God. The poor disciples were trying hard to be celibate. It is really doing something unnatural, almost impossible. They were all feeling guilty. And then the Master died. His last words were, \"R emember celibacy is the foundation of religion.\" After a few days, one of the disciples di ed, and the moment he entered paradise he was so full of joy that now he would be meeting his Master. He had been with the Master for thirty, forty years. He saw the Master sitting by the bank of a beautiful river under the shadow of a very huge and ancient tree, with a beauti ful naked woman sitting in his lap. The disciple could not believe his eyes. Still just out of old habit, he fell in the Master's feet and asked, \"What is happening? What happened to celibacy?\" The Master said, \"You will always remain an idiot! This is the reward for all my celibacy. Now I can enjoy as many women as I want, and here no woman grows old, no woman perspires, no woman has menstrual periods. You cannot improve upon the women that are available here. Th eir very body is fragrant; they don't use French perfumes.\" But the poor discipl e was at a loss. It was such a shock. This is the situation of all the religions. All the things that th ey deny to people here, they will give a million times more as a reward in paradise. Naturally, the poor human being is pulled. To be, or not to be? To enjoy a woman here or to wait just a few years more and enjoy as many women as you want for eternity. No marriage happens in heaven; all marri ages happen in the churches. And they say that marriage is made in heaven, but in heaven there are no couples, only individuals. The poor man is pulled apart. His fear of hell represses him; his greed for heaven represses him. With so many problems of day to day living he has no time to think of enlightenment. He has no time to think that there is anything more than this miserable world. And this is a created situation, because only in such a situation can you keep them enslaved. You can send them to Vi etnam to kill innocent people without any hate. You can send your pilots to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki within seconds without any feeling. You have tu rned people into robots. Millions of people around the earth are in the armies, just functioning like robots. And those who are not in the armies are also imprison ed in some kind of social, political, religious ideology. It is so difficult to fi nd an individual who is clean, completely clean."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"And that's my whole effort: to create a complete clean human being, unburdened of the past, unburdened of any guilt. un burdened of fear and greed, unburdened of politicians and priests. Just clean, so clean that he becomes a mirror. And in that mirror, you see for the first time wh ere the door is. In that mirror, the door reflects. Just as our eyes are mirrors in which thin gs reflect -- we find where the table is and where the chair is because our two eyes are mirroring things around us -- when a man is completely clean, silent , serene, his inner being becomes a mirror and the inward door that was always there is reflected in it. And the magnetism of the door is such that once one has seen it, there is no way to escape from it. You start moving toward that door the way a moth moves toward a flame knowing perfectly that coming closer to th e flame he is going to be burned, he is going to die. But some strange att raction, the moth is ready to die. The same is the situation when you see the door of enlightenment for the first time. You become the moth and the door becomes the flame. You know you are going to die; but at the same time you kn ow that you are going to be reborn on the other side. This is resurrection. Q:* IF I COULD ASK YOU A QUESTI ON ABOUT YOUR PAST.... WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THAT DOOR, YO U SPENT A YEAR WHEN YOU WERE MAD -- IN WHICH YOU COULDN'T FORMULATE A SENTENCE -- AND YOU LOST YOUR PERSPECTIVE. IS THIS CORRECT? IS THAT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THAT DOOR? A:* I have been looking for that door as long as I remember, from my very childhood. I must have carried that idea from my past life because I don't remember a single day in my childhood in this life that I was not looking for it. And as far as my craziness is concerne d, naturally I was thought crazy by everybody. I never played with any ch ildren. I never could find any way to communicate with the children of my own age. To me, they looked stupid, doing all kinds of idiotic things. I never join ed any football team, volleyball team, hockey team; of course, they all thought me crazy. And as far as I was concerned, as I grew I started looking at the whole world as crazy. In the last year -- when I was twenty-one -- it was a time of nervous breakdown and breakthrough. Naturally, those who loved me, my family, my friends, my professors, could understand a little bit wh at was going on in me -- why I was so different from other children, why I would go on sitting for hours with closed eyes, why I sat by the bank of the river and went on looking at the sky for hours, sometimes for the whole night. Naturally the people who could not understand such things -- and I did not expect them to understand -- thought me mad. In my own home, I had become almost ab sent. I would be there in the room and my mother would be asking me, \"If you see someone in the house, just tell me,"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"because I don't see anybody here and I have to send somebody to fetch some fruits or some vegetable from the market .\" The market was not far away, just two minutes walk; but I was not considered to be anybody. They had accepted the fact that I was good for nothing. And they were right. In th e morning they would send me to purchase something which was needed immediately and I woul d return in the night. And then I would say, \"I think you had sent me for something, but I completely forgot about it. If you remind me, I can run again.\" And they said, \"Please, excuse us that we sent you. Now if you go again, then the whole night nobody knows when you will turn up.\" By and by they stopped asking me anything, and slowly, slowly they started feeling as if I were not there. And I love d it, the way I had become a nothingness, a nobody, an absence. That one year was tremendous. I was surro unded with nothingness, emptiness. I had lost all contact with the world. If th ey reminded me to take a bath, I would go on taking the bath for hours. Then they had to knock on the door, \"Now come out of the bathroom. You have taken enou gh bath for one month. Just come out.\" If they reminded me to eat, I ate; otherwise, days would pass and I would not eat. Not that I was fasting, I had no idea about eating or fasting. My whole concern was to go deeper and deeper into myself, and the door was so magnetic, the pull was so immense -- like what physicists now call black holes. They say there are black holes in existence. If a star comes by chance to a black hole, it is pulled into the black hole. There is no way to resist that pull, and to go into the black hole is to go into destru ction. We don't know what happens on the other side. My idea, for which some physic ist has to find evidence, is that the black hole on this side is a white hole on the other side. The hole cannot be just one side; it is a tunnel. I have experienced it in myself. Perhaps on a bigger scale the same happens in the universe. The star dies; as far as we can see, it disappears. But every moment new stars are being born. From where? Where is their womb? It is simple arithmetic that the black ho le was just a womb -- the old disappeared into it, and the new is born. This I have experienced in myself -- I am not a physicist. That one year of tremendous pull made me farther and farther away from people; so much so, that I would not recognize my own mother. I might not recognize my own father. So far that there were times I forgot my own name. I tried hard, but there was no way to find what my name used to be. Naturally, for everybody that one year I was mad; but, to me, that madness became meditation and the ultimate of that madness opened the door. I passed through it. I am now beyond enlightenment -- on the other side of the door. Q:* EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, DO YOU ST ILL HAVE BLACK MOMENTS? FOR"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"EXAMPLE, THIS SPRING WHEN YOU STOPPED GIVING DISCOURSES FOR TWO MONTHS, WHERE WERE YOU? WERE YOU IN THE BLACK HOLE? A:* No. I have passed the black hole. No w I am always in the white house. Presidents will come and go, but I am going to remain in the white house all the time. Q:* IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU WERE SILENT FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AROUND APRIL AND MAY OF THIS YEAR? A:* Yes. I was sick at that time. I was not feeling fell, so I simply rested. But I was not in silence. Q:* IT WASN'T A LOSS OF PERSPECT IVE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? A:* No, nothing. That cannot happen now. That is an impossibility. Q:* YOU HAVE SAID THAT HERE ON THE RANCH, IN THE BUDDHAFIELD, YOUR SANNYASINS EXPERIENCE AND SHARE MOODS; THAT JOY IS CONTAGIOUS. DOES A BAD MOOD EVER PASS THROUGH THE COMMUNE? A:* Just wait a minute. First let me finish your last question; otherwise you will be in a difficulty to figure it out. For three and a half years I was silent to sort out those people who were hanging around my words, who were enchanted by my words, who loved my voice, who loved the way I speak, I argue. But that is not my basic function. I speak to help you to be silent. I say something so that you can go beyond words. I use words to help you to go into wordle ssness. It is just like having a thorn in the foot, with another thorn you pull it out. Your mind is full of birds, so many and so much chattering, yakketty-yak , yakketty-yak. It goes on and on. But then, people became intoxicated with my words. That was not my purpose. I continuously insisted, \"Don 't be concerned with my words; be concerned with my silences, the gaps between the words, the gaps between the lines.\" Three years I remained silent. Those fe w remained hanging around for a few months. Some managed to hang around for one or two years. Three years was too much; by and by they all left me thin king that I was going to remain silent forever. The day I saw that all those peop le who were interested in my words but not in silence had left, it was time to speak. And this speaking is totally different fr om the speaking that was there three and a half years ago. I was speaking to peop le who were listening through the head. I was arguing, I was rationalizing, I was doing everything to convince their heads. Now there is no need of that. I have go t people with whom I can talk heart to"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"heart. My words don't pass their heads. Th ere is no scrutiny in their heads when they hear my words. My words simply penetrate directly into their hearts. Albert Einstein has proved according to non-Euclidean geometry that there are no straight lines in existence. He is righ t as far as objective lines are concerned. Every line is a curve -- of a very big circle, so you cannot see it as a curve -- if you go on drawing the line on both ends, on e day you will find that you have made a circle. In existence there are no straight lines. If we draw a straight line here on the floor, it looks absolutely straight, but it cannot be because the earth is round. This small straight line is just a piece of a vast round which goes around the earth. Einstein is dead; otherwise I would have said to him that I know there are lines which go straight, too. But those lines are not of geometry, they are lines of love. I experience it every day. My being and my sannyasins' beings are joined not by curved lines but by straight lines. Now it is a totally different affair. I can say whatsoever I want to say. Three and a ha lf years ago I had to say things which people wanted to hear. I had to drop a f ew things because they would not be able to digest them. I had to impose interp retations on Jesus on Krishna, on Buddha for the simple reason that if I impose th at interpretation on Jesus, I can have a certain communication with the Ch ristian. We can come close. Now I have my own people so I don't take the trouble to interpret Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Lao Tzu. On the contrary, all the things that I left unsaid before my silence began I am saying now. And the interpretations that I had managed through Jesus's mouth I am taking back and putting Jesus in his own place. So my work has really started now. Before the silent period, I was just preparing the ground and finding the people who will be able to remain with me in every climate, in every season, in every change. I am not a thinker who remains consistent. Because I am an existential ma n who moves with existence, only those who don't bother about what I said yest erday can move with me. If today I am contradicting it, they don't worry about it. One thing is to be understood very cl early: to my sannyasins whatever I am saying is not important; what is importan t is that I am saying it. Whatever is being said has no significance; but in saying it on my part and hearing it on their part, something else side by side with the words has transferred. Those words were just vehicles creating a way for something which cannot be said, cannot be reduced to language at a ll. that's why they are never concerned about contradictions. I am not creating a philosophy or a theology. It is a religious field of experience. Now, you were asking something.... You can ask. Q:* I ASKED ABOUT THE ENERGY FI ELD HERE; AND I WAS WONDERING IF IT EVER HAPPENED, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU WERE NOT FEELING"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"WELL, THAT A MELANCHOLY CAUGHT ON? OR, IS THE ENERGY HERE ALWAYS POSITIVE? A:* It is always positive. My sickness is a physical thing; the energy has nothing to do with my body. The energy is never sick. It is never negative. I mean the energy of an enlightened pers on is never negative. the energy of an unenlightened person is always negati ve. The unenlightened knows nothing of positive energy. He only reads books on positive thinking and this and that. Idiots like Norman Vincent Peale go on writing books on positive thinking, and millions of people read those books thinki ng that perhaps by positive thinking they can become millionaires, by positi ve thinking they can produce palaces. And they don't bother about how many palaces Norman Vincent Peale has created. They don't bother at all that Ro ckefeller has never read Peale, that Henry Ford has no idea of Peale. It is not a question of positive thinking . Positive thinking is appealing only to negative people, because they know thei r negativity continuously. But without enlightenment, you cannot have positive energy. So I saw throw away all those books on positive thinking. They are delu ding you. They are giving you a sense as if without being enlightened you ca n be positive. That is impossible. Positivity is beyond the door of enlighten ment. Negativity is on this side. The night is on this side -- the black hole -- and the day is on the other side where the sun never sets. So as far as I am concerned, I am always overflowing with energy. My body can be sick -- but that makes no difference to my innermost being; it remains exactly the same. and whether I am speaking or sile nt, my field is vibrating, is ready to welcome anybody who comes with an open heart, is ready to receive into the innermost center of the energy field one who is not resistant, not reluctant, but is ready, vulnerable, open, is willing to risk. There is a field already existing. And the moment you enter Rajneeshpuram, you will feel a different air, a different milieu, a different silence, a different loving energy all over the place. But those who co me with closed eyes and closed heart, those who come with prejudices already determined with their conclusions -- naturally, they come, they go, and th ey remain untouched by the immense energy that was available, free. I have been known around the world as the free sex guru. Now they should change it because things have gone far beyond sex. Sex is energy, the energy of the sleepy man. The moment a man become s enlightened, the same energy turns into a positive field. Now they should start calling me the free energy guru, because I have traveled miles, and the go on calling me something which I have left far behind. Even if I die and my people can remain rejoicing, loving, the energy field will remain. I cannot take it away with me. But if they start being ordinary again, jealous, full of hate, hostility, violence, then they will destroy the energy field."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"I have created the energy field; now it is existing almost independent of me. And my whole effort is that while I am alive I should detach myself completely from the energy field and see whether my people can manage it. And that's what I am doing every day. I am giving more and more responsibility to my people. I am sending people fr om one commune to another. If twenty people are ready here, I send them to Ge rmany. If in Japan they need, I send people there. So twenty people go to Germany and from that commune twenty people come here. So in both ways it is a great exchange program. My twenty people there will try to create the energy field, and those twenty people here will learn how energy fields are created and how one should preserve them. Soon I want a belt of energy around the e arth. And as far as I am concerned that energy belt is the only hope for life to exist beyond this century. Otherwise the politicians have already arranged for global death. Q:* HOW CAN THE ENERGY FIELD, THE GESTALT, OF THIS PLACE CONTINUE WITH NO CHILDREN BEING BORN? I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR VIEWS ON TH AT SUBJECT AND I AGREE WITH THEM. I JUST WONDER HOW WILL YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? HOW CAN IT CONTINUE AND EVERYONE JUST GETS OLDER AND THERE ARE NO YOUNG PEOPLE COMING UP? A:* They will be coming. I am telling my people not to produce children. Enough young people are all around the world. why bother creating children and waste your energy in growing them up? I need all that energy for my energy field. So right now I cannot spend any amount of energy in giving birth to children and rearing them. And what is the use when all over the world there are millions of young people frustrated with the whole society, searching for a new way of life? It is so easy. When you can get ready-made young peop le, it is simply uneconomical to produce children. And we are going to get hold of the whole youth because there is no competitor around. The young man has fallen away from the old generation and the old people are trying hard to bridge the gap. Their priests are learning psychology, doing research work, getting Ph.D.s in psycholo gy, in psychiatry and philosophy to figure out somehow what has happened, why this generation gap goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger. But they are not going to be able to bridge it for the simple reason that they are still trying to bridge it so that they can keep the young people in the old fold. The young people need a milieu of freedom, lo ve, responsibility, joy. They are not concerned with your God, whether he exis ts or not. They are not interested in your heaven and hell. The whole old mind is so out of date that just by changing words and paraphrasing old things into new langua ge, they are not going to manage to"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"fulfill the needs of the young people. In fa ct they are the cause of creating this whole frustration, anxiety, anguish in young people all around the world. I am the alternative. I will tell my people to prod uce children only when we cannot get any from the ready-made market . And I don't think that is going to happen. The ready-made market is so big, and people are continuously bringing new children into the world, not knowing that they are bringing people for me. They would stop if they knew that Po pe the Polack and Mother Teresa-type people are all working for me by preven ting people from using birth control methods, the pill, by teaching people that abortion is a sin. They don't know -- unknowingly, they are my agents. They are working; and, for centuries, you need not worry, new people will be coming in. And when we have enough energy field th at the whole earth is surrounded by a certain belt of energy, then I can tell to my people: it is time. You produce. Certainly your children will be far better. They will come out of your meditativeness, out of your love. They will not be accidental. But not now. The way I have got all these people from ready-made shops -- I am going to continue my business the same way. Q:* I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE COMMUNITY IN OREGON TH INKS ABOUT YOU; THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT YOU, YOU DON'T WO RRY ABOUT THEM. BUT I WANTED TO ASK SOMETHING ABOUT THE PO LARIZATION THAT HAS GONE ON FOR FOUR YEARS OR SO IN OR EGON. I FINALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE POLARIZATION WAS A KIND OF PUBLIC DYNAMIC MEDITATION THAT YOU WE RE CARRYING ON TO TRY AND INCREASE TENSION FOR A LONG TIME SO THAT AFTER A WHILE IT WOULD RELAX. YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD, \"YES.\" A:* I will go on finding new ways to create more and more madness in the Oregonians because that is one of my ways of working. That's what I have been doing in India, and I am going to do it in America. Wherever I am, my way of finding friends is to create enemies. Then a clear-cut polarization happens. If there are no enemies outside, your frie nds become lousy, lazy, dull, dead. A certain hostility around is absolutely necessary for you to be alert, to be stronger, to be together. This happens naturally. I ca n create any kind of opposition. If one dies, another; there is no trouble in it . And since we are not troubled and we are always the beneficiaries of it, why should we stop it? That's why I refused point blank the question of a journalist who asked if there were any possibility of coexistence. I said , \"Never. Either we or they.\" It is a question of either/or. It is not politi cs in which nations coexist. Jews and Christians coexist with all their host ility repressed. They are not friends. Now the Pope is trying to make some arrangements with the Jews, trying to forget all those two thousand years of ho stility. But neither can Christians forget"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"that Jesus was crucified, nor can Jews forget what has been done to them continuously for two thousand years. This is a political way: You keep your hostility repressed and I keep my hostil ity repressed, because somehow we are here; we have to be here, so we coexist. I don't like that word at all. I have my own word. I call it parallel existence: We will exist the way we want to exist; you ex ist the way you want to exist. There is no question of coexistence, it is paralle l existence -- two lines running parallel, meeting never. The only way is that you convince us th at you are more joyful, more dancing, more blissful. I am not concerned about th eories -- that you convince us about God; I am concerned about people. You ha ve to prove that you are more joyful than we are, you are more blissful than we are, you are more peaceful than we are. Then certainly we will mix with you. What is the need to remain separate? Or, sooner or later you have to recognize -- ion fact, even in their hostility people have recognized it reluctantly -- that these people are certainly happy, far happier than they have ever been. Their theology has not helped. It has help ed them to become more miserable. Their Jesus Christ has not come to save them. Their politics and their politicians have failed them. Their leaders are just professional liars. They have to see that there is a sma ll oasis amongst them where no politics exists, no competition exists, no jealousy exists; where the people are working so hard for twelve and fourteen hours a da y, seven days a week with no holiday. Since I don't believe in God, I don't believe that on Sunday he stopped working, so I cannot give any holiday. People are working fourteen hours a day and looking so happy and so radiant and so joyful and so dancing -- how long can they ignore that fact? It is something existential, not theoretical. It is not like Protes tant Martin Luther arguing with the Catholic Pope. It is no t Hindus arguing agai nst Buddhists. It is a totally different kind of argument. We are not saying anything -- we are showing them something; and sooner or late r they will have to see it. They will have to hear our laughter, they will have to see this desert becoming again green, bringing flowers. For fifty years it has been a dead land. They will see birds coming again, animals coming. I don't think that they are more stupid th an the animals. You go in the night in the commune and you will find deer standing on the road not caring at all about you. They know my sannyasins -- nobody is going to hurt them. People have to get out of their cars to push them away. In my own garden I have one hundred peacocks. They don't allow even me in the house. They are blocking my way all ov er the place; not only blocking, if they are somewhere else, they rush toward the c ar just to stand in front. I enjoy. That means they have understood that nobody is going to harm th em, and they love the play. I will move the car slowly, they will go on moving backwards slowly, but they will not go out of the way."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"I don't think Oregonians are more stupid than the peacocks and the deer and the swans that we have. Nobody is wo rried here, not even animals. When I came to this place the junipers were small, dying, almost dead. Now they are lush green, have become thicker, bigger. Just four years more and you will see all these hills green and a ll this valley full of laughter. Oregonians cannot resist the temptation to come here, to see the people, to understand the people. That's why I don't believe in coexistence. My denial was not understood by the journalist who had asked, because the moment I said, \"Never,\" she immediately left the mike. She should have asked what were my implications, what did I mean by never, why was I saying never. Perhaps she had come to hear that word, and once she got it, her prejudice was fulfilled and she immediately left. If she had asked my implications, she would have understood -- we coexist only with enemies. I would like to be one with the Oregonians , not coexist -- that word is ugly, but that woman was so prejudiced she could not stay a single moment. She did not give me a chance to explain what I meant. That's what I was going to do, but as I looked, she was gone. So I said it is better to let her go; that will create more hostility and it will do something good. In my life everything has been doing go od to me. I have never come across any situation which finally has not been a ble ssing. So I have learned to trust life and its ways. Q:* THERE'S SO MUCH MUSIC THAT HAS COME OUT OF THIS PLACE, A MUSIC OF AN ORIGINAL SORT. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL EVER BE A LITERATURE COMING OUT OF HERE? A:* Soon everything will be coming out from here. And everything that will come out from here will have a different fl avor to it. We have sculptors here, for example, but right now they are making houses, roads, and other things which are of more basic necessity. Once we are fi nished with the infrastructure of the commune, all our sculptors will be free, all our painters will be free, all our poets will be free, and you will see something of a totally new quality coming in every direction, every dimension. I have here around me the most intel ligent group you can find -- the most talented people who can do anything -- yo u just have to give them time, the opportunity, and they are ready to do anything. Do you see my watch? Piaget was asking half a million dollars for it. One of my sannyasins I sent to Switzerland to le arn how to make watches. Within two weeks he was back and since then he has made four or five watches and he has been teaching other sannyasins. The other sannyasin has made this watch. It is far better than the Piaget, far more accurate, and it is made of real stones -- not of diamonds. It is not fake: real, authentic stones."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"One of the idiots from Portland said on television that I was wearing a fake watch. He does not understand language -- these stones are not fake. These stones are as real as any diamonds. If he cannot make the distinction between diamonds and stones, that simply means he should accept his ignorance about jewelry. But he cannot make my watch fake! It has been made with so much love, that to me, these stones are far more precious th an any diamonds can be. I will not sell this watch for ten million dollars; no price will be accepted for the watch. It cannot be sold: love cannot be sold and purchased. Hearing the man calling the watch fake, I could see how people are blind. If I was saying that these are diamonds and later on you find they are not, then certainly it is a fake watch. But I am saying these are stones. And if you cannot understand any difference between stones and diamonds, it shows your state of knowledge or ignorance. To me it make s no difference. These stones are so beautiful, I don't see any reason why di amonds should be costlier than these stones. These stones have cost noth ing, and my sannyasin's work was a meditation for him. We have all kinds of people here. We ha ve made all the houses ourselves. We have made the big Gurdjieff Dam, and s oon we are going to double it because there is still space and we can go deeper into the mountains. We have made all our roads ... and sometime I can take you to my own road which my people have made especially for me. Perhaps I am th e only man in the whole world who has a road for himself. No traffic, no need to follow any rules of the road. I can go the British way or the American way or the Russian way, it makes no problem. The whole road is available. And my people who made the road had never made roads, but they learned it immediately. You need just a little intelli gence to learn anything. My people are doing all computer work. They have beco me so expert that now they are selling their expertise in the outside world. My people had never made any houses. Now they have become so expert that they are making houses for others in Germany, in Switzerland, in England. Cheaper, better, more comfortable, more contemporary. Novels will be coming. Dramas will be coming everything that man can do, we are going to do, and better. We just have to settle down. And we are settling down even against th e Oregon government, the Oregonians. Nothing makes any difference -- we are settling down, we are settled -- nobody can throw us out from here. Q:* WOULD YOU PERSONALLY LIKE TO EVER TRAVEL AGAIN? A:* No, because there is nothing outside. Here, yes -- I have been to the disco yesterday. I enjoyed it! "},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Q:* DID YOU DANCE? A:* Yes. Q:* I READ IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES FROM ONE OF YOUR INTERVIEWS THIS PAST WEEK THAT YOU SAID TH AT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO MAKE LOVE TO A WOMAN ANY MORE -- YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY FOR THOSE GYMNASTICS -- BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THE DISCO.... A:* I have energy for women also. I just wanted my men sannyasins not to be worried! Because if I am interested in an y women, then her boyfriend is finished. It is just to solace them. I have enough energy, there is no problem. So all my male sannyasins have been immensely happy. The women sannyasins look a little sad, but I find other ways to ma ke them happy. There is no problem. Q:* WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR GLASSES? A:* That was just because of these lights, my eyes were feeling teary. Continuous exposure for two hours in the morning or two and a half hours, two and a half hours in the evening, my eyes started feeling teary. That's why I used those glasses; I don't need them now that they have managed to put the lights a little farther away. I think they need still to ad just because I can feel the strain on the eyes a little. Otherwise, my eyes ... you just look at my eyes. People think they get hypnotized ... I don' t know. Journalists avoid looking into the eyes that perhaps they may get hypnot ized. And for me it is such a simple job that I don't need to exert too much energy -- just a little smile toward a woman is enough. I don't have to chase her and go through all the dramas and traumas. There is no need. In my whole life I have never met a single woman who was not ready the moment I looked into her eyes. Where sh e was going to find such a simple man who has not even asked her name, who has not asked her address? And on the next railway station, I get down and we sh all never meet again. The introduction has not happened, but I have made love to the woman. I am not British. They will not do anything without introduction. But to me everything is love. Talking to my people is making love to them. My words reaching into their hearts create orgasmic reactions in their being. Just coming and going, dancing with my people ... just for a second stopping to dance with someone, and that's enough. That woman is not going to sleep the whole night -- you can ask the woman -- she is going to dream continuously of the dance."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"I have already made love. To me love is nothing in particular to do with sex. there are a thousand and one ways of maki ng love. Sex is the lowest, the animal heritage. And I would like my people to ri se above biology. Only then will they be really free. Then you can find thousa nds of ways of making love. Just sitting silently together doing nothing, but full of love for each other, and there is a certain meeting which is happening between the two energies. So I am continuously making love to my people in every kind of possible way. Don't be worried about my energy. And don't be worried about my eyes. They are perfectly okay and I am a non-seriou s man, so I have the freedom to say anything that comes to my mind without ever bothering about the consequences. And my whole life's experience is such th at nothing has ever gone wrong. So I have become absolutely certain that noth ing ever goes wrong, you just have to trust existence. And whatever happens is right. You meet my people and you ask them ... everybody will say I have made love to them. Talking is a way of making love. Dancing is a way of making love. But these are higher qualities of love. Animals cannot understand it; you can go on playing the flute and the buffalo will go on chewing the grass. She will not even stop to look at what you are doing. Th e flute makes no sense to her. But to the lover, you play the flute and something immediately starts transmitting from your song and showering on your beloved. And my people are searching all possibilitie s, finding all possibilities of being in love. Sex is only one of them, and the ve ry lowest of the kind. In fact, everybody should have a film of himself making love and see it once in awhile. Then he will see what kind of gymnastics and wh at happens to the woman's face -- distortions, and you call it orgasm? She is having a fit. And the man is trying so hard, huffing, puffing. Everybody should have a film of his own lovemaking just to see it whenever the desire arises. Just see the film and that will be enough. That is the very lowest type of thing that is available to all animals. Man can manage to have many other dimensions, many other levels. An d the higher you reach towards enlightenment, new dimensions open up. For a man who has passed through the door to the other side, everything is love. My whole twenty-four hours, I am making lo ve to existence in different ways. If I am taking a shower, I enjoy it as much as making love to a woman. So what is the difference? I am contacting existence through water. It is not necessary that I should make the contact with existence through a feminine body. Eating, I am making love, because I ea t with such joy. And I don't see any difference. My joy is the same. So twenty -four hours I am in love. It does not matter what I am doing. That you can take as a criterion of the man who has gone beyond enlightenment: whatever he do es is love. Whatever he says is love. If he does nothing, that is love. If he remains silent, that is love. Now, should we start dancing?

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH KNBC-TV, LOS ANGELES, CA QUESTION:* HOW SHOULD I ADDRESS YOU? WHAT NAME DO YOU PREFER? ANSWER:* Whatever you like. Q:* CHOICES MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR ME. ALL RIGHT. A:* Choices are always difficult. Q:* DURING THE THREE YEARS OF YOUR SILENCE, WAS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL IN THE WORL D OCCURRING THAT ALARMS YOU? MORE SO THAN WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED PREVIOUSLY? A:* Two things: One is that nuclear weapo ns are coming to a point where either we have to stop producing them totally, or we have to be ready to evaporate from this planet. The second thing that has been of tremendous significance is the discovery of the disease AIDS. Now it seems humanity is between two ditches. Almost walking on a razor's edge. Either nuclear weapons will destroy it, or the disease AIDS will destroy it. The destruction is becoming more, more probable than it was before. It is easy to control the politicians, convince the politicians not to go forward, but how to convince the virus that creates AI DS, and how to convince the people to turn away from all the perversions th at religions have forced upon their sexuality? AIDS is the culmination of homosexuality, lesbianism and all kinds of perversions. But the source is religious insistence on celibacy, which is unnatural. If you force people to be celibate, and you force men and women to live separately in monasteries and nunneries, homosexuality is bound to happen. You cannot prevent it, because man's sexuality will ha ve to have to find some way out."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"And AIDS is the ultimate of that perver sion. They don't know that there is any possibility to find a cure for it. Almost all the experts are agreed that a person who has confirmed AIDS is going to die within two years. But within two years he can spread the di sease to thousands of people. By sexual contact, just by kissing somebody, and a few experts are even suspecting that it may be contracted by breathing. Then we are on wildfire, which can spread all over the earth without any limitation. It seems everything is against humanity. It is as if this planet is going to die. That's why I started speaking again. I felt that seeing the death of the planet just as an observer is irresponsibility. I have to respond to the situation, and I am spreading -- through my sannyasins, th rough mass media, in every possible way -- how we can destroy the idea of celib acy from religions, how we can convert homosexuals into heterosexuals, how we can convince the women's liberation movement that lesbianism is not liberation but sheer stupidity, and how we can create an atmosphere around the world that will force politicians to stop piling up more and more nuclear weapons. It is almost an impossible task, but no t absolutely impossible, and when the life of the whole planet is at risk, everything should be done to prevent it. Every intelligent man's door should be knocked on . It is time to take the challenge and come out. The artists, the painters, the scientists, the dancers, the musicians, all the creative people around the world should declare that any government that goes on piling up nuclear weapons is anti-people, anti-humanity. Q:* YOU SPEAK OF CHANGING HU MAN NATURE. NOW THAT THE VIRUS AIDS IS HERE, IT IS PRESENT, IT IS THERE. NOW THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE IN EXISTENCE. IS CHANGING HUMAN NATURE AKIN TO CLOSING THE BARN DOOR AFTER THE ANIMAL HAS ESCAPED, NOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS ALREADY HERE? A:* Changing human nature can make a lo t of difference, because AIDS is not a natural disease. Q:* HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? A:* Because all the medical experts are agreed that it is a by-product of homosexuality. No heterosexual couple who has remained together without sexual contacts with other people has come up with AIDS. Homosexuality -- if we can simply convince the popes and the imams and Ayatollah Khomeini and all these idiots to stop this idea of ce libacy -- allow your monks, your nuns to make love, and allow humanity freedom from the guilt of making love, don't make it a sin. At this moment every resource should be used to convert"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"perversions back to nature. Heterosexua lity is a natural phenomenon. And out of heterosexuality there is no possibility of AIDS. Secondly, the very fact that we have so many nuclear weapons that we can destroy the whole humanity 700 times is enough, if everybody comes to know about what the politicians are doing. Even the politicians are no more so enthusiastic about a nuclear war. They can also see that in this war nobody is going to be defeated and nobody is going to be victorious. This war is a global suicide, it is not war. Just a huge amou nt of nuclear weapons is enough to prevent it being used. So I am not without hope. I see every possibility that we can change the course where we are going unconsciously. There is no need for AIDS to be there, and there is no need for a nuclear war to be there. In fact, we can change the nuclear energy into creative sources. We can make this earth a beautiful garden without hunger, without poverty, without disease. It will be simply idiotic to use so much energy for destroying innocent people, and for destroying the only planet around here that is alive. Q:* ARE YOU GETTING USED TO THE TAPE CHANGES, THE INTERRUPTIONS? A:* I am accustomed to every kind of change. Q:* BHAGWAN, WE HEARD A LOT OF RUMORS DURING YOUR THREE YEARS OF SILENCE ABOUT YOU OWN HEALTH. HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW? A:* I am feeling better. Q:* THE BACK PROBLEMS, THE ALLERGIES, THEY ARE IMPROVING? A:* No, they are there, but these are not sicknesses which can ever be cured. You have to take care and avoid the situat ions in which they can occur. I am as allergic as I have ever been, but all th e possibilities of allergy are prevented. I don't come in contact with any perfume. I don't come in contact with crowds, perspiration, smells, dust. Then I am perf ectly okay, there is no problem. Those allergies are not diseases -- they are simply my heritage. Q:* ARE THEY FRUSTRATIONS, LIMITING YOUR...? A:* No, no frustration in it. In fact, it k eeps me absolutely clean. And it keeps me isolated, which I enjoy. Because to be sile nt and alone gives the greatest bliss that is possible in life."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"So I don't take allergies as a disadvantage -- it has proved a blessing in disguise. My back also has been a blessing in disguise. It is the same -- the problem is there. The best experts in India and fr om England confirmed that it is not something that will leave me. I will have to live with it. And, you will be surprised, because of my back, only Rolls Royce suits me. No other car, no other chair. So you can see the blessing in disguise: my back has brought Rolls Royces to me. Q:* SO THAT'S THE REASON! I'VE BEEN WONDERING! A:* Yes, that's the reason. Everybody has been wondering, but that is the reason. I keep people wondering about many things. Q:* HOW CAN A MAN WHO LIKES RO LLS ROYCES DISLIKE SPAGHETTI? A:* That is a long story! I used to have a very beautiful woman around me -- an Italian woman -- twenty years ago. I don't think she ever took a bath. She was simple against it, it seems. She smelled ... just disgusting! But she was a beautiful woman.... At that time I was not aware that I am a llergic. The day I became aware that I am allergic, I got rid of that woman. She was the first woman who brought spaghetti to me, and it smelled of her. That's why I am against spaghetti -- even the name of spaghetti reminds me of that woman, and I immediately start feeling that my attack of athsma is coming. Otherwise, I have nothing against spaghetti. Q:* LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A SUBJ ECT THAT MAY BE LESS PLEASANT THAN SPAGHETTI, OR MORE UNPLEASANT.... A:* No, nothing is more unpleasant.... Q:* WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR FOLLOWERS WHEN YOU PASS ON? A:* Who cares? What was happening to them when I was not here? The world goes on. When I was not here -- it is not a problem to me -- what was happening in the world was happening. I was not here, I was not responsible for it . When I am gone, to you I am gone; to me you are gone. So the curtain falls. Q:* WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU NOW TO BE HERE, TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES, TO REMAIN IN OREGON, TO HAVE THE ATTORNEYS FIGHTING THE BATTLES WITH IMMIGRATION? "},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"A:* I enjoy fighting. And because I have found the most backward people here in Oregon, I have chosen it. The fight is go ing to be long. The longer it goes, the longer it will keep me alive. The longer it goes, the stronger it will make my people. And we are on the right path. We are fighting for those values America stands for, and they are fighting against America. We are fighting for the Consti tution of America, and they are doing everything against the Constitution. So it has to be seen who wins. We may be a small minority, but I promise you that we are going to win in every case against the state of Oregon. And we are going to prove to these people th at it is not so easy to go against the only constitution in the world which ha s some democratic fragrance about it. Q:* DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE OF OREGON, OR DO THEY HAVE TO BE DEFEATED? A:* I don't want to persuade anybody. Either they defeat me, or I defeat them. No compromise. Truth knows no compromise. The lies always are ready to compromise. Naturally, because in compromise, truth will always be the loser and the lie will always be the gainer. The lie is zero, it has nothing to lose. Yes, the state government has been trying to compromise. The federal government has been sending their mediat ors to compromise. I am not going to compromise, and when the other party is trying to compromise, that shows where they are. They know that if they don't compromise, they are going to lose the whole thing. And why should I comp romise when I know that the whole thing is going to be mine? Q:* WHEN YOU USE PHRASES THAT ARE TAKEN BY THE PEOPLE OF OREGON AND OTHERS AS INFLAMM ATORY IN YOUR DISCOURSES.... YOU HAVE REFERRED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HELD VERY DEARLY BY PEOPLE HERE ... BY PHRASES SUCH AS \"POPE THE POLACK,\" \"CHRIST THE CRACKPOT,\" \"MOTHER TERESA, THE CRIMINAL.\" ARE THOSE PHRASES INTENDED TO BRING ENLIGHTENMENT TO PEOPLE, OR DO THEY INSTEAD FILL THE HEARTS OF TH OSE PEOPLE WITH SUCH HATRED THAT THEY CANNOT HEAR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? A:* It works in many ways. Those are my devices. First, I am talking to my own people. They are not hurt by what I am saying about Pope the Polack, Teresa the Terrible, Christ the Crackpot -- nobody is hurt. On the contrary, they start looking at things in a totally new way, the way I want them to look at them. I want outside people to get hurt, shocke d. I want them to be angry, hateful, because it is a very fundamental principle of psychology that if you can create hate in a man, it is very easy to change it into love. Love and hate are not so"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"different as people think, and certainl y they are not opposites. They are two polarities of one energy, just like darkness and light. So without going anywhere, just sitting in my room, I can manage to give shocks all around the world, shake people in thei r sleep, in their slumber. Because to me their Christianity is a kind of opium, an d their Hinduism is a kind of marijuana, and so on, so forth. These people need to be shaken really badly. And I will go on throwing ice-cold water on their eyes as long as they don't open their eyes and jump out of the bed. It is not a question of persuasion. You don't persuade a sleeping person to wake up, because between a person who is awake and a person who is asleep there is no possibility of communication. So whether they hear me or not, I want them to be hateful against me, that's enough -- I have done my job. All these people.... And there are almost one million sannyasin s around the world. Even in Soviet Russia, even in East Germany I have my sannyasins. Of course, they are underground sannyasins. From where are these people coming? First they were shocked, first they were hurt, but thei r shock and their hurt started a great question, a great quest in their minds. They became suspicious about their ow n conditioning: Perhaps Christ was a crackpot? Let us give it another thought. And Pope is certainly the Polack, there are not two opinions about it, and you cann ot find a thicker head than Pope the Polack's, because the world is sufferi ng from overpopulation, and he is preaching around the world against birt h control, against the pill, against abortion. This man -- if I call him a criminal, I am not condemning him, only describing him -- perhaps he is the greatest criminal alive. And the same is my attitude about the Hindu leader, shankarachary a, Mohammedan leaders like Ayatollah Khomeini -- I call him Khomeiniac -- because these are the people who are insisting on more and more population on the earth. Ethiopia is dying, India is dying, soon the third world will be dying of starvation. And who will be responsible for it? Mother Teresa will be responsible for it, Pope will be responsible for it. In the eyes of the future, these people will be as criminal as middle ages popes are crimin al in our eyes. They burned innocent old women, just calling them witches. So what? If somebody wants to be a witch -- the word is not bad, it just means a wise woman -- so whose business is it to prevent? In the middle ages, the same popes repres enting the same Jesus Christ, calling themselves infallible, burned thousands of women alive because they decided that they are in conspiracy with the devil. Now no intelligent person today can stand on their side in that matter. They themselves f eel ashamed. In fact, they burned Joan of Arc as a witch, but it was so much against people's love for that courageous young woman that finally af ter three hundred years, they changed their verdict."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"One infallible pope burns the woman a live, declares her a witch; another infallible pope declares Joan of Arc a sa int. From the grave the bones are pulled out and worshipped. Now these idiots -- you want me to be polite with them? And they are dragging the whole world towards poverty. They have a vested interest in poverty -- they have to be exposed. Mother Teresa want s more and more orph ans in the world; otherwise who is going to give her No bel prizes and all kinds of awards and titles? She is roaming around the world -- I don't know when she finds time for serving humanity -- receiving rewards, awards, titles, opening functions, conferences. I can't think when she serves humanity. All she is doing is collecting Hindu and Mohammedan or phans and converting them into Catholics. This is sheer politics of number, she is a cunning politician. It is not even right to call her a woman -- she has no heart. She is simp ly a puppet in the hands of the Vatican. Q:* IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT A CHILD DYING OF STARVATION AND NOT TO FEEL A TUG AT YOUR HEART, A DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD? A:* I will do something for the child: I w ill give him an injection and send him into eternal sleep. That is my compassion . To keep him alive for his whole life to starve again and again, fall sick, create more children who will be sick, who will be again orphans -- this is sheer stupidity. I am a simple man of mathematics. If Ethiopia is dying, my compassion says there is no point in sending food, becaus e these Ethiopians with that food will crate more Ethiopians. This is not a solution. Either give them so much that they can live at your standard of living -- but for that you will have to stop all your nucl ear weapons and all your war efforts and all the money that you go on pouring into them. Or, if you cannot do that -- and nobody is willing to do that -- these hypocrites go on calling themselves compassionate. What kind of compassion is this? [text missing here in change from tape one, side A to side B] ... a little butter to the Ethiopians. For four years they have b een dying, because for four years there has been no rain. And now every day thousands of people are dying. All over the world politicians feel compassionate. They send a little bit, but their gifts prove to be only sp oonfuls of sugar thrown into the ocean to make it sweet. No, I am not so gullible.

And there is no problem, because if the soul is eternal, as all th e religions say, then you have not done anything. Just the house was falling and you have moved the soul into a new house, a better house, a fresher house. But if all these religions are wrong and communists and materialists are right, then too, there is no problem. They say when the body dies, everything dies, there is no soul left -- no problem is ther e. So whether one believes in the soul or does not believe in the soul, it is better to let these poor people at least die peacefully. You could not help them to live peacefully, joyously, but you can at least send them to death peacefully , silently. That is my compassion. Q:* BHAGWAN, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OTHER MISFORTUNATE SOULS.... A:* You can ask about anything, becaus e I have no secrets to keep about anything, I have nothing private, I am absolutely open to all kinds of queries. And I am going to say exactly what everybody wants to say, but they don't have the guts to say it. And I don't care ab out any respectability -- I am already notorious enough. And I enjoy it. Q:* YOU ENJOY IT? HOW SO? A:* Yes, I enjoy it. To be respectable means bourgeois; to be notorious means rebellious. Every revolutionary will be notorious in his time, and every respectable person is nothing but in the service of the vested interests. Certainly, you don't give Nobel prizes to notoriou s people like me. You give Nobel prizes to Mother Teresa. She is respected becaus e she is serving your vested interests. I am notorious, but I enjoy it. I don't want to be respectable. To be respected this mad humanity is insulting.

You are saying, \"To save the integrity of the community there are guns and guards.\" That is absolutely wrong. Q:* WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THEM, THEN? "},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"A:* The reason for those guards is becaus e I have been attacked many times in my life: I have been poisoned; an attempt was made to kill me with a knife before then thousand sannyasins -- and twenty police officers, be cause they got the message that something was going to happen that morning, so they reached in time before the knife was thrown at me. The man was caught red-handed. Ten thousand witness, twenty police officers as witnesses -- and still the man was freed by the court with punishment. Now, if my people feel to protect me, I am not going to interfere, for the simple reason that I don't interfere. If somebody is going to assassinate me, I will say hi to him, too. I will not interfere. And if my people who love me want to protect me -- and what protection? In a nuclear world, do you think those guns me an anything? Except for their love for me, those guns are toy guns. What can they do? But I respect their love. I don't care abou t their guns. And those guns are not for the integrity of the community.

But if somebody tries to harm the commu nity, certainly, we will do everything to fight back. I believe in tit for tat. Q:* THE COMMUNE HERE DEFENDING ITSELF IF THERE SHOULD BE SOME ATTACK -- IS THAT IN CONCEP T ANY DIFFERENT FROM A NATION STOCKPILING NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM AN ATTACK? A:* No. Q:* I GATHER FROM YOUR CONDEMNATION, THEN, OF STOCKPILING NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH WHAT THE COMMUNE IS DOING. A:* No. I am not stockpiling nuclear weapons here, and I won't allow my commune to stockpile nuclear weapons. An d I don't want nations not to have armies, not to have other weapons. I am just against nuclear weapons. Other weapons are just a football match, and man is an animal -- once in a while there is an itch to fight. I am in favor of pre-first-world-war wea pons. Do your best -- those weapons were perfectly good. And the world was a far more pleasant place to live before the first world war, because the population was small, and your wars helped to keep the balance of population. You need wars. I am not a pacifist. I think if wars comple tely disappear, it will be a loss. It is perfectly good for this mad humanity once in a while to erupt into a war, destroy a few people, because they were su rplus, and keep the balance."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"I am against nuclear weapons because th at will destroy the whole humanity and then there will be no fourth world war. And that I don't like! I would love fourth world war, fifth world, war, and history goes on. But this third world war is dangerous -- it simply puts a full point on history. That's why I am against it. Otherwise, I am not against war. It is just children playing. Let them play -- there is no harm. So if my commune wants to collect pre-first-world-war weapons, I am for it! Q:* I DON'T THINK THEY HAD OUZI S IN WORLD WAR I, DID THEY? A:* They are not nuclear weapons. They are freely available in the market, anybody can purchase them. The govern ment does not think them serious weapons. Anybody who wants to purchase them in any numbers can purchase them. They are freely available. And if Oregonians have them, I will not prevent my people. If Oregonians have one, my people will have two, because in a game you should not lag behind. And what does it matter? People have to die anyway. And the strangest thing is that most of pe ople -- ninety-nine percent of people -- die on their beds. That is the most dang erous place! Ninety-nine percent. Only one percent manage to die in varieties of ways. So this is nothing wrong. Just if people want to fight, have a good fight -- enjoy it, celebrate it! Oregonians will be fighting with hostility and we will be fighting with songs and dances and celebration. Perhaps they will be able to kill us, but th ey cannot kill our spirit -- the spirit of ecstasy. And that will haunt them more . The ghost of Rajneeshpuram may haunt the whole of America!

Q:* BUT WHAT DO YOU DO AB OUT THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY? A:* They are foolish! They should learn to take me non-seriously, the way I take the whole world non-seriously. If they don't learn it, then they unnecessarily get terrified, go through nervous breakdowns. I am absolutely non-serious. What I"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"am saying to you, I may contradict tomo rrow -- or if you want, right now! I can do that, too. Just don't change the cassette in the middle! Q:* YOU AT TIMES HAVE SPOKEN WELL OF SOME OF THE THINGS JESUS SAID, SOME OF THE WORDS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO BUDDHA, TO MOHAMMED. AND I HAVE ALSO UN DERSTOOD YOU TO SAY THAT MUCH OF WHAT THEY DID THAT IS GOOD WAS LOST IN THE FORMALISM OF THEIR FOLLOWERS, WHAT THE FOLLOWERS TRIED TO ESTABLISH. I WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU SEE A PARALLEL HAPPENING IN THIS COMMUNE HERE -- THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS BEING LOST IN THE FORMALISM OF YOUR FOLLOWERS? A:* No. It is impossible. First I have to remind you that whatever I have said about Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed -- and that there is much good in them which has been lost by their followers -- is centuries old. You are quoting Old Testament, and I am now in the middle of the LAST TESTAMENT. Those statements belonged three and a half years ago, before I went into silence. And do you know why I went into silenc e for three and a half years? Because I got tired of telling beautiful things abou t Jesus, knowing perfectly well that he was a crackpot. Q:* WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT, THEN? A:* Because I wanted to catch hold of Christians, and I got them! I have my devices -- I may be a madman but I have my methodology. Q:* DO THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS? A:* Yes. Q:* DO YOU BELIEVE IN MACHIAV ELLI? IS THAT PART OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY? A:* Machiavelli can be my disciple, and he will enjoy learning a few more things that he has missed. I spoke on Jesus and I said he had said many beautiful things. And I interpreted him, but that interpre tation was mine. It has nothing to do with Jesus. I was simply trying to catch hold of a few Christians, but that I was doing with all the religions. It is natural, because all the people of the world are already divided. When I came into this world, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Christian, somebody is a Hindu -- no customer available! And I have to do my business, too. I have every right. So, how to get customers?"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"I had to plan devices. And the natural way was -- the simpler way -- that anything that is wrong in Jesus, throw it on his disciples. And anything that can be seen as good, can be polished, given a more contemporary ring, bring it above and give the credit to Jesus. Great Christians like Stanley Jones, who was a world-famous missionary, he told me, \"I am puzzled. No Christian down the centuries has even been able to give such beautiful meaning to the words of Jesu s.\" I said, \"The trouble is, I cannot tell you the truth.\" That poor fellow is dead now -- but to you I can tell the truth: What beauty can be in Jesus' word s? He was uneducated, uncultured, a carpenter's son. In his time it was sa id laughingly, \"Look at the Messiah.... Who has ever heard that prophets and messi ahs are born in Bethlehem?\" Bethlehem became a laughing stock because of Jesu s, and he was looked at like a buffoon. Riding on his donkey, proclaiming himsel f as the only begotten son of God.... Just see it, visualize it: a man sitting on a donkey looking like a perfect hippie, declaring he is the only begotten son of God, and telling you, \"Unless you follow me, there is no way to be saved. At the last judgment day, I will choose my sheep and they will enter into paradise. And th ose who are not chosen by me, will fall into eternal hell.\" And have you ever thought of the meaning of eternal hell? In a seventy-year life, how man sins can you commit to deserve eternal hell? Is there any fairness, justice in existence, or not? In seventy ye ars -- because Christia ns believe in only one life -- how many sins can you manage to commit to deserve eternal punishment? This is simply stupid. Beca use of this simple statement, Bertrand Russell went against Jesus and he wrote a book, WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN, because this is simply unfair, unjust, inhuman. And the man certainly is a mental case. Now I have got my people -- from a ll sources I have caught them, from Buddhists, from Hindus, from Christians, from Jews. From every land, from every country, from every race, I have caught hold of those who can now listen to me directly, and I don't need any Je sus, any Buddha, any Mohammed to stand between me and my disciples. So I am kicking them out. For three years I remained silent, just to give a gap so people forget all about what I said before those three years, an d I can start from the very beginning again. So don't quote anything from my books. Those days are dead -- those books are dead. Q:* DO YOU WEAR THAT WATCH EX CEPT DURING TV INTERVIEWS? A:* I have got hundreds of watches. And this is the least costly -- just $180,000. I have watches which are a half-million doll ars, or more. And I have hundreds -- but they don't belong to me, they belong to my sannyasins. This watch, too, is borrowed. Nothing belongs to me; everythi ng is provided for me. I am just a guest here in this commune. I am not even a sannyasin."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":" Q:* IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRE CTLY, THAT YOU SAW SPEAKING HIGHLY OF JESUS AS A STRATEGY TO APPEAL TO CHRISTIANS, TO GET YOUR WORD TO THEM, AS A TACTIC. DO YOU HAVE NEW TACTICS NOW? IS YOUR TALKING TO US THIS EVENING -- IS THIS PART OF A NEW TACTIC TO REACH PEOPLE? A:* Everything I do is a certain device. Talking to you, too. I am involved in some great alchemical work of transforming pe ople from their sleep into enlightened souls, and I have to try every kind of device possible. This, too, is part of it. Everything that I say or do is part -- organic part -- of my whole work. And my work is to bring to people awakening on as big a scale as possible, as it has never happened before. Q:* YOU USED THE FIGURE EARLIER, IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY, OF A MILLION SANNYASINS AROUND THE WORLD. WOULD THAT BE YOUR ESTIMATE? A:* Yes. Q:* I HAVE READ -- I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY ASCERTAINED THE ACCURACY OF THIS -- THAT A NUMBER OF YOUR MEDITATION CENTERS BOTH IN THE UNITED STAT ES AND IN EUROPE HAVE CLOSED, AND THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DRAWN FROM THAT IS THAT THE NUMBER OF SANNYASINS IS SHRINKING. A:* Their conclusion is wrong. We ha ve closed a few centers because those centers were too small, and the sannyas ins were finding it difficult to live amongst the hostility around them. So we ha ve consolidated a few centers into a big commune. So those centers have di sappeared, but a new commune has come into existence. The number has not decreased, the nu mber has increased because many who were afraid before to become sannyasins are no more afraid because they have five hundred sannyasins with them. Now their enemies are afraid. I am consolidating all over the world, an d the number is increasing every day. From a half-million it has reached to on e million, and these are above-ground sannyasins. The underground sannya sins are not included in it. In communist countries, in China, in Ru ssia, in other small communist countries I have my sannyasins, and they are spread ing fast there, too. In fact, they are more excited than sannyasins anywhere else. Naturally, human psychology is such that in Moscow they have to meet in a basement of a friend's house -- silently, afraid even the walls in Russia are detectives and belong to the KGB."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"There is great excitement in meditation, in reading my books, listening to my tapes. For sixty years in Russia, religion had almost disappeared except in a few places which the Russian government has been keeping up for tourist purposes. Only a few churches are there which are maintained for foreigners to visit and see that religion has not been disturbed. Everybody is free -- and you can see. But in fact all the churches have become either hospitals or schools, and the whole country has become atheistic. After sixty years, these people were born after the revolution. They have been brou ght up in an atheist atmosphere. They have been conditioned that there is noth ing in you -- you are only a component of physics, chemistry, biology, but there is no spirit in you. And for the first time they are becomi ng aware through me that they are consciousness. All these things are just their house, and they are not just a composite whole of all these things; they have an individuality, a consciousness. And the only way to discover it is meditation, and people are meditating. And the government is already starting to persecute them, trying to find out where they meet, what they do, where they go. They have started taking my books from them. My books are banned. These are good signs -- this means the youth will get more excited. It has be come a revolution, and that's what the young blood always needs -- some rebellion. I have one million people, and they will be growing every day for the simple reason that there is no other alternative. The old world is already dead -- or almost dead, which is worse! And for the new world there is no other movement except this movement. It is not a political movement. It does not belong to any nation. It does not belong to any race. It does not belong to the past. It is absolutely fresh -- just born, young. And you are asking: Can your followers do the same as happened with Jesus? In the first place, the followers have not destroyed Jesus, Jesus had everything ready. He had sown the seeds, the follo wers have only been reaping the crop. Jesus is responsible. I am not giving any theology to my disciples. I am not giving them any catechism. I am not giving them any be lief system. And my statements are so contradictory, that there is no possibility for anybody to figure out what kind of man this was. Nobody can bring any deformation, because I am not giving anything to the disciples -- no discipline, no dogma, no creed. What can they do? I am giving them freedom to do whatsoev er they want to do. I am giving their responsibility to themselves. I am not taki ng their responsibility on me. I am not their savior or prophet or messiah, no. Q:* YOU ARE THEIR MASTER. A:* I am master of myself! Q:* ARE YOU THEIR MASTER, AS WELL?"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":" A:* No. I am trying to help them to be ma sters of themselves. I am just a catalytic agent. I am master of myself, so I know how one becomes a master of oneself. I am simply sharing my experience with these people. They are not my followers, they are my fellow travelers. And they are absolutely free to do anything they want. No restrictions, no inhibitions, no repressions. What can they do? The moment I am go ne, they will also go on their way separately, because their connection with me is direct. They are not interconnected like Christians or Hindus or Mohammedans. They are connected to me directly. Each sannyasin has a di rect communication line with me. The moment I am gone, his last barrier is al so finished. Other barriers I had finished before -- now the last barrier, the love towards me, is also finished. He is now totally free. Utterly free -- to be himself. So there is no problem. The followers of Buddha or Confucius they all destroyed their Master's things because the Master himself has given all th e poison that was needed to destroy it. For example, Buddhas has given 33,000 rules of conduct. Even to remember them is impossible, the question of following them does not arise. And any man trying to follow 33,000 rules of conduct will soon be in an insane asylum. He will be in the same position as happened in Aesop's fable of the centipede. A centipede is just going for his morn ing walk. One hundred legs -- a small rabbit could not believe his eyes, how he managed to walk. One hundred legs? Which one first, which one second, whic h one third? He stopped the centipede and said, \"Uncle, I have a question if you don't mind. How do you manage to walk with one hundred legs? He said, \"M y God, I never thought about it! Now I will watch how I walk and then I will tell you. Up to now I have been simply walking without thinking.\" And he could not walk even a single step. He fell down, because he was trying to figure out which leg first and which leg second -- and the number was one hundred. Even a great mathematician like Albert Einstein would have fallen with one hundred legs. That poor centipede -- knowing no arithmetic. But the centipede was very angry and told the rabbit, \"It's okay that you asked the question to me, but here is a big commune of other centipedes. Don't ask such a stupid question to anybody. Perha ps you have crippled me for my whole life! I will never be able to walk again, because I don't know how I used to walk. It was simply natural.\" 33,000 rules of conduct? Are you trying to drive humanity insane? And if they don't follow, they feel guilty. If they fo llow, they look mad. And if you look at those rules, you will be absolutely aw are. For example, one sannyasin, Buddha's disciple, was going to spread his message. Buddha said to him, \"Never look at a woman. You are going far away.\" The man said, \"It is a little bit difficult, because half the people are women. Everywhere is full of women, and you are giving me a message not to look at a"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"woman? But how am I supposed to know before looking that a woman is coming? And by the time I know that sh e is a woman, I have already looked.\" The man raised the question that it woul d be almost impossible for him to follow it, Buddha gave him the advice, \"No, it is possible. I will give you the clue. You walk looking just four feet ahead of you, so if you see a woman's feet, you know. Don't look up, always keep your eyes gl ued four feet away.\" In India, women use ornaments on the feet, on the toes, and ju st by looking at the feet you will know it is a woman. The man was a little of a philosopher. He said, \"That's okay. Anything else?\" Buddha said, \"Never touch a woman.\" Th e man said, \"But there can be a situation.... For example, a woman is dr owning and I am standing on the bank. What do you want me to do, jump in the river and save the woman, or just go on my way without looking at her? A woman may have fallen on the street sick or old or blind and she needs the help of some one to take her at least to the nearest town, and I am passing by . What do you suggest?\" Buddha said, \"Okay, you can touch a woman, but remain absolutely alert. Keep yourself as a witness, don't get in any wa y involved. Do it as if she is only a corpse, and you are fulfilling your duty.\" Now this kind of discipline will soon create disturbances. People are going to disobey such things and find loop holes and destroy the whole thing. I have not given them anything in which they can find loopholes -- I have given them only loopholes. Now what can they de stroy? It is said a fishing net consists of holes. I have given them only holes,no fishing net. Now they can do whatsoever they want to do with holes. I give them absolute freedom to be themselves.... No guilt, no promise, just enjoy the moment to the fullest, and you are not responsible to anybody. No God to be responsible tow ards, no hell to be afraid of , no heaven to be greedy for. All that is present this very moment, enjoy it intensely, totally, because no one knows -- the next moment may come, may not come. You want to do something?

A:* I don't know Q:* AND FURTHERMORE, YOU DON'T CARE! A:* I don't care.

What does it matter? I don't know, an d I don't care, either. I am perfectly happy right now, so blessed that I can bless the whole world. Still my blissfulness will not be exhausted. Q:* WHY SHARE IT WITH THE WORL D? YOU MENTIONED EARLIER YOUR HAPPINESS IN YOUR OWN PERSON.... WHY NOT KEEP IT WITHIN YOURSELF? A:* Because it goes on increasing if you share. It is profit-making. Q:* THERE ARE A FEW GIGGLES TH ERE. DEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN BY PROFIT-MAKING. A:* The more you share your bliss, your joy, the more it increases. It is a totally different kind of economics from that which you are aware of. In the ordinary economics the rule is if you go on sharing your money, it will decrease. In the higher economics, which is my business, the more you share, the more existence goes on pouring into you. It is just like a well: you go on drawing water from the well and new water goes on fl owing from everywhere. If you stop drawing water from the well, the water will become stale, dead, even poisonous. Bliss has to be shared. It is not out of co mpassion. That is why I said it is profit- making. It is not out of compassion that I share my bliss. it is just out of simple profit motive. It increases the more I share . It is like the rain cloud full of rain. It has to shower somewhere, otherwis e it will become heavy, burdened. Yes, I say, if you don't share your bliss it will go stale. It will start stinking very soon. It will die. You have to share it to keep it alive, flowing, increasing, expanding. I am an imperi alist. I don't believe in any limits on anything. I can understanding why you are scratchin g your beard. You don't have a beard and you are scratching it. You take a fe w grapes -- that will help you. That scratching is nervous. You just take some grapes! Those grapes are there just to avoid doing anything else that shows nervousness. But it is something new. All journalists feel nervous, because they have never met such a crazy man before.

A:* No. Because anything that is just give n away is never taken by anybody. The higher the cost, the better people will keep it, save it in their treasuries. Give it free, and it has no value, because people don't understand value unless it has a price. They understand price, they don't understand value.

[the cameraman has problems] Q:* I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO REPEAT SOME OF THE WORDS YOU JUST SAID... WHY BLISS HAS TO BE SOLD.... WHY YOU SELL BLISS. COULD YOU GRANT US THREE MORE MINUTES? A:* I can, but I cannot repeat what I have said; I will say something else. I don't believe in repetition. Everything in this world has to be achieved. You have to pay a price for it, and the bigger the price you pay for it, the high er is your estimate of it. If bliss, ecstasy, joy, were all available, like water, free -- nobody will be able to appreciate their value. You don't know the real value of water un less you have been thirsty in a desert. While he was in India, Alexander was aske d by a great Master, \"If you are in a desert and thirsty and I have a full bottle of water, how much will you be ready to pay for it?\" Alexander said, \"I will pay half my empire in such a situation.\" But the Master said, \"I will not sell until yo u pay me the full empire. Why should I sell? If you are willing to pay half, that is indication enough that if I just wait a little more, the customer is going to feel more thirsty and is going to pay the full empire.\" And Alexander agreed that perhaps he would give the whole empire. And the Master laughed. He said, \"Then what are you doing? Wasting your whole life for a bottle of water? Are you stupid or something?\""},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The world understands things in its own way.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH THE RAJNEESH TIMES, TOKYO QUESTION:* BELOVED BHAGWAN, BUDDHA THE JAPANESE SEEMS QUITE CONCEIVABLE, YET, ZO RBA THE JAPANESE QUITE INCONCEIVABLE. WOULD YOU COMMENT? ANSWER:* It is one of the most signific ant questions to ask. Buddha is not only conceivable in Japan, a Buddhist country, Buddha will be conceivable anywhere, even though the countries are not Buddh ist. Perhaps Buddha is the only human being in the whole history who is loved, respected by ALL, not only by Buddhists. On the other hand, Zorba is inconceivabl e in every old culture, civilization, religion, because they all have condemne d materialism and they all have raised spiritualism to its ultimate height. They have created a duality between matter and spirit, between the mundane and the sacred. Zorba represents all that has been condem ned for centuries upon centuries by all the religions. Buddha is loved certainl y by Buddhists, but respected by non- Buddhists, too. He represents something of the purity of the highest conceivable spirituality. That's why I say the question is significant. My whole effort is to bring Zorba and Bu ddha closer and clos er -- so close that both can exist in one human being without any contradiction, as complementaries, helping each othe r, not fighting with each other. Separately, both are missing much. Bu ddha is absolutely bloodless, just a skeleton, because he has denied everything that life is. Life is love, life is laughter. Buddha has denied everything. He is just a skeleton. Zorba is full of life, love, laughter. Eat, drink, and be merry is his whole religion. He does not know anything beyond eat, drink, and be merry. He does not know ... he has no question or curiosity about something that is higher -- higher than the alcohol, higher than the woman or man, higher th an this world, the visible world, the tangible world. Zorba has no quest; he is perfectly happy drinking, dancing, enjoying. Buddha is missing the blood, the life, the love, th e joy, the celebration. Buddha cannot dance. It will be simply inconceivable, Buddha dancing. Zorba cannot sit silently"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"and meditate. That, too, is as inconceiva ble as Buddha dancing. Zorba is dancing, singing, drinking. He is making love to any woman, who by chance meets him. Zorba represents the materialist in its best form. Buddha represents the spiritualist in its best form. but you are both, spirit and body. Existence is both, matter and consciousness. Therefore I say that spiritualists have b een denying the very base of the temple. They accept the temple but they deny th e foundation of the temple, and without the foundation, no temple can stand. That's why religions have failed. Gautam the Buddha has failed, for the simple reason that he was trying to make a temple without any foundations going do wn into the earth. He was trying to grow roses, but he was not ready to acce pt the roots under the ground which life in darkness and, of course, are not as beautiful as the roses. But neither the roses can exist without the roots, nor the roots can afford to exist without the flowers. The roots without the flowers will be ba rren, and the flowers without the roots can only be of plastic. so all the relig ions of the past have created a plastic humanity. Denying Zorba, they have denied all that is solid in you. And the materialists, communists, Marxists and ot her brands of materialism -- Epicurus in Greece, Charvaka in India -- they are eating, drinking, womanizing, but at the very end they find nothing but frustration. Something is missing. They may have all the money, all the power, everything that a man can ask for, but still inside they are empty, hollow. They may be dancing, but their dance has nothing of divinity in it. Their dance is just an exercise of the body. There is no soul to it. These are the two ways humanity has lived up to now -- divided, split, schizophrenic, both have to repress so mething. Buddha has to repress Zorba. Zorba has to repress Buddha. As far as I'm concerned, both are sick because both are half of one whole, which can be health y only if both the parts meet together and fill the gaps. Zorba can become the foundation, Buddha can become the temple. I don't see that there is any conflict be tween the rose and the roots. On the contrary, the roots are continuously send ing food, water, nourishment, color, fragrance to the rose. the rose is on the receiving end. All that the rose gives to you comes from the roots. Cut the roots away, and the rose dies, disappears. All fragrance, all life, all dance in the wind ... the joy in the sun ... simply withers away. Take the roses away, and what meaning is left for the roots? That's why materialism is bound to come to a point where it feels meaningless, everything meaningless. It is the Zorba in the West which has come to its climax in the so-called philosophy of existentialis m. Existentialism is the ultimate logical conclusion of Zorba. There is no me aning in life according to European existentialism. There is only anxiety, an guish, despair. Zorba had started with love, laughter, life, and it is strange that in the end the conclusi on is that there is only one way to get rid of it all, th is whole mess and madness, and that is suicide."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"The whole Western intelligence is in a gr eat insane space, because they have accepted only the roots and now they are asking, \"Where are the flowers?\" They never allowed the flowers to grow. On the contrary, they went on cutting the branches, the leaves, the trunk of the tr ee, and now they are asking the roots, \"What is the meaning of you? For what do you exist?\" And in the East, just the op posite has happened: only the spiritual is true, and the material is illusory. All the spiritual masters in the East have been emphasizing only one thing: that the worl d in which you live is only a dream. It does not matter whether you are rich or poor -- what does it matter if it is only a dream? Whether you are hungry, sick, old, he althy, it is only a dream. It is not the reality. The natural consequence was, that in sa ving their spirit and their spirituality they have lost their root s. That's why the East is poor. Gautam Buddha is responsible for it. If you deny materia lism, then how can science develop? If matter is illusory,then the whole scientifi c endeavor is illusory -- Hiroshima and Nagasaki have never happened, it was ju st the Japanese dreaming about it. If matter is illusory, then how can the atom be real, which is the constituent of matter? And if life is illusory,then why make so much fuss about life disappearing from the earth in a third world war. Because Gautam Buddha and the people like him in other religions emphasized only the other world, this world was neglected, ignored. No science was developed, although it could have been developed long before it started to develop in the West. The Western developmen t of science is only of the last three hundred years. Mathematics was discovered in India ten thousand years ago, but what happened? Guns and dynamite wer e discovered in China five thousand years ago, but then what went wrong? In three hundred years the West has developed nuclear weapons, and they have managed to reach to the moon. What has the East been doing for ten thousand years? You will be surprised to know that when Marco Polo came back from China, he brought from the Chinese emperor many presents for the pope. He was laughed at about everything that he brought, an d he thought he was bringing something of immense value. For example, up to that time, the West had no idea of printing machines, and he had brought printed bo oks from china. The West had no idea of currency notes, but in China curre ncy notes had been in use for three thousand years. What went wrong? People who invented mathematics, people who invented printing presses, people who invented guns and gunpowder...? The whole responsibility goes to Gautam Buddha an d his type of people. They emphasized that all this is illusory -- don't waste ti me. The small time that you have got has not to be wasted in the desert of materialism. You should devote your whole life to the search for truth, for that which is far above what you see. Seek the invisible, the intangible. Seek the eter nal, the immortal. Seek the immaterial."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Emphasis from people like Buddha who ha d charismatic personalities influenced the whole of civilization, and for cent uries all progress stopped. India knew everything about mathematics, but could not produce an Albert Einstein. If things had moved rightly, India would ha ve reached to faraway stars by this time, not just to the moon. The moon is very close. If Western science can reach to the moon in three hundred years, India cold have reached to the farthest star in ten thousand years. All the basic prin ciples of mathematics were known, but they were never applied. They rema ined theoretical. They remained undeveloped because the genius of th e country was attracted by Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, Shankara, who were emphasizing that matter is illusory,that this life is just a dream, and the only use you can make of this life is to find that which remains forever. Naturally, the East has remained poor. Nobo dy else is responsible for it. it was bound to happen. If I had been there at Buddha's time, I would have predicted that what he was teaching would result in poverty, sickness and death to the same people who were influenced by him. And remember, when people are poor, hungry, dying, do you think they can meditate? With a hungry stomach, can you go on sitting silently and let the grass grow by itself? Basho's stomach was full when he wrote those lines. He must have begged and eaten well. Then, sitting under a tree by the side of a pond, he could write beautiful poetry of tremendous significan ce. But we should not forget that Basho was not hungry. If he had been hungry, then there was no possibility of these beautiful lines coming out of him. \"The ancient pond, the frog jumps in. The so und.\" Or, the silence. It is difficult to translate exactly the Japanese word, because Japanese has no alphabet. In India, we have a word,which is pronounced \"cha pak,\" -- the sound of the frog. When a frog jumps into the pond, th ere is something like chapak. But these beautiful statements are not out of a hungry stomach. The East went on becoming poorer and poorer, because without technology and science you cannot be rich. And if Ethiopia is dying today -- almost one thousand people per day are dying, and in the last four years, millions have died in Ethiopia -- who is responsible for these people dying ther e? Why have they not been able to develop enough technology and science to create and produce wealth? Because wealth was condemned by their religious leaders and the people listened to their religious leaders. Wealth was condemned. Children were declared to be gifts of God, so they went on producing only one thing: children. Now, no child brings with him a piece of land, seeds for the new crop, water to nourish the plants. God goes on sending children without any equipment to be here, and the religious leaders go on saying they are gifts of God, but they have proved to be the very curses against humanity. The East was bound to remain poor beca use of Gautam Buddha. It was bound to remain unprogressive, backward, because of Gautam Buddha. And I love the man; you can understand my anguish that I have to say that Gautam Buddha is"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"responsible for this whole misery. For t wenty-five centuries, millions of people have suffered, have gone mad, have become perverted -- and the man who is responsible for it, I love him. I love Zorba, too, but I know it is because of the materialists we have suffered two world wars and now the third is im pending to destroy the whole humanity at any moment. Because of Zorbas, the West has remained superficial. Yes, its stomach is full, perhaps much too full, but its being is empty. The house is really beautiful, a palace, but nobody lives there. It is empty. Yes, there are precious paintings on the walls and great sculp tures in the garden. Everything is immensely valuable, but nobody lives there; nobody IS there, because the materialist forgot completely to come ba ck home. He went out, and out, and out, and went on searching farther and farther away from his home base. Now he has completely forgotten who he is, where he comes from. Now he is asking, what is the meaning of my life, what I am searchi ng, what I am going here, what the hell am I doing here? He is angry, angry at life itself. In one of Dostoevsky's novels, THE BROTHERS KARAMOZOV there are three brothers. One brother is an atheist, one br other is a very pious religious innocent person, and the third brother simply does not care about either. The atheist says: If I meet your God, Ivan -- Ivan is the religious one -- if I meet that fellow anywhere, the first thing I am to do is to return the ticket, and ask the gentleman, \"Is it right to send me into a world wi thout asking my permission? Who are you? What authority have you got to force me to live a life which is meaningless? And everything that is joyful, you and your representatives condemn it. You have done a great job of creating. You create us without asking us. That is the first crime you have committed. Then you give us instincts which we have not asked for and send your prophets and messiah s who condemn those instincts saying that sex is sin, that attachment is sin, that possessions are sin. So what kind of game is going on? Are you some kind of a sadist? Have you created us to suffer? Are you enjoying our suffering and misery?\" That brother is speaking for the whole West. Everything is available, but what is the point? You will go on making love to this woman, to that man, but what is the point? After a few experiences, you simply look silly. What are you doing? You may eat in this restaurant,in that restaurant -- Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian spaghetti -- but sooner or later yo u are bound to recognize what is going on. What is the point of it all? Why should I go on living tomorrow, because again tomorrow, spaghetti? It is enough for any intelligent man -- and the more intelligent a man is, the sooner he gets bored. Retarded people can go on living with a woman or with a man their whole life. But intelligent people, the greater their intelligence, the greater is their capacity to see that ther e are thousand of beautiful women. Why remain with one? There are thousands of beautiful men, so why cling to one? There is no natural law that you have to remain clinging to one. Why create a bondage?"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"But even if a man goes on moving from one woman to another, soon he gets tired and founds out that he is in a vicious circ le. Finally he finds to his great surprise that all women are exactly the same. Wh at you call making love -- whether you make love to Cleopatra or Mother Teresa -- it is the same, the same stupid thing. So the whole West has created the foundati on of the temple, but a foundation is meaningless without a temple. They go on making foundations, and then they are stuck: \"What are we doing? For what are we making this foundation?\" They don't have any idea that a temple has to be created. They have denied that temple for centuries: there is no consciousness. Karl Marx says, \"Consciousness is only a by-product of matter.\" See the point: Shankara, Buddha and Mahavira say that matte r is illusory, that consciousness is immortal reality. Charvaka, Epicurus, and Karl Marx say just the opposite, that matter is the ONLY reality and consciousness is only a by-product. It is just like a clock on the wall that goes on clicking, giving you time. If you bring an aboriginal into the room and show the clock moving, he will look all around and say, \"Where is the spirit of th e clock?\" Because if it moves, there must be a mover hidden inside. But there is no mover, the movement is a by product of a certain mechanism. You can take apart all the parts. Do you think the soul of the clock goes upwards to meet God? If it was a good clock, giving the right time all the time, it will go to God; if it wa s a bad clock, giving the wrong time all the time, it will go down into hell to suffer. But you know there is nobody who is going anywhere. You can put those parts together again, and the clock starts clicking. that clicking of the clock is just a by-product. The West denied consciousness; the result is a tremendous feeling of despair. The East denied matter; the result is Ethiopia, India. Half a million people are going to die out of poverty this year. Two million people will be barely able to survive. You cannot tell them that being barely able to survive will be life. And who knows about the next year? Right now the world population is four billion. In every decade we are producing one billion people, so by the time this century ends, we will be nearabout six billion people. Our resources are being exhausted, and this increase of popu lation will be happening in the poor countries,not in the rich countries. The poor countries will become poorer, much porer, and it will be impossible for rich er countries to give any help. And why should they give? The poor don't give th eir meditation to the rich. They don't give their experiences of ecstasy, bliss fulness to the rich. Why should the rich give the fruits of their technology to th e poor? They are going to be in difficulty themselves, because they are piling up nuclear weapons. This is where Zorba has brought them. Sooner or later nuclear weapons are going to destroy the world. Yes, they w ill die with their stomachs full. In fact, half a million people only in America suff er from obesity, fatness. They go on growing like monsters. They don't have an ything else to do except eat. Eat more. A small child, an American, was puzzled why the Ethiopians go on dying. He told his father that it s eems so stupid that one thou sand people are dying every"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"day, starving. Why don't they open thei r fridges? If there is nothing else available, they can eat cakes, biscuits. Now, the American child cannot concei ve a home without a fridge. What a distance we have created amongst human beings! The Ethiopian has never seen a fridge and perhaps will never see one. There seems to be no way for Ethiopia to survive. Zorba has brought half of the world to where they have everything. Only the man is missing, the spirit is missing -- and with the spirit, all meaning, all ecstasy, all joy, everything has gone down the drain. In the East, they are poor, dying, sick, suffering in every possible wa y, and that is the consequence of what Buddha has been teaching to these people. I want East and West to disappear into each other. I want Zorba and buddha to disappear into each other. Only then will we have a whole man, and the whole man is the need of the day. It is because of this that I am going to be condemned from both sides. The religious people w ill condemn me as a materialist; and the materialists, the communists are condemni ng me for diverting peoples' minds towards meditation. That means the youn g generation is being diverted away from the revolution, that I am serving in some way the interests of capitalism. I am the greatest danger to them, becaus e I am attracting so many young people. If they had not come to me, they woul d be communists. But now the situation has come to such a point that red no longer represents the communists, it represents me. They both are angry: Zorba is angry, Buddh a is angry. But I am not to be stopped by either. I am going to put both of th em into a mixture and put the electricity on, so that when the juice comes out, you cannot find which is Buddha and which is Zorba. That is my sannyasins: one who will live with intensity and totality like Zorba. But that is not the end, that is only the beginning. He will go on searching, seeking for something higher to live, something better to live. He will be in favor of science and technology. He will not deny this world. He will not call it a dream. It is true -- as true as anything can be. Who can say roots are untrue? Just to prove that roses are true, have you to prove roots to be illusory? I don't see the point. Roots are roots, and as roots they are real. Roses are roses; as roses, they are real. The problem is that they are joined together and they depend on each other. I have told you that juices are flowing continuously from th e roots towards the flower; but it is not a one way affair. the flower is taking the sun rays deep down to the roots. Because those roots are underg round, they also n eed the life that sun rays give. Without those sun rays, those r oots wil die. The flower does not open for you to make a garland, it opens for the roots which are hidden. In fact, it is an extension, a hand of the roots to catch hold of life and energy from the sun, the wind, the rain,and send it back to the roots which are hidden deep down. It is a two way traffic."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"And this is how it should be between Zorba and Buddha. If Buddha has eyes -- and certainly he has eyes -- but he doesn't have legs, what is he going to do with his eyes? The house is on fire.He can see it. He can see the way out, but he doesn't have legs, he is crippled. And so mebody is sitting by his side who is blind, but has strong legs. I am suggesting a simple thing: get intr oduced to each other! Tell each other what you have got and what you have not go t. It is a simple thing to come to an understanding that the crippled man, who can see, sits on the shoulders of the strong man, who is blind but who can walk. Now they are together, functioning as one unit. One sees and shows the way, and the other follows -- that's the only way to get out of the house which is on fire. And we ARE in the house which is on fire . It is exactly the right moment when Zorba and Buddha should drop all th eir antagonism and become one. Yes, Zorba is blind, but he is a strong person. Buddha has eyes, but he is fragile. He can sit under the bodhi tree, but if the jungle takes fire, perhaps he will not be able to escape. It had happened in Buddha's life.... I ha ve been to that place near Bodhgaya, where Buddha became enlightened. There is a small river, Niranjana. Buddha was so weak because of fasting, meditating. He had devoted everything to meditation. He had forgotten his body, he had forgotten everything else. He went to take a bath in Niranjana. It is a small river. When I went there, I could not believe -- perhaps at that time it may have been a little bigger river -- but the story is that he was so weak that the current of the river started carrying him away and he could not manage to stand against that small river's current. He tried hard somehow to get out, and had to hang onto the root of a tree on the side of the river. He had to rest for a time to gather energy enough to get out of the river. This situation, this story, is the story of the whole East. Yes, Buddha has got eyes. He can see as far as existence is. His visi on is limitless but he has done one thing wrong: he has gone against the body, agai nst nature. His achievement is partial. So is the achievement of Zorba partial. Remember one thing: truth can only be th e whole. It is just like a circle. You cannot draw half a circle. That is not possible. Just the word circle means FULL- CIRCLE. You cannot draw half a circle. That will be only an arc, not a circle. A circle has to be whole. And that's the situ ation about truth: truth has to be whole. Half a truth is worse than a lie. Buddha is half of the truth, and Zorba is half of the truth. It is going to be difficult to explain to Buddhist that I am making an effort to create a synthesis between Zorba and Buddha. They may feel offended, but that does not matter. Truth is on my side, and I am ready fo r an open discussion with both Buddha and Zorba. And my vision is so clear that both are half and both have disturbed the whole humanity."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Now it is time for Zorba the Buddha to appear.

Q:* THE PROBLEMS OF SOUTH AFRICA ARE BASICALLY REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS JAPANESE. WE ARE ACCEPTABLE IN BUSINESS, BUT CULTURALLY WE ARE CONSIDERED COLORED AND HAVE SEMI-HUMAN S TATUS. IS THERE ANY SOLUTION POSSIBLE IN SOUTH AFRICA? A:* South Africa is not a big problem. Like all problems it is very simple, but the vested interests make everything complex. In South Africa only fifteen percent of the population is white, and these fifteen percent white are invaders. Eighty-five percent of the people, the natives of th e land, have been living in slavery for centuries. They are simply slaves, serv ants, working in the coal mines, gold mines, diamond mines. Those mines belong to them, but they get only a little bit of money to survive. And the fifteen pe rcent white people exploit their rich country, and have been doing so for three hundred years. Now it has come to the point where someth ing has to be done, but the problem is that these fifteen percent whites came three hundred years ago, and now they don't have anywhere to go. There are Dutch people, English people, Italians. There are others, but the majority is Dutc h. Their own countries are not ready to accept them back, because no country wa nts its population to grow suddenly. Somehow they are keeping things in balance. Neither do these people really want to go back, because in their own co untries they will be ordinary second-rate citizens. Maybe clerks, waiters, porters, wh ile in South Africa, they are kings. All their investment is in South Africa. All th e technology that they have brought, all the mechanism is in the mines of South Af rica, and they know how much more is still there to be exploited. They have on ly scratched the surface. This is their greed and their fear of going back to th eir own countries where they will be almost foreigners. They have started calling themselves Af rikaaner, they don't call themselves Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, Span ish. No, they have become a new race: Afrikaaner, and they call their language Af rikaans. They don't want to leave and I can understand the human greed. I can al so understand their problem of who is going to accept them. Nobody is willing to accept them, but that does not mean they have to continue to exploit eighty-fi ve percent of the people, their country, their land; nor that they have to go on being the ruling ones. It is strange that in the twentieth cent ury only the fifteen percent, the white people, have the voting right in South Africa. The eighty-five percent majority"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"has no voting right, so the question of their coming into power does not arise. They have nothing to do with power. Th ey can't even vote. It is inhuman. I can see the difficulty of the white people; I can see the exploitation of the black people, but it cannot continue the way it has up to now. It has come to a point of explosion. Now there is emergency rule . The whole country is under military rule, and South Africa has one of the biggest armies in the world. No journalist is allowed in, so nobody knows how many people are being killed and burned every day. My suggestion is simple: fifteen percen t of the land should become a new country -- Afrikaaner. Fifteen percent of the wealth should go to the new country, Afrikaaner. Fifteen percent of the army should go to the new country, Afrikaaner. Everything according to the percentage, with South Africa divided into two countries, Afrikaaner and South Africa. It is so simple, if people really want to solve the problem. The white people should remain there. They have been th ere for three hundred years, and their old countries are not going to accept them ba ck. It is enough time. But they should get according to their percentage. if they don't want to divide the country, then the eighty-five percent majority should be given the voting right. Naturally then the government will be of native South Africans. These are two clear alternatives. And I think the white people will prefer the first. They would have at least fifteen pe rcent of the country -- fifteen percent of its wealth, diamond mines, gold mines, and fifteen percent of the army -- and they would be their own rulers. And the na tive eighty-five percent of the people would have eighty-five percent of the ar my, eighty-five percent of the wealth, eighty-five percent of the land, and wo uld be their own kings. I don't see a problem at all. They just have to sit with each other and find out the way to divide. If the ruling minority insist that they don' t want division, then they must give the eighty-five percent majority their voting ri ghts. But then they will not have even the fifteen percent that was possible in the first place, because the native majority will throw them out of the government. Then they will be at the natives' service. Those natives who have served you for three hundred years -- now you serve them. they have worked in your mine s and died -- now you work and die. The whole world should insist that either of these two alternatives has to be accepted; otherwise, the South African gove rnment simply will be rejected by all the governments of the world. They should be thrown out of UNO. They have no right to represent a country where eighty-five percent of the people are against them. They should not be given any support. All businesses from other countries should be completely stopped. The presen t government should be forced either to accept the first conclusion, or accept the second alternative. And I think the first is perfectly beautiful . They don't lose; they get as much as they deserve, fifteen percent. The native South Africans don't lose anything, they get as much as they deserve. One just ne eds the clarity to see. But this is the"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"problem: even when things are very si mple, millions of people have to die, innocent people have to suffer. The id iotic politicians and power-hungry people go on massacring poor innocent children, women, old people. In South Africa the army now is given th e power to shoot anybody they suspect. No inquiry is needed; no arrest warrant is needed; no court has to decide. The military itself has all the powers to shoot ANYBODY, and suspicion is not something that you can later prove wron g or right. Whether it was wrong or right, it makes no difference -- it was not a certainty, it was only a suspicion. So now they are killing anybody they want to kill. It is the responsibility of the whole world to reject South Africa as a member of civilized humanity, because what they are doing is barbarous. But even countries like America that are supposed to be the most advanced, progressive, democratic countries do th ings which are inconceivable. In the Second World War, when Japanese armies attached Pearl Harbor, one and one- half million Japanese -- who were living in America, who were American citizens, who had been living here for ge nerations, and most of whom were born in America -- were given fifteen days notice to sell their properties, land, everything, and move to a special place that the American government was providing for them. And the whole of America was kept in d arkness. Even today that part is not mentioned in books of history about the Second World War. In fact, all around the world, nobody kn ows what actually happened to those one and one-half million Japanese-Americans. Fifteen days was such a short notice -- how could you sell your businesses, your houses, your lands? -- and who is going to purchase them when th e local buyers knew th at within fifteen days you will have to go, that the lands, the buildings, your car, your shop, your business, everything will be left in their hands, free? Why purchase? These one and one-half million Japanese-Americans who had earned all this with their own labor with their own intelligence , were really rich people. The Japanese have the knack of becoming rich; they know how to create wealth. They had to leave, and they were not supposed to ask why or where they were going. Just one thing was told to them -- that the American government suspected that when America and Japan were at war they might favor Japan. And in a democratic country, the governme nt had not a single proof that a single Japanese in America supported Japan. Out of one and one-half million people, they could not find a single proof that anyone was really or willing to support Japan. They were ready to support and fight for America because they considered America their country; but they were take n into isolation in the desert where they were told that they would be taken c are of on a reservation, just like the Red Indians. But it was not a reservation. Now facts have become available: it was the same kind of concentration camp that Adolf Hitler had created in Germany for Jews."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"After the Second World War, the pe ople who had been running those concentration camps in Germany were pu nished, but America was not punished even though they had behaved in the same way with absolutely innocent Japanese-Americans who were not in favo r of Japan. They were tortured, no medical facilities were given, their food was not up to standard, and they were crushed like sub-human beings. When they were brought back after the war, their properties were not returned, and have not been returned even yet. An d this is a democracy! During the whole period of wartime, America was not able to find any proof to support their actions. When the Japanese-Americans were released, their businesses were in American hands, their cars were in Ameri can hands, Americans had taken over everything without giving a si ngle paise in compensation. Now forty years have passed and those Ja panese-Americans are still asking the American government: \"Give us some compensation. It was your duty.You forced us and we had not committed any cr ime, and you don't have a single case against us.\" And it is not a small thing -- one and a half million people and their properties -- and the American government is silent. That's why I say that civilization has yet to come. It has not yet happened. There are only pretenders, hypocrites, but no t truly democratic people anywhere. America is different from the Soviet Unio n only in hypocrisy. The Soviet Union is straightforward, a dictatorship. America IS a dictatorship proclaiming itself as a democracy, and now we can say it from our own experience. For four years, Rajneeshees have been harassed by the American government -- the state government, the federal govern ment -- without any legal reason on their part to support their acts against us . All their laws are in our favor and their constitution is in our favor, because from the very beginning I have made it clear to my people not to do anything knowingly or unknowingly against the American constitution; that it is the on ly constitution which at least accepts democracy, accepts freedom of speech, ac cepts respect for the individual -- so don't do anything. We have not done anything against th e constitution, but still we are being harassed in every possible way. They are taking advantage of all kinds of laws, which have never been applied to anyo ne in the whole history of America. Suddenly those laws have become applicable to us, and those laws go against the American constitution. So now my new stand is that we will fight the American government in Oregon, and if needed, th en the federal government, to save the American constitution. We are for the Ame rican constitution and its values, and even if we have to fight with the America ns themselves, we will fight to the very end -- because that constitution is th e only hope for humanity some day to become democratic, some day to become really civilized and human.

The whole trouble and the journey into the unknown is for me. Nobody seems to be concerned about that; everybody is concerned about those who will be left behind, living.

That's what gives a man dignity, integrity, self. For the first ti me he feels he is. And the responsibility makes him free of all kinds of slaveries, enslavements. So, I'm not going to say what they ha ve to do when I am gone. That is manipulating people even when you are dead. Moses is still manipulating the Jews. He was not satisfied while alive.

And Moses gave commandments to them to be followed after he is gone. The same was done by Mohammed, by Buddha. Th ey were too much concerned about what their people are going to do when they are gone. It is something of tremendous importan ce that they were so much concerned. The reason is that in their presence they have persuaded the disciples to repress every natural instinct. Sex has to be re pressed and they have to be celibate. Under their influence and charismatic personality people have accepted something absolutely unnatural. Only an impotent man can be celibate; and no impotent man has been known to become enlightened, not yet. He has no energy in him. Enlightenment will need a tremen dous explosion of energy. He cannot"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"even create a child; how can he create himself in a totally luminous way? So no impotent man has ever become enlightened. And all the people who became enlightened were really over-sexual. In fact their over-sexuality was one of the causes for their enlightenment. They had so much energy that the woman was not enough . Many women were also not enough. They had such a great energy that they wanted to make love to the whole existence itself, and that's what enlighten ment is, and orgiastic experience with existence itself. Q:* ARE YOU ENLIGHTENED? A:* Yes. Q:* HOW ENLIGHTENED. ARE YOU VERY ENLIGHTENED? A:* There are no quantities in enlighten ment; either you are enlightened or you are not enlightened. Q:* I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AS FAR AS OTHER RELIGIONS.... A:* No, I have not answered your firs t question. You asked me what I am thinking about these people after I am go ne. I am not even thinking now, when I am here. I am giving them total freedom. I have not enforced anything on them that will make me afraid that once I am gone these celibates are going to create trouble. I have not repressed anything. If they want to smoke, I tell them to smoke the best cigar possible -- don't go for anything seco nd rate. If you want to love, find out the best man, the best woman, and go into it as totally as possible. I am in support of expression and all the so -called religions were in support of repression. When you repress people you are certainly afraid that when you are gone there is going to be chaos. That problem does not exist for me. When I am gone there is going to be no chaos because chaos was all that I have been training my people for. My commune is a chaos and yet a very organic chaos, a very creative chaos, a chaos out of which stars are born. That's why that kind of question becomes very difficult for me to answer. I am not gi ving them any discipline, any rules of conduct. I am simply teaching them to be aware, alert, to be independent. Take your responsibility and do whatsoever you want to do. Don't bother about Moses, or Jesus, or Buddha, or me. Jesus lived his way; he never bothered about others. If he had bothered about others; the Jews would never have cruc ified him. Buddha never bothered about anybody. I don't accept anybody as my master or my leader. I am nobody's"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"shadow, nobody's carbon copy, and that's what I am teaching to my people: Don't be anybody's carbon copy, including me. So, alive, dance with me, rejoice with me . When I am gone continue to dance and rejoice in remembrance of a man who gave you freedom, who gave you individuality. What else is there to bo ther about the future? Wherever I am -- somewhere I must be -- I will go on showering my love on my people and I know they will find ways to respond. But that is something very private; I cannot reveal it to a non-sannyasin. Q:* YOU HAVE MADE A LOT OF DIFFERENT REMARKS ABOUT RELIGIONS, AND -- I BELIEVE THIS IS YOUR MOST RECENT ONE; YOU'LL CORRECT ME, I'M SURE YOU WILL -- TH AT THIS IS THE TRUE RELIGION, THIS IS THE TRUE CHURCH. CORRECT? A:* Right. Q:* YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU WERE BUILDING AN ORCHESTRA OUT OF ALL THESE OTHER RELIGIONS. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO THAT? A:* I have done it already. There is no question of proposition. You can see my commune, Jews, Mohammedans, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas. Q:* SO YOU WEREN'T SPEAKING OF THE WHOLE WORLD, THEN, YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING OF IN THE COMMUNE? A:* I am just speaking of my world. Hell to the whole world! Q:* YOU MADE A COMMENT A FEW YE ARS BACK, I BELIEVE, THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE WORLD POPUL ATION WOULD DIE OF AIDS. NOW RECENTLY ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'V E SEEN IN THE NEWS, THAT THE FIGURES ARE JUST ASTRONOMICAL, DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR PREDICTION IS STARTING TO COME TRUE? A:* No need because they are going to die; there is no way to save them. Q:* HOW SOON DO YOU THINK? A:* Within the last twenty years before th e twenty-first century, they are going to die either by nuclear weapons or by AIDS. The nuclear weapons are the culmination of our whole past politics. AIDS is the culmination of our whole religious past. AIDS is the logical conclusion of all sexual perversions; and religions have caused all kinds of perversions in man. Homosexuality is a very religious"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"discipline. Monks were forced to live to gether in monasteries where no woman was allowed to enter. There is a Catholic monastery in Athos, one thousand years old. In these one thousand years not even a six-month-old baby girl has entered the monastery. Even that is not allowed . I sometimes wonder -- a six-month-old baby girl -- what is the fear and what ki nd of monks are living inside? Are they monks or monsters? And in Athos the rule is that once you enter the monastery only your dead body comes out. You will never come out alive to have any contact with other human beings. Ther e are nunneries where only women can live; no men can enter. Now what do yo u want? You are creating the situation for homosexuality, lesbianism, masturba tion and all kinds of things. These monks, these nuns are the original sources of AIDS. So your politics have brought you to th e third world war, which is looming on the horizon, and your religions have br ought you to AIDS. Your political and religious leaders have done great serv ice to humanity and to this planet. I am certainly concerned about my pe ople. They have been given all the information about AIDS. Meanwhile, the go vernments are trying to repress exact information for the simple reason that if they accept that AIDS is spreading, if may create anarchy, chaos, turmoil. Rich people can afford private doctors, private physicians, and they can keep thei r mouths shut with their dollars. There are many people who have AIDS; they ar e confirmed by the medical profession but the public does not know about them. Just think of the situation. A person who ha s AIDS can live at the most two years, at the most, which is almost impossible. If he remains secluded, avoids all kinds of infections, does not come in contact with anybody, perhaps he may survive two years; otherwise, six months is going to be the average. Just think, you are given six months to live. You would not like to be condemned by people that you have AIDS. You bribe the doctor. And you have only six months to live, naturally you will make as many sexual contacts as possible. Life is fleeing out of your hands. You would like to do everything that you always wanted to do but you had time to postpone. Now there is no time to postpone, so these people who are not made known to the public are going around spreading AIDS like wildfire. Q:* SO YOU DON'T THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING ENOUGH TO CONTROL AIDS, THEN? A:* Not at all. They are doing nothing. Their senators have AIDS and they have not yet imprisoned those senators. Their senators are homosexuals; they should be immediately arrested. There is no ot her way: put them into imprisonment. Q:* WOULD YOU DO THAT WITH A SANNYASIN IF HE OR SHE HAD AIDS? "},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"A:* There is no need because my sannyas ins are living in a totally different world. I have one million sannyasins aro und the world and I am trying for them all to come and live in communes, not to live in the outside world. So I am segregating them into different places, in to different countries, in communes. We do not condemn anything; every sannyasin goes through the medical test and if he finds that he has AIDS the whole commune is full of compassion for the person. Q:* ARE YOU TESTING FOR AIDS, THEN? A:* Yes, we have our own medical center, a ll kinds of expertise: doctors, nurses, a hospital. And we have a special place far away in the mountains where we remove those people who have AIDS. We take care of them. We give them everything they need, books to read, f ilms to see, games to play. They are respected in the commune, and everybody is responsible that they are no longer to make any sexual contact. Not even kissing, because AIDS is caught through kissing. So I'm telling my sannyasins to change thei r patterns and drop the idea of kissing which is certainly unhygienic even wi thout AIDS. Two persons mixing their saliva which contains all kinds of germ s. And there are idiots who are doing French kissing. I have suggested that my sannyasins change that pattern: start rubbing noses with each other. Hygienic, clean, and if sometimes somebody has a cold, at the most you can catch cold. And this is not a big problem. Nobody considers a cold a disease. If you don't take medicine it goes in seven days; if you take medicine it goes in one week. And th is is not something new; Eskimos have been doing it for their whole history. Th ey don't kiss, they rub their noses and they enjoy rubbing their noses. As much as you want, you can rub. There is no problem and I think Eskimos are far more progressive, at lest about kissing. There are other aboriginal tribes also , in India, where noses are rubbed and kissing is simply laughed at. When Christian missionaries reached th ose aboriginal tribes to spread Christianity, the aboriginals have not stopped laughing yet about two things. One they call the missionary posture, ma n on top of the woman, which looked very ugly to the aboriginal. The woman is fragile, delicate, she should be on top. And this huge animal is putting all hi s weight and doing push-ups on the poor woman. In India this posture is called missionary posture because they came to know about it for the first time thro ugh Christian missionaries. Otherwise in India there are known eighty-four differe nt postures and in those eighty-four different postures the Christian missionary posture is not included. And second thing that they could not believe is that these people kiss. And these people are trying to open hospitals, medicine -- can' t they understand what they are doing, that this is very unhygienic?"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"The aboriginals who are five thousand years behind the civilization have never agreed for kissing. Even though they ha d become Christians -- they were poor and Christians could provide them with f ood, clothes, education -- they have not started kissing. They still rub noses. So, as far as my sannyasins are concerne d, perhaps they will be the only ones who can escape the calamity of AIDS. We don't condemn anybody; if he has AIDS, so what? Take precautions. He is not humiliated and disrespected for that; on the other hand, he becomes the center of the love of the whole commune. Now we have two sannyasins who have confirmed AIDS. We are taking care of them and we have given them the most beautiful part of our land, the best beautiful view. Q:* ARE THEY HERE IN THIS COMMUNE? A:* Yes, they are here in this commu ne, but we have one hundred twenty-six square miles, so they are miles away, be yond the lake, living in a beautiful place and doing whatsoever they can do. They can do proof-reading, they can do editing or whatever they want. They can simply make a beautiful garden there. And if both those two sannyasins want to make love to each other there is no problem. Nothing more can happen to them; what has to happen has happened. Perhaps two persons having AIDS making love may come to discover this is the only way to get rid of the disease -- no body knows. So we may be able to find out: if they survive more than two years that means we have found what medical science has failed to find. But we will be taking care of these people. They are victims of religions, but what they can do? If the politicians and the religious le aders -- that means nuclear weapons and AIDS -- are in a race to destroy humani ty, I don't think politicians have guts enough to go for a third world war, beca use both sides, America and the Soviet Union, have enough nuclear weapons to destroy this planet seven hundred times. I don't think any politician in Ame rica or any politician in Russia has guts enough -- and what is the point? The whole point in a war is to be victorious, but in this war nobody is going to be left alive. The question of who was vict orious and who was defeated will remain unsettled and there will be no one to writ e the history, eithe r. Just because of the totality of war, war is an impossibility. Ther e is no need for pacifists, unnecessary to scream and take protest march. Just fo rget all about it; nuclear weapons have already done. They have finished the idea of war. Politicians can go on talking about war because that keeps them in po wer, but there is going to be no war. Q:* WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN YOUR OPINION IF A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY GOT HOLD OF A BOMB AN D DETONATED IT AND STARTED ANOTHER WAR? "},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"A:* NOBODY can start it because everybod y knows that starting it is finishing the whole humanity. And those poor coun tries who are dying.... Do you think Ethiopia is going to have nuclear weapon s? Do you think India is going to have nuclear weapons? They are trying, but half of their population is on the verge of becoming another Ethiopia. They are se lling their wheat. The people who have produced the wheat are dying because th ey are hungry, and their wheat -- their production, their labor -- is being exported so that India can manage to have a nuclear plant. Sheer stupidity. But even if they can get, nobody can conceive India becoming a nuclear power comparab le to the Soviet Union or America. Q:* INDIA MAY NOT HAVE IT NOW AND IT MAY NOT BE A THREAT, BUT WHAT ABOUT CUBA OR LIBYA OR KHADAFI? A:* NOBODY. Even if they can afford, even if they can make, nobody has guts to start seeing the whole perspective. The whol e thing is clear that if you start, that is not the end; soon you will be retalia ted with nuclear missiles and you will be destroyed. And your starting it will mean the end of the world. So I don't think there is any possibility of third world war. It is simply canceled. It is strange how things happen in history -- war goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and a point comes when it is to big, an d you cannot manage to have it. War itself commits suicide, that's wh at the third world war is. Once Albert Einstein was asked, \"Can you say something to us about the third world war?\" He said, \"I have no idea. If you want to know about the fourth world war I can say something.\" The inquir er was simply at a loss. He could not believe what Einstein was saying. \"About the third world war you cannot say anything? What can you say about the fourth world war?\" And Einstein said, \"It will never happen; that much can be said about it. But about the third world war there is no way to say anything.\" So the war is certainly canceled -- nucle ar war. Any other kinds of war can go on. They are just football games, so I'm not concerned about that. But AIDS is certainly my concern because it is sp reading, individual to individual. No government control is possible. Even your president, your prime ministers may be having it. Nobody knows unless ev erybody is checked. You should begin with President Ronald Reagan -- that is the place to start with -- the White House should be completely checked because th is White House is just like white lies. What is going on inside it is all black. In Oregon catch hold of Governor Atiyeh and start checking from there. First all your assembly members, your senators; first do it on the highest level because these are the people who can keep it to themselves and go on spre ading. And then by and by come lower and lower, and find out people, then these people have to be segregated someplace. It is such an urgency it cannot be de layed. And the whole humanity has to be made aware of all the facts relating to AIDS, all precautions that are possible. And around the world create the atmosphe re that if anybody has AIDS he is"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"simply a victim of centuries of stupid relig ious ideas. Don't be hard on him. Help him so at least in these last days of his life, he can relax. There is no need for him to be employed, no need for him to thin k of other responsibilities. Free him from all responsibilities. Let him enjoy music, movies, literature. Be compassionate to him. I don't think your world is going to do it , but my communes are doing it already. Q:* NOW YOU'VE MADE A POINT IN THE PAST THAT YOU HAVE A VERY OPEN SEXUAL COMMUNE HERE. HOW DOES THAT EFFECT THE CHILDREN IN REGARDS TO CHILDR EN ON THE OUTSIDE? ARE THEY BEING EXPOSED TO SEX AT AN EARLIER AGE? HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCES? A:* There is no problem at all. Children are told everything about sex not in any roundabout way of explaining, but direct and exact. And once their curiosity is satisfied they don't bother about it; they will bother only when they are sexually mature. In the outside society they be come interested before their sexual maturity because they see in the movies, they see in the streets, they see in their parents, and they wonder what is going on. A child is very curious to know about everything that he comes access, and you create all kinds of curiosities. He knows his father is reading magazines like PLAYBOY, and he also looks into the magazines when the father is in the bathroom. He knows his mother is fritte ring with somebody else. Children are very conscious, very alert, silent, bu t watching everything that is going on around them. Naturally he becomes curiou s -- something is being kept secret from him. -- and this curiosity is dangerous; he may try to do something that others are doing. It must be really gr eat because everybody is doing it, every movie, every family. All the children are talking about it, so there must be something really experienceable. But in my commune it is totally differe nt. We tell our children everything. We tell them they are allowed to ask all the question, that there is nothing to hide, there is no secret. And we tell them that soon they will become mature, soon they will be having sexual experiences, so it is better to be acquainted with all the facts about sexuality as well as all the fictions which are all untrue but have been told to children down the ages . So we are making them aw are of the facts and the fictions. Then, when they are sexually mature, we do no not prevent them from having sexual affairs. We simply introd uce them to precautions; that is their responsibility. If a girl becomes pregna nt she becomes a burden on the boy she loves and she becomes burdened by her ow n act, so we provide to them all birth control methods. In every bathroom we have free birth control methods available. They can go to the medical ce nter and get the pill. We help them in every way."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"We don't want them to remain celibate because celibacy is cause of AIDS. We want them to know as many girls, as many boys as possible. The richer their experience the better for choosing a life partner later. If a boy has known hundreds of girls he is more experience d and more capable of finding the right girl with whom he can manage to live. There will be less nagging, less fighting, less jealousy because the girl has also e xperienced hundreds of boys before she decided for this boy. The boy had expe rienced hundreds of girls before he decided for this girl. They both know. And in my commune it is absolutely allo wed even after marriage that if the girl wants to go with someone for a day or two, or the husband wants to go with someone, it should be respected. It is their freedom. Once in a while a little change is good, and it is not destructive of marriage. On the contrary, it helps the people to remain together. Their love becomes more and more a friendship. In the ordinary world people are together bu t their love becomes more and more an intimate enmity. Here, their togetherness becomes more and more a friendship, and any day they want to change their partners that is their freedom, their choice. So nobody is crying and weep ing and screaming. If you hear anybody screaming, crying, you should know that he is doing Dynamic Meditation; it is not the ordinary screaming that goes on in every other household. And we give them one hour every morning to scream as much as they can, so for twenty-three hours there is no need. We are absolutely simple and natural. In the four years we have been here not a single child has been born. People understand their responsibility. We are the only people in the whole world who understand responsibility. Right now the world population is four billion and it is increasing at the rate of one billion pe r decade. By the end of this century there is not going to be elbow room -- on bo th sides you will find somebody standing. What are your governments doing and wh at are your churches doing? Four sannyasins have certainly died in our commune but not a new child has been born. And we are not going to give birth to children till the world population is reduced to one fourth. Q:* ONE FOURTH OF WHAT IT IS TODAY? A:* What it is today. Without coming to one fourth there will be Ethiopias, there will be Indias, there will be small-scale wa rs. These are just methods of nature to bring balance. Nuclear war is out of th e question; there will be diseases, AIDS and everything, just to cut the population. But my commune is perfectly responsible, happy, rejoicing. It is not that anybody is controlling them; we only inform them that these are the facts -- now they are intelligent enough to draw the conclu sions. And my communes certainly are intelligent enough. Almost everybody is a graduate. Most of the people have masters degrees, a few have Ph.D.'s, a f ew are D.Litt.'s. And they come from all professions: psychiatrists, professors, doctors, engineers, electronic experts,"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"computer experts. We are absolutely sel f-sufficient. And that's what we are doing around the world. We are trying to make every commune self-sufficient. If the outside world dies of AIDS or anything we can still survive and we can manage humanity's heritage. The planet need not die with the popes and with the presidents and the prime ministers. It can live, go on living with dancing and celebrating sannyasins. But we are not seri ous about anything. This, too, is not a serious affair. We do everything playfully. Q:* I JUST HAVE ONE FI NAL QUESTION TO ASK YOU. WHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY FOR YOU? WHAT DO YOU DO FIRST IN THE MORNING? HOW DO YOU START YOUR DAYS? A:* First, I'm an absolutely lazy man. I call myself the lazy man's guide to enlightenment, so I am a non-doer. In the morning I have to be awakened otherwise I'm not going to wake up. At six o'clock they wake my up, and then I take one and a half hours in my bathr oom relaxing in my bath. I love my bathroom the best; it is my temple. Th ey have made for me really beautiful, gorgeous bathrooms. And not only one because I'm always for two of everything, not less than that, because if something goes wrong in one bathroom I'm not going to miss my bath. A second bathroom has to be constantly alert and ready. So for one and a half hours I enjo y in my bathroom. I have the best bubble baths. I'm allergic to perfumes, so I ca n take only herbal bubble baths. If you come to my bathroom you will be surprised to see what a treasure I have got there: the world's best shampoos, ha ir conditioners, liquid soaps without perfume, all kinds. It is really difficult every day for me to choose.... It takes my almost five minutes to figure ou t what this combination will do. After my one and a half hours I take on e glass of juice; that is my whole breakfast. And then I go for my mornin g talk, two and a half hours gossiping with my sannyasins. I don't have any go spel I have only gossips, and I laugh with them, enjoy with them. By eleven I'm back. Eleven is my time for my lunch. and has been for my whole life. I have never missed my lunch at eleven. At eleven-thirty I go to sleep. Th at, too, I have never missed. I have always slept from eleven till two fo r the simple reason th at if you sleep in the day for one or two hours, you have two mornings instead of one. And why miss the other? And sleeping is just a beau tiful activity. Patanjali, the founder of yoga, has described the ultimate state of consciousness as very similar to deep sleep. The only difference is that in the ultimate state of consciousness -- what he calls samadhi -- one is aware; in deep sleep one is not aware. For me now there is no difference: my sleep is my samadhi. I am aware, so I am enjoying my sleep in a double way. Patanjali, Buddha, Mahavir a, all those great Indian founders of religion missed something that I am enjo ying -- they missed the afternoon nap. They could not sleep because all these so-called great prophets and messiahs were fulfilling the expectations of medi ocre people who were their followers."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Now it doesn't look right for a Buddha to sl eep in the day -- it looks lazy, it looks luxurious. And Buddha had not guts enou gh to say to those followers, that \"If you cannot accept me as having an afternoo n nap, then just get lost. Just to fulfill your expectations, I am not going to change myself.\" Many times many people have told me th at a religious man, particularly in India, should wake up at three o'clock in the morning. That is the traditional Indian spirituality, three o'clock in the morning. I said, \"I am ready to lose my enlightenment, my religiousness and everything, but forget completely that I am going to wake up at three o'clock in the morning. That is the best time to sleep; the most precious time is between thr ee and five -- those two hours are the deepest. It is a scientific fact, but I have known it according to my own experience that those two hours are the most important because you go deeper. And I am fully conscious, so I can see wh en I go deep. Now science has come to support it. They have found a way -- your temperature falls down when you go deeper into sleep. Between three and five, your temperature comes. down; otherwise for twenty-two hours it remain s the same, normal. For two hours, it suddenly falls down. So I enjoy my afternoon sleep. Then at two o'clock I have to be awaken ed again. I go for a drive that I have always loved, and my sannyasins have made a beautiful road just for me. Perhaps I am the poorest and the rich est man in the world: I don't possess anything, but everything that anybody can possess, I use it. I do n't think even the Queen of England has a private road going in to the forest in the hills by the side of a lake. It is used only for one hour, and there is no traffic, so there is no question of following any stupid laws of being on the right or being on the left. Mostly I follow being in the middle, which is not allowed anywhere else in the world. That's why I enjoy it. Back at three o'clock, I rest just sitting in my chair. I have a beautiful haiku from a Japanese poet which says: Sitting silently, doing nothing, and the grass grows by itself. That's all -- haikus are very sma ll statements, but of tremendous meaning. So for one and a half hours, I am just si tting silently, doing nothing, and let the grass grow itself. And it is growing. My grass is not green, it is red. And it is growing all around the world while I am simply sitting in my room, doing nothing. Even Basho was not aware -- he was thinking only of the grass by his side in the Zen garden where he was silent ly sitting. My grass is growing all over the world and I am not doing anything for it. But one and a half hours I enjoy sitting; then again for one and a half hour s, I am back in my bathroom for my evening shower. Then I have my supper, and from the supper I come directly here for the interviews. By nine, nine-fift een, I will be back. Then my personal secretary has one or two hours -- whatso ever she needs -- for any advice for the commune around the world, any letters to be answered. Mostly, they do them themselves, unless they find something that needs my advice; then they bring it to me. At eleven in the night, all my lif e I have eaten a certain kind of Indian sweet that I eat and go to bed. With out eating my sweet, I cannot sleep."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":" Q:* WHAT KIND OF A SWEET IS IT? A:* It is a Bengali sweet which is not known in the West, but is the best. It is made of milk but the butter is taken out. You heat the milk and just pour lemon juice into the boiling milk. It separates, and what is left is called *** (name of sweet). It is something that the West has not used. It is the lightest sweet. In Bengal it is given to patients or to those who are reco vering from a long sickness. It is very helpful and tremendously delicious. From el even to six, I am again knocked out. And it existence wants me again tomorrow, I will be awakened; otherwise I am gone -- gone with the wind. My life is very simple -- the same. For th irty-five years it has been the same. I never got bored by it for the simple reason that I never compare two days. If you go on giving me the same food for a whole year, I will not complain because I don't compare. Yesterday is gone, finished. I again enjoy the same food with the same freshness, with the same excitement, with the same enlightenment as I have always done. My people go on doing everything for me. You see this beautiful robe? You were impressed by the colors -- my people make my robes, my people make my shoes, my people make my watches. Everything that I have on is made by my people. That's why I say everything that I am wearing is priceless because it is made of love. If somebody is going to give me a billion dollars for this watch, I am not going to sell it. There is no pr ice which can purchase this watch because it has been made by my sannyasins with so much love and so much care. And these are not diamonds -- and that's why I loved it even more -- these are real stones, defeating diamonds. I have always enjoyed whenever a stone defeats a diamond, whenever a genius comes out from the lower classes and defe ats all the super-rich. And it has been always so -- all the geniuses have come from lower classes. The super-rich have been absolutely impotent; they have not contributed to civilization in any way. They have not given birth to a single Picasso, a single Dostoevski, a single Turgenev, Gorky, Marx, Albert Einstein ... they are just futile, getting fat. In America there are half a million people suffering from over eating, obesity; and this year exactly half a million people in the third world are going to die of hunger. It is a strange world we have cr eated in which half a million people are dying because they have no food, and the other half-million are dying because they are eating too much. Their fridges are so full. I have heard a story of a man whose wife was becoming bigger and bigger, fatter and fatter and was looking so ugly that to go with her in the society was just a shame. So he brought a beautiful pictur e of a nude girl, well-proportioned, and put that picture inside the fridge, where his wife was continuously going to give an idea what a woman should be like. But the trouble changed: the man started going to the fridge to look at the girl! Th e wife stopped; she hated to see that girl."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"She would have killed that girl. She sto pped going to the fridge and she started getting slimmer. But the husband started going to look at the girl and while looking at the girl, he would get interest ed in the ice cream and this and that. Soon the situation changed -- the wife was slim and th e husband was ashamed to go with her in the outside society. But this is what is happening around the world. A few people are dying because they have too much; a few people are dy ing because they have nothing. Just a little understanding, and we can create a beautiful humanity and a beautiful world where nobody needs to die, where nobody needs to suffer from AIDS. All that you have to do is to change stupid ideas and make man a natural human being, and allow his humanity and nature total freedom.

Because this whole earth is ours, all the boundary lines of nations should disappe ar. Only then there is a guarantee there is not going to be a war in the future. I am for one world, one government. if nations are there, then war is inevitable.

DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS GOD-GIVEN? A:* There is no God. Q: WHAT DO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BELIEVE IN, THEN? A:* Their beliefs are blind; the very wo rd belief means blind. If you know, you know; you do not believe. You don't belie ve in the sun, in the moon. You don't believe in the roses, in the trees. You be lieve in God. You believe in heaven. You believe in hell. Those are all fictions. Q:* ARE YOU A GOD? A:* No. Q:* ... OR A MAN? YOU ARE A MAN? A:* I am just an ordinary man. Q:* BUT YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED. A:* That is not much of a difference. It is just a difference between closed eyes and open eyes. Q:* YOU BELIEVE IN POLYGAMY, BUT YOU ARE AFRAID OF OVER- POPULATION. YOU BELIEVE IN FREE SEX, AND YOU ARE AFRAID OF AIDS. HOW CAN YOU PROPAGATE POLYGAMY AND FREE SEX WITHOUT PROTECTING YOUR FOLLOWERS FROM AIDS? A:* I am protecting them already; there is no question of how. First, I am not in favor of polygamy as against monogamy. I am in favor of dissolving the very institution of marriage. That is the uglie st institution that has happened to man. Marriage dissolved, there is no question of monogamy or polygamy. People are free: if they want to be together, they are together; if they don't want to be together, that is their decision. And chil dren should be taken care of by the commune. Children should not belong to families, but to the commune. And I am taking perfect care of my people. In four years not a single child has been born in this commune. "},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Q:* WE KNOW BHAGWAN, THAT YOU AR E LIVING A RATHER RICH LIFE. BUT DO YOU THINK THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING FOR THE POOR? A:* Those who are poor are themselves re sponsible for their poverty. They have believed in idiotic religious ideologies which have made them remain poor. Q:* AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP THEM? A:* They have to suffer whatsoever they have done. And if they have to punish someone, they should punish the Po pe, Mother Teresa, Shankaracharya, Ayatollah Khomeini. Hang all of them: th ese are the people who are against birth control, against the pill, against ab ortion. These are the people who are increasing the population. The Pope increases the population and I am responsible for it? And those poor people li sten to the Pope, no t to me, so what I have to do with them? Q:* IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU THAT YOU ARE INSULTING MAYBE HALF THE WORLD BY SAYING THIS? A:* I want the world population to be re duced to one fourth. Only then can this world be comfortable, luxurious; can people live, enjoy, rejoice, create. Life can be a blessing. With this population it is a nightmare, and the responsibility goes to your religious leaders. I am not going to suffer for their crime. Neither me nor my people. We are living in comfort, in lu xury. And I believe in comfort and luxury. Man has the intelligence to create more comfort than nature is capable of giving, more luxury than nature has ever intended to offer. And man should use the opportunity. These poor people who are dying in Ethiopia, in India, or anywhere, have listened to the wrong pe ople. Now they should take revenge. They should burn the Vatican; they shou ld take over all the churches. I am not responsible for their poverty. For thirty ye ars I have been teaching birth control methods, abortion. And the poor people wh om I have been teaching these things have been throwing stones at me, have been throwing shoes at me, have made attempts on my life. Strange reward -- I am trying to show them how to prevent becoming more and more poor, and they want to kill me. I am simply finished with all that nonsense. They should go to their Pope, to their Khomeini, to Shankaracharya and settle thei r things. i am concerned on ly with my red people and with nobody else. Q:* DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF YOUR MIND TO BECOME A SANNYASINS? YOU ONCE SAID THAT. A:* Certainly. There are two ways of bein g out of the mind. One is falling below it; then you go into an insane asylum. The other is going above it; then you"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"become enlightened. But both are out of mind. Hence there is a certain similarity between the madman and the Buddha. A certain similarity. Q:* AREN'T YOU FREEZING? A:* No. Q:* IT IS COLD IN HERE. A:* I love freezing. Q:* BUT YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES ON. A:* They are not thicker than yours. Q:* BHAGWAN, RECENTLY THE POPE OF ROME PAID A VISIT TO THE NETHERLANDS. DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO COME THERE TO SEE HOW YOUR FIVE THOUSAND DUTCH FRIENDS ARE DOING? A:* No. I don't have any need to go anywhere. Q:* YOU LET THEM COME TO YOU. A:* They come here. Always the thirsty have to come to the well. Q:* BUT YOU ONCE CALLED HOLLAND YOUR MOST ORANGE COUNTRY, SO I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN OREGON? A:* In Oregon I am doing something el se. In Holland, even without me, the country is going to turn red; but in America my presence is needed. Q:* BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING ATTACKS ON RONALD REAGAN SEVERAL TIMES. I NEVER HEARD YOU ABOUT THE RUSSIAN LEADERS. A:* I simply don't know anything about th e Russian leaders -- except that I am against communism. Q:* BUT YOU DO KNOW ABOUT AF GHANISTAN AND THE RUSSIANS BEING THERE. "},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"A:* Yes, I have heard about it. But I don' t read any books, any newspapers. I have dropped all rubbish. For five years I am ju st without any contact with the outside world. Q:* HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW THEN? A:* Just my secretary. Q:* SHE TELLS YOU? A:* If she feels something has to be informed to me, she informs. Q:* AND SHE DIDN'T INFORM YO U ABOUT THE RUSSIAN LEADERS DOING ALMOST THE SAME BUT THEM IN ANOTHER ANGLE AS THE WESTERN LEADERS? A:* She has never informed me about the Russian leaders. One thing I know is that they are not hypocrites; they are op enly dictatorial. They believe in the dictatorship of the proletari at so whatsoever they do, they do it without hiding themselves behind beautiful words. America talks about democracy, but that is only talk. Q:* WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS PLANET, BHAGWAN? WILL THERE BE ANOTHER BHAGWAN? A:* I don't know, and neither do I care. When I was not here the world was not missing me. Q:* BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE, YOUR SANNYASINS WILL MISS YOU WHEN YOU ARE GONE. A:* Only my sannyasins will miss me. Q:* SO WILL THERE BE ANOTHER MASTER? A:* No. Nobody can replace me; nobody can be my successor. I am making it absolutely clear that we are not to create another Christianity, another popedom, another Vatican. No. My sannyasins are related to me: Drink as much as you can from my well, and when my life di sappears you are free to live the way you want. There is nobody going to dominate you, order you, discipline you. I am against all discipline, against all command ments. My whole emphasis is on the respect of the individual and his freedom. Ev en if he wants to go to hell, nobody"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"should interfere. So when I am gone, you see only from one side: when I die, you all have died to me. Q:* WE HEARD THIS STORY OF THE REVEREND JIM JONES WHO ORDERED HIS FOLLOWERS TO COMMIT SUICIDE. YOU ONCE SAID THAT WHEN YOU WILL GO, MANY WILL FOLLOW. DO YOU MEAN THIS AS A MASS SUICIDE? A:* I am not a Christian. I am not a Reverend Jim Jones. Q:* YOU DON'T WANT YOUR DISCIPLES TO FOLLOW YOU WHEN YOU ARE DEAD? A:* No, never. I want them to live and live abundantly. And when I am gone, I want them to celebrate my death beca use we celebrate ever ything: defeat or victory, life or death. Celebrate, dance, enjoy. Q:* IS THERE A LIFE AFTER LIFE? AFTER DEATH? A LIFE AFTER DEATH? A:* Yes, there is. But unless you experience it, my answer will be only a belief to you. I know it, but I don't want anybody to believe in my knowledge. I can help my people to come to the point from wh ere they also can know. And that is one of my basic tenets: unless you know, don' t believe: doubt to the very end till you come to know. And when you know, there is no need to believe. I don't believe in life after death -- I know. Q:* DO YOU MIND WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DO BELIEVE? A:* I mind because their belief will prevent them from knowing. They have moved in a wrong direction. Q:* YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY HOPE FROM THE PEOPLE, DO YOU? A:* I want to take away all hope from people. Every hope. Because hope is the opium that all the religions have been supplying to the people. Q:* WHAT IS IT, THEN, THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE WHEN THEY MAY NOT HAVE HOPE? A:* This moment is enough. Hope is for those who are unable to live this moment, those who are suffering and are in misery. They need hope; they only think of tomorrow. My people live today. And tomorrow never comes, it always"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"comes as today. They know the secret of how to live today, so they will be knowing the secret anywhere, anytime. Ethiopia needs hope. India needs hope. Poor countries need hope. Retarded people need hope. Miserable couples need hope that in heaven everything will be perfectly good: your wife will not be nagging you there. Your children will not become hippies there. They will not start taking drugs and dropping out of the university there. You need hope. I am gi ving to my people the reality; hope is only a fantasy. The sick man needs hope for health. But why should the healthy man need hope for health? He is already healthy. Q:* IS THE MESSAGE YOU ARE BRINGING ONLY FOR SANNYASINS, ONLY FOR 500,000 OF YOUR DISCIPLES? OR DO YOU WANT TO BRING THIS MESSAGE TO MORE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD? A:* I don't want anything. My people are there. I have not searched for them, they have come to me. Those who are in need, they should seek me. If they are not in need -- get lost -- it is none of my concern. Q:* HOW DO YOU LIKE MY TIE? TH IS WAS THE ONLY RED THING THAT I COULD FIND? A:* That is the only colo r I hate. I never use red. Q:* YOU MUST LOVE SHEELA. A:* Sheela I love, but not the red color. Q:* SHE IS RED AND ALL YOUR DISCIPLES ARE RED. A:* That is why I have given red colors to them -- because that is the only color I will never use. Q:* SO NONE OF YOUR CARS IS RED, EITHER? A:* There are a few cars which are red, but I am sitting inside and I don't see them. Q:* YOU ARE A VERY WISE MAN. A:* Of course. The wisest who has walked on this earth. Q:* IS THIS CLIMATE FINE FOR YO U, BHAGWAN? MUCH BETTER THAN IN INDIA?"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":" A:* Much better in every way. The water is clean, pure. In India it is difficult to find water which is not polluted. Just th e other day I was informed that in India half the crops are eaten by rats and othe r animals. And the people, fifty percent of India's people, are almost starving. Whatso ever they eat, half of it is eaten by bugs in their stomach. So almost three fourths of their production goes to the animals or to the bugs. All rivers are polluted. Here, we have the purest water possible, the cleanest air possible. And we have enough land, space, 126 square miles. It is three times l arger than New York City. Q:* ARE YOU CREATING A WONDER HERE IN THE DESERT, BHAGWAN? A:* Certainly. An oasis I am creating . And we have already succeeded much. When we came four years ago, there was only one house -- that was all. Now we have houses for five thousand people, fully equipped with everything modern. All the houses are centrally air-conditioned. The air is dry; that is what has helped me most. Because I suffer from asthma, humidity is a trouble for me. And I suffer from all kinds of allergies whic h are not curable. No allergy is curable; you have just to protect yourself agains t it. So here we have managed everything. My people have done everything so that for four years I had not suffered from any allergy. My back was bad in India, an d in India they could not manage to do anything. Experts from England were called, the best expert. He also could not figure it out. But strangely -- I have used all kinds of cars available in the whole world -- just one car Silver Spur by Rolls Royce, fits to my back. Q:* IS THIS A COMMERCIAL, BHAGWAN? A:* I am absolutely a business man. Q:* BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY NINETY. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE MORE? A:* Three hundred sixty-five soon. Q:* EVERY DAY ANOTHER ONE? A:* Yes. Q:* AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM AWAY TO THE POOR PEOPLE, I UNDERSTOOD. A:* No. Never. Q:* I KNOW, BUT CAN YOU GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE THEN MAYBE A BIT OF UNDERSTANDING, A BIT OF LOVE?"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":" A:* I have given them for thirty years and in return they have given me poison, they have thrown knives at me. I am fini shed with all that nonsense. These Rolls Royces will go to my sannyasins, not to anybody else. Q:* WHAT YOU ARE ADVOCATING IS LOVE. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE LOVE TO PEOPLE THAT NEED IT? A:* My people are enough. I have one m illion sannyasins. What do you want of me? I am loving one million peop le. Do you want to kill me? Q:* YOU WOULDN'T MIND.... A:* Is it not enough? One million people? I am loving and loving as much as nobody else can love. Q:* ARE YOU A BETTER SHOWMAN THAN RONALD REAGAN IS? A:* I am certainly better in everything. I believe in the best. And if I start loving all those people, then what Ayatollah Kh omeini is going to do? Then Pope the Pollack will be out of employment. And wh at Mother Teresa th e Terrible is going to do? I take care of these people also. I leave business for them also. I don't want them to die without business. I have my business going fast like a wildfire; their businesses are shrinking, so I leave th e whole world to them: serve the poor because your religion teaches that throug h service to the poor you will reach to paradise. I don't believe in any paradise. I say: Live richly herenow. This is paradise. Q:* YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH, YOU SAY, AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE VERY MANY DISCIPLES OR FOLLOWERS, BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD IS POOR. A:* I don't want them. I have more than enough. Q:* YOU DON'T WANT TO CONVERT ME, FOR EXAMPLE? A:* No. Q:* WHY NOT? A:* I don't believe in conversion. To me conversion is interfering in somebody's freedom. You can become a sannyasin; I will not convert you. You will have to"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"ask. You will have to beg on your knees to be accepted. And then too perhaps I may not accept. Q:* MAYBE I WON'T, BHAGWAN, HEARING ABOUT YOUR IDEAS. DO YOU RESPECT THAT? A:* That's great. I respect everybod y and I respect everybody's decision, individuality. Even if he is wrong, it is his right to be wrong. But I will never try to convert anybody. In my whole life I have never tried to convert anybody. The people who have come to me have come on their own; if they stay with me, they stay on their own. If they want to go, they receive a good farewell. They can go. It is all freedom: no conversion, no enforcement, no conditioning. So I will not convert you, but if you want to become a sannyasin.... Q:* YOU WON'T LIKE MY COLOR IN RED... A:* I will put you all in red. Q:* YOU WERE TALKING YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY CAN LOVE JESUS CHRIST. I THINK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CATHOLICS CAN. AND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? A:* How many contemporaries of Jesus loved him? Q:* TWELVE, AT LEAST. A:* Twelve. And how many wer e present when he was cruc ified? One, at least, and the eleven had escaped -- and these are great apostles of Jesus. And the one who has remained has refused that he knows Jesus. You take few grapes. Q:* I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BE WITH THE LITTLE THINGS. A:* You just take a few grapes. Q:* INSTEAD OF SMOKING, BHAGWAN. A:* Yes, they are very helpful. Q:* I MUST BE A LITTLE BIT IN LOVE WITH YOU, BECAUSE I DIDN'T SMOKE ALL DAY. I DIDN'T DRI NK. I HAD ALL MY CLOTHES DRY- CLEANED. AND I HAVE COLD FEET.

That's why I am saying take a few grapes. Q:* SO YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, BHAGWAN? A:* No. I am going to take over the whole universe. Q:* YOU THINK THAT THERE IS LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS? A:* At least fifty thousand planets have life. Q:* AND DOES THAT COME ONCE TOGE THER? ARE WE VISITING THEM? ARE THEY VISITING US? A:* Yes. Life moves from one planet to an other planet -- not bodies, but spirits. Q:* DO YOU BELIEVE IN UFO'S? UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, YOU KNOW. A:* No. That's all nonsense. Q:* PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLANETS VISITING US? A:* No. Q:* INVADING MAYBE? IT COULD BE A TEACHER OF THEIRS, A MASTER OF THE PLANETS. A:* Nobody is interested in invading this madhouse. Q:* WHAT IS YOUR SEX APPEAL, BHAGWAN? YOU HAVE SO MANY GORGEOUS WOMEN AROUND YOU AND IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. A:* I love women, and women love me. Q:* ARE YOU A CELIBATE? A:* No. Why should I be? This is a st range question. Nobody asks: Do you breath? Do you eat? Q:* HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR DAY SINCE YOU DON'T READ? "},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"A:* With so many gorgeous women, you are asking me: How do you spend your day? Read the book Arabian Nights and you will be reading my autobiography. Q:* WHY DO YOU SPEAK UP NOW AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN SILENT FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS? IS TH IS BECAUSE THE FRUIT ON THE TREE IS RIPE? A:* Yes, that is one of the reasons. But even deeper than that, I had gone into silence to let a few people drop out from sannyas. These were the people who were enchanted with my words, my philosophy, my approach towards the fundamental problems of life. I have be en insisting that what I say is not important: the important canno t be said; the truth is inexpressible. You can know it in silence, but you cannot put it into words. So I wanted to get rid of those people who cannot understand my silence. The only way was to be silent. In three years I sorted out all the wrong kinds of people. In three years those who remained as happy with me as before -- these were my people. After sorting out the wrong kind, now is the time for me to say what I really wanted to say. The right opportunity was not there; now I have enough people who are ready to listen to me without any prejudice. An d I have not to fulfill any of their expectations -- they don't have any expect ations about me. So just to sort out the wrong people was one of the most fundamental reasons. Secondly, it is true -- in these three years of silence, the peop le who were living with me have come to a state of maturity, centering, groundin g -- the fruit is ripe. The flowers have blossomed and now I would like to spread the fragrance unaddressed. Whoever wants it can have it; the fruits are here, just be the side on the table. Q:* IT IS THERE, RIGHT, BUT NOT FOR A NEW GENERATION, BHAGWAN, BECAUSE YOU ADVOCATE COMPLETE BIRTH CONTROL. A:* I don't care. Nobody cared about me. A ll of you are just accidental products. Who cared for you? Do you think your father and mother were thinking about you? Q:* YES. A:* NO. You are just accidental. Q:* THEY WANTED ME. A:* No. Because they never knew who yo u are. They may have wanted a child, but not you. Q:* I HAVE THEIR CHARACTER, A COMBINATION OF THE TWO."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" A:* There were millions of possibilities -- not only you. When your father was making love to your mother, he released millions of germs and one of them -- that is you -- reached to your mother's cell. All your millions of brothers could not reach and died. And their life is only two hours. If they don't reach the mother's egg within two hours, they will die. And the problem is that only one can reach, and the moment one reaches, the egg closes. It is rare that two male cells reach together so there are twins. On ce a cell has reached, all others have to die. In every love affair millions of be ings are being killed. And nobody knows who is going to win the race. I don't th ink your mother or father knew anything about who was going to win the race. It was fortunate that you won it, but nobody cares. Q:* THANK YOU. A:* Come back again and again. I will be waiting here. Q:* THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HO PE YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME THAT THIS INTERVIEW MIGHT NOT BE THE KIND YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO. A:* No. I am never angry about anything. I am always ready to adjust to anything, any situation. There is no problem in it.

Q: SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS IN NEW YORK, UNITED STATES, REPORTED THAT THE NUMBER OF RAJNEESHEES WORLDWIDE ARE DECLINING, AND THAT YOU'RE SLOWLY RUNNING OUT OF RESOURCES. NOW AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SILENCE YOU HA VE STARTED TALKING AGAIN, YOU STARTED GIVING INTERVIEWS, YO U STARTED TO TALK WITH THE DISCIPLES. IS THIS PART OF A MEMBERSH IP DRIVE, OR IS IT JUST YOUR WISH TO COMMUNICATE? A: In the first place, sannyasins are increa sing all over the world, so there is no question of their decrease. Secondly, I don't believe in converting anybody. I believe that the very effort to convert somebody is trespassing his freedom, his being. I can say what I want to say, but there is no effort to convert anybody to sannyas. In my whole life, I have never converted a single person to sannyas. Although there are one million sannyasins around the wo rld, they have all come to me on their own accord. And I am against all kinds of missionary work, conversion, making people Christians, or Hindus or Mohammedans. Every individual has the right to be himself. I can say to the person -- not as an author ity, that I am the only begotten son of God, so you have to believe me, and un til you believe me, you are lost. If you"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"believe in me, you are saved. These st rategies are simply cunning, political, playing on man's fear and greed. Exploi ting man, taking advantage of his innocence, ignorance. I am against the whole company of messiahs, prophets, founders of religions. A single man has declared war against all th e religions of the wo rld. I am fighting with every argument that they have prop osed for thirty-five years continuously, and they have not been able to support any of their dogma, and they have not been able to answer any of my questions. So the people who have come to me have come out of their own freedom, intelligence. They could understand me, what I am saying, and they could see the fallacy that I was showing them. But unless somebody comes to me, asks for sannyas, I am in no way going to interf ere into his fundamental right of being himself. Right or wrong -- that does no t matter -- who am I to decide what is right for him, what is wrong for him? I can say how I have found my bliss, my joy. That's all. If your heart starts feeling with me, if your heart starts beating with me, and a desire for adventure arises in you for new spaces, new ecstasies, I am av ailable. Not as a leader, but only as a friend. This is for the first time that one m illion people have gathered around a man who claims no miracles, who claims no authority, who claims no speciality -- who only claims that he is a friend. And if you enjoy my friendship, you are welcome. The moment you feel that ou r paths now separate, I give you my heartfelt blessings, the same way as I had given to you when you had come to me. Nobody is prevented from going. Nobody is pushed, manipulated to come in. I have started speaking for my own reasons. I do everything according to my own reasons. I never bother about the world around me, and I don't care at all. For three years I was silent because I want ed few people who were wrongly hanging around me because they were intellectually convinced -- and that is not really to be with me -- I wanted to get rid of those people. But I am not rude to anybody. I have never said to anybody come in, I have never said to anybody to go out. But I have my own devices. Three and a half years of silence was enough for them, they could not stand it. They were interested in word s, they were interested in my theories, they were interested in my arguments -- their approa ch was intellectual. They dropped out. The moment I saw that the wrong people had dropped, I have started speaking again. Now I am speaking to those people who do not expect me even to speak. In three and a half year silence they were with me with the same joy. If I was going to remain silent forever, they were go ing to be with me with the same joy. Now it is a question deeper than intellect . It is more close to a love affair. You don't think about it -- suddenly you know you are in love, suddenly your whole being starts feeling a dance, suddenly you start whistling, you want to sing."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"If something like this happens to anybod y around me, then only he is with me, my fellow traveler. So I have sorted ou t the people politely, given them the opportunity to leave on their own accord so I need not have to tell them to go away because they are with me for wrong reasons. Logic is a game. If two persons discu ss something and one person wins the discussion, that does not mean that what he is saying is truth. All that it means is that he has more logical argumentative ca libre than the other one. The other one may be the truth. The defeated one may have the truth, but is not articulate enough. So truth cannot be decided by logic, argumentation. Its decision is something deeper -- it is of the heart in the beginning, an d in the end it is of the being itself. So now I am speaking to my own people , and now I can open my whole heart to them without even bothering to argue what I am saying. Without giving any evidence, any proofs. They know me, that until it is something that is going to help them, I am not going to say it. It is not a question of right and wrong. It is a question of helping them on the path. So now I have my people around the wo rld. They are increasing every day, because I am the only alternative in the whole world against all the religions and against all the politicians. Against all nati ons and against all races -- I am the only alternative. I stand for the simple human being -- I don't want him to be German, I don't want him to be African, I don' t want him to be American or Russian, I don't want him to be Catholic, Protes tant, Hindu, Buddhist, Mohammedan. All these are meaningless. History is full of all this nonsense, and because of this, man has stopped growing thousands of years before. I want man to be completely clean of the past, so he can become available totally to the present and to the future. The numbers of sannyasins will be incr easing every day faster and faster. For two reasons: The politicians are creating the situations -- I am not converting anybody. The politicians are creating the si tuation in which, if they succeed, this whole beautiful life on the earth will be destroyed. And the politicians can disappear only if nations disappear. War ca n disappear only if nations disappear. My people belong to no nation. They claim the right of the whole earth. The religious leaders, on the other hand , have led people to a very dangerous disease: AIDS. Politicians have come to th e nuclear weapons, that is their logical end: and religious leaders have come to AIDS. AIDS is a by-product of monasteries, nunneries and the preachers who have been telling people to remain celibate. If you put people, man in one place confined, women in another place confin ed, you are preparing the ground for homosexuality. Nobody can be celibate, it is against nature. It is against your physiology, against your biology, against yo ur chemistry. So just taking a vow of celibacy is not going to change the whol e program of your biochemistry. Then your biology will find some roundabout way -- that's what perversion is."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"And that homosexuality has ultimately cu lminated into this disease AIDS which is going to take over the whole world like wildfire. Only my communes will be the refuge, because only my communes, I am trying to destroy all kinds of perversions and bringing people back to na ture, to their natural being, respecting their bodies, loving their bodies. And tryi ng to understand that sex is natural only with the opposite pole. A man and woman can only create authentic orgasm. All other ways of orgasm are just phoney, and in the name of orgasm, nothing is achieved, cannot be achieved. Against nuclear weapons, I am the alternative because I am creating meditative people, silent people, peaceful people wh o do not want to destroy this earth. And against AIDS I am creating communes all over the world like oases where people will be back into the garden of Eden from where that idiot God pushed them out. Q: IN ONE OF THE INTERVIEWS, YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD. I THINK IT WAS A TV STATION HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. A: I am taking over it. I am already on the way, but my ways of taking over the world are not that (those) of Adolf Hitler or Alexander the Great. Those idiots have failed so badly that no intelligent pe rson can try to take over the world in their way. I have my own way. My way is to create more and more lo ving, peaceful, silent people around the world. That's my; empire, but in my empire, everybody is an emperor. Nobody is a slave. I am taking over the world. There is no other way for humanity to survive. Soon the people who are hostile to me will be begging that they should be allowed in the commune, because in the outside society if it is found they have AIDS, they are going to be condemned the way lepers were condemned in the past. Lepers were not allowed to live in the cities, th ey had to live outside. They could not move in the daylight, they had to move in the night. They could not take water from the well of the town -- they ha d a separate well outside the city. And leprosy is not such a dangerous thing. There has never been anything more dang erous than AIDS. So anybody who has a little intelligence, then the politicians and the religious leaders are pushing him to become a sannyasin. I don't need to go for conversion. They are pushing people toward me. Q: THAT WILL BE IN THE END THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE? A: This is the only way -- not in the end -- right now, in the beginning, because in the end.... It is all finished."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":" Q: YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF, HOWE VER, AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER.... A: No. Q: WHAT ARE YOU, THEN? A: Just a simple human being, just like you -- with a little di fference that your eyes are closed and my eyes are open. But you can open your eyes any moment and the difference disappears. Or, I ma y close my eyes.... Just that much difference, nothing much. First I will try to open your eyes but if I feel that everybody wants to sleep, then why I should bother? I should go to sleep myself! I don't take anything seriously. Leaders are serious people, taking the responsibility of the flock. And that's why I call them names, because I cannot find worse condemnations for these people. Jesus I call crackpot, a mental case, a man with a wish to die. And his whole life is a life of a schizophrenic. The behavior is enough proof -- he curses a fig tree -- can you thing of why a man sane should curse a fig tree because there are no figs on it? And it was not the season for figs ! The poor fig tree, what can she do? But he was angry because he had come from a village where people had refused to give food to him and to his twelve fools that he used to call apostles. And they were all hungry and tired, and then they came to the fig tree and there were no fruits. And this man talks about: Love your enem y. Even love your neighbor, which is even more difficult than loving your en emy. I can love the enemy very easily because there is so much distance between the enemy and me, but to love the neighbor is just like loving your wife. . This man is talking about love, this man is talking about compassion, kindness and he is not compassionate to the poor fig tree. And anybody cursing a tree, what do you think about him? If I call him a crackpot, nothing is wrong in it. he was absolutely insane. He interfered with people's ways of life. For example, in the temple of Jerusalem where money changers have been doing that kind of business for centuries, since the time of Moses when the temple was built. And in fact those money changers were of tremendous help to the land an d to the people, because with all the donations that came to the temple, thos e money changers were giving loans to poor people on a very nominal interest. And Jesus goes and throws their tables and pushes them with a whip out of the temple, and he says that this is my father's house and I will not allow anybody to pollute it with money. Now this man has no proof that he is the son of God. There are many mad people around the world who think they are son of God, they are prophet, they are messiahs, and they are all in mental asylums. They also don't have any proof. What proof Jesus has? Any certificate from God, any, message stamped by God,"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"signed by God? What proof he has got -- ju st a poor carpenter's son. That too is not certain whether his father was his father. Q: BUT YOU ARE BHAGWAN, YOU ARE THE ENLIGHTENED ONE. ARE YOU PERFECT? A: No. The Enlightened One simply mean s one who has come to know himself. That's all. The prophet dominates. He predicts. He gives you doctrines, theologies. You have to believe in him -- he himself cannot prove anything about hell or heaven or God, all are fictions -- but if all are fictions, his being a prophet flops because then without those fictions, how he can be the prophet? If there is no God, then how Jesus can claim that I am the only begotten son of God? So these prophets are trying to keep all the fictions, all the lies, because amongst those lies they can declare themselves to be a prophet. And the people who can believe in a God no one has ever seen, the people who can believe in hell and heaven no one has come back to give us a little detail about these places, are gullible. Any cunning person, a little artic ulate can declare himself a prophet and these people will believe him because believing is all that they know. And if he is the type of Jesus, so angry that he throws single-handedly all the money changers out of the temple and declares th at it is my father's house and I am going to clean it of all impurities, natu rally the gullible will see and believe in him. I am not a prophet because I don't have any consolation for anybody, and I don't have any hope for anybody. I don't sell opium to people, and that is the basic function of a prophet -- he is a dope dealer. The messiahs are trying to save the whole humanity. They have not been able to save themselves. Now Jesus must have been a fanatic idiot. Even on the cross he still believes that he is going to be saved by God, but when he sees that time is passing, blood is oozing, he is thirsty, he shouts at the sky. The sky is empty, no answer comes. Ne ver any answer has come from the sky. Millions of people have been praying -- no prayer has been answered. Jesus shouts, almost angry, frustrated, that: Ha ve you forsaken me? He is talking to God. He was still believing that God will come sitting on a white cloud with angels playing on their harps singing a lleluja. Nobody came, nothing happened. People simply laughed at the stupidity of the man -- even on the cross, he has not come back to sanity. And upon his crucifixion the whole Christ ianity is based. That's why cross has become its symbol: I call it \"crossianity.\" I don't call it Christianity, it has nothing to do with Christ. Its whole thing is the cross, and the cross is a symbol of death. So I don't say that Reverend Jim Jones did anything which goes against Jesus. he simply followed him to the very logical en d. Jesus was saying to people: soon I will go and prepare ground for you and soon you will all be coming, and you"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"will be with me and with God the Father in paradise. Reverend Jones, of course, was an American and believed in speed and he knew that 2,000 years have passed and the \"soon\" is not finished yet. It seems a different time scale exists in paradise, so he did not want to take an y chance -- he took all his followers with him. Why bother coming back and then take them. Reverend Jones is just part of the whole Christian attitude, but strange it is that Christians started condemning that man. Q: A LOT OF EX-SANNYASINS LEF T YOU DISAPPOINTED -- MAYBE IN THAT PROCESS WHEN YOU DECIDED NOT TO TALK ANY MORE -- AND SOME FELT AND VOICED THEIR CONCERN PUBLICLY THAT YOU EXPLOIT YOUR FOLLOWERS TO SUST AIN AN EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE. YOUR FORMER ITALIAN COOK, DEEKSH A, CALLED YOU A LIAR IN THE OREGONIAN; YOUR FORMER BODY GU ARD SHIVAMURTI SAID YOU ARE DISHONEST -- I THINK IT WAS IN THE OREGONIAN, AS WELL. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE PEOPLE PERSONALLY? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM? A: I love them still, the same as I have always loved them; and what they are saying is not wrong. I have never said that I never lie. If a lie is helpful, I am the first person to lie immediately. Truth is not a value to me. Helping those people who have come to me in every possible way -- and they are all asleep, they cannot understand the language of the one who is awake. So every enlightened person ha s lied and, of course, they did not have the guts to say so. I don't have any problem in a ccepting the truth that I lie. The whole question is: What helps to wake you up? For example, if you are not waking up, I can lie and shout in your ears that your hous e is on fire. It is not on fire, but what to do? Hearing that your house is on fi re you jump out of the bed and you wake up, and then I can say I am sorry that I had to lie, but there was no other way to wake you up. Q: HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO WAKE SOMEBODY UP? A: To the very end. I don't believe in half-hearted things. Anything I can do will be total, so if Deeksha says that I lie, she is perfectly right. There is nothing wrong in it. She is not condemning me. Q: WELL, SHE TOLD THE OREGONIAN REPORTERS THAT SHE HAS TO HIDE FROM YOUR FOLLOWERS NOW. A: That is up to her, and you have to ask her what she said, and why she said. How can I answer for her? I can answer for myself. About anything she has said"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"about me, I am ready to answer; but abou t anything else that she says, she is answerable, I am not. If Shiva says that I am dishonest, he is right. To me everything can be used as a device to wake people who are fast asleep , unconscious. To me it is just a game. If honesty helps, good; if it does not help, dishonesty will do. And I love those people who have left. The reason must be in themselves. If they say they left disappointed, that means they have some appointment with me? Certainly, unconsciously they must be ho ping that some expectations will be fulfilled by me, and I don't fulfill anybody's expectations. Those who can remain with me without an y expectations, only they are capable to understand me and capable to understand the work that I am doing. These people, if they feel disappointed (it) si mply means they had come with a certain idea, hope, desire -- and I fulfill nobody's desire. I teach desirelessness. I don't fulfill anybody's hope. You must have seen the Christians have put a board outside my commune that those who enter here, drop all your hopes forever. That's perfectly true. They are doing my work. Q: DO THEY KNOW THAT? A: They don't know -- this is the difficul ty. That's why I call these people idiots! So anybody who leaves me, leaves on hi s own responsibility. Anybody who joins with me joins on his own responsibility. So if you see these people, tell them that since I don't take anybody's responsib ility and I don't promise you any hope, then the whole frustration is your own making. I am not a party to it. I have never claimed that I am an hone st person. I have never claimed that I always speak the truth. Even under oa th, you cannot manipulate me to say anything that I don't want to say. I will say only the thing that I want to say. So all these allegations they think are al legations -- I don't think so. By saying such things against me they are simply showing that for its ten years or eleven years they were with me, they could not un derstand a single word of mine. They are simply saying that they are retarded , their minds are not more than thirteen years of age. Their physical age may be anywhere, but their minds are stuck at the thirteen. If they don't believe me th ey should go to a psychoanalist and let themselves be examined that ho w much is their mental age. With me only people who have tremendous intelligence can stay. I am not Jesus. With Jesus all those twelve uneduc ated, illiterate fishermen, farmers, woodcutters, carpenters -- those were his di sciples, not a single learned rabbi was convinced. That is very strange becaus e he was a Jew. he was fulfilling, long awaited prophecies of the Jews for a messi ah. In fact, they should have rejoiced that our days of waiting are over and he has come. But not a single educated person was conv erted by Jesus. He could manage only with fishermen and woodcutter, uneducated, illiterate people. It was a kind of"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"bribery and exploitation because he prom ised them: If you believe in me I am going to take you to paradise. Naturally those fishermen, woodcutters have never thought that they would ever be able to make -- rabbis, great scholars, saints, prophets, they will enter into paradis e -- and this guy is saying that if we just believe in him, we will be the first to enter. So what is the problem, we are not losing anything. he says simply believe in me, so we will believe. But no intelligent person can do that. In my people you will find just the opposite. My commune must be the only place in the whole world with so much education -- almost everybody is a graduate from some university. Most of them have masters degrees, few have PhD degrees , few are D.Litts. They come from all professions -- they are not fishermen and farmers. They people who have left me -- for example, Deeksha; she is illiterate, she would have fitted with Jesus perfectly well, but not with me. She could not understand me. She was a good cook, but being a good cook you don't become enlightened. Shiva -- what intelligence he ha s got? If it took him ten years sitting by my side -- he was always sitting by my side -- if it took him ten years to discover that I am a dish onest man... then do you think I have to answer anything? Q: LET ME GO INTO THE NEXT QUESTION, IF I MAY. A: Go anywhere! Q: THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRIES DESPERATELY TO DEPORT YOU. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO RAJNEESHPUR AM IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO? A: No, I never think of tomorrow. I am here right now, and we are enjoying! And for four years they have been trying desp erately top deport me. If in four years they could not find a single reason to deport me, I don't think in forty years they are going to find it. Four years is (are) enough against a sing le individual; and a whole department is continuously working. Their people are going around the world to find something so I can be deported. They will fi nd that this is the most difficult case that has come to them. I am going to fight up to the Supreme Court. Q: BUT YOU HAVE SAID DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT YOU WOULD GO TO AUSTRALIA. A: That was just to visit. And if I love it there, then the same problem will be in Australia. Wherever I am the problem is going to be the same, so I don't care"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"about it whether the INS in America is tr ying to deport me, or INS in Australia trying to deport me. What difference does it make to me? Q: BUT IT WOULD MAKE DIFFERENCE TO RAJNEESHPURAM, WOULDN'T IT? A: Nobody can destroy Rajneeshpuram. If they succeed -- in the first place they cannot succeed, because I have applied on five grounds. They have only six ground. I can do the sixth, too. They ha ve six grounds for application. For five grounds I am capable. They cannot deny on any grounds. Sixth is marriage -- I can do that, too. With as many women as they want! So it is just out of (the) question. They cannot deport me, they simply will get crazy and cracks and retired, and I am going to be here. And if -- just for the argument's sake -- if I decide to go, they cannot deport me, but if I decide to go, they cannot stop me, either. Let them know it. They are absolutely impotent either way. If I deci de to go, they cannot prevent me. And If I go, that does not mean that the co mmune will be in any way harmed or wounded. I have prepared my people that without me they can exist as beautifully as they are existing with me. Because I have not taken any responsibility. You should see the point: I have not taken any responsi bility. I am not responsible for anything in the commune. I am just a guest. I am not even a member of the commune, I am not a sannyasin. I don't have any responsibility that they will miss me. I don't do anything; in fact, they have to do everything for me. If I am gone, they should really rejoice, and my being here is a constant trouble for them. Once I am gone from here, nobody is going to bother them. And I have my communes all around the world -- without me they are running exactly the same way, so there is no problem at all. INS or American government, or any government cannot cr eate any problem for me. I can create thousand and one problems for them. The moment I decide to create problems, they will be at a loss to find how to tackle with me. Up to now, I have not created any problem. Q: WHAT PROBLEMS WOULD YOU CREATE, FOR EXAMPLE? A: I can create any problem. For example, I can go to the Supreme Court that the whole American government is functioning against (the) American constitution. And I stand for (the) American constitution, and the whole American government is against it. And I have gr ounds to fight how they are exploiting and deceiving people. The state government of Oregon is doin g the same. They accepted this city, incorporated it, everything was done according to the constitution. For two years the city was legal. We were getting th e support of the state, the federal"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"government support to the city -- and after two years, suddenly the city became illegal. Then who is responsible? All those peop le who make this city legal should be immediately arrested and imprisoned. The go vernor is part in it. The attorney general is part in it. What these id iots were doing for two years? They were giving state support, money, everything to the city. What the federal government was doing? They were giving money to the city. And idiots can go in such a berserk way about everything, that I don't think they have given much. (To Sheela, off mike:) How many dollars from the federal government have we received? SHEELA: ABOUT $32,000 LAST YEAR FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, I THINK IT'S ABOUT THAT MUCH. Bhagwan: That is nothing. I cannot even purchase one-third of a Rolls Royce. And these idiots are now asking the mo ney back! In the first place they did wrong. They gave that money to a city which was not legal. They are responsible for it. In the second place, they have guts to ask the money back. From whom? The city does not exist. You gave money to a non-existent city, so go and ask the holy ghost if he knows anything about it! Q: THE PRINCE OF HANOVER WAS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE SANNYASINS. HE WAS VERY ILL, AND THERE IS A RUMOR THAT YOU ASKED TO CUT THE OXYGEN TO SH ORTEN HIS SUFFERING. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE TO DIE IN INDIVIDUAL CASES? A: That rumor is absolutely wrong. Do you think if the rumo r had any evidence then the royal family of Germany would ha ve remained silent? And the father of the Prince, the mother of the Prince wer e present at the funeral in India. The brother of the Prince was there, the wife of the Prince was there, the daughter of the Prince was there. If the rumor has any validity, then the Prince of Hanover, his sannyas name was Vimalkirti. He was related to almost all the royalties of Europe. Prince of Wales is his cousin-brother. His mother is Prin cess of Greece. First she had married the Prince of Denmark, and then she divorced him and married Vimalkirti's father. His mother's sister is a queen -- perhaps in Spain or somewhere. All these royalties against a poor man like me? Could not do anything if the rumor had any evidence in it? Just their bein g silent is enough proof that all this is nonsense. So as far as Vimalkirti's death is concerned, the rumor is simply a rumor. So please don't get confused about my idea, my approach about the death of an individual. My way of life accepts that ev ery individual has the birthright to et"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"out of life if he wants. De ath is not something that should be in the control of government, law. It is an individual freedom. If I don't want to live in this body anymore, nobody can prevent me. And in fact, even though all the govern ments and all the legal systems are against it, suicide goes on happening every day. And it is such a amusing phenomenon, that if a person is caught redhanded committing suicide, then he is sentenced to death. Because he was trying to commit suicide! What kind if lawmakers we have? He was trying to commit suicide, now you are making arrangements for his death. He should have come in the first place to you -- that I am going to commit suicide, please kill me. Why I should unnecessarily take the risk of falling from a tree, getting broken legs, hanging myself from the ceiling, feeling suffocated, but not dying, jumping into a river -- but be cause I know swimming, getting out of it? Why should I, or anybody should take all these difficulties. So as far as philosophical opinion is concerned, I am for individual's total freedom -- death included. And it is th e duty of the community to provide him beautiful facilities for death. Why one shou ld wait for old age and the troubles of old age, the degradation of old age, th e rejection of the young people, the old person feeling constantly an unnecessa ry thing in the house, a burden to everybody? He is not capable to do anything for them, and they have to do everything for them. All his companions are dead, his friends are dead. He goes to the same park where he used to go and sit with his friends -- now he sits alone on the bench, nobody comes near him. Most ly he is sick in the bed. And if that person wants then it is simply ludicrous just to wait for death to come. And this death is going to be terrible, because he will be old, sick and he will die by and by, inch by inch, and we have now every scientific way to send him joyously into deep sleep forever. If you and your society cannot give a man a beautiful life, at least you can arrange for him a beautiful death. And if he wants, it is his birthright. And anyway, anyone who wants to go out of life will find the way, so why unnecessarily create a legal system against? He will find a way. The people who fail in committing suicide are really pe ople who are hesitant -- 50/50. In fact, they have a split mind. One part says it is good to get out of life, another part shrinks back and feels afraid. This inner conflict is the cause of their failure. Otherwise, I don't see that there is any way to prevent me from dying. There are so many million possibilities all around. So you cannot prevent, and you think the penalty has to be an electric chair? Why you could not provide that beautiful electric chair before? The man would have said goodbye to his friends, enjoyed the best meal that he always wanted to, but because of sickness and old age and diabetes, he was not allowed. He can have beautiful ice cream, now there is no problem. He is going to the electric chair, he can have champagne. One day of absolute freedom because there is no tomorrow anymore. So he need not worry about his blood sugar going high, his blood pressure going high, or he is getting drunk and doing something stupid."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Who cares now? At least one day give hi m total freedom and let him die. Help.... Your medical hospitals, all the hospital s in the world should have a beautiful place for those who want to die. He can be taught even on the last day ho w to be silent, how to relax, so when you are given the injection which will ta ke you deep and deep into sleep, you don't fight it. Otherwise, you will be in suffering. This can be simply explained. He can practice beforehand, do a little rehearsal. And I am ready to provide to every hospital one of my sannyasins to teach meditation. And his room for death should be a temple, beautiful, with flo wers and with everythin g. He should go from this earth like a king. Just resting, relaxing and going forever into deep sleep. When we can manage it, I don't think we sh ould prevent it. And, anyway, it is going to help world population prob lem immensely because 1,000 people are dying every day in Ethiopia. Out of hunger when one dies, it is real torture. Out of thirst one dies, it is a torture of days together. Why not they should be given injections which is simple, so they can relax and die and be reborn in America ? Because they all want, all over the world, the poor peop le think America is the paradise on the earth. So if they died with the idea of being born in America, great; let them die with the idea, and let them be born there. I am perfectly in favor of freedom, and de ath is only one part of my whole idea of freedom. Q: HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR DAY? A: Have I to spend it? Q: HOW DO YOU SPEND IT? A: No, I am asking you -- have I to spen d it? I live it! Spending is not a right word. Life is not money, you don't spend it. Otherwise, one day you may go bankrupt. No, I live it and I live it intensely. Each moment of my life is a blessing. Whatever I am doing, I do it to the very climax. I don't believe in Gautam Buddha and his middle path. Gautam Buddha was teaching the middle path, I teach the extreme. If you are enjoying, what will be the middle path? 50/50? 50 percent en joying, 50 percent in despair. When I am taking my bath, I enjoy it as much as I have enjo yed my enlightenment, not in any way different. And one and half hour in the morning, on e and half hour in the evening -- three hours I am in the bathroom.

INDIAN OFFICIALS SAID TWO YEARS AGO ACCORDING TO SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS HERE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION DOES NOT RESEMBLE A RELIGION. DOES THIS HURT YOU PERSONALLY, OR DO YOU FEEL ANY REMORSE ABOUT THIS? A: No. There is no problem. In fact, that is what I am saying -- that my people don't resemble any people who have ever lived on the earth. They don't resemble any old religion. Neither do we want to be categorized with those insane theologies. It is a to tally new phenomenon. Q: YOU SAID ONCE THAT YOUR RELI GION WILL DIE WITH YOU. WILL YOU NOT ASK ANYBODY TO CONTINUE FOR YOU -- PERHAPS SHEELA, PERHAPS ANOTHER PERSON, LAXMI, OR AN ORGANIZATION FOR YOU? A: Nobody. It is up to them whatever they want to do when I am gone. Do you see the politics in the whole idea of succe ssors? That even when I am gone I will control through Sheela the commune. Because I have trained Sheela I can trust her, and she will remain in control. Then she prepares somebody else. And in a subtle way, though I am dead, I am cont rolling the living people. No, I cannot be so inhuman. While I am here, rejoic e with me. When I am gone, you are intelligent enough, whatever you want to do, do. I am not going to declare anybody as my successor, and I am not going to say to my people what you have to do when I am gone. Just look at it from the other side: Peopl e only see one side always they ask me \"When you are gone,\" but you don't ask me when I am gone, you are gone as far as I am concerned. The world is dead. The moment I am dead, for me the whole world is dead. Now who bothers about a de ad world? It is not one-sided death, that I am only dying. I am disappearing to you, you are disappearing to me. It is equal, equal death on both the sides. And I have no desire to control. I don't control even while I am living. But thes e people, for example, John the Baptist, baptizes Jesus, initiates him as his successo r. This is a subtle strategy. Then Jesus appoints these twelve apostles as his me ssengers.

Q: IN AN INTERVIEW WITH AN A MERICAN NEWSPAPER, YOUR FORMER RANCH MANAGER BOB HARVEY, SAID THAT HE RESTORED SEVERAL MINES ON YOUR REQUEST ON THE GROUNDS OF THE RANCH -- THE OUINNS* MINE, FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT IS IN THESE MINES? AND IS IT CORRECT WHAT SANNYASIN DHYAN JOHN SAID THAT YOU; HAVE BUILT A KALI TEMPLE? A: That is absolutely wrong. Because in those three and half years while this man Bob Harvey was here, I was silent. I spoke only to Sheela. I never instructed him. That's absolutely wrong; I was not spea king. And it is true that there is a possibility of mines on the land, it is 126 square miles of land. It comes in the range which directly comes from Canada and moves through this property. Every possibility -- it may have oil, it ma y have gold, it may have silver, it may have copper; but we are not going to open those mines for the simple reason that we love our people so much that we don' t want any hazard for our life. If you start working on a gold mine, you have to use chemicals which finally pollute all your water -- poisonous. In fact, one ranch just ahead of us has also gold mines. They were going to open them and we had to go to the court because their water moves into our ranch. We will not allow our water to be polluted, and we have stopped them. So there is no question of our people digging up all the metals or oil or whatsoever is available in the land. And legally ten feet of the earth is ours, and unless we allow anybody to penetrate th ose ten feet, nobody -- not even the American government -- can dig the gold underneath. And we know how to be rich, how to be wealthy. Who cares about the gold? Let it lie down."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"And this man is absolutely lying that I had instructed. I have never talked with him. He had no business with me; he was a servant. He used to take care of this land before we came here.

But that man chea ted the commune. he was getting one thousand dollars per month from his owners. Our sannyasins are innocent people -- the accountant... he started goin g to the accountant every week to get $1000. Just a misunderstanding, the accounta nt thought perhaps he is salaried $1000 per week. Now, $4000 per month for a se rvant! Even a poor man like me cannot afford. And what qualifications he had for $4000? Even a vice-chancellor of a university does not get that much. Th e chief justice of the supreme court in Oregon does not get that much. He had no qualification, nothing -- just an ordinary servant. I had never given hi m any instructions. And because we are not interested at all in the mines, I don't think anybody else has given him instructions to find out. Because we are not interested at all. So many people have approached that they know there are mines here and they are researchers and they would like to research. We have refused them point blank. We don't want any research on our ground, because basically we don't want to create mines here. Q: SWAMI PREM LEELADHAR WAS INTRODUCED IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES AS A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO SP ECIALIZES IN SEX CHANGES. DO YOU PERFORM SEX CHANGES ON THE RANCH HERE? A: If somebody wants, it is part of their freedom. If somebody wants to change his sex, I think there is nothing immoral in it. You have lived as a man: you know what being a man is, and naturally every ma n is curious about women. In fact, it is said that nobody has yet been able to find the mystery of the woman. This is a perfectly good way -- change your sex an d be a woman, and find the mystery. There is no mystery. (Laughter.) But if you can live in one life both the si des of the coin, why not? I don't see any problem in it. The sex change is such a simple thing. The difference between men and women is so mall, almost negligible. It is just like if you pull your pocket out it becomes man; you put the pocket back , it becomes woman. And Leeladhar is really a great plastic surgeon, one of the best. I only believe in the best. So if anybody wants... Q: THERE ARE CONSISTENT RUMORS THAT THERE IS A HUGE ARMS CACHE IN RAJNEESHPURAM. I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN SUCH A PEACEFUL PLACE BEFORE -- I MEA N PEOPLE HUGGING EACH OTHER ON THE STREET, SMILING AT EACH OTHER, WAVING AT EACH OTHER -- WHY WOULD YOU NEED SO MANY WEAPONS? "},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"A: There are not so many weapons. We ha ve a police force which is part of Oregon state. And for the police force, all the weapons and everything, the Oregon state is responsible, not we. We have a commune security force because I have been attacked many times, attempts on my life have been made, the last time in India when a knife was thro wn at me, there were 10,000 sannyasins present. It was in a morning discour se. And because the police got some information ahead of time, 20 police offi cers had reached almost few minutes before the man threw the knife. So 20 police officers were eyewitnesses, 10,000 sannyasins were eye witnesses, and yet the court freed that man without any punishment. Because the politicians wa nted him to be freed, because the religious leaders wanted him to be freed. There is so much hostility in Oregon, it is not a problem to me. In fact, I created it. But my people are concerned about me, and if somebody comes to assassinate me, I will not hinder him. That is hi s freedom, I will not interfere with it, although he is interfering with my life, bu t even at the risk of my life, I will not interfere into his freedom. But my peop le -- why should I interfere in their freedom to protect me. So those few gu ards are here. And what a strange thing that in a world which has gone nuclear -- just those toy guns -- do you think we are going to attack America or Soviet Union? Q: YOU DECLARED DEATH AS THE BIGGEST ORGASM OF ALL TIMES ONCE. DO YOU WANT TO LEAD YOUR DISCIPLES INTO THIS SUPER ORGASM, OR DO YOU FEAR A NOTHER JONESTOWN AMONG THEM? A: No. This is the only place where Jo nestown cannot happen. it can happen in the Vatican, it can happen in any Christian context. Yo u should be aware of few things: Both the world wars happened in a Christ ian context. Christianity for centuries has killed millions of people -- burned pe ople alive -- it is a death-oriented religion, in the service of death. Poor Reverend Jones was simply doing the best he could. This is the only place where Jonestown cannot happen, because there is nobody who is a \"reverend\" here. As far as my idea about death is concerned, if a man can go meditatively into death, then death is the greatest orgasm you can feel. Because death is the separation of body and soul; it is just like when the physicist breaks the atom, there is such a great explosion. Just a single atom, which is not visible to the eyes, can destroy Hiroshima, Nagasaki. When man's body and his soul separate, if the man is alert and aware in that moment, he will see a tremendous explos ion of joy, light, eternity, truth -- whatever you want to call it. But most pe ople die unconsciously. Before death, they become unconscious, so they never come to know it. My people are learning meditation. There is no need for them to be especially prepared for death. I am"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"preparing them for life, and in that very preparation, they are getting ready for death. Any time they will have to die. Q: IF I MIGHT INTERRUPT YOU, IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY THAT IF SEPARATION BETWEEN BODY AND SOUL IS SUCH A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE, WOULDN'T IT BE DESIRABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT? A: No. Because before that you have to learn how to be alert and meditative; otherwise, you won't get anything, no orgasmic experience. Because the experiencer will be in a coma. The whole life is a preparation for death, and you should be able to be so conscious in lif e that when you are making love, there are not only two persons, but four person s. Two persons making love, and two consciousnesses watching, witnessing. Or you are walking on the road, you have to walk with watchfulness, alertness, so that you can see your own body walking. The whole life you have to prepare; then on ly in death you may be able to retain consciousness. So it is not just se parating the body and soul; otherwise everybody who is given electric chair will enjoy an orgasm. Then Jesus being crucified would have enjoyed an orgasm . Then all those Jews -- one million -- whom Hitler put into gas chambers. He di d really great religious work: gave one million people spiritual orgasmic experi ences, and still these Jews are against him. No, just death won't do. Between death and you there must be fu ll consciousness. Then only it can become an orgasmic experience. The wh ole life you need to prepare, and then death is the climax of life. Then it is not the end of life, but the climax of life. The whole perspective changes. Q: YOU SAID THAT EVERYBODY WH O WILL DIE IN A TWENTY-FOUR MILES RADIUS OF RAJNEESHP URAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY ENLIGHTENED. WHY IS THAT SO? A: That is true. Not everybody. There you are wrong. Only a sannyasin. Not Oregonians. Only a sannyasin dying within a t wenty-five mile radius will become enlightened. And this is not something n ew. It has been known in the East for thousands of years. Gautam Buddha had sa id exactly the same. He said within twelve cosas radius, any bikkhu that is his sannyasin dying will become enlightened. I was puzzled myself that how, what mechanism works? Twelve cosas are approximately twenty-five miles; but th en I saw few sannyasins dying around me and becoming enlightened, their death was not death. I could see it."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"When Vimalkirti died, we celebrated his death as it is celebrated for an enlightened man. You could have seen on his face the joy, the marks of that orgasmic experience through which he ha d gone. He was still radiant. The body was still somehow carrying the stamp of the experience. And then, many sannyasins in these fifteen years have died. Then slowly, slowly I became aware wh y it happens. I am continuously in contact with my people. They love me so immensely that it is not a question of believing in me -- it is a simple uncond itional love. So whenever a sannyasin will be dying, these twenty-five miles are some thing like an existential law, like the law of gravitation or the law of water evaporating at 100 degrees. Nobody asks why. And the scientist has no answer, he can say only that that's ho w it is. Never at 99 degrees; never at 101 degrees. Exactly at 100 degrees the water evaporates. But why the water has chosen 100 degrees? It is simply a law. These twenty-five miles, Buddha has recorded; these twenty-five miles, Mahavira has recorded, another founder of a great religion, Jainism, a contemporary of Buddha. And I have experi enced it, and now I can feel that the energy of a commune if it is a single en lightened person, then the radius will be only five miles at the most. But if it is a commune of thousands of sannyasins, the radius becomes twenty-five miles. Why? Nothing can be said about it. That's how it happens. And I don't know if the commune beco mes bigger and still bigger, perhaps the radius will become greater. I hope one day here you will see 100,000 sannyasins, and then I want to see how big the radius can be. Can we cover the whole America? Our effort will be to cover th e whole world. We have communes all over the world which will soon have the same effect. Jus t they need one enlightened person amongst them, and then all other sannyasins become kind of radiating, reflecting the energy field further and further away. And when a sannyasin dies in this loving energy field, it is easier for him to be awake than otherwise. It is just like if you are sitting amon gst a few people who are yawning and dozing, soon you will find yourself yawning and dozing. And you will be surprized -- why you are doing it? Those people are creating a certain vibe. If you sit with people who are bore d to death, soon you will feel a certain boredom entering in you. You may have experienced sometimes to be with someone, you feel as if you are nourished. And with someone else, you find as if you have been sucked. These are very simple experiences everyb ody knows that with a certain person you gain energy, with a certain person you lose energy. People avoid these people because they are parasites. The en lightened person has an energy field of five miles, alone; but if he has a commune around him, then at least twenty-five miles radius is ready to wake any sannyasin dying within it. Why it works, there is no way to say. It is just the same as ot her scientific laws -- it is also a scientific law."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":" Q: YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT AN D SECRETARY, SHEELA, HAS MADE TREMENDOUS WAVES HERE AND IN AUSTRALIA RECENTLY ON TELEVISION AND PRESS INTERVIEWS AND IN THOSE WAVES CREATED, YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY BAD PRE SS -- THE ORGANIZATION, YOU DID.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH KGO TV, SA N FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA QUESTION:* WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE A REPORTER LEARN HERE? A:* One thing and only one thing: that this is the alternative to your world. Your world is on the verge of death. The polit icians have brought the nuclear weapons to create the funeral of the whole humani ty. And the religious leaders, insisting on celibacy, have brought humanity to the ultimate disease -- AIDS. And the politicians and the priests both ar e bent upon to destroy the world. We are creating a totally new kind of man, with new values. And these communes are around the world now -- one million sannyasins, and we provide the alternative to your mad world. Q:* HOW IS THAT ACCOMPLISHED? A:* First the sannyasins only requirement is to be a meditator. And meditation means going into yourself, to the deepest core of your being, where absolute silence, serenity, peace, bliss are expe rienced. And once a person experiences those values then all ambitions about beco ming a president of a country, or the prime minister, or becoming famous, a ce lebrity, all ambitions disappear. And if we can create millions of people who have no ambitions, that is the only way to prevent war. War is the culmination of ambitions. And the peaceful man, the silent man wh o has touched his own source of being, is no more Christian, no more Hi ndu, no more Mohammedan, no more Buddhist, no more American, no more Russian, no more German, no more Italian, he is simply a human being, and the whole earth is his home. If we can destroy those ugly lines on th e map which divide humanity -- there is no reason for war: one thing. Second, if we can create such serenity and joy in people's lives all their perversions; homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, group sexuality, which all have culminated finally into AIDS, will disappear. Because we are creating such a contented man who needs no one to fulfill him. He is alone enough.

OR AT LEAST WOULD VOICE AN AGREEMENT WITH IT. A:* They would not. There is no question of suspicion. I am ce rtain they will not listen. They will fight back. They will be hostile towards me. They are. But that makes no difference. I am not a serious man. If the world is going to go we will do whatever we can do, but our work is playfulness. We are not saviors and we are not here to save anybody. That is just by the way. Otherwise we are celebrants not saviors. We enjoy an d we are enjoying, and who cares for tomorrow?

THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS PLACE SPEAKS OF ACCIDENT. EVERYTHING SPEAKS OF PURPOSE AND INTENTION. A:* That's the beauty of being playful, and yet not becoming accidental. Being nonserious, laughing, enjoying, dancing an d yet doing everything that is needs. There is no contradiction. That's why I say we are creating a new man in which this contradiction melts, becomes complimentary. We are certain that those idiots are no t going to hear.

WHAT DID YOU STUDY? WAS IT ANOTHER GAME? WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU USED FOR PREPARATION? A:* No preparation I have done for anything, ever. I have loved reading from my very childhood. My own personal library consisted of one hundred fifty thousa nd rare books of all the religions, philosophies, poetry, literature. And I have read all of them, but with no purpose; I enjoyed it.

In fact, I would like you to go with me a little more back. When I was a student, my professors felt that I am more prepared than them -- and I was. But I was not prepared. They had stopped thirty years before when they left the university and became professors. And I have read everything th at has happened in these thirty years. They were thirty years behind me. I wa s expelled from many colleges for the simple reason that many of the professors could not stand me. Understanding is out of the question, even they could not stand me. Finally I was admitted in a college with a condition that I will never attend a class. But I ask the principal how I am go ing to enter into the examination. Class is no problem, that is great freedom, g ood, but how I am going to enter into the examination? The principle said, that \"That is my problem. I will give you enough attendance to enter into examin ation. But it is a promise between you and me that you will not come into the college at all.\" And for two years I never entered that co llege, and I got into the examination, and I got the gold medal, I topped the whole university and the principal was amazed.

I have never listened to your lecturers, but I have such a love to read everything, and to go to the very depth of, to the very roots of everything. In my reading there was no purpose, just joy. I relished it. For nine years I have been a lecturer in the university after th at. That too, was a gr eat joy. I relished, but the students were in a trouble. The un iversity was in a trouble, because I will teach Aristotle, and I will also say that he is absolutely wrong. So first I will finish the course, and then I will destro y the whole that I have been teaching them. And they were in a great confusion then what is right. I said, \"Now, it is up to you.

If you become serious about it, enjoyment disappears, it becomes work, hard work. I have never worked, I'm a lazy man. I call myself a lazy man's guide to enlightenment. I don't do anything.

Those who hate me, they go on doing their things and I cannot hinder them. I have been poisoned. I have been in every way put in a dangerous situation.

A:* No. That is not true, because for th irty-two years I have been absolutely nothing. So it may be objectively true as far as science is concerned, that nature abhors vacuum, but as far as spiritual inte rior world is concerned, it is just the opposite. The deeper you go, the more you find yourself empty. Ultimately, you find yourself just a zero, and that is the point of enlightenment. Your ego has disappeared,your greed has far away disappeared. You have disappeared, there is only light, life, infinite, eternal, but you are not there as a person, but just a pure consciousness, and it is nothingne ss. Buddha has actually given it the name nothingness -- nirvana; that* means nothingness. In the western world, no religion has reached to that point -- all the western religions -- the three: Christian, Jud aic tradition and Mohammedanism, which are born out of India. The other three religions which are born in India: Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism -- all th ree have reached to the point where you enter into an inner zero. And that is th eir ultimate goal: to be nothing, and it is never filled by anything. Q:* YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEA RN THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THAT. A:* You will not, and I am not surpri sed, because how can you understand something that you never have experien ced. For example, if you have never tasted sugar, whatever I do, there is no way to explain you the taste of it. I will have to ask my sannyasins to hold you and force a spoonful of sugar into your mouth -- the only way. Looks a little h ard, but what can be done? Unless you taste it you will not understand it. So if you really want to understand what I am saying about inner nothingness come here , be here for few days. Meditate with my people who have experienced it. Just being close with them, some kind of synchronicity happens. If there are a dozen people who are deep in meditation, you simply sit in the middle of those people and try whatsoever they say, just sit down and watch your thoughts and do nothing. But thos e twelve people are radiating something towards you, and your effort together will give you the taste. If I have given the taste to thousands of people, you cannot be exceptional, nobody is. Everybody has the same spiritual potential. "},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Q:* I AGREE WITH YOU. A:* Okay, and you will remember your qu estions, otherwise your questions will remain unanswered.

I have not brought any answer, so whatsoever you ask I will answe r. It is going to be immediate, but to me it makes no difference what you ask. Q:* I'M AWARE OF THAT.

IS THIS PLACE ANOTHER WHATEVER?\" BUT THEY ARE CLEAR SIMILARITI ES, AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE SOME SHARED KNOWLEDGE. A:* There are bound to be some similari ties, because we are not the only human beings. Outside also there are human beings, so there are bound to be some similarities. I have two eyes, you have tw o eyes, but that does not mean that our basic attitude is the same. For example, you mentioned Reverend Jim Jonestown. Q:* I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE THE SAME. I'M OBSERVING THAT A LO T OF THE TECHNIQUES ARE. A:* No. Neither our intentions are the same nor is there any possibility of such a thing to happen here. Reverend Jim Jone s and his Jonestown can happen only in a Christian context. Q:* HE WAS A MARXIST. A:* Marxism is a Christian product. Q:* HE FORSOOK RELIGION AS HE DEFINED IT, AND I REMEMBER A SERMON HE PREACHED ONE DAY WH ERE HE THREW THE BIBLE ON THE FLOOR AND STOMPED UP AND DOWN ON IT AND SAID, \"THAT'S ALL"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"BULLSHIT,\" AND WENT ON TO TELL HIS FOLLOWERS IF THEY FOLLOWED HIM TO GUYANA* THAT EVENTUALLY THEY COULD GO TO THE SOVIET UNION AND THAT R ELIGION WAS TO BE FORSAKEN. PERHAPS PHILOSOPHICALLY YOU COULD CONNECT THE TWO, MARXISM AND CHRISTIANITY, BUT ON THE LEVEL THAT MOST PEOPLE DEAL AND WILL UNDERSTAND, THEY AREN'T RELATED. A:* They are related. Q:* BUT ISN'T IT MISLEADING TO REFER TO A MAN WHO DEFINES HIMSELF AS A MARXIST AS BEING A CHRISTIAN? A:* Certainly, because he still remains the Reverend Jim Jones. Reverend is a Christian title... not a Marxist title. You don't refer Reverend Joseph Stalin. And as far as Marxism is concerned, it is si mply a reaction to Christianity. Remember that Jesus and Marx both were Jews, neve r forget that. And both were trying to change the Jewish tradition -- Jesus in his own way, Marx in his own way. Because Jesus has failed on certain points: the only begotten son of God, the existence of God, heaven and hell, Marx si mply denied. There is no God, there is no question of any begotten son of God, th ere is no heaven and hell. In fact, there is no consciousness in man, it is on ly a by-product of material things. It was really Jesus in a new edition in which all those points have been deleted which brought Jesus to the crucifixion -- only those points are. Otherwise, just as Jesus is concerned with the poor and says , \"Blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of God,\" Marx is not different. He says, \"Proletariat of the world unite, because you have nothing to lose and ever ything to gain.\" The only difference is that Jesus was talking about a fictitious kingdom far away in the heavens, and Marx was a more pragmatic and practica l man -- he was talking that, \"We can create that paradise here -- all that is n eeded is: destroy classes, make a classless society.\" But both were in favor of the poor, both were against the rich. Jesus says, \"A camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but not a rich man can pass through the gates of his god.\" Now this man seems to be the first communist! What do you expect of a co mmunist? Even Marx has not such a strong statement against the rich. In fact he was living on the money provided by a rich man, Friedrich Engels; whole lif e he never earned anything. Friedrich Engels was an industrialist, a rich man, and he supplied all his needs, his whole life. He could not say that Engels cannot en ter into the kingdom of God; without Engels, Marx himself will not find a way into kingdom of God. Jesus raises the poor to the highest level. He praises them and that's what Marx was doing in a more scientific way. Jesu s was too young. He was crucified when he was thirty-three, uneducated, knowin g nothing -- he was just a carpenter's son. Maybe he knew something about w ood, but about God he knew nothing."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Karl Marx is just another Jew, against the Jewish tradition, the richness of the Jews, their immense intelligence to create wealth -- Marx was poor, just as Jesus was poor. And you must remember that M arx's father was a reverend, so he was brought up in the context of Christiani ty. His father was converted -- he was a Christian -- and he was teaching Chri stianity to his child ren too. And whole communism is just a reaction against the Jewish wealth, their capacity to create wealth. This man, Reverent Jim Jones, is doin g exactly what Jesus was doing. He was saying to people that, \"You just follow me, believe in me, and you will enter into my kingdom of God.\" The only condition wa s, \"Believe in me!\" And that was the condition of Reverend Jones, \"Believe in me, and I will lead you to the kingdom of God.\" His kingdom of God may have been Sovietland -- that does not matter -- but he was the leader and you were the led; he knew what and where they are going -- you need not bother about it, need not even question about it. Secondly, Jesus said to his disciples, \"I will come back. First I will prepare the ground for you in the kingdom of God an d then I will come back to take you.\" Reverend Jim Jones were far more intelligent than Jesus: why go and prepare; why not take the whole lot with you? This is the only place where Jonestow n cannot happen. It can happen anywhere within Christian context; it cannot ha ppen in India, you cannot conceive. In Hindu concept you cannot conceive. Q:* OF WHAT? -- SUICIDE. THOUGH NOT ALL WHAT HAPPENS THERE WAS SUICIDE. A:* Jonestown -- Jonestown you cannot conceive under Hindu or Buddhist or Jaina or Tao traditions -- impossible, for the simple reason that Krishna, who is the God of the Hindus is a lover of life. He has sixteen thousand wives. Do you think such a man will...? Q:* COMMIT SUICIDE? YES, FRANKLY. A:* No! Suicide is committed by people wh o have only one wife. Having sixteen thousand wives, one is already living in paradise! What more you can want?

Q:* IN THE TECHNIQUE OF ATTRACTING, WORKING WITH PEOPLE. A:* What technique? Q:* THE TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION -- NOT PRECISELY THE SAME (TAPE INAUDIBLE) A:* Reverend Jim Jones.... Or even Jesus, has never heard what meditation is. They knew only prayer and prayer is not meditation. You are finding difficulty now to... show the similarities. Meditation you mentioned, which cannot exist in Jonestown. Q:* THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION. A:* No. There is no control. There is no control about anything. People are absolutely free to be here or not to be here. I DON'T SEEK A TRICK HERE AND I DON'T SEEK A FALSE COMPARISON, SO.... A:* No. I understand. I understand your intention. Just see one thing: in Jonestown, the major following was Bl ack people, in this place the major following is White people. In Jonestown the people were all illiterate, uneducated... except for few. Here everybody is educated, most of them are graduates of universities, most of them has Masters' degrees, few have Ph.D.'s, few are D.Litt's. Not even few are uneduc ated. The uneducated, the illiterate, the poor, the Black -- these are the people wh o are very gullible, these are the people who are victims of all kinds of systems of belief.

They were not going to be part of the commune and we were not interested in transforming them. Just whenever we have surplus mone y, and our people are so productive all around the world, that whenever we have some surplus money, we would like to share it with different groups. Th at was just the our first experiment to share it with the street people and to give them the same dignity as any other human being needs: give them the same love, the same equality, the same"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"clothes, the same food, the same air-cond itioned housing -- a taste of what they are missing on the streets. Never again we are going to invite them , because we have other projects, far more dangerous. In the next month we are going to have another project which is going to shake the whole America. Q:* I TAKE IT FROM THE FACT YO U DIDN'T VOLUNTEER TO TELL ME WHAT IS, THERE'S NO POINT IN ASKING. A:* There is no point in asking, because I would like to keep people in curiosity, suspense. Q:* A SANNYASIN ONCE TOLD ME DU RING THE PERIOD OF YOUR SILENCE THAT YOU WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK AGAIN WHEN AN ECONOMIC NEED AROSE. A:* That's wrong. We have never faced any economic need, otherwise my Rolls Royces will not be go on growing. One has come just now, one is coming within the next week, and one I am informed, my people are specially making: an old model of Rolls Royce, Phantom. It is going to cost four-hundred-thous and dollars. Ordinary Rolls Royce costs only one hundred thousand dollars; it will take one and half year to be made, but it will be the most unique Rolls Royce in the whole world. So we are not out of economy. There is no question, for me to speak because my commune was not going well. My commune is going so well that nothin g else in the whole world is going so well! Five thousand people are here. They all have the best standard of food, the best housing, the whole commune is ce ntrally air-conditioned, they have hundreds of cars, hundreds of busses, they have five planes, and we are not expanding, because the legality of the ci ty is under litigation, so they have prevented us to expand. Otherwise I wa s going to bring one hundred thousand sannyasins here and I will bring. Th e litigation we are going to win. In a democratic country nobody can defeat me. Q:* WHERE COULD A MAN LIKE YOU BE DEFEATED? A:* Only in the Soviet Union, never, no other place. They are afraid in Soviet Union. Already my books are banned. I have sannyasins underground in Soviet Union, they are being persecuted, already, but because of the government persecution, there is great excitement to become sannyasins. For the first time, against communism, there is a new mo vement. And the new generation needs something new. Communism is already ou t of date. Marx's books, who reads? No communist, nobody bothers -- it is just old testament. So that is the only place"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"where I may be defeated, but not in America. If I am defeated in America then America is not different from Soviet Union; then it is a bogus democracy, hypocrite. Q:* DO YOU SAY THAT IN CONFIDENCE OF YOUR BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME OF DEMOCRACY BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE... A:* Certainly. Q:*... SO THAT IF YOU CAN'T WIN THEN THE GAME IS WRONG? A:* I know the constitution of America and I am going to stand for it against the Americans, because the American government, the state governments are all violating the basic rights given to human beings in the constitution. I can play the game. I can play the game in Soviet Union also, if the need arises, because I don't think anybody has read communist literature more than I have read. I can play the game, but first I have to try America. Q:* WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PE OPLE WHO STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY HERE? A:* This reason is clear: psychology is the latest development of intelligence, the latest science. And they can understand me more than anybody else. They are the most intelligent people. Q:* CAN THEY TEACH BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE? A:* That is not certain. To be a psychologist is one thing; to be a teacher is totally different art. We have so many psychologists here that many Ph.D.'s are farming, many Ph.D.'s are creating dams, many Ph.D.' s are looking after my peacocks.... Few perhaps are functioning as psychologists, psychiatrists, in the medical center. If somebody needs any help, if somebody is schizophrenic.... Q:* WHAT ABOUT IN THE MEDITATION COURSES AND IN THE UNIVERSITY? A:* Meditation is beyond psychology. It is not psychology. It has nothing to do with brain, it has nothing to do with the mind either. It is a state of no-mind. Even Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung and Alfred Adler, had no idea of meditation, what it is. They all thought in terms of concentration. Concentration has nothing to do with meditation. Concentration is a method of the mind and meditation is a way how to transcend th e mind, how to go above the mind -- so"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"you are on the top of the hills and all yo ur thoughts are just in the valley -- and you can watch them and you can have a bi rd's eye view of what kind of mind you have.

The most bogus is the mind. The brain is a reality. The no-mind is a rea lity. The mind is only a program: Hindu mind, Mohammedan mind, communist mind -- the mind has to be labeled, because it is a program. And meditation is a deprogramming. It is going beyond the mind. Nobody can deprogram a meditation man -- impossible. There is no way. He has nothing. I am available: I give the challenge to an y psychiatrist in the whole world if he can deprogram me. Just he has to be alerted that by deprogramming me, he may get deprogrammed!

IT HAPPENS IN ADVERTISING, IT HAPPENS IN THE MILITARY, IT HAPPENS IN CHURCHES, BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED.... TH ERE SEEMS TO BE A LEVEL OF IT THAT'S ALMOST FRANCHISABLE.

Q:* THIS RULED MY QUEST: TO MAKE FOLKS SEE THINGS HOW WHATEVER PARTICULAR LEADER SEES THEM. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME TO BE HEATING UP AND HEADING SOME PLACE THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WORLD AT LARGE. A:* It is happening there and the politicians are leading the world to a nuclear war, because they go on piling up nuclear weapons inspite of all their speeches about peace, love, friendship, coexistenc e -- but they all are piling up nuclear weapons. In fact it seems to be a little crazy: al ready they have so much nuclear weapons, they can destroy this planet for seven hundred times. Now there is no need. There is no way for life to escape; they have already seven hundred times more than it is needed. But they are heading out of fear of each other. The religious leaders are continuously tryi ng to convert, particularly Christianity which is the biggest religion in the world, is trying to convert the poor people very easily. Because those poor people need food, those people need medicine, they need houses, they need jobs, and Christianity can provide them few things. And their own religion cannot do anything else but prayer to a God who does not exist. So Christianity is trying to convert people more and more into the church, because it is also a political game -- politics of numbers. Politicians and priests have been in a certain conspiracy always. The conspiracy is that they both need wars, they both need poverty, they both need people in suffering, misery, orphans, widows, sick people -- they both need all these people. Without these people Adolf Hitler has a statement in his biography that, \"Only in a wartime you can become a great he ro,\" and that is true: all your heroes are wartime heroes. You don't know anythin g about, not a single peacetime hero. Politicians, if they want to achieve th eir ambition -- and they are ambitious people, otherwise why they should be in politics? Their ambition can be fulfilled only in war. The trouble is that the thir d world war is going to destroy all, so both parties are waiting and trying to find out ways how to prevent nuclear weapons or sabotage them. Once either America or Soviet Union finds a method, that can nullify nuclear weapons, the war will be immediately on. It will be postponed till that moment, and that moment cannot be very long -- both the sides are co ntinuously working how to find something as an antidote for nuclear weapons. Right now they don't have any antidote. Till they don't have the antidote, you can remain assured there is not going to be war. But soon th ey may find. There is not much problem in it. If they can find nuclear weapons , they can find something which negates nuclear weapons."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"And the religious leaders are trying to convert the poor countries, the poor people -- that is also the program of th e capitalist countries. Against communism. America don't have a philosophy to ar gue. Against communism, America needs Christianity to argue. You cannot convert Indians into Americans, obviously. You cannot convert Japanese into Ameri cans, obviously. But you can convert them into Christianity. So Christianity is serving the capitalist politicians and is spreading Christianity all over the world. And these Christians, their leaders, are against abortion, because if there is abortion.... The religious lead ers are against abortion. Q:* NOT ALL OF THEM. A:* All. Q:* EVEN THE ONES WHO SAY THEY'RE NOT? A:* Everyone is against abortion -- religio us leaders. The Hindu religious leaders, the Buddhist religious leaders, the Christ ian, the Jews -- they are all against abortion, against birth control methods, against the pill for they all want more numbers. Number is their strength. Q:* YOU PAINT SUCH AN UTTERLY DARK PICTURE.... YOU PAINT SUCH A PICTURE OF THE TOTALITY OF SELF ISHNESS OF EVERYONE OUTSIDE HERE. A:* It is true. It is true. I am neither.... I am not a pessimist, I am not an optimist either. I am just a realist. So if it is night I cannot say it is day. And I am not painti ng it dark; it is dark.... Absolutely dark. Q:* THIS IS THE ARK? A:* This is Noah's ark. This is where we are trying to pull the intelligent youth, so they can be saved from AIDS -- outside wo rld will not be capable to save people from AIDS. They may be ab le to postpone the third world war, but who is going to postpone AIDS. Q:* HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT HERE? A:* Only we can do it. We are already doing it. Every sannyasin is going through tests, and if somebody is found to have AIDS, he is not condemne d; he is a victim of all old religions. We love him, we have made a beautiful place. Two persons we have found who have AIDS -- we have made a beautiful place, the most scenic for them, because their life is now short, and we are suppl ying them everything that they ever"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"wanted. And we are going to create that place bigger -- if more AIDS people come to the commune, we will put them th ere with all medical facilities -- but AIDS cannot be in any way cured. All that can be done is those people can be prevented from spreading it, and that you cannot do in the outside world -- it is impossible. Q:* YOU'RE SAYING IT HAS TO BE A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT? A:* Yes. It has to be a certain commune where people love each other, respect each other. Even the person who has AI DS does not feel condemned. In the outside world the people who have AIDS are trying to hide it, otherwise the whole society will be turning their backs on them. Q:* I KEEP HAVING DIFFICULTY... IT 'S THE TOTALITY WITH WHICH YOU CONDEMN US.... Q:* I'VE BEEN TO AIDS HOSPICES, I'VE SEEN THE TREMENDOUS CARE, THAT DECENT GIVING HUMAN BEINGS PRESENT TO MEN WHO WERE DYING. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE OF RELIGION WHO YOU CONDEMN BEING GENEROUS AND GOOD AND OPERATING FROM POINTS OF CONSCIENCE. A:* It is just your prejudice that has give n you all these ideas. For example, if you look at mother Teresa from your attitude .... I am just taking an example, because I know her and her work.... Anybody who sees her work will appreciate it -- she is doing a great service to humanity: saving the orphans. But the re al purpose of saving the orphans is converting them to Catholicism. All thos e orphans are being adopted by Catholic families. One American Protestant family went there. They were not aware that they will be refused. They were asked, \"Are you Christians?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So they were taken in and the receptionist informed that, \"There are seven hundred orphans -- you can choose -- but first you fill the register to what religion you belong,\" and then they wrote, \"Protestant. \" And the clerk said, \"Wait. Let me first inquire,\" and out he comes back and says that, \"We don't have any orphans right now.\" A minute before there were seven hundred orphans. This man wrote a letter to all biggest In dian newspapers. I condemned on that letter mother Teresa. She wrote a letter to me . I had told her that this is absolutely ugly; you are trying to convert orphans into Catholicism, your concern is not the orphan. Your concern: one more Catholic. Secondly, you are against abortion, you are against birth control, because if there is birth control and abortion, where you are going to get orphans -- the whole supply of orphans. So on the outside it is white house, inside it is all black. @D She wrote to me that, \"I will be praying to God on your behalf, that he should forgive you.\" Nobody can say that so mething is wrong in it, but I know everything is wrong in that sentence. I wr ote her back that th ere is no God, so"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"don't try to befool me. Secondly, who are you to pray on my behalf without my permission? You are interfering into my life, without my permission -- this is trespass. So the sentence looks beautiful, but when yo u dissect it, what she is saying that I am wrong, so wrong that I will be punish ed by God, and she is right and she is praying for me -- what great generosity. Q:* I CAN'T, I CAN'T SEE THINGS IN THAT BLACK AND WHITE. LIKE YOUR STORIES ABOUT MOTHER TERE SA -- I KNOW NOTHING. BUT I DO KNOW THEY'RE DECENT PEOPLE OUT THERE. A:* You have to look more deeply into these generous people. These are the people who have kept humanity poor. Q:* YOU ARE TREATING TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AIDS; I HAVE SEEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THEM... A:* They are not serving, they are not serv ants of the people, they are not serving the poor. Service is not a respected word here. They are simply sharing their love. And in sharing it is totally different. You give your love to those people who have ve ry little time to live... and without any greed. All the religions in the world are serving the poor with a certain motivation that if they serve the poor they will reach to the kingdom of God. My people have no greed, no motive ; there is no God and no paradise. Q:* HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE I SAW WORKING.... WON'T GET IT? A:* They enjoying it, they are just enjoying it. I have made everything here a celebration, and that is my religion: celebration. And we don't bother about anything else. If those two people are sick, it is part of our celebration to share our energy with them and prevent the disease spreading to other people. And we can do it perfectly. In the outside wo rld, I know there are Senators in your parliament who have AIDS. But these pe ople can hide it -- they are powerful enough -- they can hide it. And the person who has AIDS knows that he is going to die within two years time: he will make as many sexual contacts as possible. Q:* ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I WOULD GO OUT KNOWINGLY CONTAMINATE PEOPLE IF I KNEW I HAD AIDS A:* No, no. It is not a ques tion of knowingly contamin ating. The question is a man who knows that he's going to die. Hi s immediate reaction will be how much"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"he can live in these two years or six mont hs time. He has to live with speed, with intensity, that he had never done before.... So this man is going to have as many sexu al contacts as possible. Not that he is trying to contaminate anybody; he is just the flame which is going out. In the outside world it is happening. Soon you will see. Q:* WELL, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. A:* The question is: you can be contamin ated even by kissing and you may not know, because it is not only sexual in tercourse that you get, get the AIDS. Q:* THERE IS A THEORY ABOUT THAT. A:* Yes. You can be just kissed by a friend and you may get it. And without knowing it, you may contaminate other pe ople. It is a wildfire. And now there are few experts who are saying that there is a possibility to contaminate even by breathing -- then it becomes absolutely impossible. But in my commune, we will try to prevent that too. Everybody, all the sannyasins can use the doctors' mask. You will not be able to do that in the ou tside world. That's what I am trying to make the difference; the difference is he re we are living together, caring about each other, loving each other. Outside worl d, you have your family, a small circle friends, but the outside world is big, and it is beyond control. All the states and all the governments are trying to repress the information about people who have AIDS. For the simp le reason, because it is such a condemnation. And if you repress the information, you are a criminal. For example, in Oregon, they have made the test for AIDS so difficult that almost ninety percent people who are suffering from AIDS will not be caught into it. This is what my medical people have info rmed me, that the test they are doing is such that ninety percent will be cleared out. Q:* I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THAT. A:* Yes, you should talk with them. An d these ninety percent people who are given a clear certificate will not be cont aminating anybody knowingly, but they will be contaminating all the same. Knowledge is not needed to contaminate anybody. The outside world is crushed between nuclear weapons and AIDS. Perhaps nuclear weapons may be avoided, for th e simple reason if we cannot find an antidote, the nuclear weapons cannot be used, but AIDS is unavoidable. Unless the world turns into small communes, and people start going on their own accord to be examined, and every commune manages for those people special places to live and supplies their demand s -- I don't think the outside world is going to do that."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Thirty million people in America are almost in Ethiopia.... And America cannot do anything for thirty million poor people in America itself, but it goes on making more nuclear weapons. You have these mad people in power to be removed immediately.

And the prime minister of India is selling wheat to outside countries, exporting wh eat, because he wants nuclear plant and for that money is needed. Now these people should be behind bars. Rajiv Gandhi is one of my friends... but still I say he should be imprisoned immediately, because what he is doing is criminal. People are dying and you are preparing for more death.... Strange. And you call that they are generous -- the pope is generous and goes on contin uously telling, \"No abortion, no birth control, no pill -- these are all immoral,\" and to go on creati ng more children is moral.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH ILLUSTRATED W EEKLY OF INDIA BOMBAY, INDIA Q:* FOR ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS, YOU KEPT A MAUN. AND AFTER THAT , YOU GAVE IT UP. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE A MAUN? WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO GIVE IT UP? A:* There were many reasons. The mo st fundamental was concerning my sannyasins. I don't want them to be inte llectually related to me, because that has nothing to do with the real experience of your being. There were many people who were just hanging around me. They loved my words, they loved my way of thinking, and I am not a thinker, and I am not a preacher. I am not a prophet or messiah. I want to share my experience and for that only those who are capable of living with me in silence are ready to understand me. So for three and a half years I was silent. The basic reasons was that th ose people who were hanging around my words, were interested intellectually in me, dropped out. And the people who were in love with me -- not with my words or theories -- they remained. The moment I saw that a ll people whose concern was their head are gone, I have started speaking again. Now with these people, speaking is a totally different experience. They can read me between the words, th ey can read me between the lines, and they are not addicted to my words. If I silent they are as happy as when I am speaking to them. Q:* BUT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ADDICTED TO YOUR WORDS AND BEING ADDICTED TO YOU? A:* There is a great difference. Being addicted to my words is just being intellectual. Being in love with me is total. Being in love with me is not a conviction, it is an experience. Being in love with my words, somebody can destroy it very easily -- just a little be tter argument and the person is finished. But a person who is in love with me -- nothing can disturb him. His trust is not based on any argument, it is not philosophical, it is existential."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":" Q:* ONE MAY DRAW SUSTENANCE FROM HIS LOVE FOR YOU; SOME MAY DRAW SUSTENANCE FROM THEIR LOVE FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WHY DO YOU THINK ONE KIND OF LOVER IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER AND NEEDS TO BE DROPPED OFF? A:* He is not only less important, he is absolutely wrong. His approach toward me is wrong, and what he is doing with my words -- creating certain belief systems, creating some philosophy, some ideology which is going to prevent him from knowing himself. My whole work is to help people to know themselves, and those who become addicted with the words are creating a hindrance for themselves. It does not matter whether they are Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan or addicted with my words. It is the same thing: They are hanging in their heads, and the reality is somewhere far deep where no word has ever entered, and no word is ever possible to enter. It is in your uttermost silence, in your me ditative peaceful serenity. So it is not a question only of difference or degrees, they are polar opposites. Those are the wrong people -- unnecessarily wasting their time here. Q:* BUT DOES A MASTER CHOOSE HIS FLOCK?... HE LEADS HIS OWN LIFE AND BY HIS EXAMPLE, PEOPLE FOLLOW HIM. HOW DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHO FOLLOWS HIM? A:* I am not a leader. So nobody is al lowed to follow me. They are my fellow travelers, they are my friends, and I am absolutely certain that who should be my friend. Followers -- who cares? Flocks -- who cares? Crowds -- who cares? These are individuals. I care. And I don't want an y wrong person for any wrong motive to waste his time. It is not harming me -- he is harming himself. It is out of compassion that I want him to be released. And they went away. The device worked perfectly well: they went away and new people have come in their place. Wh ile I was silent they became sannyasins. Their approach is totally different; their search is different. So remember, I am not a leader, I am not a prophet, I am not a messiah. I have no business to do with all that company. I am a simple man just like you and my people. If there is any difference the difference is very slight. The difference is that you are asleep, and I am awake.

Q:* BUT YOU HARDLY INTERACT WITH THEM. A:* Continuously I am interacting. I am dancing with them, I am talking with them. I am sitting in silence with them. Q:* BUT IT IS HARDLY A ONE-T O-ONE COMMUNION WITH ANYONE. A:* There is no need. I have created the field where just sitting by my side is enough. Otherwise, they will be gone if there is no communion. What they will be doing here? For what they will be here ? I dance with them, and they feel my love. They know my love. Love is something that need not be expressed in words, or expressed even in actions. They can see it in my eyes. You are seeing it in my eyes. Not only they are my friends, you are my friend. That's why you are here. This is the beginni ng of a friendship and it is not going to end easily. Q:* IN INDIA YOU WERE PERHAPS IN CLOSER TOUCH ON A DAY-TO-DAY LEVEL WITH PEOPLE. A:* No. Not much. Just when I was initiating them into sannyas. Q:* BUT YOU ARE SLOWLY WITHDRAWING YOURSELF? A:* Yes, that's true. Because now I can have a contact even from distance. Now physical contact is not necessary, particularly with my people. Even though I never come out of my room, they know I am there. They know and they feel. In the beginning it was necessary to come into contact because that was the only language those people could have understood. As love deepens, as meditation deepens, distance makes no difference. I have my communes all around the world. Those people who are in a commune in Germany, or in Holland or in Switzerl and feel me as deeply as my people.

Q:* YOU SPEAK OF FREEDOM OF ALL KINDS: INTELLECTUAL, EMOTIONAL, SEXUAL. HOW CAN YOU YO URSELF LIVE SUCH A RIGID, BORING, DULL, DISCIPLINED LIFE? A:* It is not disciplined for me. It is not dull for me. It is not rigid for me. To me, it is the most comfortable life. It is not that I have disciplined myself, it is that living in many ways I have found the mo st comfortable way, the most luxurious way to live. Q:* BUT SURELY THE MOST COMFORTABLE AND THE MOST LUXURIOUS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO LIVE ONE'S LIFE. A:* To me it is. To me it may not be. But whatsoever is the best to you is luxurious for you. And I don't say that all my sannyasins have to live in my discipline, the way I live, or the ritual of my living. No. They are free to find out their wa ys. But I have found mine and I am perfectly contented with it. So it is no t dull -- I am every moment enjoying it. Q:* IT'S AN EXTREMELY STRUCTURED LIFE. A:* It is not structured. It may look from the outside. It may look from the outside it is structured, it is not structured. I have.... For example, I have tried to wake up thr ee o'clock in the morning, I have tried to wake up four o'clock in the morning, I ha ve tried to wake up five o'clock in the morning. I have tried to wake up eight o'clock in the morning -- and finally I found that six suits me the best. Now, for an outsider it may look a structur ed life that every day I wake up at six, but to me that has been the best mo ment. After that, the sleep becomes a headache. Before that, the whole day becomes dull, sleepy. But exactly at six I have found my time. And now scientists say that for two hours every night, you have the deepest sleep. If you wake up after these two hours exactly, you will have the most awakened day. In those two hours, your temperature fa lls down, so it can be measured from outside, too. And I have tried that, that when my temperature falls down, it falls down between four and six. And exactly at six -- and this is a later thing -- I had found my time long before. For thirty years I have been waking up at si x. But this is just recently I found out that scientists say that these two hours -- wherever in the night they happen, and to different people they happen at different times. Somebody may find it at five o'clock, somebody may find three o'clock."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Vinoba Bhave used to wake up at three o' clock, and that became the discipline of his ashram. Everybody has to wake up three o'clock. Now that is nonsense, that is stupid. Vinoba it may be the right time, but all those people in Vinoba's ashram are unnecessarily suffering. Then in the whole day they feel dull, sleepy. Change your diet, your diet must be wrong. Change your other habits, something must be wrong. An d the only thing wrong is that they are waking up at the wrong time. So, to me, it is not structured. I have looked for it and found the right point, the balanced point. The same with my food . I have found what suits me, how much is needed, how much keeps me in a well-being, and I go with it. I am a very luxurious, lazy, comfort-lo ving man. And I have found everything that is needed to make me comfortable. I possess nothing -- I am the poorest man in the world in that sense. Otherwise, I am the richest, because my people have made everything available to me. It does not belong to me, it belongs to the commune, but you will not find such a co mmune anywhere in the world -- now, or in the whole history of man. No ashram with five thousand people ha s ever been there liv ing in centrally air- conditioned. This is the only city whic h is completely air-conditioned in the whole world. And my people are eating the best food po ssible. Enjoying their life in different ways. It depends on them. Q:* IT'S SAID YOU ARE THE GURU FOR THE RICH. A:* Yes, I am. Q:* BUT HOW DO YOU COMBINE YOUR OWN LEVELS OF COMFORT AT EVERY POINT... WITH THE PRINCIP LES OF COMMUNITY LIVING WHICH YOUR OWN PEOPLE FOLLOW? A:* My people have every facility availa ble. We have the Italian restaurant, we have the Chinese restaurant, we have the Indian restaurant. We have the continental food available. We have the American food available. All kinds of wines and champagnes, all kinds of cigars and cigarettes. Everything is available -- they have to choose and find. Q:* THEY HAVE BASIC NORMS OF COMMUNITY LIVING WHICH THEY FOLLOW, WHICH MAY BE SELF-IMPOS ED, OR STRUCTURED BY THE COMMUNE. A:* Nobody is imposing anything... It is not even self-imposed. The very word imposed is not right. "},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Q:* HOW DO YOU COMBINE THIS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY OF YOURS WITH THE GROUND RULES OF THE COMMUNE? A:* There is no ground rules in the co mmune. It is a commune of individuals who are not in any way parts but members, living. And they have to live according to their own way. If they feel this is fitting to them -- good. If they feel this is not fitting to them -- good. If they feel this is not fitting to them, we have all kinds of work available. For example, a doctor is tired with pa tients and hospitals and he becomes a sannyasin. We have a hospital, but he do es not want to become a part of the hospital. He is fed up and finished. He wants to go farming: perfectly good, he does farming. And he enjoys it for the first time in his life. His whole life, he wanted to do farming. There are professors.... Q:* THIS COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGER OUS IF A FARMER WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR... A:* A farmer cannot be allowed to be a doctor. He will be sent to study medicine. Even the doctors who have come here from different countries are not allowed to practice unless they get Oregon certific ate to practice. The farmer needs no certificate. It is not a qualified job. It is not something that is harmful to anybody. Q:* BUT HE MUST KNOW THE LAND USE LAWS. A:* That we are fighting and we are creati ng our own land use. And the way we have used the land, Oregonians have never used it. For fifty years this land was just lying do wn barren, a desert. We have made it an oasis. They will have to change their gr ound rules for land use, because we are showing them how land should be used. When I had come here there was only on e house. And 126 miles of land -- just barren, dead, only few junipers. Junipers are known as camels of the trees, but they were also in a very poor, dying co ndition. Since we have come we have managed to make dams, we have collected rainwater enough that all the junipers have become big, thick, green. We are making the whole city a green plac e, and those idiots are discussing in the courts about land use. They should come here and see how land has to be used. And they have much land in Or egon lying down like this. Otherwise, where can you find 126 square miles land so easily? It was for sale for fifty years -- nobody purchased it. What they will do with a desert? We have changed it into a gard en. Go on coming every year and you will be surprised that every year you will find expansion, more people, more trees, more birds."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"There was not a single bird when we came here -- now there are peacocks, swans and -- because of the water -- deer from all other places have moved. We have thousands of deer now, and we are thinking to make a deer park especially for them. In fact, deer have never enjoyed su ch a luxurious life as they are enjoying here, because we have put the grass that th ey love most -- alfalfa. They are eating it too much that you will not find su ch fat deer anywhere in the world. Q:* YOU WILL NOT FIND SUCH PROSPEROUS AND WELL-KEPT SANNYASINS ANYWHERE , FOR THAT MATTER. A:* No, you will not. And these if you go in the night in the roads, they will be standing in the road, you will have to stop because they know my sannyasins don't harm anybody. So peacocks are there.... In my own garden there are one hundred peacocks, and they won't give me way to drive. They are standing just there in front of me.... Q:* I WAS ACTUALLY PREVENTED FROM SEEING YOUR HOUSE. A:* You will be prevented, but not by peacocks! For that we have sannyasins. But those peacocks or those deer, they have understood one thing: that these people are nonviolent, not any way harmful. You can be with them without any fear. Q:* THE OREGONIANS DON'T THINK SO.... A:* Oregonians are far retarded than the deer. Q:* THEN WHY THE SUB-MACHINE GUNS? A:* For the Oregonians who are retarded, because they will understand only the machine guns, no other language. It is not for the deer. No bird, no animal is being killed here. In Oregon there are every year ten years* freedom from the government to kill deer. All over the state deer are killed. This is the only place we have stopped... that no deer can be killed here, and if anybody kills a deer on this land he will be in trouble. Those guns have never been used yet, an d I don't think they will be ever used. Those retarded Oregonians are so afrai d, they don't come near. And we don't have long-distance guns. But if it is needed, we will have them. We are nonviolent. We don't want to do any harm to anybody, but we are not Gandhians, that if you do harm to us , we will give you the other cheek. We are not Christians. We respect you so much that if you hit, you will get a bigger hit. We respect your dignity, your individuality, your hu manity. Christ's st atement that when"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"somebody hits you on one cheek give him the other cheek is a humiliation of the other man. You are reducing the other ma n into an animal, sub-human species. You are becoming holier-than-thou. Just by giving one cheek.... What about if he wants to hit you third time? What cheek you are going to give? We don't give another cheek -- if somebody hits on our cheek, we will hit on both of his cheek s together, simultaneously. We respect people. We respect their humanity. We don't want to prove that we are holier than you. We are just as human as you are. The hostility in the Oregonians is perfec tly good for us. One thing: they don't come here -- no disturbance. That's what I wanted, for all sides fifty miles around we are completely isolated, doing our th ing without any interference, without any trouble.... Q:* WHAT IS THAT \"OUR THING?\" A:* Many things.... People are meditating. In India it was a trouble. Others were getting disturbed because my meditation s are one hundred twelve methods in which few methods are chaotic, dynamic, active. The people have to throw out all their screams, shout, throw out their anger, dance, jump, jog. Naturally the neighbors will be disturbed in the early morning, and every day the police were there that neighbors are complaining. So I told my people we have to find a place where no neighbors are. One thing certain, the police is ours, so there is no problem. Q:* THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS. A:* No. Not dangerous at all. The police belongs to the state government. They are part of the police govern ment of the state, they have been trained by the state, but they are sannyasins and they know what you are do ing -- you are not disturbing anybody. And we have such a va st land that you can go on doing in one corner and nobody will know. We have a nature institute which allows people to live naked. They have a special lake for themselves. They can live naked, walk naked in the forest. Nobody is interfering. Even if you move naked in the streets of the city, nobody is going even to look back, what is the ma tter. It is your thing. That's your thing. Q:* IT'S A SAD COMMENT IF AN ATTRACTIVE PERSON IS WALKING NAKED AND NO ONE LOOKS AROUND. A:* Because everybody has his own fr eedom, even looking around is an interference. More than three seconds -- th at's what psychologists have come to the conclusion -- more than three seconds if you look at a man, that is interference."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":" Q:* WELL, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOU FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES ALREADY. A:* You have been doing immense interferen ce. But, it is perfectly okay with me because you at least blink. I don't blink. You should see that . That blinking, I don't blink.... When I am talking, I forget blinking. But everybody is free to do his thing. If somebody wants to hug somebody on the street -- in India it was a problem. Unnecessary, that somebody is hugging -- it should be nobody's business. If you don' t want to see, don't see. Just turn your back and go away, or close your eyes. Here, we are having absolute freedom. If people want to hug each other -- and it is a beautiful experience to hug each other.... Q:* BUT HERE YOU HAVE TOTAL FREEDOM TO HUG EACH OTHER, YOU ALSO GIVE TOTAL FREEDOM TO HI T EACH OTHER. AND THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.... A:* No. When people hug each other, nobody wants to hit each other; when people are prevented from hugging, then the only way to touch the other is by hitting. There is a basic psychology involved in it. Sigmund Freud said that people have invented guns, arrows, because they were prevented to hug each other, to love each other. Love is really a man trying to enter the woman. Now if that is prevented, the man will try to enter from a distance with a gun. That gun is phallic, according to Freud, and all other psychologists agree with him: that if you allow people total freedom of love, violence will disappear. Gandhi and people like him are responsible for violence in the world. In Gandhi's ashram, nobody could fall in love with any woman. There was great discipline that no woman meets in secr ecy with any man. His own secretary Karilal* could not follow this discipline. His own sons could not follow this discipline. The discipline is stupid. But when you prevent people from loving, then their very energy of love becomes hate. Hate is not different from love, it is love standing on its head, doing sirshasan*. Q:* IN OTHER WORDS, YOU BELIEVE THAT IF HITLER HAD A JEWISH GIRLFRIEND TO MAKE LOVE TO, HE WOULDN'T HAVE COMMITTED VIOLENCE ON THE JEWISH POPULATION? A:* Certainly. Hitler was rejected from ev erywhere. His parents rejected him, he was never given love by his parents. He was continuously condemned. He wanted to become an architect; no sch ool of architecture allowed him. Then"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"finally he became a soldier. Now there is no way to avoid the fact that the man was basically interested in art, in architecture, but being denied from everywhere, only army was the place where he was accepted. And even from the army -- after the firs t world war -- he was thrown out. He was one of the most rejected persons in the world, and he took good revenge -- he did well. Q:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE DID WE LL? YOU WOULD SUPPORT WHAT HE DID? A:* It means he has given you a lesson that: love people, respect people, a person should not be rejected so much that he becomes simply a maniac. That's what you made Adolf Hitler.... Adolf Hitlers will be born again and again if we cannot allow people freedom of love, warmth, dignity, respect -- just fo r being themselves. We respect people if somebody reaches on the Everest -- some Edmund Hillary*, then we respect him. If somebody invents something, we respec t him. If somebody is a painter like Picasso, we respect him, but we don't resp ect people just for being themselves. Everybody cannot be a Picasso and everybod y need not go to the Everest, and it will be silly. We have to respect people as they are without any demands on them. Q:* BUT YOU DON'T EITHER -- YO U ATTACKED MOTHER TERESA RECENTLY. A:* I attack Mother Teresa because she is doing so much harm to humanity. These are the people -- Mother Teresa is only symbolic, I call her Mother Teresa the Terrible. These people, Teresa, or Polack the Pope, or Jesus Christ, or Mahatma Gandhi, all these people in a ve ry subtle way.... I never suspect their intentions, their intentions may be good , but their actions are dangerous: these are the people who are keeping the world poor. Jesus says, \"Blessed are the poor.\" Now th is is something absolutely wrong. The poor are not the blessed, they are the cursed! -- the condemned. But he consoles them by saying that you are blessed. Q:* BUT YOU ARE SELECTIVELY USIN G THAT VERSE. THE FULL VERSE IS: BLESSED ARE THE POOR FOR THEY SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH. SO THOSE WHO INHERIT THE EARTH CA N NEVER BE POOR, SO HE WAS USING THE WORD POOR PURELY METAPHORICALLY. A:* Just wait a minute.... Just wait a minute, you are quoting wrongly. I was quoting rightly: blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the kingdom of God, not earth."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":" Q:* THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS -- THE KING JAMES VERSION SAYS THE EARTH. A:* There are not two versions! Q:* THE KINGS JAMES VERSION SAYS THE EARTH. A:* It is the kingdom of God basically in Hebrew. Kingdom of the earth is already possessed by the rich, it is alre ady inherited. Jesu s can only promise something in far away future, after death. All religions have been playing that game of promising people things beyond death. There is no evidence of anything beyond death, whether poor enter into the paradise, or rich enter -- more probability is that rich will enter. There is no possibility for poor in paradise if there is no possibility for them here on earth! And these people... Teresa co llecting orphans, what she is doing? Creating more poverty in the world. She is against abortion, she is against birth control, she is against the pill. These are sins. Naturally, if thes e things are there, orphans will disappear, and with orphans disappearing, who is going to give Nobel prize to Mother Teresa? I condemned her; she wrote a letter to me. In the letter she said, that \"I will pray to God to forgive you.\" Now the sentence looks perfectly nice, but no t to me. It is nasty. I wrote her back, that \"In the first place, I don't believe in any God, so who are you to pray to a God who does not exist? At least you should have asked me. \"Secondly, who are you to pray on my be half? I have not given the authority to you, and I have not committed any sin that God should forgive me. If He meets me, He will have to ask forgiveness from me, because what He has done to the world is enough! All these Tamerlane, Genghis Khan, Nadirshah*, Alexander the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, Joseph Stalin -- who is responsible for all these people? Who is responsible for Ethiopia dying? Who is responsible for half the world being poor and on the verge of death? Who is responsible for nuclear weapons? \"If God is the creator, and if He is omni potent, omniscient, He knows everything -- past, present, future -- He knows that there will be Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And even knowing that, He creates the world? He knows that there will be a nuclear war, and people are piling up nu clear weapons. Even the day he created the world he knew that one day there wi ll be a nuclear war, and millions of people will suffer tremendous torture and death. And this is your God,\" I told her. She never replied. I again wrote her, th at \"You reply, because otherwise I am going to sue you in the court. Who can on my behalf -- without my permission -- ask my forgiveness from God?\""},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"These people are simply trying to in crease their number. All those orphans become Catholics; all those poor people , aboriginals, become Christians. The hospital, the schools, the food -- these are all strategies. Islam had the strategy of the sword. Christians have the strategy -- because the world has changed, ways have changed -- they come with brea d and butter and one hand and Bible in another. Mohammedans used to come swor d in one hand and Koran sarif* in another hand. But it is the same -- just to purchase you. They are using people's poverty to make great numbers of Christians, beca use number has power. It is simply politics, nothing else; there is no religion in it. Just the pope before this polack who is now the pope, was a homosexual -- well-known over the whole Italy. And he was a bishop before becoming a po pe, in Milan. And the whole Milan knew because he was continuously moving with a homosexual, a young man. Q:* BUT THAT'S PURELY A SEXUAL PREFERENCE. A:* That's what I am saying, that it is perversion, not preference. Q:* YOU MEAN A MAN LIKE YOU WHO BELIEVES IN FREE SEX, YOU WOULD OBJECT TO PEOPLE EXERCI SING A SEXUAL PREFERENCE? A:* No, it is not a preference. Otherwis e soon you will be making love to the camera, love to the electric pole. And plea se, don't disturb my junipers. It is not preference, it is unnatural. It is a re ligious contribution to humanity, this homosexuality. It started in the monasteries where only men were living and no woman was allowed in. It started into nunneries where only women were living and no man was allowed. Naturally, man is intelligent enough to find some way. All the monks have been either masturba tors or homosexuals, but in some way they have to do something. Their biolo gy you cannot change by just preaching. Their bodies won't listen to your Bible. Q:* BUT YOU WERE A CELIBATE AT TWENTY-ONE. WHY CAN'T THEY BE? A:* I have never been a celibate. Q:* YOUR BIBLE SAYS THAT. A:* I have never been a celibate. If people believe, that is their foolishness. I have always loved women, and perhaps more women than anybody else. You can see my beard. It has become grey so quickly because I have lived so intensely that I have compressed in fifty years almost two hundred years. "},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Q:* OF SEXUALITY? A:* Yes. But I am not a homosexual. Thes e people have been talking of celibacy and creating sexual perversion. And the se xual perversion has led to the disease AIDS, which can kill almost two-thirds of humanity. Who will be responsible for it? Q:* WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN SEXUAL PERVERSION AND SEXUAL EXPERIMENTATION? A:* There is no sexual experimentation. Sex is a purely biological thing, absolutely determined by biology. For example, in the wild no animal is homosexual, but in a zoo if only male animals are there and no female is available, they turn into homosexuals. Your world is a zoo, not a wild place. In a wild jungle, nobody, no anim al ever turns into a homosexual. Q:* SO WOULD YOU, LIKE ROUSSEAU, TALK IN TERMS OF GOING BACK TO NATURE, TO THE WILD? A:* No. I am not saying back to nature, I am saying forward to nature. Not back - - back is not my vocabulary -- forward to nature. There are tremendous treasures hidden in nature which these perverted pe ople have denied humanity to enjoy. I am against these people because what th ey are saying and what they are doing ultimately results into something like a curse. All the religions have been preaching ce libacy. And nobody has ever bothered whether celibacy is medically possible or not. Even Mahatma Gandhi at the age of seventy was having wet dreams in hi s night. And you cannot find a more sincere man trying more sincerely than he tried to be a celibate. For forty years, no success. And do you know in the end he started sleeping with a naked woman? But Gandhians don't talk about it. Gandhians even approached Mahatma Gandhi, that please don't do it. Vinoba was one of them, Kalila* was another, Maulana Azad*, Kreplani*, all asked him, \"Please don't do this experimentation\" -- in your language. It was not experimentation; it was forty years of failure of celibacy. And all these popes -- just tw o days before, one Christian minister has been jailed for one and a half years because he was using small children. That is experimentation. In the pulpit, in the church, he is talking about celibacy and inside the church he is abusing small children. On father filed the case. He got for on e and half years jail. How many others have come, because they were afraid to say anything against the religious leader. But now when he is in jail, many other children have said that the same he has been doing with them."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"But this is not about one priest I am sayi ng. All the priests have to do it! We are forcing them to do it. We respect their celibacy, and that respect is a bribe to remain celibate. And their biology does not know about your respectability -- their biology has its own laws and it follows its own laws. The people who have been consoling th e poor are the enemies of the poor. Poverty can be destroyed immediately. All that is needed is that nations should disappear -- only then wars can disappear. And seventy-five percent of every nation's income is going into war efforts. Even America is doing eighty percent income pouring into nuclear weapons. Now if the whole world stops this nonsense, what is the need to be poor. We have so much energy, so much money, so much scientific intelligence. But strange, in England, in Europe, in Ame rica, too, they are destroying food and Ethiopia is dying, and soon India will be in the same position. And if you see Rajiv Gandhi, tell him that he will be re sponsible for India's poverty and people dying there, because he is exporting wheat OUTSIDE India and his own people are on the verge of death -- half of the co untry. But he wants a nuclear plant. Tell him that this is not a child's games, and you don't understand anything about humanity. You better go and become a pilot again, that is your place. You don't understand and you don't need to be a prime minister of a country which is suffering from poverty and you are looking for creating a nuclear plant. For what? Even if India puts every penny into crea ting nuclear weapons, it will take three hundred years for them to be equal in power to America or the Soviet Union. And do you think for three hundred years , America and Soviet Union will be staying where they are? It is stupid -- ab solutely stupid -- for a country like India to think of nuclear we apons, atomic energy. But they go on saying to the poor -- in India, all Indian religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, all go on saying -- \"It is your past life's bad actions, that's why you are poor.\" That's the reason -- because of these religions -- for five thousand years at least India has never revolted, suffered all kinds of poverty, slavery, accepted it, because the religious leaders were telling them that if you reward or if you do anything against it, you will have to suffer in the future life. Let me tell you one thing: you will be su rprised.... One of the Jaina great teachers in India is Acharya Tulsi -- it is a Jaina sect, Terapanth. He is the head of that community. Their basic philosophy is that if somebody is dying of thirst and you have water, don't give it to him because he is suffering from his past life's karmas. And giving him water means interf ering into the punishment. He will be punished soon again. He cannot get rid of it, and by interfering, you have committed a crime; now you will suffer also. If somebody is drowning, you simply go on walking. Let him drown -- it is his past life's actions, and you should not in terfere in any way. For example, if you pull that man out of the water and tomorrow he murders somebody, you are also responsible in that murder. You see, the lo gic is great. If you have not saved that"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"man, the murder would not have happened. So in the next life you will also suffer because you saved that ma n and took part into murder. If you teach people for thousands of years th at it is your bad actions in past lives which create poverty, you are stopping them from revolting, you are stopping them from doing something to change their situation. You are telling them, \"Just accept the situation in which you are.\" An d that's how the East has accepted and remained poor. And still you want me that I should not speak against these people -- Buddha, Mahavira? I have to speak. To me these are far bigger criminals than Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, because those peop le have done very small harm. One million Jews Adolf Hitler killed, but how many poor people Mahavira has killed? And living in poverty is far more dangerou s, far more suffering than dying in a beautifully, scientifically managed gas ch amber in Germany. Within a second you are smoke, holy smoke, rather than suffering for millions of years. No, I am against all these criminals. And I mean what I say. Q:* DO YOU THINK THAT IF THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD DID NOT INVEST SUCH A LARGE PART OF THEIR MONEY, OF THEIR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT IN NUCLEAR ARSENALS, THEY WOULD HAVE USED IT MORE MEANINGFULLY? TH EY WOULD HAVE FOUND SOME ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF CREATING A SITUATION OF TERROR IN THE WORLD? A:* The question is whether they invest in nuclear weapons or into something else all depends on us, not on them. Q:* IT IS BORN OUT OF THE DESIRE TO CONQUER, TO RULE. A:* I understand, but now it is absolutely idiotic. Up to now it was meaningful to conquer. With the nuclear weapons you cannot conquer -- nobody is going to be victorious and nobody is going to be de feated. All are going to be finished. In that way, nuclear weapons have served great cause: now war is meaningless. Q:* M.A.D. -- MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION. A:* Yes. So it is meaningless. They are not going for the third world war -- they will talk about it, talk about peace. They will play the games, and they will put small nations into fights and wars so th ey can sell their out-of-date weapons to them. But they are not going for a big w ar. Pakistan and India may go into a war, Bangladesh and India may go into a w ar, but Russia and America are not going into war because both are perfectly aware what it means. There is no victory. War was meaningful, you are right, be cause it was conquering. Now with nuclear weapons, the whole situation chan ges. We can put this whole energy in"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"conquering new planets, going to the stars. We can conquer nature which is deteriorating, and we can put the nature back into its harmoniousness as it was always. We can feed people. We can create medical food, just pills. If you cannot grow more wheat, you can just swallow a pill and that will do. The whole world has to be made aware in what a situation we have reached: that war is absolutely meaningless. So now no more pouring your energies into more nuclear weapons. Q:* THEN WHY ARE YOU INVESTING IN MISSILE SILOS? A:* I am investing only in toy guns. Th ose toy guns are enough to keep the Oregonians afraid. They don't do any ha rm, but just keeping them there, they remain far away. Q:* THE RUMOR THAT YOU ARE SHIFTING TO AUSTRALIA, ARE THEY RIGHT? DO YOU HAVE ANY SUCH PLANS WHATSOEVER? A:* No. I will be visiting. Q:* WHEN IS THAT? A:* That will depend. If America wants me to go out, to Australia.... Perhaps I may stay there forever. I have a beautiful commune there, on the sea beach. I may stay there. So there is a great opportunity for America to get rid of me. But first, my green card. With green card, I am not going out of America. I am going to fight up to Supreme Court. They have six clauses -- six types of pe ople to apply for American green card. I have applied on five. On each I will fight separately. One file will take twenty years to be finished by the time it reac hes to the Supreme Court. On five grounds again I will start on the second grou nd. One hundred years, they cannot do anything to me. And the sixth clause is not difficult for me -- that is marriage. I can marry as many women as they wa nt. But they cannot throw me out of America. If they are intelligent, they sh ould immediately issue my green card, then perhaps I may never come back. If Australia is there... and I have my communes in beautiful places. In Holla nd we have purchased a great ancient Christian monastery. And it was meant for Christian monks and a school for Christian children, beautiful gardens, three hundred people's accommodation. And we are renovating it. I may stay in Holland. I may stay in Germany. In Germany we have twelve communes of the same size. Germany is my country. Now the colo r red is no more connected with communists, it is connected with me. And we have sannyasins in the Soviet Union. We have sannyasins in other communist countries. We have sannyasins"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"in the East Germany. They are not only there, they want to make a commune. I am stopping them because if you make a commune and you come over-ground, you will be in difficulty. You remain unde rground. But they are so excited they want to make a commune in East Ber lin. My sannyasins in Soviet Union are more excited than anywhere else. Q:* HOW DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WI TH THEM? OR HOW DO THEY STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU? A:* That I cannot say to you. But I am in touch and they are in touch, and everything is going just groovy! Anything...? Q:* IF RUMORS ARE TO BE BELIEVED, ON THE 5TH OF SEPTEMBER, YOU ARE STARTING A NEW PROGRA M WHICH WILL POSSIBLE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH AIDS? A:* That's only a rumor. Q:* WHY IS THIS PARTICULAR A FFLICTION SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE? A:* Because it has no medicine, no cure. Q:* NEITHER HAS CANCER. A:* Cancer only of one type, but there are many types of cancer which have cure. They can be operated. And the people who have cancer are no t contagious. They will not spread the cancer all over the world. AIDS is a di fferent phenomenon -- no cure. The person is sure to die within two years. The pers on can contaminate not only by sexual intercourse, but by kissing. If his saliva comes in contact to you, you can get it. Kissing is going to be prohibited. In my commune I have told people that you drop kissing completely. You learn the art of Eskimos who rub noses... which is far more hygienic, and no fear of any epid emic. At the most, cold, which is not a disease. If you don't take medicine, it goes away in seven days; if you take medicine, it goes away in one week. I am concerned about AIDS, certainly, particularly for my people. My communes are creating every prohibition, precau tion. Every sannyasin is going through tests. We have found two sannyasins. For them we have made a beautiful... the most scenic place in the commune we have given to them. And we will take care of them, and they are respectable people, th ey need not hide it. They are simply victims of religions."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"In the outside it is totally different.

But governments are hiding, state governments are hiding, because nobody wants to accept the fact that your country is full of homosexuals -- beca use it is a homosexual disease. Q:* BUT IT HAS SPREAD BEYOND THE GAYS. A:* Yes, it has gone beyond now. It is no t confined to only homosexuals, but it is created in homosexuality. Then it spreads. It can go to a woman; then from women it can go to another man who has never been homosexual. And there is no way.... Q:* BUT TO STOP KISSING IS LI KE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T SHAVE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET A NICK IN YOUR CHEEK WITH THE BLADE WHICH MIGHT GIVE YOU TETANUS. A:* No, it is not that way. In fact, a man shaving his beard looks like a woman -- it is ugly. As far as women are concer ned, they love beards. You can ask my women here. A man without a beard and a mu stache is just half man. Just think of a woman with a mustache and beard -- looking like a SARDA RJI*. That's what is happening to men. A stupid idea because men biologically feels attracted to the feminine physiology -- her face. He thin ks that the woman's face is beautiful because it is without beard and without must ache. He is just a fool -- he does not know simple laws of nature. To a woman a man without a beard and mustache has no appeal. And you can see that all your prophets, all your messiahs... They had beards, and beautiful beards. And they influenced tremendously. Most of it will go to the beard. It happened when Lincoln was standing for the presidentship in America, he had no beard, no mustache. He was a thin man, tall man, and ugly. While he was campaigning one small girl told him, \"Unc le, if you grow a beard and a mustache you will look far more beautiful.\" And the idea got into his mind and he grew his beard and mustache. Now it is very difficu lt whether that played some part in his winning."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"I am not saying that there are not exceptions . I am simply saying that it is not like a beard that out of fear you stop shaving -- because if that becomes the situation, then ninety-nine percent people die on th e bed, so don't sleep on the bed! Just sleep on the floor. Q:* THEN HOW DO YOU STOP KISSING? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING. A:* No. Kissing is totally a different matter, because we can find better ways. Q:* OF FOREPLAY? HARDLY ANY. A:* Many! Because you don't know the feminine body. It is all erotic. Q:* I'LL ASK YOU THOSE QUESTIONS SEPARATELY, PERHAPS! A:* You can ask separately, but for this you have to remember that the woman's whole body is erotic. You can play it from anywhere. It is a strange musical instrument. Vatsyayana knew it five thou sand years before when he wrote his sutras. He suggests that lovers should pr ess each other's earlobes and that gives great joy. That seems very hygienic. And, in fact, there are tribes... Eskimos never kiss, they rub noses.... Q:* THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING.... A:* No. They know, because they see the missionaries and they think that these are fools. Even Eskimos think the mi ssionaries are fools because they are transferring diseases to each other. It is not that they are unaware of kissing, they are perfectly aware. There are aboriginals in India, in Thailand and in other parts of the world where rubbing of the nose is the common practice, kissing is not. And when something like AIDS is standing on your door, it is a small question of being intelligent to take precautions. And at least try once, and how you feel... you may enjoy it more than kissing. At le ast it is more fun -- something new and novel.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH KEYI TV, EUGENE OREGON, TRACY BERRY, Q: ABOUT THESE PRESS INTERVIE WS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING THE PAST FEW WEEKS: JOURNALISTS HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT YOU FROM THESE SESSIONS. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT SOME OF THE JOURNALISTS? A: Nothing. Q: WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE? YOU'VE CALLED YOURSELF THE WORLD'S GREATEST SHOWMAN. ARE YOU PLANNING TO PERHAPS TAKE YOUR SHOW ON THE ROAD? A: No, the roads will come to Rome. All roads will be coming to Rajneeshpuram. I'm not going on any road. Q: DOES THIS HERALD AN EXPANSION PHASE FOR RAJNEESHEES -- YOUR GOING SO PUBLIC? A: They are increasing, and they are expanding all over the world. Q: SPECIFICALLY, WHAT SORT OF EFFORTS ARE GOING ON? A: The same that is happening here is happening around the world in all of my communes. People are trying to live in a new way. The past of humanity has failed, utterly fa iled. It has not been able to create a better man, a better society. Civilization has only remained a word; it has not been yet actualized. In my commune, you can see the beginni ngs of a new man. The commune is not a family. It is just the opposite -- disso lution of the family. Families are small units which have kept people confined -- their love confined, their respect confined."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"A commune is coming into the open, ou t of your small circle of hypnotic conditioning. In the commune you are not a Hindu, nor a Christian, nor a Mohammedan. In the commune you are not a communist nor a fascist. The commune does not live according to any ideology -- political, or religious, or social. Each individual lives accordin g to his freedom, according to his responsibility, according to his meditative consciousness. And the more a person meditates, goes deeper into himself, he starts living on th e outside with new values which he had never known before : love, compassion, friendliness, joy, celebration -- and for no reason at all. People celebrate when there is some reason to celebrate. We simply celebrate, because celebration in itself is a reason. There is no need for any other reason. It is enough unto itself. Our people are free in every possible way. So we are dropping the old patterns of jealousy, competitiveness, politics. There is no politics, there is no competitiveness, there is no jealousy. If one lover moves to another lover, there is no antagonism. It is simply un derstood that it is human. Many inhuman things have been impose d on man. For example, marriage is inhuman. It is forcing two people to liv e together for a future about which they know nothing. Here, this moment is enough, and if th e next moment also you find yourself loving each other -- good. And if you find that it is difficult, it has become nagging, it has become poisoned -- that yo u are no more interested in each other -- then to go on living is ugly. It together is wasting energy, the life of two people Both can move, and both can move before things become bad, before things go sour. When they are sweet, friendly, th ey can move with gratefulness for all those beautiful moments that they lived together. Q: DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE A MORAL CODE? IS THERE A WRONG? IS THERE A RIGHT? A: No. I don't have any moral code. All moral codes are inventions of different societies in different geographies in diffe rent situations, but there is no moral code which is universal. So I don't teach any moral code, because what is moral today may become immoral tomorrow. What is immoral to day may become moral tomorrow. So I don't teach a code that fixes people with th e past. I give them insight to see, to be clear, to be aware, to be conscious so that they can find what is good, what is bad in each situation without any code. My people are not living according to any code, any doctrine, any creed. They are living according to their consciousness. And the whole effort is, how to raise your consciousness higher and higher. So to me, there is only one morality and that is being a conscious being. And then act out of it. You cannot act wrongly. "},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Q: THE PERCEPTION OUTSIDE OF RAJNEESHPURAM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TEACHING AMOUNTS TO ANARCHY -- MAYBE A PLEASANT SORT OF ANARCHY. A: That is absolutely wrong. Anarchy is a reaction against what the governments have done to man. It is not a revolution; it is simply a reaction. And by reactions you cannot live. For example, the founder of anarchy, Pr ince Kropotkin, simply wants all the governments to be dissolved immediately. That is stupid, because the man is not capable to cope -- even with all the co urts, all the police, all the army and the whole hierarchy of government. Man is cr iminal, man is murderer, man is rapist -- so a this is stupid idea to dissolve all the governments. My idea is not for anarchy -- that is not my goal -- but to create better individuals. Finally, perhaps one da y we will have so many conscious individuals on the earth that there is no need of any government. But I am not preaching anarchy. Q: HOW DO YOU COUNSEL YOUR FOLLOWERS TO DEAL WITH THE LAWS OF THE LAND? FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU URGE THEM TO PERFORM CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WHERE THEY SEE IT NECESSARY? A: No, We fight the government, the go vernment agencies. And we follow their rules, because we are playing their game . And we can play the game better than they are playing. And in four year's ti me we have proved to them that how stupid they are. Laws are made by th em, rules are made by them, but we can find loopholes in their laws and loophole s in their rules. And we are going to be here, and going to fight to the ultimate end. So we are not against their laws. But their laws are made by mediocre politicians, and we have far more intellige nt people to fight. We have the biggest law firm in the whole world -- four hundred legal ex perts continuously getting ready for more and more fight on more and more grounds. And your governments -- state government , the federal government -- they are all doing many things illegally, against the Co nstitution. It is their Constitution, it is their law, but they are doing things against it, going against it. We will be in favor of the Constitution and we will go against them. We will be in favor of the laws and prove to them that they are acting illegally. So our way of fighting is not to disobey. Our way is to prove that we are obeying the laws and you are disobeying your laws. And laws are yours, made by you, and you have committed so many stupidities in them that we are perfectly capable to fight with you. Q: IT MUST BE DISAPPOINTING TO YOU TO HAVE MET WITH THE LEVEL OF REJECTION AND PERSECUTION."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":" A: No. In fact, it was perfectly expected. Any new idea has to be ready to accept the challenge of hostility, rejection, pe rsecution. I would have been disappointed if they had ignored me. They could not ignore me. And strange, it is a small commune, living in a desert trying to make the desert green, an oasis, and they are terrified . These people who are living, loving, dancing, singing -- what harm are th ese people going to do to them? In four years' time we have not committe d a single crime. In the commune not a single rape has happened. There is no prostitute in the commune. There is no murderer in the commune. There is no thief in the commune. The police in the commune are just sitting, doing nothing, because there is nothing. We have the city magistrate, but in the court, in four years, nobody has been brought as a criminal. Against such peace ful, loving people the whole of Oregon is afraid. They must be just retarded people. Q: IT ALSO SOUNDS, THOUGH, LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING SOME OF THE COMMOTION YOU'RE CAUSING AROUND THE STATE. A: Mm? I want -- because that gives us strength. Every challenge brings us strength. And we will go on creating mo re and more challenges. We will not let them sleep peacefully. We sleep pe acefully -- we have no trouble. Q: HAS THE FUROR THROUGHOUT OREGON AND THE U.S. CONTRIBUTED AT ALL TO THIS CYNICISM? A: The U.S. has nothing to give to me. In fact, in that way I am disappointed. I was thinking that America must be more intelligent than any other country, less prejudiced than any other country -- rea lly democratic -- but being here for four years what I have found is that democ racy is just in the name. Behind the democracy everything undemocratic is going on. Our own experience is a proof of it. I have not found that America is really a country where individuals are respected, freedom of speech is respected. It is only talked about. And I don't see any sense of humor -- not at all. They have been taking us so seriously -- and we are taking them so nonseriously; but they cannot understand. We are all the time joking, but they cannot understand simple jokes. They are havi ng secret meetings -- the governor, the attorney general, and they did not allow -- they were discussing us and they did not allow any one of our representatives to be there. If you are discussing us -- at least it is simple courtesy that at least one person from our side should be there and you should listen to what we have to say. They did not allow... they did not allow any journalist either. The governor said, \"After our secret meeting I will talk to you and inform you.\" And whatever he informed us about was simply lies"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"and nothing else because we have found the confidential file which says just the opposite. What he had said to the people, to the jo urnalists, to the media -- he was saying that everything is under control and we are pacifying people, there is no problem to be worried, the heat is cooling down. And in the secret report that they prepared inside they are alerting the army to remain ready. Any moment, if they are ordered, they have to reach Rajneeshpuram in three hours. Now, what kind of people are these? An d what is the need of bringing the army here? We are not a nation, that you have to attack us? And they are lying to the media that things are getting settled and there is no problem. If there is no problem, then why is the army given the alert? And why have you given them a time, that within three hours you have to reach Rajneeshpuram? So these people, I don't think, have any sense of humor. They are just dodos. Q: WHO DO YOU FEEL HAS TREATED YOU FAIRLY SINCE YOU'VE COME TO THIS COUNTRY? I CAN'T BELI EVE THAT EVERYONE HERE HAS BEEN AGAINST YOU. A: Not everyone. Most of the journalists have been very fair, very loving. And those are the only people I have come in contact with from the outside world. And they have been intelligent and they could understand what I am saying and they could understand the sense of humor. All the journalists who have come here, except one or two, have enjoyed the place, loved the place, wanted to come again and again. Q: DID YOU PLAN TO MAYBE GO OUT AND SPEAK TO PEOPLE? A: No... Q: IF YOU WENT OUT AND MET OREGON AND TALKED TO THE PEOPLE, AND THEY FOUND OUT YOU WEREN' T THIS HORRIBLE MONSTER, IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUNCH OF RED-ROBED FOLLOWERS, IT WOULD BE EASIER THAT WAY? A: No, it would not be, because I have been for thirty years in India, moving around the country; no, it is not so. Shoe s have been thrown at me; stones have been thrown at me. I am speaking and in the crowd a band is playing so nobody can hear what I am saying. Poison has been given me twice, to kill. And the last thing before I left was an attempt on my life."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"So I know... and I have had enough of it , so I want to be here; if anybody is thirsty, he can come. If he wants to thin k me a monster, so far so good. That will give him good nightmares. Q: WELL, LET'S SAY, I'M THE AVERAGE PERSON IN EUGENE OR PORTLAND, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHI NG EXCEPT WHAT'S ON THE NEWS OR IN THE PAPER, DOES THAT ME AN THAT I HAVE TO DRIVE TO RAJNEESHPURAM TO FIND OUT OR HOW WOULD I GET. A: That's the only way. You have to come. And it is such an experiment that there is no other way, you have to come here and be here and meet people and see with your own eyes what is happening. And it is open. It is not like Soviet Ru ssia, that you can not enter here, that you cannot meet people, that you cannot remain for a few days as our guest. And you can move freely, nobody is preven ting you. That's the only way. And we have our communes all over the wo rld. So if Germans wants to know about us, in Germany we have twelve co mmunes. If Holland wants to know us, we have our communes there. On the same pattern, the same way of life, the same approach towards life, we have pl aces in Australia, in India. We are opening in Japan, and soon we'll be all over the world. Small oases, so whoever wants to know about us has to travel and visit our communes. Q: THE RUMORS THAT PERHAP S YOU MIGHT BE MOVING TO AUSTRALIA... AND YET, I SEE A LOT OF EXPANSION GOING ON HERE, WHAT IS THE REAL STORY? A: I was just joking. Because Australia s eems to be so much afraid of me. Only Sheela has been there, my secretary, and she has created so much turmoil there, that they are getting very much afraid that I may be coming, so I told the journalist that yes, I am coming; tell them get ready. But I am not going anywhere. I am going to be here an d fight the American idiots who are destroying democracy and a ll human values for which America stands. It is a very strange situation. I, I am fighti ng for the American Constitution, American values, against the Americans. But this w ill expose America to the whole world. That is their fear. And I'm not going anywhere. Q: QUESTION ON THE JOKING: YOU' VE RATTLED SO MANY PEOPLE'S CAGES BY SAYING, \"OH, WELL MAYBE I'LL GO TO AUSTRALIA.\" OR OH, YES, I WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD.\" A: Yes. "},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Q: DO YOU AND SHEELA SIT DOWN AND SAY, \"OK, LET'S FRIGHTEN AUSTRALIA THIS WEEK,\" OR IS IT... A: No, it is spontaneous. There is no need. Because we are absolutely nonserious about it. In Joke, everything is allowed. There is no problem. Q: THE CONSTITUTION OFFERS FREEDOM OF RELIGION. IT SEEMS THAT WHAT YOU ARE OFFERING IS FREEDOM FROM RELIGION. A: Certainly Q: SO, HOW DO YOU COUNSEL PEOPLE TO PURSUE THAT? IS FREEDOM FROM RELIGION POSSIBLE? A: It is possible, and should be made possible, because religion has dominated people, exploited people, kept poverty in the world. Religion has committed so many crimes that it is time we should be finished with it... Jesus says, \"Blessed are the poor.\" The same is the tone of Buddha, the same is the preaching if Mahavira. They all are consoling the poor people th at you will inherit the kingdom of God. Marx was right only on one point in his all writings: that religion has been the opium of the people. And I agree with him only on that point. It has been the opium! They have drugged people to remain poor... Even in a country like America which has all riches -- the rich est country -- there are thirty million people suffering from poverty. Thirty milli on people are suffering from poverty, and Ronald Regan goes on piling up on nuclear weapons. And there is no point in having more nuclear weapons, beca use both Soviet Russia and America combined have enough nuclear weapons to destroy humanity seven hundred times. So what is the point now? Nuclear weapons have made war absolutely obsolete. It is meaningless. The whole me aning of war is to win. Now there will be no winner and nobody defeated. The whole of life will be finished. So now war is against life and in favor of deat h. It is not a question if American democracy or Russian communism, it is a question of whether life has to exist on the earth or not. Thirty million people in your own country are starving on the streets, and you are preparing for war. And you are already equipped too much. But the politicians are not interested; in fa ct they want poor people because they can always be purchased. The religious people want poor people because they can be easily converted. That is what Christianity is doing all over the world. Islam used to do it -- in one hand the sword, in the other hand the Koran. You can choose: either the Koran, or the sword w ill behead you. Christianity has changed its techniques. In the one hand the Bible, in the other bread and butter. A little bit nicer, but the inner game is the same."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"In India, I tried to find out whether any rich person has ever been converted to Christianity: I could not find a sing le case. Those who are converted to Christianity are orphans, beggars, poor people, starving people. Now, naturally the catholic pope and his bishops and th e whole army of their priests would like that abortion should not be legal, becaus e if it becomes legal, Catholics will be less in number -- where are they going to find orphans. Birth control should not be allowed, it is against God; population should be allowed to grow as people become more and more poor. And that means more customers for Christianity. Q: MANY PEOPLE BECOME RELIGI OUS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR LI VES. THEY NEED A CHURCH TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM. AND IF THAT IS TRUE, HOW COULD THESE RELIGIONS EVER BE ABOLISHED WHEN IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THEM? A: In fact, this is a very vicious circle. Religions teach every child as the child is born, immediately religions catch hold if it -- either Hindu or Mohammedan or Christian. And they start making him feel that he is not capable of deciding for himself, that he has to depend on thos e who know. That he has to listen to the parents, that he has to liste n to teachers, that he has to listen to the priest. They make children slowly dependent, and thos e children lose their sense of strength, their being, and then naturally they wa nt on everything to be advised and commanded, to be ordered. They can function only if they are ordered. If they are nit ordered, they are in confusion. They are always in search of a father figure. It is not strange that they call the Christian priest father: It is not strange that God is called the father. There is simple psychology behind it. They need a father figure; but I am saying it is a vi cious circle. Religions create it and then they say people need guidance. Nobody needs guidance. I have people here -- five thousand people are here, one million sannyasins are around the earth -- none if them needs any guidance. None of them is dependent on anybody else. If one million people can depend on themselv es and take the sole responsibility for themselves, because I am not their father -- I as not even their uncle! And I Am not their leader; because I cannot humiliate a person by forcing him to follow me. I am just a friend, not more than that. I can talk to these people. It is up to them to decide for or against. I am not asking them to believe in me. And all the religions have done that; that's why they are called faiths. I am against faith. My whole approach is unless you know it, never believe anything. And the beauty us that when you know, there is no need to believe -- you know it. Belief is always for the ignorant. Faith is always for those who are not courageous enough to enquire. I teach doubt; I teach skeptici sm; I teach enquiry. And a person has to remain in the state of not knowing until he comes to know. Belief covers his ignorance. You do not know about God, you do not know about what happens after death. Naturally, you start believing in somebody who pretends to know."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Neither your popes know about it; nor Jesus Christ knew about it. Even on the cross, he shouted toward the sky: \"G od have You forsaken me?\" He was a believer -- just illiterate, uneducated. And the people who were following him were also of the same grade, third rate. Those third-rate people became apostles of Christianity -- carpenters, woodcutters , fishermen. Not a single rabbi was a follower of Jesus Christ, and the whole Judea was full of learned rabbis. What does it show? It simply show that Jesus appeal is only for th e very ignorant, and those ignorant people want to cover their ignorance, they are ready to believe. You will find totally different kind of people around me. You will not find ignorant people, you will not find illiterate people; you will find people who are almost all graduates from universities, have master's degrees, have Ph. D.s, D.Litts. Most of them are highly qual ified professionals: psychologists, professors, doctors. You cannot enforce thes e people to believe. They have come to me because everywhere they are being indoctrinated and their intelligence was in rebellion. Here they have found a place where no indoctrination is happening. I don't have any doctrine to teach; I don't have any program to give. I only deprogram peop le and leave them to themselves. Now find you way, be courageous and go into the unknown. Q: HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM THEY'VE MADE THE DESERT FLOWER. THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS WITH TH E MORMONS SETTLING IN UTAH, THE JEWS IN ISRAEL; AND THE ONL Y THING THAT REALLY SEPARATES ORGANIZED RELIGIONS FROM CULTS, IS JUST TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT. DO YOU SEE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE RAJNEESHEES AND...? A: No! How many Rolls Royces do the Mormons have? (Laughter) In a five thousand member community we have nine ty Rolls Royces, hundreds of other cars, one hundred buses, five planes, the city centrally air-conditioned. Why these people can...? Q: WELL, YOU HAVE ROLLS ROYCES, THEY HAD WIVES. A: They cannot have many more wives that we can have. We can defeat anybody. And just look at my commune women. You will not find more juicy women anywhere else. They are just gorgeous! Q: THE PRECAUTIONS THE COMMUNE HAS TAKEN AGAINST AIDS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FOREMOST EFFORTS WORLD-WIDE TO FIGHT THE DISEASE. HOW DID YOU FI RST BECOME AWARE OF IT AND RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUS NA TURE OF THAT ILLNESS? A: I have a medical center here. We have the best doctors possible -- from all over the world, not only from Oregon -- we ha ve FRCS from England, and they are"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"continuously watching about everything, so that our commune can be protected from any kind of attack. And AIDS is going to be the most tremendous disease that man has ever seen. So it is their research on it, and if they feel there is something I should know they inform me. And soon we are going to do something abou t it. We will be the first in the whole world to do something; right now what is being done is that every government is trying to suppress the information abou t it, because no government want the world to know how many AIDS patients they have. The Oregon government has made such a test that ninety percent of AI DS patients will pass through it. This is simply criminal, because those ninety people that you have passed and cleared will be spreading the disease; and th e disease is such that even by kissing you can give it to another person. It is not necessary that you should make some sexual contact -- just by kissing. Saliva is the carrier. I have told my people to stop kissing, instead of it, rubbing your noses against each other and enjoy it. And, in fact, these are people -- Eskimos do it already. They are five thousand years backwards, but as far as AIDS is co ncerned, they are far more superior than us. It is not that they don't know abou t kissing -- they have seen missionaries kissing, and they laugh at it that what kind of dirty people are these? Because kissing is simply laughed at. They have their ways -- and man is no inventive -- they rub noses, they rub each others' e ar lobes. And these are all erotic points, and the women is so erotic her whole body is erotic. There is no need to put her in danger. In India, you will be surp rised to know that the ordinary posture of making love -- man on top of woman -- is known as \"missionary posture,\" because it was the first Christian mission aries who were seen in that posture. Otherwise in India it was insulting. A woman who is softer, more fragile, and a huge animal is doing push ups on the poor woman. Q: THERE WERE THOSE CHARGE S FILED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO REGARDING YOUR CHILDREARING TACTICS HERE IN THE COMMUNE. COULD YOU JUST BRIEFLY DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE? A: That is absolutely wrong, and the court has completely cleaned us. The charges were invalid. And now we are goin g to sue the woman who had put the case for child abuse. She has never been here; she know nothing about what is happening here to the children -- and she puts a case against us. And now she is defeated. This is insulting and disg usting. There is no abuse. Our children are the ones who cannot be abused. In the ou tside world, children can be abused, are abused. Here it is impossible because we are giving them all the information about sex -- not in a roundabout way. We are giving them actual facts -- that these are the facts of sex and these are the effects of sex, and until you are sexually mature don't get involved in any relationship which will destroy your whole life, may make you retarded, may make you perverted. And when you are of age, the medical center provides ev ery contraceptive, pills. We don't prevent"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"them, but first let them be ready. If a boy is fourteen and has the energy now to make love -- he has the greatest power to make love between fourteen and twenty-one, and that is the time which is wasted in universities. After that, he is on decline. By the time he gets married after his Ph. D, he will be twenty-eight, twenty-seven; he has already declined. By thirty-five he is becoming older, he loses interest, he make love but he is a spent cartridge. Q: I PEERED THROUGH THE WINDOW AND WATCHED AS YOUR CAR ARRIVED, AND YOU DANCED WITH YOUR SANNYASINS. WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THEIR EYES, WHAT DO YOU SEE ON THEIR FACES? A: Just love and nothing else. Great love and great gratitude. I don't think anybody has been loved so much as I ha ve been loved. Jesus has only twelve disciples -- I have one million; and out of one million, ninety percent are women. So it is really groovey. Q: ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEATH? A: Death it not the end of life, it is the culmination of life. It is one of the most beautiful experiences. If you have really loved then only will you experience the beauty of death; if you missed life itself in listening to the sermons in the churches, in reading the Bibl e, and all kinds of nonsen se... if you have missed life itself, you will die in a coma. Before death comes you will become unconscious, so you will miss the experien ce of death. The people who are living consciously -- and that is my basic te aching, live consciously every moment. Even while making love, remain consciou s and a witness. It is a life... long growth if becoming alert. Then you ca n die consciously and you can experience death as the ultimate orgasm. It is far bi gger than any sexual orgasm. In fact, the difference is not only of quanti ty, the difference is of quality. It is immeasurable. Living moment to moment, one learns how to die. beautifully, silently, joyously. One is going on another adventure. Unknown -- I don't give them any ideas what is going to happen after death, because that is absolutely wrong, destroying. it is like if I loved a movie an d I tell you the whole story of the movie, and then tell you that I have brought a ticket for you, go and see. I have destroyed it already; what is the point of seei ng it? I give them the ticket, but I don't tell them what is going to happen. Th at they have to discover on their own. It is tremendously beautiful because I ha ve lived before and I have died before, and I have died consciously so I know what beauty it is. It is not the end; it is always a new beginning. In existence nothing dies -- it cannot. You cannot destroy even a small pebble. You can grind it, but it will be there. Now in powder form . You can throw the powder into the ocean. It will be there, resting somewhere in the bottom of the ocean, but now it is an accepted scienti fic truth that nothing can be destroyed,"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"you can only change its form. And if this is so about matter, what to say about consciousness? -- Which is the highest ev olution on the earth. Existence cannot be so stupid, so unintelligent to destroy consciousness -- it does not destroy even stones, how it can destroy your soul? But I don't say to anybody believe in me. I say experiment; and right now you are aliv e, so don't bother about death. When it comes, it comes. Right now you experi ment with life, and be ready: death can come any moment. And particularly in these days where politicians are preparing to destroy the whole humanity, and religions have contributed their contribution through AIDS. That will destroy if politicians cannot, then AIDS will destroy humanity. So we are really living without any tomorrow. Always man has lived without tomorrow, but never with such a crisis. And I say AIDS is a religious disease because its beginning is in homosexuality, and homosexuality was born in monasteries of religions because there they segregated men and women and they did not allow men and wome n to meet. No women can enter in a monastery where only men live; ne ither men can go into the nunnery. You are creating the situation for homosexuality. Religions have been teaching for celibacy -- which creates perversions becaus e it is unnatural. It is just as if somebody says to you that unless you st op urinating you will not enter into the kingdom of God. That is just nonsense! But you can find a few idiots who will start making an effort, because if this is the price, they are ready to do it. But what they will do -- they will pretend, they will be hypocrites, and they will find perverted ways from the back door. You cannot go against nature: celibacy is against nature. And all the religions ha ve been preaching celibacy. They are responsible for AIDS. So today the situatio n is really more da ngerous than it has ever been. Tomorrow is more uncertain than it has ever been. So live today with intensity, with totality, with as mu ch consciousness as possible. And I have here one hundred and twelve methods how to increase your consciousness. So if death comes tomorrow, there is no problem -- there will be only my people dying joyously with a smile on their face. Q: AT YOUR NEWS CONFERENCE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU INVITED SOMEONE TO ASSASSINATE YOU. IS IT A JOKE? IS IT FEAR OF DEATH BY NATURAL CAUSES, OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE LOGICAL WAY YOU COULD SEE THE END OF YOUR LIFE? A: Most probably, that will be the logical en d of my life. It is a serious joke. And I would prefer it that way, rather than dy ing on the bed. Nine ty-nine percent of people do that. I don't want to belong to that crowd! I would rather like to be assassinated than to die on my bed. And to me there is no problem. I have experienced life. I have tasted all its joys. There is nothing that I have missed. If death come this moment, I will not ask even one more moment to complete my sentence. It is perfectly Okay. In ex istence, nothing is ever completed. Only in novels, stories begin and end. In life ther e is no beginning and there is no end."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"Abruptly things start and abruptly things finish. There is no preface, there is no appendix, there are no footnotes, nothing. It is always in the middle that the story begins. When I used to read -- fo r five years I have not been reading anything -- but I loved reading so much that I have to find out ways to make the book more interesting. I would begin in the middle, then go to the end, then come to the beginning. And that was more hil arious, gave more suspense. Life is really hilarious. Just you have to know how to love it. We don't have any God, we don't have any heaven and hell. We have only this moment, so we can pour all our energies into it. And we are doin g that. We are celebrating and enjoying and loving and laughing and dancing. In fact, that is what creates hostility toward me. The poor is hostile to ward the rich; the sad people are hostile towards those who can laugh and love and dance. The whole world lives in such misery and suffering that they cannot tole rate me. My existenc e and my people's existence proves them wrong -- and I am not a person just to argue. I give existential argument: my commune is an existential argument to the whole world that you also could have loved and danc ed and sung and enjoyed, but you have chosen wrong paths, so you go to church, yo u go to the synagogue. My people don't go there. There is no need for them to anywhere. They don't pray. They are not beggars. And to whom to pray? There is nobody in the sky to pray to. My people meditate. They sit silently doin g nothing, they enter into their own silence, enjoy it. The more you enjoy it the deeper and deeper you enter into it. There come a point where you are exactly at yo ur center of being. And that's what I call enlightenment: a great explosio n of luminosity, clarity. All questions disappearing, all doubts dissolved, you ha ve found the answer. The answer is within you -- nobody can supply it. And all these prophets and messiahs have been doing just that: they are suppling you the answer. And borrowed answer is not going to help. Those borrowed answ ers have made the whole humanity miserable. They have taken their enquiry, they have taken everything away from the people and left them utterly poor. My people are multidimensionally rich. Q:SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? YEARS FROM NOW WHEN YOU DIE, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE RAJNEESHEES? A: They will celebrate my death. Q: AND THEN GO TO THE FOUR WINDS, OR STAY TOGETHER...? A: That is for them to decide what to do. I am not to decide. Remember, that is the strategy of a politician: he want to even control people after his death. The religious leaders declare their successors, bu t what is the point in it? The point is dead over-ruling the living... When I am gone, I am gone. And it is a double thing to be understood: when I am gone, I am gone to you -- you are gone to me. I will be doing whatsoever I want to do; you should do whatsoever you want to"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"do. Nobody has to control. You cannot control me when I am dead. You cannot tell me what I should do after death. Ne ither will I say to anybody. I have made you love life, relish every moment. You know the secret. You will not miss me; you don't need any successor. You are my successor -- everyone individually. If you still decide to remain together -- good ; if you want to go separate on your own ways, that is even better. But I am not going to dominate you, either alive or dead. To dominate anybody in any way is criminal. Q: WHAT WILL RAJNEESHPURAM LOOK LIKE IN TEN YEARS? OR WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IN TEN YEARS? A: Nothing -- I never think about the future. Future is not my concern at all. To me, time is only now, and space is only here: beyond that I have no concern. While I am here, I love my people making a desert into an oasis. When I am gone, these people will be here. These are intelligent people, they don't need any instructions. Even now I am not givi ng them any instructions. They can understand. They know that I love greener y, so they started planting as manu trees possible. They know I love water, so they have made dams, lakes. They love me -- from my shoes up to my hat they make everything for me. I never think about the future. That's why my life is without any tensions -- I never think about the past, so I am not burdened wi th the past. I never imagine about the future, so I'm not worried about the futur e. And today is enough unto itself. I enjoy it. When I go to bed, I thank the wh ole existence that it has been beautiful today, and if by chance I wake up again, we will see. Q: YOU MADE THE COMMENT TH AT THERE CAN NEVER BE PEACE BETWEEN OREGONIANS AND RAJNEESHEES. WHY IS THAT? DO YOU NOT WANT PEACE? A: I always love peace, but what I had said actually has been misunderstood and it was bound to be because the question wa s asked, it was not about peace, it was about coexistence. And I said: \"Never.\" Because coexistence is an ugly word, political; it means you are you are an en emy, I am hostile, I am an enemy, but what to do -- we have to live. I am here, you are here, and we have to live somehow, so some compromise is needed. That is coexistence. I don't believe in coexistence. Either I will turn Oregon red, or they are free to turn us into Oregonians. That is peace, not coexistence: One existence. Till that happens, the fight will continue. Q: WHAT IF OREGONIANS DECIDED JUST TO LEAVE RAJNEESHEES ALONE? "},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"A: I don't think everybody can leave Rajneeshees to live alone we won't allow that! Q: THE MOST OPEN WOUND IN THE STATE WAS WHEN THE RAJNEESHEES WON THE ELECTION IN WHAT WAS THEN ANTELOPE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS LEGAL, PEOPLE FELT IT WAS A TAKE-OVER. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THE RAJNEESHEES WOULD EVER PULL OUT OF THE CITY OF RAJNEESH? A: There is no way, because they are absolutely wrong and we cannot compromise with anything wrong. It is simple democratic process that sannyasins are the majority, and whoever is th e majority will rule. If they want to rule, they should create a majority and they can have the rule. There is not problem in it. And one should not be so ug ly in behaviour that you don't want to be ruled by the majority, and the minority want s to rule the majority. It is not a take-over. Otherwise, Ronald Reagan has taken over America. If majority supports, then that's a democratic proce ss. And it is not a small majority. There are not more than one dozen people in the dead Antelope, and there are hundreds of sannyasins there. They can bring more people if they want; otherwise, we are going to bring more people. Q: WILL YOU AND RAJNEESHEES GET INVOLVED IN THE OREGON POLITICAL SYSTEM YOU SO DESPISE, RUN FOR OFFICE? A: No. There is no political problem fo r us, and we are not involved in any way with the politics. The sannyasins who are living in Antelope, they were being tortured by the minority. For small legal things that they wanted, they were not allowed. The minority should have thought about it -- it was such a simple thing -- that they were denying the majority thin gs which they legally asked. They are not asking any illegal thing. If they wa nt to make a house, permit will not be given; if they want to purchase a la nd, permit will not be given. On what grounds? Their children will not be admitte d in the school. On what ground? A minority torturing a majority -- that is demo cracy? And since we have come there, nobody can complain that we ha ve harassed any Oregonian? We invited them they gave taken their children ou t of school. And still you think that there should be some peace! And many of them have already left; and the others who are still hanging are hanging because there is nobody else except us to purchase their properties, so they can leave. If they cannot be with us, there is no reason for them to be there; but we are going to be there. Q: CAN WE EXPECT PEOPLE IN RA JNEESHPURAM TO BE RUNNING FOR THE STATE HOUSE OR THE STATE SENATE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS? "},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"A: No. We are not interested in politics.

A: No. But if sometimes the need arises, we will do everything to beat them on their own grounds. But we are a small minority, and the majority of millions of people in Oregon is threatened by us -- this is something ridiculous. We should be threatened by them, we are not; they are threatened by us which is simply absurd. That's why I say I have kn own people from all the countries of the world, but Oregon seems to be special. It seems all the idiots of the world go on being born in Oregon. Strange ! For example, they are unnecessarily harassing us. That's what they did in Antelope. If they had not harassed our people, we were not interested in making a mayor or a council. Why we sh ould bother about all that? We are not interested in power or prestige. In fact, it was so difficult for our people to persuade somebody to be mayor, to persuade somebody to be the councillor -- nobody wants. Who wants to ge t that sort of job? There are so many groovy things going around, and the poor mayor is sitting in the town hall having a meeting about unnecessary things ... We are not interested, but if they harass us too much, we can do anything. We will fight in every possible way. We do not want to harass anyb ody and we do not want to be harassed by anybody. We are harmless people, we will not do an y harm to anybody; but if somebody does harm to us, then we are not Christia ns -- we are not going to follow Jesus Christ that when somebody hits on yo u cheek, give him the other cheek. To me that is insulting the other person who as hit you. It is making him subhuman. You are becoming holier than thou. No. We are just human being and we respect you. If you hit me on one cheek, I will hit yo u your both cheeks imme diately. I just respect you as a human being. You n eeded it, you deserved it, you earned it. There is a story in Buddha's life. He said in one sermon that you should forgive a person seven times. One of his disciples stood up and asked, what about the eighth time? Reasonable question. Buddha was at a lo ss for a moment. He had never expected that somebody would ask about the eighth time, so he said, OK, Make it seventy- seven. But the man stood up again and he said it makes no difference. What about the seventy-eighth time? I ha ve heard one story of a Christian saint who was hit on one of his cheeks. Obviously, being a follower of Jesus, he gave his other cheek, but the man was also some ma n of guts -- he hit on the other cheek even more forcibly.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH BHASKAR, CORREO BRASILIENSE, BRASILIA, BRAZIL QUESTION:* BHAGWAN, I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS MOMENT. BRAZIL'S A VERY POOR COUNTRY. SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING MISERY. THERE IS NO FOOD , NO HOUSING, NO EDUCATION. BUT THEY HAVE THREE HOPES: TO WI N AT THE LOTTERY, TO BE SAVED BY GOD, OR TO MAKE A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. THERE IS A VERY POPULAR EXPRESSI ON IN BRAZIL WHICH SAYS, \"GOD IS BRAZILIAN.\" DO YOU THINK SO? ANSWER:* God must be Brazilian, but it is very unfortunate, because only poor people, suffering people need a God. God is just opium. You can take the opium and forget your suffering your misery, your poverty. So, the more a country is poor, more it sill be addicted with God. It is the same proportion al ways. So the more a country is poor, the more it will be addicted to God. It is the same proportion always. More the country is happy, contented, comfortabl e, who bothers about God? For what? Even in the ordinary life of a man, on e remembers God only when he is in misery, suffering, trouble, sick, bankru pt. When everything is going great, nobody remembers God; there is no need . God is the need of the suffering, downtrodden. So perhaps, if you say seventy percent of Brazilians are without food, without houses, then God must be a Brazilian. God is the property of the poor, the hope of those who are living a hopeless life. And they will continue to live in poverty un til they get rid of this God. So tell the Brazilians he is a Brazilian, so it is our duty to finish him. Once God is finished from the world, man need not suffer, for the simple reason, then we start functioning intelligently. There is no need for poverty, there is no need for misery, there is no need for so much sickness. There is no need for man only to live seventy years. These are just because we have not tried intelligence in living. Wherever we have tried it, we have reached heights of immense dimensions. Only as far as man is concerned, we are dependent on God."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"It is only three hundred years since science came into being. It revolted against the world and all kinds of superstitions. And within three hundred years science has given man so much that in thirty th ousand years, religions have not been able to provide. And this too, against the priests, against the politicians, science has contributed. If politicians and priest s are not there, man can take a quantum leap. There is no barrier between man and paradis e. But the priest wants people to be poor, because only the poor need him. It is a simple business ideology. The politician wants people poor, because only the poor can be conditioned. They are illiterate, uneducated, and they are so much in suffering that any hope and they are ready to buy it. It may be God, it ma y be communism, it may be revolution -- something in the future, faraway. The poor are ready to buy it. The politicians have been selling hope fo r thousands of years. The priests have been selling hope, and it is really strange that after such a long time they are still doing good business. And man seems to be fast asleep, without looking at the whole strategy. The priests and the politicians have to disappear from the earth. Only then the new man -- rich, comfortable, skillful , creative -- can come into being. So it is Brazilians' duty to kill God. He must be there. It is the duty of the poor people of the world to kill God. The rich people would like him to survive. For the rich people God is a beautiful investment, because God creates a buffer between the rich an d the poor. And because of that buffer the rich are protected. Remove the buffer and the rich and all their exploitation will be exposed. And then no priest can go on befooling the poor in the name of God, in the name of fate, in the name of the law of action, past lives. All kinds of things have been invented just to keep the poor poor, ready to be sucked by all kinds of parasites. And the poor man has lived in poverty for so long that he has become accustomed to it. He accepts it as his lif e. He does not know what life is, so he cannot think that he is missing something. To miss something, first you have to have it. And that's the function of my communes. In every country I want my communes to live as richly, abundantly, contented, joyously, without God, without heaven, without hell, without politicians, with ou t priests, and prove to the world that people can live without all this nons ense! And they are living far more beautifully than anybody else. Nobody on the earth is singing a song of joy. Nobody on the earth is in a state to dance. We have to create these oases in the whole desert of the earth, so people at least can see the possibility. They can also be part of this ecstasy, this pilgrimage. First, they will be hostile, because it hurts the ego to see that others have attained, and you have failed. So the first reaction is that the others are pretending. Their laughter is just a makeup. Their joy, their dance is just show-business."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"But how long can you befool yourself by finding such explanations? People cannot go on working for twelve hours, fourteen hours a day, and still be able to laugh, enjoy, dance, love. Sooner or later the outside people are bound to be attracted to our communes. Our communes have to become finally, a kind of university where we teach -- not three r's, but three l's: love, life, laughter. And there is no other hope for the poor. Revolution has failed. In Russia, the politicians were giving them the hope that after the revolution everything will be paradise. Sixty years ha ve passed, there is no sign of any paradise. Of course, one thing has happ ened: they have distributed poverty equally. And they don't allow Russian peop le to come in contact with the rich countries, for the simple fear that if they can see how richly, intensely and totally people are living, then this communism has failed. It could not make them rich, it has only made them all poor -- equally poor. So equality has been achieved. The cla sses have not disappeared. Their names have changed. It was the bourgeois cla ss and the proletariat -- the poor and the rich. Now it is the ordinary citizen an d the member of the communist party. The member of the communist party has more power than any rich man ever had, is using all luxuries for himself th at any rich man ever had, is living comfortably with all technological devices at his hand. And it is only in Russia, that to become a member of the commun ist party is the most difficult. In any other country, you can just become the member if you want -- any moment. No qualifications, no conditions have to be fulfilled. But in Russia, to become a member of th e communist party is a long process, a long discipline -- far longer than a poor man has to travel to become rich. The distance between the hierarchy that is in power and the people is bigger in Russia than anywhere else, for the simp le reason, that the middle class has completely disappeared and it has left a big gap. In other societies, the society is divided, not only in two classes -- about that Marx is absolutely wrong. Society is di vided into many steps. Those two may be the extreme steps -- the poorest and the ri chest, but there are in between both, many classes. So there is a link. And the middle class is the biggest class, because on one hand it joins the poor, on the other hand it joins the superrich. In Russia the middle class has disappeared, because the rich are no more there. So the rich and the middle class both have been reduced to the proletariat. Poverty is so equal that you don't feel hurt, you don't feel jealous. There is nothing to feel jealous of, everybody is just like you. God has failed. Marx has failed. And I don't give any hope. Naturally I cannot fail. They were all giving hope, they could not fulfill the hopes. I am not giving you any hope. On the contrary, I am taking away all your hopes, all your future, so that you can live in this moment. Even if you have not much to live, still one can make this moment a paradise by small things."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"And if the whole humanity is convinced that this is the only moment to live, the misers will disappear on their own accord -- because they are not living, they are accumulating for the future. The monk s and the nuns will disappear, because they are not living in the moment; th ey are living for some heaven, some paradise somewhere. So the basic thing today is, that God -- wh ich is another name of hope, revolution -- which is a materialistic name for God... But they function exactly the same. Their function is to keep people intoxicated. My work is to wake people and stop taking all these opiums. If people are just a little bit awakened, we can disperse all nations, all nuclear weapons, all atomic plants -- which are simply wasting energy. And the same energy can become creative and make peop le as rich as no Alexander the Great was ever rich. The clothes that I am wearing, no empero r in the past could have used them. And I am a poor man! It was simply impossible, because the technology was not there. We can make the whole earth full of em perors living better than Ashoka, Akbara, Alexander, Napoleon -- in every possible way. I don't see any problem, except the mind of the poor itself -- which is so conditioned that it still goes on believi ng in God, who has never answered any prayer, who goes on believing in paradis e. If God was so compassionate, he would have given you paradise here. Why after death? Why not before death? And the poor people have to see the fact that all the revolutions have failed. The French Revolution failed, the Russian Re volution failed, the Chinese Revolution failed. They were bound to fail, becaus e the revolutionaries who were going to take over the power will become the power elite, and the society will be still divided. And these power elites will be more danger ous than the rich people of the old. For the simple reason, in countries like Russia and China, you cannot create another revolution, because the revoluti onaries who have taken over the power know how it has been taken over, so they have prevented all possibilities. Even to talk about revolution is enough to be persecuted, killed, or exiled into Siberia. Even if Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, or Lenin himself, were to be born into Russia, there is no possibility that th eir books would be published. Only government has the publication depart ment. Anything that is published is published by the government, approved by the communist party. And Marx would not have been allowed to sit in the British Museum the whole day doing nothing but reading and taking notes. His whole life he never did anything, except reading and writing. Hi s writings are voluminous. But in Russia that is not possible. He will not be counted as a proletariat. One of my friends was visiting Russia -- he is a Buddhist bhikku, a follower of Buddha, a monk. He told me, \"The first thing that was sh ocking to the Russians were my hands.\""},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"I said, \"Your hands?\" He said, \"Yes. Whenever I shook hand s with them, they immediately shrank back. And they said, `You must be a bourgeois. Your hands don't show that you have ever worked.\"' I told the Buddhist monk, \"You touch my hand. Then you will know that you are a proletariat and I am a bourgeois! That will give you great consolation.\" Marx would not have been possible. No revolution in Russia is possible. Everything has failed that man has done up to now, for the simple reason that man does not change his conditioning an d goes on doing things with the same conditioned mind. All that is needed is a simple deprog ramming. Your mind should be cleaned from being a Brazilian, from being an American, from being an Indian, from being a communist, from being a socialist, from being a Christian, Jew, Hindu -- whatever the name of your limitations. Al l those limitations should be dropped, so you can become an unlimited being. That is freedom, and that is true revo lution, and it is an individual affair. So take my message to Brazil, \"please st op hoping, and start living! Out of your living there is hope. Out of your hoping there is only death and nothing else.\" Q: BHAGWAN, TODAY, BRAZIL HA S THE SECOND HIGHEST RATE OF AIDS IN THE WORLD. DO YOU TH INK IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND A MEDICINE AGAINST AIDS? AND WHY ARE THE GAYS MORE SENSITIVE TO AIDS? A:* First, the homosexuals have created the disease AIDS. It is a homosexual contribution to humanity. Then it can spre ad to heterosexuals, but the source of the disease is homosexuality. Few things will have to be understood. One, homosexuality is not the way of nature, not the way of existence. Existence always wants the opposite polari ties to meet. Then only you can create a better generation. Homosexuality is un creative, and homosexuality is between two men, two women. There is no polarity, there is no tension, no challenge. First, people started becoming homose xuals in monasteries, soldier camps, school hostels, university hostels -- wherev er man was separated from women. It was going to happen. Biology knows nothing about your moralities. By the time a boy is fourteen, he is capable of giving birth to a child. The sa me is true about the girl. But in all the societies, this is the time when their sex is repressed, and this is also the time when their sex energy is at its climax -- between fourteen and twenty-one. Nearabout eighteen you have your peak sexual energy, which you will never have again. It seems all societies have conspired that man should not know the blissfulness of orgasmic experience. This was a beautifu l way to divert: that he has to be"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"educated first, he has to go to the univer sity. And by the time he is back from the university -- he may be twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight -- he is already on the decline. He has lost the time when he could have attained orgasmic experience. Now he can only experience ejaculation. That proves to the religious people that it is sheer wastage of energy, you don't get anything. And after making love, a man feels frustrated, nothing comes out of it. He has lost the right timing. The society has diverted him. If we want a more joyous world, the best thing will be that between fourteen and twenty-one, all girls and all boys are given birth control methods and total freedom to mix with many boys, with ma ny girls, because you will never have this energy again. It is lost, then it is lost forever. Then you will have to wait for next life. That is why everybody is wait ing for the next life, because they have missed something very essentia l in this life. They may no t be aware of it. Perhaps they are not aware, but there is a woun d inside. Something that could have blossomed in them has not blossomed. That's why there is so much despair. And then all the religions are teaching celib acy. First, they prevent the best time to know the secrets and mysteries of se x, and then they impose the idea of celibacy, that it is very spiritual. It is simply against nature, against your biology. The monks in the monasteries of all the religions, have been the first to find homosexuality. And the disease is basi cally homosexual, because nature never forgives. You have to follow the law. If you put your hand into the fi re, you are going to be burned. Nature simply goes on its way. There is no question that you are a saint, so you will not be burned, you are a celibate so you will not be burned, only the sinners will be burned -- that is stupidity. Everybody is going to be burned who puts his hand into the fire. The law of nature is impartial, accept s no exception. And anybody who goes against nature, sooner or later will have to suffer for it. Homosexuality was the greatest crime against nature. Few things to be understood before yo u can understand why AIDS evolved out of it. In ancient China, it was a common practice if an emperor was getting old and his people did not want him to die, the meth od that was used to prolong his life was not a medicine. It was two beautiful young girls who will be lying on both of his sides in the night. And strange as it ma y seem, it has worked for thousands of years in China. Finding himself between two beautiful girls, he again becomes psychologically young. A great lust for life arises in him. He would like to be young again. Playing with those girls, there are moments when he forgets that he is old. And the life of emperors in China has been the longest of any emperor in the whole world. This was the medicine. @B003 I mention it so that I can explain what is happening to the homosexuals. Because they are both men, their energies don't have any tension, their energies don't"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"have any challenge, their energies by an d by start losing the will to live. For what? There is no challenge. They start losing the desire to live. They may not be conscious of it. Just as the Chinese emperors started feeling a tremendous desire to live more, perhaps fore ver-life is so beautiful it is not worth losing great lust arises in them. That lust gives you energy. That lust provokes all your stagnant forces into functioning. You can see it happen to a man who suddenly falls in love with a woman and you meet him on the road. You met him yesterday, too, but you can see the difference. The man is looking radiant. His walk has a dance in it. He is whistling. And this man used to walk th e street as if he were dragging himself against his will because he has to reach his home. But today he is not walking, but running. because he has to reach the home -- the woman will be waiting there. Something that was dormant in him ha s become dynamic. The homosexuals slowly, slowly go on losing their desire to live. and that is the basic cause of the disease called AIDS. It is not a disease. If it was a diseas e, there would be a possibility of finding medicine for it. This is the most strange thing about it -- it is not a disease. Otherwise, it may take some time, but we will be able to find some medicine for it. But it is simply loss of the will to li ve. Now, what medicine can bring the will back? The man really wants deep down to die. He has dropped all hopes to reach the bank. He is ready to be drowned any moment. He has given himself a life sentence. He has crucified himself. Jesus only said everybody has to carry hi s cross on his own shoulders -- I wonder why he forgot that everybody has to crucify himself also. But people are doing that: carrying their cross on their shoulder s, and then finally putting themselves on the cross. Homosexuality has to disappear if we want AIDS to be prevented. All homosexuals have to be taught again that the woman is something significant to their life. Her warmth is something significant to keep them alive. Now it is a well-established psychological fact that if a child is given every nourishment except the warmth of the body , blankets are given -- he is not kept in cold, he is warm; every food that is needed for his growth is given -- but there is no human touch anywhere. There is nobody to hug him, to hold him close to her chest, to her breasts where he can feel warmth, love. They have tried with one child keeping scientifically perfectly healthy checking that nothing is going wron g, and another child is kept with the mother -- no check, nobody is bothered whether anythin g is going wrong or not. But the first child dies within three months. And this experiment has been first done on animals many times, and the same is the result: without the mother's warmth, the feminine warmth, the child perhaps never gets the will to live."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"That is my explanation for the phen omenon. He never gets, in the very beginning, a desire to live. This is on e side of the case which is now well established. Homosexuals cannot give to each other the warmth that they need. They need a feminine warmth. Two women cannot give to each other the sa me quality of energy and love that a man can give to them. But it has to be understood that AIDS is not created by lesbians. That too is very strange. Homosexuals have created AIDS, not lesbians. The reason is clear: a woman is always a receiving center, and man is always an assertive energy. Two women can live together without disturbing each other's life for the simple reason that they are not assertive agents. They are completely closed and alone . They can be togethe r, but they will not affect each other. Two men are both assertive. So when homosexuals are making love, they not are giving energy to each other which is not n eeded at all -- they both need feminine energy, feminine warmth. So lesbians have no part in contributing Aids. I am sorry to say that on that point they have not proved equal to men. Homosexuality has to disappear from the world, and we can make it disappear, at least in our communes. It is just a question of unde rstanding. And, because it is artificial, superficial, it can be easily removed. And precautions should be taken agains t AIDS because it is already rampant. This is not the beginning -- we are almost in the middle of it. The ind is not far away. It spreads like wildfire. And now they have come to find that even kissing can give it to you. Looks as though medical people will not be able to find any medicine for it. We have to find a way, and we can find a way. My own understanding is that in our communes slowly, slowly homosexuality should disappear. About lesbians we can take care later on -- it may not be giving AIDS, but it is ugly, unnatural. Perhaps someday it may bring somethin g better than AIDS, nobody knows, because nobody knew about AIDS befo re and homosexuality has been in existence since religions ha ve been in existence. It took thousands of years to create th e situation in which AIDS can happen. But to me it is not a disease -- it has noth ing to do with medicine. Medicine and medical care can keep it from spreading, can keep the man who already has it, alive to the maximum -- that is two years... if he is completely isolated where no infection is possible. That gives the clue to me : the AIDS patient loses a ll resistance power. His life energy has shrunk withinwards. The petals of his life energy are no more open -- they are closed, they are getting ready for the night. Hence, any infection can enter into his body. Because his own will to live is not there, his body will not create the antibodies to prevent AIDS. In my communes I will suggest: First, try to help homosexuals turn into heterosexuals. Everybody in the commune should go to every possible"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"test, because we love each other so much that we would not like one of us to become the cause of the death of so many people. No sannyasin would like it. And we are not going to condemn, because he is simply a victim -- victim of Jesus Christ, victim of Mahavira, victim of Buddha, and those big criminals are no more there. Otherwise, they should be shot immediately. Fortunately, they are dead. So help them -- these are victims of thou sands of years of homosexuality. Respect them. Be loving to them and compassi onate. And then each commune has to create a corner for them where they can live. And my idea is that a male AIDS patient should live with a female AIDS patient. Perhaps that may be the only medicine po ssible. I say perhaps because it has not been tried, and I am not a man of medici ne. I am just crazy, and crazy ideas come to me. But when nothing is working, why not try a crazy man's idea? All the sane people are saying there is nothing that can be done, so you are not going to lose anything except a madman's idea. My idea is that a woman and man -- both having AIDS so there is no question of giving AIDS to each other, or as much they can give, that is up to them , there is nothing more to it -- have come to the very end of the journey. But my feeling is that the female en ergy and male energy meeting again may provoke the will to live. The warmth of a woman, the love of the man may postpone the date of their death. And this can be done only in my comm une with my people, because they all understand each other. They would like to help each other. Here we are going to start... soon. And perhaps that may prove the only cure. If it is out of homosexuality that the disease is born, then something out of heterosexuality will be the medicine. This is my simple logic. Q: BHAGWAN, YOUR SANNYASINS IN BRAZIL ARE TRYING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO MAKE SOME BEAUTIFUL SPACE WHERE EVERYBODY COULD LIVE TOGETHER, AND IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THEM? A: It is difficult? Q:YES. MY FEELING IS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO MA KE BUSINESS, TO MAKE A COMMUNE. A: You talk with Sheela and Savita about that. Some way can be found, and a commune can be created. Start on a small scale and slowly it can grow. And few businesses you can do very easily. And we can send you sannyasins from outside, all around the world to help you. For example, you can start publications. In Brazil, many of my book s are published, but they are published"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"by publishers. Somebody else is taking the profit out of th em -- our sannyasins should publish them themselves. Jus t that will bring you good money. There is no need to create huge pala ces. Just workable houses, simple. For example, in India where poor people are in millions, in a village a beautiful hut can be made almost for nothing. This has been a tradition in Indian villages that whenever somebody is making a house, the whole village will help. And the houses are made with bamboos -- the ba mboo functions as the wall -- cow dung mixed with mud is put on both sides of the bamboos, whitewashed it looks so clean, so beautiful. And just bamboos on the roof with mud tiles. For two hundred rupees, you can make a beautifu l house. Two hundred rupees means, today, five dollars, or at the most ten dollars. Between five to ten dollars, you can make a house. So when the situation is bad, then think of your local products-wheth er bamboo is available, other kinds of wood are available cheap -- and use that material. There is no need for marbles, and there is no need.... Yes, one day wh en you have money then have marble palaces, but meanwhile, till the palaces co me, you need a certain kind of shelter that can be made very easily. Not difficult -- you can create a commun e of five hundred people with small cottages. And you can start businesses. For example, public ation you can start with your own press, your own editors, your own designers. And you can make it an art -- hand binding, hand stitching. And in fact you can sell in the market fo r a better price than book printed mass scale in a factory, because that will not have that beauty. And about other things you talk to Sheela and Savita. There is no problem which cannot be solved. But Brazil needs a commune. Q: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SOMETHI NG ABOUT THE THIRD WORLD WAR. WE FEEL EACH DAY THE WAR COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER. IS THERE SOME POSSIBLE WAY TO PREVENT THE WAR? A: The truth is that the nuclear war is never going to happen. Even when I say it is coming closer and closer, the reason to say it is not that the war is coming closer and closer, the reason is to awak en you somehow that the war is coming so close now there is no time to waste -- get up as quickly as possible before the war finishes you. But the third world war is impossible for the simple reason that both the nations America and the Soviet Union are equally balanced with nuclear weapons. And if a war starts, the whole point of a war is to win, but in a nuclear war nobody wins. So war has lost its basic foundati on. Why should you fight when both are going to be finished in it? The possibility of one becoming victorious and the other being defeated is no more there. So I say with nuclear war, war has reached to such totality that it has committed suicide. Now war is not possible -- I mean nuclear war is not possible."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Just the other day I saw a petition of American scientists who had made the first nuclear war plant in America -- the pion eers of nuclear weapons. Fifty scientists have signed the petition to the presid ent and to the Supreme Court that we are trembling with fear -- what we have done . And we have already so much nuclear weapons on both sides that they are enou gh to destroy all life from earth within ten minutes. Those fifty scientists who have been making nuclear war possible have visualized the situation that is happening . The same is happening in Russia -- the scientists are becoming aware that what th ey are creating is a mass scale world- wide suicide. It is so absurd and meaningless. Those fifty scientists have mentioned one thing which I have been telling again and again: that up to now all our efforts to find some antidote for the nuclear weapon has failed. And we don't think that we will be able to find something that destro ys the power of nuclear weapons -- no counter energy is available. It is because of this fact they have pu t the petition because now it is simply destruction -- there is no way of protec ting anybody. I am tremendously happy that nuclear weapons have come to a po int where fighting becomes useless, war becomes utterly stupid. And even if seeing this stupidity the politicians decide to go for a nuclear war, then I think this earth deserves it. If its leaders are ready to destroy it, th en perhaps it is g ood we finished. The universe will go on -- it has been going on before this earth was born, it will go on with the same beauty and with the sa me splendor. It doesn't matter that the earth is gone. There are 50,000 planets exac tly like this earth in the universe where life exists. So if the situation for life to exist on th is earth disappears, the bodies will be dead here and your souls will be transplanted into other planets. They don't need missiles, they don't need rockets, they ca n simply jump a quantum leap from this planet. But as far as I am concerned, I am totally convinced that war is impossible for the simple reason that that's why they have been postponing it. And they will go on postponing it -- they want to find someth ing, either party -- whoever finds it first will immediately go for nuclear war because he can protect his country and you cannot protect your country. Then war again gains meaning -- somebody will be victorious and somebody will be defeated. But I don't see there is any way to find an antidote. For the simp le reason that 300 years of continuous creation of war me chanisms, destructive weapons, has led to the nuclear weapon. You have never work ed for life, you have never thought about how to create more beautiful life-he althier, intelligent, lengthier. If side by side you were working for these 300 years , putting your whole energy as you have been putting into war, perhaps you ma y be able to find an antidote -- but there is not time enough."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"If all the scientists of the world together start working now, perhaps in one hundred years they may be able to fi nd a clue which nullifies all nuclear weapons. That seems to be impossible. So to me the third world war is over. We have passed it -- now think about the fourth. And prepare for the fo urth. Third is not possible. And I am not a pacifist, and I don't want my sannyasins to be pacifists. A pacifist is against war; so much so that if he had nuclear weapons he will fight with nuclear weapons against war. A pacifist is not a peaceful man. Our sannyasins are not pacifists, but peace loving, silence loving, trying to find their inner serenity. If we can create aro und the world millions of people who are centered in their meditation, who know who they are, who know the tremendous bliss that comes when you en ter into your innermost core, that will create a energy blanket around the earth. Th at is the only possibility to prevent. So directly I am not concerned with w ar. My concern is how to create more peaceful people, more loving people, more meditative people. Because if the balance for peace-loving people is more in the world, then any war can be prevented. If there are millions of meditators in the world, nobody can force them to go war, to go destroy innocent people. In fact, th ese people who have attained some light within themselves will become a tremendo us barrier -- not only against nuclear war -- but against any kind of war. I am aware that nuclear war is impossible, and it is possible that the Soviet Union and America will come to a conclusion to drown all their nuclear weapons into the Pacific -- I don't know who gave it th e name Pacific. Perhaps for this purpose -- and stop all traffic in the Pacific. Althou gh it is five miles deep, there is always danger anything can trigger, and then it can become a chain explosion. So for at least a decade, no traffic in the Pacific. Drown all the weapons there. And my feeling is, soon Russia and Ameri ca will come to that conclusion. But that does not mean war will not happen. Then old type of war -- first world war, second world war -- those type of wars will continue. Thinking of the third world war, they look like children's pl ay. But they were immensely horrible. So as far as I am concerned, third world war is out of the qu estion. But still other wars will be there. If we want to prevent all kinds of war in the world, then we have to spread the red people to the farthest corner everywhere, so that we have a commune of millions of young people who declare that they are the owners of the earth, and they refuse any kind of passport, any visa. Movement is our birthright, and the whole earth is ours. If we have millions of people to destroy the boundaries of nati ons, the boundaries of religions, then there is nothing to fight for. Fight with whom? So my direct effort is not to prevent w ar or to be a pacifist and print pamphlets against war and protest and put posters on the walls and scr eam and shout. All that nonsense is not going to prevent. They were doing the sa me thing before the"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"first world war. They were doing the same thing before the second world war. They are doing the same thing before th e third world war. They are just useless people. Good intentioned, but unintelligent. My effort is to create a vast atmosphere of peace around the earth and that will be enough. War will become impossible. In every country we will have thousand s of sannyasins who will prevent that country itself, because they will say, \"F irst kill us and then you can kill the neighboring country.\" They will be sitting on the boundary line meditating, \"Kill us first.\" On both the sides. On the other sides also. Back to back. And I don't think any politician has th e courage to kill millions of his own people, because then the whole country will destroy the government and the politicians and everything. Because these children are not doing anything wrong, and they belong to the whole country. So create peaceful people, and if time arrives, we will risk all our peace-loving people. And I don't think that any country can go to war. It has never happened that the people of the same country are opposing its own government, that \"War is not going to be our game anymore.\" And it is happening in both the countries. The en emy camp -- young people are ready there too: \"Kill us first and then you can do whatsoever you want.\" There are a thousand-and-one possibilities to change this world. But the basic need is to spread more and more sannyasins all over the world. Already the red color is no more associated with communists. We have taken its possession already, copyright is ours now. Even in Russia we have a beautiful group of sannyasins. Just the other day there was an article against me in a Russian magazine. They have been persecuting sannyasins. They have been taking their books away. The sannyasins have done nothing wrong -- no illegal thing, no crim e -- so they cannot do anything to them. In the article they have published the ma in prominent sannyasins' names, so that they can be recognized by the people anywhere, because they don't wear red clothes, they don't wear a mala. They are my underground sannyasins. They meet also in the basements of houses, so that they can meditate and nobody hears. They can listen to the tape, they can read a book. And they are more excited than anywhere else, because for sixty years Russian youth has been missing some thing which is the very flavor of youth, something revolutionary, something rebellious. For si xty years, Soviet youth is the poorest youth in the world. From their childhood they si mply become adult. The youth -- that season -- never comes. Those days of dreaming of changi ng the whole world, of changing man, of creating a new humanity -- if they are not there, youth loses all its glamour, its splendor. So they are immensely excited. And I kn ow that communist countries will soon be having thousands of sannyasins -- without any question."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"And nobody else can provide communist countries anything that I am offering to them. They have been taught there is no God. I say, \"Perfectly good, there is no God.\" They have been told there is no hell, no heaven. Perfectly true. They have been told not to belie ve -- that's my whole teaching. Only on one point... I am giving them something new -- that is meditation. And Marx or Lenin or Stalin, nobody has said that meditation is against communism. Just sitting silently, doing nothing... How can it be against communism? Or against anybody? So my sannyasins need not be afraid in communist countries either, because my teaching agrees with Marx on every poin t, except meditation. But that is the whole secret: that meditation will dest roy all those communist ideas, those Marxian concepts. And about meditation, ther e is not a single word against it in the whole communist literature, because they have never even heard about it. Marx knew nothing about it. So try to spread meditation far and wide , and find out whatever is possible in your situation. The country is poor, then manage something. But communes have to exist. And once a commune is there, soon you will be able to produce many things, create many things. And the commune is not going to rema in poor long. And it will become a prototype for other people, \"If we can create and we can live comfortably and we are not starving, and we are rejoicing, why can't you just do the same as we are doing.\" Okay.

The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH FRED BRUNING OF NEWSDAY, LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK Q: BHAGWAN, HOW DO YOU STAY WARM IN SUCH A COLD ROOM? A: is not cold. Q: TO ME IT IS VERY COLD. A: To me it is only cool. Q: HAVE YOU ALWAYS FELT BETTER IN COLD SURROUNDINGS, EVEN AS A CHILD? A: Always Q: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THAT IS ASKED IN MEDITATION: WHO ARE YOU? A: It is a little bit complicated. It is no t an ordinary question. When you ask \"Who am I?\" you are not waiting for an answer. There is nobody to answer you. But by constantly inquiring \"Who am I?\" sl owly, slowly other thoughts start disappearing. You become more and more attuned with only one thing -- this quest: \"Who am I?\" When all thoughts have disappeared and only the sound \"Who am I?\" remains, that is the mirac le moment. That sound also disappears. First it kills all your thoughts, and finally it commits suicide -- not that you get an answer, but the question disappears. And th at is the moment of ultimate bliss.

I am always the witness. If I describe myself -- in the very nature of things -- that description becomes false, because I am again witnessi ng it.

I can describe the color of your hair, I can describe the clothes you are wearing, but I cannot describe you, the being that you are -- that remain s indescribable. And that's the whole mystery of existence: that at the ultimate core, at the very center, is something that you can experience, but you cannot explain. Q: DO YOU EVER HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR WORK, ABOUT YOUR ROLE? A: There is no question. Fo r thirty-two years I have not encountered any doubt in me, any question in me. Yes, before I became enlightened I had millions of questions, millions of doubts. The moment I came to know myself, that dark night was over.

I am a simple, sincere, straightforward man. What do you mean by fidelity? Fidelity means: when you don't love, even then remain faithful. Anything that goes against love is ugly. What is the need of fidelity? If I love you, is that not en ough? You need some fidelity too? That means there is a doubt in your mind -- you are afraid: today love is there; tomorrow it may not be. So something lega l, religious -- the church, the court, and some condition of fidelity -- so when love goes away and the spring is over, you can cling to these props: fidelity, court, law religion, church. Love needs nothing. Q: HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED MARRIAGE? A: Never considered marriage. Q: DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN? A: No. How can I have children? Not even my sannyasins have children. Q: WHY DO YOU SAY: \"HOW COULD I HAVE CHILDREN?\" OF COURSE YOU COULD HAVE CHILDREN. A: I don't want my child to be in this world with Ronald Reagan, Soviet Union, Ethiopia, India. In this starving world, where people are piling up nuclear weapon to destroy the whole planet... I wo uld not like my child in this world -- no! Q: WHO DO YOU CONSIDER HISTOR Y'S MOST ADMIRABLE FIGURES AND MOST DESPICABLE? A: Your whole history is bunk.... I mean the whole human history is bunk, because it is written by people who were vict orious; it is all false. For example, in India, Britain ruled for three hundred years and they were the writers of history. And whatsoever they wrote was wrong. Th ey were not writing about the reality, the fact.

And all the old books were destroyed. Trotsky himsel f had escaped and he was in Mexico, writing history. He was on the last page , when one of the murderers from Stalin hit him on the head with a hammer. Looking at Trotsky's history -- and he was one of the chief characters in the history... Lenin was not a very impressive person; he had no charisma. He was a great organizer... Trotsky had charisma, and he had influence over the masses. Both together were immensely helpful and complementary to each other. Q: YOU HAVE READ WIDELY? A: I have read immensely. Q: DESPITE THE FLAWS IN HISTORY, WHO DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE ADMIRABLE INDIVIDUALS? A: You will not even have heard those names that I consider admirable. For example, I consider admirable a poet in Japan, Basho, who has written a few small haikus -- three-line poetries. But ea ch haiku is a tremendous experience of meditation. No poet in the whole world ha s been able to put so much in those few words. But only a meditator can understand it. Q: YOU HAVE EXPRESSED YOURS ELF IN THE PAST ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, THOUGH? A: I have spoken on many individuals. Q: JESUS FOR INSTANCE? A: Yes, I have spoken on Jesus, Moses, Mohammed. I have spoken on hundreds of people... There are three hundred fifty books that I have spoken; I have never written anything -- those are all spoken words. I have admired one Chinese: Chuang Tzu. He is the most absurd character in the whole history of man; that is why I admire him. Q: WHY DO YOU ADMIRE ABSURDITY? "},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"A: Because life is absurd. To search for mean ing in it is going to be frustrating. That's why western philosophy has come to a certain philosophy of existentialism, which talks only of meaninglessness. Chuan Tzu says that there is no need to search for meaning. If you search for meaning, then you will end up in meaningl essness, and that will be frustrating. Life is an absurdity -- it is a mystery. You need not search for meaning, you have just to live it, enjoy it. And I agree with him. Q: YOU SEEM TO DELIGHT IN CONTRA DICTIONS. I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? A: Yes, that's what I am saying; I am al ways contradicting myself knowingly, so that nobody can make a consistent philosophy out of me. Q: BUT IN THE END, WHAT WI LL BE LEFT BUT A SERIES OF CONTRADICTIONS? A: Those contradictions, if you pass th rough all of them, first will create confusion in you; second, will create a trem endous silence in you. If you persist, if you don't escape from the confusion, they will create a silence in you -- and that silence will be a revelation. So I am not giving a philosophy to people; I am giving a device for them to discover the ultimate silence of existence -- which is meaningless, as meaningless as a roseflower is.

She wakes me up at six o'clock in the morning. And then one and a half hours I enjoy my bathroom. Q: ONE AND A HALF HOURS? A: One and a half hours -- that is minimum. Q: WHAT GOES ON? Great things...

A: Yes, I have not only one bathroom -- I have two, because if something goes wrong with one bathroom, the other is a ll ready, emergency ready. I cannot miss anything. Q: WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY? A: Just some plumbing problem arising... Because I cannot miss anything -- I want to take as much out of each moment as it is possible. I love taking a bath(tub), playing with soap bubbl es. Albert Einstein discovered everything about the universe, playing with soap bubbles. My one and a half hours is nothing -- he was sometimes six hours in his bathtub.

A: Just a little exercise in my bathroom. Q: ALSO IN THE BATHROOM... A: My bathroom is big enough. Q: AND THEN IS THERE A PERIOD OF STUDY?

She is my secretary; if she feels that something is happening which ne eds to be informed, then she brings it to me. Q: IS THERE ANYTHING IN CURRENT HISTORY? A: Yes, right now she is bringing ev ery information about AIDS, which is significant. Q: IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN SEPTEMBER YOU WILL INVITE SOME VICTIMS OF AIDS TO THE COMMUNE FOR CARE. IS THAT TRUE? A: Perhaps, perhaps. Spread the gossip. Q: HOW DO YOU THINK THE SANNYASINS WOULD RESPOND? "},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"A: Just the way they are responding -- they will laugh.... They will laugh, because my sannyasins don't consider death a calamity; it is a celebration, a new beginning. Q: DO YOU THINK AIDS REPRESENTS SOME COSMIC PUNISHMENT FOR WHAT'S GONE WRONG SOMEHOW? A: No. There is no punishment in existenc e and no reward -- each action has its consequence. It depends on you, what you want to call it. Q: SO AIDS HAS NO SIGNIFICANCE BEYOND ITSELF? IT EXISTS, IT KILLS AND IT MEANS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT? A: That's all -- nothing more than that; nothing more in it. Religions bring the idea of punishment and reward, and th rough that they bring heaven and hell and the whole theology: that you are a si nner, that you are a saint. To me, there are only people -- neither sinners nor saints. And everybody has to do what he wants to do. If a person ends up with AIDS it is totally his responsibility; he was doing things which have brought him to a certain end. And he should be perfectly happy with it -- nobody has forced him. Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS: HOMOSEXUALITY AND DRUG ABUSE? A: I don't. Each individual's thinking... as far as I am concerned, anything that is unnatural, anything that is not part of th e program or your biology, physiology, is going to lead you into trouble. But you may like the trouble -- you may love the challenge. I am against homosexuality, lesbianism an d all kinds of perversions. But that is my personal opinion. If any individual chooses to be homosexual, there is no condemnation in me for the person. I am not going to throw him into hell; I am not going to judge him. That is his [way]. I have told my opinion; [if] still he feels that homosexuality is the only thing that is appealing to him, then he has every right to be a homosexual. Q: BUT YOU SEE THAT AS AN UNNATURAL ACT? A: Not only see -- I say also say that it is an unnatural act. But you are free to do something unnatural. Q: WHAT FOR YOU IS SEXUAL PERVERSION? "},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"A: It is a religious disease, sexual perversion.... It is a religious disease. All the religions of the world are responsible fo r it because first they started forcing celibacy on people, which is unnatural. Unless you are impotent, you cannot be celibate. And the strangest thing is: not a single impotent person has become enlightened in the whole history of man. That means that all these people -- Ga utam Buddha, Jesus Christ, Krishna -- all these people were more sexual than ordinary people. It is their oversexual energy that does not feel contented with women and children and the ordinary, mundane world. After all this experience they are still too full of energy and they want to go on some higher quest. All these people are oversexual. No impotent person has contributed anything to the world, because he cannot be creative. His basic creative energy, sex en ergy, is missing. Telling people to be celibate and then putting monks in one pl ace, in one monastery and putting nuns into another place, and not allowing me n and women to meet, you are creating the situation for homosexuality. So Catholics are responsible, Hindus are responsible, Buddhists are responsible -- they are creating the situation. Q: I DON'T THINK CATHOLICS OR BUDDHISTS OR HINDUS ARE ANY MORE LIKELY TO BE HOMOSEXUALS THAN ANYONE ELSE. A: They have to be. Particularly their monks -- what will they do? Q: BUT THAT DOESN'T EFFECT NECESSARILY THE MASSES OF PEOPLE. A: That reflects, because th ose... for example, in India there are five million Hindu monks. Now these five million Hindu monks are staying in Hindu families, are coming in contact with Hindu children, women -- all kinds of people. And they are bound to spread th eir perversion in every possible way. They will be abusing children for their sexuality. They have been caught: just now, three or four days before, one Christian priest has been imprisoned for one and a half years because he was abusing small children. Q: BUT THESE SEEM ISOLATED INCIDENTS... A: They are not isolated. They don't come to your notice -- that is one thing... because the church wants to repress them , the society wants to repress them, the government wants to repress them. How many homosexual senators do you have? Q: GOT ME... A: No information about your senators."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":" Q: YOU SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE ALL... A: I know. Q: HOW DO YOU KNOW? A: One personally I know. Q: YOU PERSONALLY KNOW A HOMOSEXUAL UNITED STATES SENATOR? A: Yes, yes. Yes.... Not only homosexual, perhaps he may have AIDS. Q: WHO IS THE PERSON? A: Name I cannot tell you -- that's your work to find out. Q: HOW DID YOU COME UPON THIS INFORMATION? A: I will not tell you anything, but one thing I can tell you: that every vested interest is trying in every way to repre ss such information. For example, the pope before this pope was a homosexual -- ever yone in Italy knew. He was a bishop in Milan, and he was always hanging aro und with a homosexual, and everyone knew. Then he became the pope and that homosexual man who was hanging around him became his secretary, came to Vatican. Q: WHEN YOU SAY EVERYBODY KNOW, WHO IS EVERYBODY? A: Because you could have asked in Mila n to anybody. These are things which people know, but which will not come to be given as evidence in the court. These are not easily provable things. Q: BUT PEOPLE SAY THINGS ABOUT YOU THAT MAY NOT BE TRUE. A: There is no problem. No, no -- you can ask me. I am not a pope and I am not a president and I don't care a bit about an y respectability -- you can ask me. And I can put their information. correct. They may not be well informed. I can inform them about myself perfectly well. Q: THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO SPEAK OF. A: No -- not a single thing."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":" Q: PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE... A: Whatever they say, you just tell me. Q: THEY SAY THAT YOU HAVE DE VELOPED THIS ORGANIZATION FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT, THAT YOU ARE A LLIAR, THAT YOU ARE A CHEAT, THAT YOU TREAT PEOPLE UNFAIRLY , THAT YOU HAVE BEEN COARSE AND UNKIND IN YOUR DEALINGS WITH OREGON AND OF ANTELOPE FOR VERY PARTICULAR SELFISH REASONS. A: So start with one, so I can answer yo u.... For example, I have not been coarse and unfair to Oregonians; I have been ve ry lenient and very liberal. I should not have been so liberal. And from now on wards I will be coarse and I will show them what roughness means. Q: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN TOO LIBERAL, TOO LENIENT? A: We have just been factual -- calling a spade a spade. But now I am going to call a spade a fucking spade -- you can go and tell those Oregonians. Q: I THINK PEOPLE FEEL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SOME TIME. A: No, I have not been doing anything. Go point by point, so I can put you right. Q: THE POINT WAS THAT THINGS CAN BE SAID ABOUT PUBLIC PEOPLE WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY TRUTH TO WHAT IS BEING SAID. A: No. But you don't come across a man lik e me in your public people -- you can ask me and I can answer you directly. Fo r example, you cannot ask your public people; they depend on you, their resp ectability depends on you. If a senator says he is a homosexual, perhaps next el ection he is gone. But as far as I am concerned, I am not dependent on anybod y in the whole world -- not even your God. So I can simply be true. Only I can be true -- anybody who is dependent cannot be true. Q: I MIGHT ASK YOU HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN THE BANK, AND YOU MAY TELL ME THAT YOU HA VE NOTHING IN THE BANK. I CAN'T TELL WHETHER THAT IS TRUE OR NOT. A: Just listen to me: you can inquire.

I don't have even a diary to keep my accounts."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"I don't have any connection with any bank in the whole world.

And I am ready -- if they can find a single paise in my name anywhere... Q: YOUR BEING WILLING TO ANSW ER QUESTIONS DOESN'T SETTLE THE ARGUMENT. A: Nothing settles the argument. Has any argument ever been settled? Is it settled that Jesus was the son of a virgin girl? For two thousand years theologians have been arguing, and he was simply a bastard. Q: YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS MORE EASILY DEALT WITH THOUGH... A: No, this is a simpler case to decide, because a virgin woman giving birth is a simple matter to decide. My case of bank account will take a long investigation. Q: BUT IT COULD BE DETERMINED. A: Yes, it can be determined. Q: THE OTHER CANNOT. A: The other can also be determined -- I determine it. And no medical person can refuse me. Q: THAT HAS TO DO WITH MATTERS OF FAITH. WHAT IS YOUR NOTION OF FAITH? A: Faith is simply for the ignorant an d the idiots; faith is not for intelligent people. Intelligent people try to know th ings. Either they know, or they don't know. If they don't know, they simp ly accept that they don't know. Q: BUT PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE FAITH IN YOU. A: Nobody can say that. Q: I TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE HERE WHO SAY... A: Then they are wrong... Q: ... WHO SAY THEY TRUST YOU.

Q: IT SEEMS TO ME, THAT MAKES YOU MORE APPEALING TO PEOPEL. A: So what do you say: Should I start sa ying to everybody they should believe in me, everybody should have faith in me? -- will that convince you? Q: I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOU FOR THIS VERY KIND OF CONVERSATION. A: That is people's business, but as f ar as I am concerned, I can only do two things: either I can say, \"Have faith in me\" or I can say \"Don't have faith in me,\"or I can remain silent. But in all the cases I am guilty. Just look at the situation: if I am silent, you can say I am silent and that is misleading If I say \"Don't have faith in me\" you say, \"They have faith in Yo u because they love Your idea of not having faith in You.\" Q: EXACTLY RIGHT, YES. YOU ENCOURAGE QUESTIONING, BUT IS THERE ANY FORMAT SET UP FOR YOU TO BE QUESTIONED BY THE PEOPLE? A: No format is settled. They have to as k their questions. And there is no need for any format, for the simple reason that I don't come to you or to my people with any answers ready -- your question cr eates the response in me. So if I know, I will tell you. If I don't know, I will tell you I don't know anything about it. Q: A SANNYASIN MY FEEL THAT PERHAPS THE MONEY SHOULD BE USED DIFFERENTLY. HOW WOULD THAT PERSON MAKE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT HE HAS RESERVATIONS AB OUT THE WAY MONEY IS SPENT? A: I have nothing to do with money, an d I have nothing to do with how it is spent. Q: HAVE YOU NO INFLUENCE IN THE WAY MONEY IS SPENT? A: No, I have no influence, no information -- that is different corporations, different corporation heads; they have to settle their own things. Q: I THINK WHEN YOU SAY THAT, PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE IT. A: That is their business.... By not believi ng it, it does not mean that they are right.

It simply proves that God is just a bogus word. You can go on arguing about it for millenia an d you will not come to any conclusion, because in the first place there was nothing to conclude about. Q: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A CAPITALIST? A: I am a super-capitalist -- without a single cent. Q: YOU ARE IN A VERY FORTUNATE POSITION. A: That's why I am known as the Blessed One. I don't have to bother about any taxation. I don't have to bother about any bank account. I don't have to bother to earn, and [know] how to spend -- and still everything is available to me. Q: HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY YOU HAVE COME INTO SUCH GOOD LUCK? A: No -- I have simply accepted everything that has come (on) my way. Good or bad, I have accepted it. Q: DID YOU FORESEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS YEARS AGO? A: No. Q: WHAT WERE YOUR HOPES THEN? A: I am a without-hope person. Q: NEVER HAD HOPES FOR YOURSELF? NEVER DREAMS AS A YOUNG MAN? A: No. Just before twenty-one, I had. Q: WHAT WERE YOUR DREAMS THEN? A: They were dreams about becoming en lightened, and they were fulfilled. They were dreams about knowing myself, and th ey were fulfilled. And after that,now I have nothing to dream. "},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Q: YOUR DREAMS DID NOT HAVE ANY KIND OF MATERIAL ELEMENT IN THEM? A: No. From the very childhood I was not interested in anything else than myself. Q: THAT'S UNUSUAL. A: It is. It is, in such an insane world, to be so sane is... Q: HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? IS IT YOUR UPBRINGING, YOUR PARENTS? A: Very difficult to account for it, beca use my parents were just ordinary people, as everybody's parents are. They tried their best to bring me to their religion. But I was rebellious -- I made it clear to them that `please leave me alone; let me search for myself'. Q: WHEN DID YOU BEGIN SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT TO YOUR PARENTS AND WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU IN RETURN? A: Almost when I was four -- I started sm all. About small things -- it is not only about big spiritual things -- about small th ings. For example, if my father would say, \"You just get out of the room -- don' t disturb me.\" Then there was no way. I would simply refuse and say, \"You can go out if you are disturbed. I am not going out of the room alive.\" Q: WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU DI SOBEYED; WERE YOU PUNISHED? A: I was punished. Q: HOW? A: In every possible way corporal puni shment was used. I was punished but I was never angry and I had no complaint. I said... Q: YOU WERE HIT? YOU WOULD BE HIT BY YOUR FATHER? A: Yes. My father hit me, and he... Q: WITH HIS HAND? "},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"A: With his hand. And his whole life he repented for that one hit. Only once... because I had long hairs when I was a sma ll child; I had very long hairs. And my father was in continuous trouble because he was a sm all shop- keeper, and I was continuously passing through the shop ; the house was behi nd the shop. And everybody will ask, \"Whose daughter is th is?\" That was very much hurting him - - that he has to tell everybody that `he is my boy, not my daughter'. And one day he became very angry and he said, \"This is an unnecessary irritation... and the whole day you are coming in and out. Ei ther you start going through the back door or you cut your hairs.\" And he hit me. I simply went to a barber shop just in front of my house. And I told him, \"Shave my hairs completely.\" He was an old opium addict -- otherwise nobody would have cut my hairs completely. So he was in his mood -- he simply shaved my whole head. In India you shave your head completely only when your father dies; otherwise nobody will shave your hairs. I came back, and before I came back ho me, others had already reached there, thinking that my father is dead. My fath er was sitting there, and they said, \"What is the matter? I saw your son shaved -- and you are alive!\" Then I reached there and he said, \"What have you done?\" I said, \"This is the answer to your hit. If you are against lo ng hairs, you will be half against small hairs\" I said, \"Let's satisfy you one hundred percent. So I have shaved them completely. And in the future, remember : if you want to hit me, I will not complain about it, but I will respond in my own way.\" Q: SHOULD CHILDREN DEFY THEIR PARENTS? A: Certainly. If Adam and Eve had not disobeyed God there would have been nothing in the world. Q: WHEN SHOULD CHILDREN OBEY THEIR PARENTS? A: Nobody should obey anybody unless your intelligence says it is right. But that is you obeying your intelligence -- not your father, not your mother. Q: BUT IS A CHILD PREPARED TO DO THAT? A: Yes, certainly. Q: SO IF A CHILD CHOOSES TO WALK INTO WHAT AN ADULT... A: Perfectly good. Rather than creating this stupid and mediocre world, it is far better that few thousand children every year jump into the ocean and die -- but leave the world with intelligent, rebellious, vibrant people. "},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Q: BUT THAT WOULD TERRIFY PARENTS. A: Let them be terrified! I have terrified my parents -- why should I bother about other parents? Q: BUT YOU'VE NOT BEEN A PARENT. ISN'T THAT TOO EASY FOR YOU TO SAY? A: No, because I know my parents and it was not easy for them. In fact I had not been a parent because of them, because they wanted me to be married. I said, \"Then there is no way. If you keep qu iet, some day perhaps I may get married. But if you continue in some way pers uading me, then there is no way.\" Q: IF YOU SAW A CHILD PUTTING HIMSELF OR HERSELF IN DANGER, YOU WOULD NOT REACH OUT TO THAT CHILD? A: I will tell the child that \"there is da nger, and you are going into danger; you can die. I can make help available to you if you want, but if you have decided to go into it, then go -- with all my blessings.\" Q: YOU WOULD NOT PHYSICALLY RE STRAIN A CHILD WHO INSISTED ON WALKING ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS? A: No, I will not. I will not interfere in anybody's freedom, whatsoever the freedom is for. Q: BUT THAT'S ONLY THE FREEDOM TO DESTROY YOURSELF. A: No. Q: IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD. A: This is only one case. The question is : out of a hundred cases there may be one case where your example may be applicable In about ninety-nine cases there is no death involved. Just for one percent I am not going to destroy the freedom of ninety-nine percent of the people. Q: BUT IS THAT ANY MEANINGFUL LI MIT ON A CHILD'S FREEDOM -- TO PROTECT THE CHILD FROM DANGER? A: I will tell everything to him, and if he allows me I will help him physically to get out. But if he says that he wants to go into it, that he understands what I am saying, then with all my good wishes he can go."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":" Q: AND IF PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU ARE TOO DETACHED FROM THE WORLD, YOU ARE MAKING NO SENS E EXCEPT YOURSELF; WHAT YOU SAY REALLY DOESN'T APPLY TO THE BROAD POPULATION? A: I don't care -- why should it apply? Everybody has intelligence, everybody has to decide for himself. This whole idea th at you should interfer e in other people's life is being brought by the political leader s, by the religious leaders. They have conditioned the whole humanity that you have to serve others, you have to sacrifice yourself, that you have not to be selfish. My whole approach is that you have to be selfish, and only if you enjoy serving somebody -- serve -- because there is no other reward. Q: YOUR STATEMENTS ABOUT SERVICE TO THE POOR: YOU'VE SAID A FEW THINGS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONSISTENT? A: I am not a consistent man -- you should remember that. Q: SHOULD YOU BE HELPING THE POOR? ARE WE NOT OBLIGED AS HUMAN BEINGS TO HELP THOSE IN LESSER SITUAITONS? A: No. All these are just nonsense word s: `human beings' -- where are human beings? Just in theory... Monkeys never became man -- perhaps human monkeys may have become -- but I cannot say Ro nald Reagan is a man; a chimpanzee perhaps. Human beings would not have been in such a stupid state in the first place. Why is there so much poverty? -- those poor people are responsible for it. Q: THE POOR PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN DILEMMA? A: Certainly, yes. Q: WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO SOMEO NE WHO LIVED IN THE GHETTOS OF NEW YORK OR CHICAGO? A: I have lived in India which is far worse. Q: AND WERE YOU SAYING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS? A: Yes. I have been saying there and they were trying to kill me. They are responsible because they have accepted religious ideas which make them poor. They have accepted a certain ideology th at your poverty is your past life's"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"punishment: in your past life you ha ve committed bad actions -- that's why you're poor. Q: I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT TH E POOR OF THE UNITED STATES BELIEVE, BHAGWAN. A: No, I don't know about... This they ca nnot believe, but they also believe that you are born is sin; you are born be cause Adam and Eve disobeyed God. And the whole humanity has to suffer for it until you repent, until you become Christians, until you become a follower of Jesus, who will persuade God -- because he is the only begotten son of Go d -- to save you. So the question has been removed from its real context: that there is exploitation. The rich are rich because they know how to exploit. Th e poor are poor because they are not intelligent enough and not allowed to be intelligent enough so that they are not exploited -- one thing. Second -- the poor go on increasing the population of their own; the rich people don't increase their population. Q: SO SHOULD THE POOR BE PUNISHED FOR THAT? A: They are already punished. Who is sa ying that they sh ould be punished? Q: WHEN YOU SPEAK THIS WAY YOU SOUND SO UNSYMPATHETIC. A: I am, I am. Q: YOU ARE UNSYMPATHETIC TO THE POOR? A: I am, because those poor are a great calamity on the earth, and they go on producing because they don't have any ot her entertainment than sex. And they are not ready to listen to me. They are re ady to listen to the pope, who goes on saying that birth control is against God, that the pill is the worst thing that has happened to humanity, that abortion is an ti-life. They listen to these people, and these people are making them more and more poor. Q: COULD THE POOR SAVE THEMSELVES BY LISTENING TO YOU? A: Certainly -- immediately. Q: HOW WOULD THAT WORK, THOUGH?

When I started speaking to them they were one four hundred million In dians; now there are eight hundred million Indians. Q: BUT WHAT ABOUT THE POOR TONIGHT; THE PERSON WHO IS HUNGRY TONIGHT, THE PERSON WHO HAS NO MONEY TO PAY HIS ELECTRIC BILL TONIGHT; WHAT CAN HE DO? A: He should go to the church and first ask the priest there to give him food. Ask your god, ask your savior -- he has been saying that he is coming back. Two thousand years have passed and and he has not come back yet, so `you give us'. And your savior was turning stones into bread, walking on water, raising the dead. So why can't the pope do the same? He's his representative, an infallible representative -- he should do all these things. If he cannot, then burn the whole Vatican. Q: YOU SPEAK WITH SO MUCH DISDAIN FOR JESUS, ALTHOUGH WE ARE IN PART OF THE COMMUNE CALLED JESUS GROVE, AND IN THE PAST YOU HAVE SPOKEN RATHER FONDLY, IT SEEMS TO ME, OF JESUS AS A... FIGURE.

Before, I spoke abut the day; now I am speaking about the night -- twenty-four hours I have to finish. Q: PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH, THE YUPPIES' GURU? A: People don't say -- I say.... This is actu ally the fact. That's why I say I am not like other public figures. Nobody -- Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha -- had the guts to say that they are the rich man's guru, and they all were. Buddha had all of the kings of India come to his feet, of fer him thousands of acres of land and gardens. He was the rich man's guru but he had not the guts to say it. I have the guts to simply say what is the fact: I am the rich man's guru, because only a rich man can be religious -- a poor man cannot be."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"For example, if you ask Albert Einste in, \"Can you teach a poor man higher mathematics, physics?\" he will say, \"How can I? First he has to go through the complete courses of the university and at least have a master's degree in physics. Then, perhaps I may be able to start from scratch.\" Religion up to now has never asked for any qualifications from anybody. And religion is the highest experience in life. This is a strange situation: Only a rich man -- who has lived with all luxuries, all comforts, who has attained to his ambitions and is now feeling that nothing satisfies, that nothing brings the delight he was hoping for -- is ready to go into the direction of religion. A poor man asks for food, a poor man asks for me dicine; he does not ask for meditation. Q: HE HAS MORE IMMEDIATE NEEDS THOUGH, BHAGWAN. A: And I don't have food to offer him. Q: BUT IS IT A WORTHY WAY TO SP END A LIFETIME, MINISTERING TO THE RICH? A: Only one man in the whole world mini stering to the rich, and the religions -- three hundred religions are there -- and all their priests and all their public servants are serving the poor. And just look: one man is looking after the whole rich world so well, and everything is goin g perfectly well.

If they ha ve guts, I am ready to change -- I can become the pope, pope can come here. Q: WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THIN G YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE THE POPE? A: First I will destroy Catholicism comp letely.... Because if six hundred million people are deleted from the world, we have solved a great problem for poverty. Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY USE FOR PROSTESTANTISM? A: I will take them when their number comes. First: Catholics... because Protestantism is nothing much -- it is below my dignity even to condemn them. Q: YOU DON'T THINK OF MARTIN LUTHER AS A SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUAL?"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":" A: Martin Luther was simply a politician, and wanted to be a pope himself. Because he could not be a pope -- so the protest, and the Protestantism. And that is just a German mind and nothing else. And you cannot think... Q: WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF A GERMAN MIND? A: Just zero! Mind and German...? German and mind are contradictory terms. Q: WHAT KIND OF MIND SCORES HIGHER? A: Polacks! They are the highest. So just see a single man taking care of the whole world's rich people, without moving out of his place, and all these people are taking care of the poor... And just comp are the work of one man against three hundred religions and their millions of servants, and you can see. In my commune, not a single baby has be en born in four years, and I have not told anybody that you have not to give bi rth. Simply stating th at the world is too much populated... you should think -- you are intelligent. Q: THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE CHILDREN? A: For twenty to thirty years there should be no children.... Only then can we cut the population to one-fourth of what it is now. And once one-fourth of the population is there, then every couple can be allowed to have two children. Q: HOW COULD THAT EVER WORK? A: If it is not going to work, then AI DS will work, then third world war will work. Q: DO YOU HAVE A VISION OF TH E FUTURE THAT INCLUDES A THIRD WORLD WAR?

So our slogan is: Better to be red than dead. It is only a question... Just think: if I say [this] to Soviet leaders, they will ask the same question that `American is going to run over us'. If I say to Americans, they think `the Soviet Union is going to run over us'. So nobody is willing to do it first, but somebody has to do it first.

A: You will know only when it has wo rked. Had you any idea how atom bomb would worked before it worked? Even those who made it had no idea how it would work. Einstein suffered his whol e life after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, repenting that,in the first place, he wrote a letter to President Roosevelt that atom bombs can be made. He was not aware that so much is possible through a single explosion. And now we have seven hundred times more power to destroy. This small commune is a life-energy phen omenon.

Q: AND YET, IN YOUR COMMUNITY THERE IS A SENSE OF ORDER AND AUTHORITY HERE. A: There is a sense of order, and that sense or order is coming out of the intelligent people living here. Nobody is ordering. Q: BUT THOSE PEOPLE SAY THEY DRAW THEIR ENERGY FROM YOU. A: They can say whatsoever they want to say -- what do I have to do with that? Nobody is ordering, nobody is trying to enforce a certain system of them. I am simply explaining my experience, my atti tude, my approach to life, and leaving it to them. If they want to live, they are free; if they don't want to live, they are free. If they want to be here, good; if they want to go away, that is even better. Q: I SPOKE TO A YOUNG WOMAN TODAY WHO ONCE SAID THAT, WHILE SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NOT CHANCE THAT YOU WOULD EVER DO THIS, THAT IF YOU DID AS JIM JONES DID, SUGGEST A MASS SUICIDE, THAT SHE WOULD HOPE THAT SHE WOULD DO THAT. WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, WHAT DO YOU FEEL? WHAT DO YOU THINK? A: Certainly, that woman is telling her heart. She is not telling anything about me -- she is telling about herself. And as far as she is concerned, you have to ask her. That is her love for me, but I have no t asked anybody to die for me -- I have asked people to live for me."},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"This is the only place on the earth wh ere Jonestown cannot happen, because I am in total love with life -- with everythin g that life is. There is no denial, no renunciation of anything. And I would like my people to live as long as possible. But if somebody feels that way, that is his freedom. What can I do, I... Q: WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT A FANATICAL KIND OF RESPONSE? A: No, not at all. Not at all. Q: WHY NOT? A: It is simply her love. Q: ISN'T THAT A DANGEROUS KIND OF LOVE? A: Love is always dangerous. So people who are not capable of living dangerously are not capable of loving, either. Q: WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THE JONESTOWN INCIDENT, WHAT DID YOU THINK? A: I thought this is where Jesus had led people.... This was Jesus's doing. If I get him, I am going to slap him on both hi s cheeks together, so he cannot give me another cheek.... Because that's the whole conclusion, logica l conclusion, of Jesus. Jesus was telling to his people that he is going to his Father's house to prepare a place for them, and then he will come and take them. No w two thousand years have passed; he did not come back. Now it is simply logical that Jim Jo nes thinks, \"Why bother first going, preparing?\" -- it is better to take the whol e lot with you. I think this seems to be more logical and mathematical, and if Jesu s had done that, that would have been better -- there would have been no Christ ianity. That would have been a great blessing in the world: if he had taken those twelve fools that he used to call apostles, humanity would have been saved from so much misery and suffering. Q: YOUR FOLLOWERS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOOLS AS WELL. A: They are! Q: DO YOU TELL THEM THAT? A: Yes. They are here -- I tell them. "},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Q: THEY JUST DON'T LISTEN THOUGH? A: They do not. They know me -- they don't care what I say. Q: YOU ONCE LIVED A VERY SIMPLE KIND OF LIFE; NOW YOU LIVE A VERY OPULENT KIND OF LIFE. WHAT HAPPENED? A: I am just a contradictory man. One da y I can again live a simple life; there is no problem in it. But whatsoever I do, I do it totally. Q: IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL GIVE ALL THIS UP? A: Every possibility -- any moment, because in the first place, nothing belongs to me, so I have not to give up anything. This watch is given to me for your interview. In my room, I am not... even wearing a watch. The car comes to me when they have to take me here. Noth ing belongs to me. Everything belongs to the commune or to the Trust. So in th e first place, I am still a poor man -- pretending to be a rich man. Q: IF YOU GAVE ALL THIS UP, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? A: I will just go to sleep. Q: PERMANENTLY, OR FOR THE EVENING? A: Permanently. Q: WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO ALL THIS AFTER YOU ARE DEAD? A: I don't care, because nobody both ers. When I was not here, I was not concerned abut the world; neither the world was concerned about me. When I am not here, you think only one thing: th at I am dead. You forget the other part: that you are dead for me, too. The connect ion is finished: The world is no more there for me, just as I am no more there for you. I be come absent to you; you become absent to me. Q: DO YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION? A: I know; I don't believe. I don't belie ve in anything.... I know my own past lives. That's why I know there is reincarnation. Q: WHAT WERE YOUR PAST LIVES? "},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"A: Now, that will be a belief for you, only fiction. And a man who can write three hundred fifty books can write three hundred fifty fictions, also. So that is not much use... Q: BUT HOW MANY LIVES HAVE YOU HAD IN THE PAST? A: As many as you want. One thing I can say: I can lead you to the point from where you can look at your past lives -- at least one life -- and that will be proof enough of reincarnation. Telling my stories will not be of any use. Q: COULD YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAM PLE OF HOW IT HAPPENED IN THE PAST? A: No. I never give anything which can become a belief in any way. Q: WHAT ABOUT FUNERAL PREPAR ATIONS? HAVE YOU MADE SOME ARRANGEMENTS? A: No. Q: WOULD YOU WANT TO BE CREMATED IN THE NEW CREMATORIUM? A: That my people will think of. Who bothers? -- I am gone. People are so much worried about controlling, things, even af ter their death. When I am not there, this body is just matter. So whatsoever they want to do... if they want to throw it into the river, most probably that will be the right thing. Q: DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE IN OREGON FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? A: I don't know. If I get the green card, I may go out. If I don't get the green card, I am going to be here. Q: YOU'VE GOT THE PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA WORRIED NOW, I UNDERSTAND? A: In the whole world I ha ve my communes, but everywhere I will have the same problem, so first I will have to settl e here. If the green card is settled here, then I will go to Australia to figh t again -- whatever card they have. Q: THE LAST THING, BHAGWAN: DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA? "},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"A: I certainly have a message. Because Ameri ca is not an old country like India, which has existed for thousands of years and has a burden of a long past, prejudice, conditioning. America is just a child compared to a country like India or China -- three hundred years mean nothing. America has a very superficial layer of conditioning. If it can drop that conditioning -- being Christian, bein g Jew, being American -- America can become the first country of the world opening the doors for a new humanity. It is a risk thing, dangerous, but only Ameri ca is young enough to take the risk. Drop all religions, drop the boundaries of the country, throw away all nuclear weapons, declare to the whole world that \"we are no more for war -- if anybody wants to invade us, we will welcome them.\" Q: IF YOU WERE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND YOU CHOSE TO VOTE; WOULD YOU BE A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT? A: I will be simply what I am. I canno t conceive myself in any other role.... They both are the same type of people -- this is just a political conspiracy. It depends on a certain psychology of people, and democracy is using it. People's memory is very short -- three year s. So four years, five years, one party rules, and naturally it cannot fulfill all the promises that it has given to the people. It starts falling in people's eyes , and for five years the other party has been giving promises that \"we will do what they have not done.\" So after five years, the other party comes on top, and this game goes on playing. Those two parties are conspirators, shareholders in th e same company. It is a rotation of a wheel. I don't see any difference in their ideolo gy; I don't see any difference in their principles; I don't see any difference in thei r faces -- they are all the same people, playing a game. It is a football: one time on this side and one team on that side. It doesn't make any difference to me. I am against parties. I want democracy to be partyless. Unless it is partyless, it cannot be democracy -- it is only tempo rary dictatorship. Four years, five years or whatsoever time in different countr ies... You give to a party four years' dictatorship: it is temporary dict atorship; it is not democracy. Democracy will be possible only when th ere are no political parties and each individual decides on his own. Nobody is going to campaign, nobody is going to convince him. He is not a party member; he has not to follow a party line -- he has to decide himself. Q: RONALD REAGAN THINKS HE PRESIDES OVER A DEMOCRACY. IS HE INCORRECT? A: Absolutely incorrect. He does not preside over Rajneeshpuram. "},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Q: IS HE A DELUDED MAN? A: He is... senile. Q: HE'S TOO OLD TO BE PRESIDENT? A: He really should go back to cowb oy work, cowboy films, to Hollywood -- don't waste the time of the world unnece ssarily. Even as a cowboy actor, he was a third class actor. Q: YOU LIKE MOVIES, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? A: Once in a while, if my people suggest them to me.... Perhaps one or two which I liked. One was \"The Brothers Karamazov. \" That is Dostoevsky's novel that I have always loved, and I consider it more valuable than the holy bible. Another was \"Anna Karenina\" by Leo Tolstoy. That is a masterpiece of genius. So once in a while, if somebody sees something beauti ful that they would like my time to be wasted on, they bring it. Q: I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU LIKED \"PATTON\" AND \"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.\" A: \"Ten Commandments\" I liked, as a film! Q: YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK! A: No. `Commandment' -- the very word -- is not for me. Q: DO YOU SPEND MUCH TIME LOOKING AT VIDEOS? A: No. Q: AND YOU'RE NOT READING ANYTHING ANY MORE? A: No, for five years I have not read anythi ng, but before five years I have read as much as people will read in five lives. Q: THANK YOU. "}]
