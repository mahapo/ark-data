THE WAY OF THE BIRDS WHEN A MONK ASKED KASSAN, ”WHAT IS THE WAY?” HE ANSWERED, ”THE SUN OVERFLOWS OUR EYES; FOR TEN THOUSAND LEAGUES NOT A CLOUD HANGS IN THE SKY.” ”WHAT IS THE REAL FORM OF THE UNIVERSE?” ASKED THE MONK. ”THE FISHES AT PLAY IN THE CLEAR-FLOWING WATER MAKE THEIR MISTAKES,” REPLIED KASSAN. Maneesha, the bird flying across the sky leaves no footprints. This is called the Way of the Birds – simply disappearing into the nothingness of the sky, without leaving a trace behind. Zen wants you to be just like the Birds’ Way – a nobody, a nothingness. It is strange but true that in your nothingness you are for the first time born. The nothingness is the womb out of which your spiritual heights are revealed. Just as you cannot follow the bird because he leaves no footprints, the buddha also leaves no footprints. You cannot follow a buddha for the simple reason that you are a buddha; you have just forgotten it. And once you try to follow a buddha, you are going astray. Those who make footprints behind themselves – create organized religions, give commandments for the coming future, scriptures to be followed by those who have not come yet – are all engaged in nonreligious activity. Religion is a rebellion – rebellion against following. This is a religious place. You are not my followers. You can love me, I can love you .... Following means a subtle spiritual slavery. I don’t have any follower and I don’t want anybody to be a follower of anybody else either. The moment you start following someone, you are going to miss yourself. You will be lost in dark nights and dark clouds and it will become more and more difficult to find the way back home. A MONK SAID TO TOZAN, ”YOU ALWAYS TELL LEARNERS TO TAKE THE WAY OF THE BIRDS. WHAT IS THIS WAY OF THE BIRDS?” TOZAN SAID, ”YOU MEET NOBODY ON IT.” It reminds me of a very beautiful story in Aesop’s fables. There are scholars who think that Aesop as a person never existed, that those stories are told by Gautam Buddha, who was also called bodhisat. And the word bodhisat, as it moved from country to country, became Aesop. But it does not matter who told them; the stories are significant on their own. This story is that a little girl, Alice, reaches the wonderland and wants to see the king. She was led to the king’s court and the king asked the little girl, ”Did you meet somebody on the way coming towards me? I am waiting for somebody.” The girl factually replied, ”Nobody, sir.” And from this point the story becomes pure Zen. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 3 Osho"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. THE WAY OF THE BIRDS The king said, ”If you say you met nobody, then he should have reached here by now!” The girl said, ”Don’t be angry, sir, nobody is nobody!” The king said, ”I understand language, you don’t have to teach me. Nobody is of course nobody, but where is he? It certainly proves that nobody walks slower than you!” The poor girl now gets into trouble. She says, ”No, nobody walks faster than me!” The king said, ”This is very contradictory. If nobody walks faster than you, he must be here by now.” It is a children’s book, but certainly the source cannot be found anywhere else except Gautam Buddha. Even if Aesop existed as a historical person, he must have got the idea of ‘nobody’ from Gautam Buddha’s insistence that to be somebody is to be nothing and to be nobody is to be all. The ego makes you somebody and egolessness makes you nobody. But the ego is a confinement, and the moment you stop the ego you are as vast as the whole universe, you are the universe. The Birds’ Way, Tozan said, is one where you meet nobody. Don’t misunderstand like the king in Aesop’s fable. ‘You meet nobody’ does not mean that you meet nobody, it means you become nobody. That is the meeting with nobody. THE MONK THEN ASKED, ”HOW CAN WE GO ON THIS WAY?” TOZAN ANSWERED, ”BY EGOLESSNESS, ATTENDING TO EACH STEP AS IT COMES.” Living moment to moment, step by step, neither bothering with the past which is gone, nor becoming concerned about the future which has not come yet. Always being herenow, and you are a nobody; you are a no-mind. And this opening is the greatest ecstasy. This opening brings all your potentiality to its flowering. Zen treats you like lotuses. You need to open to the sky, to the stars. In your opening is your freedom, in your opening is your dignity, in your opening is your splendor. But the poor monk did not understand. He said, ”IS NOT THE BIRDS’ WAY THE SAME AS ONE’S ORIGINAL NATURE?” TOZAN SAID, ”O MONK, WHY DO YOU GET EVERYTHING UPSIDE-DOWN?” THE MONK ASKED, ”WHAT IS THIS PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GET THINGS UPSIDE-DOWN?” TOZAN SAID, ”IF THERE WERE NO TOPSY-TURVINESS HOW COULD A SERVANT BECOME A LORD?” The mind is a servant and it has become the master. It is perfectly good as a mechanical computer, a biological miracle, but it is not the master. You have completely forgotten the master, and the servant has become the master in its absence. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 4 Osho"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. THE WAY OF THE BIRDS Be awake to the beyond, to the within. Get out of your mind to see who you are, what is your space without mind. And suddenly you will know how you have lived up to now in a topsy-turviness. The master is almost absent and the servant has become the lord. THE MONK ASKED, ”WHAT IS OUR ORIGINAL NATURE?” TOZAN ANSWERED, ”NOT TAKING THE WAY OF THE BIRDS.” Tozan is a great master. When he sees that the monk is mediocre and will not understand immediately, without bringing mind in – will not see directly – he changes his statement out of compassion. The monk could not understand what is the Way of the Birds. TOZAN ANSWERED – contradicting himself – NOT TAKING THE WAY OF THE BIRDS. If you cannot understand the greatest insight directly, then you have to go from the ABC of religiousness. Zen is XYZ. WHEN A MONK ASKED KASSAN, ”WHAT IS THE WAY?” HE ANSWERED, ”THE SUN OVERFLOWS OUR EYES; FOR TEN THOUSAND LEAGUES NOT A CLOUD HANGS IN THE SKY.” This is the Way. Just spaciousness, nothing clouding your consciousness, no anger, no greed. no ego, Just a pure, innocent being. ”WHAT IS THE REAL FORM OF THE UNIVERSE?” ASKED THE MONK. ”THE FISHES AT PLAY IN THE CLEAR-FLOWING WATER MAKE THEIR MISTAKES,” REPLIED KASSAN. Kassan said, ”Don’t be worried about the universe; think of yourself as just like a small fish in the ocean.” Zen is alone in its great insight that it does not use the word ‘sin’, but only ‘mistake’. The fish can make mistakes in the ocean, but that does not change its original nature. Whatever you have done, you have simply been writing on water. Your right, your wrong, your virtue, your sin – all are divisions of the mind. Your sinners and your saints – all are fish in the same ocean. Somebody is going this way, somebody is going that way. Not to make this distinction of sinners and saints, of right and wrong, and just to be utterly silent, without any judgment – this is your original nature. You have found the universe within yourself. Then the sun rises within you and the whole sky with all the stars is part of your consciousness. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 5 Osho"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. THE WAY OF THE BIRDS Zen is expansion of consciousness to the limitless, to the eternal. It is not concerned with small, stupid things. All the so-called religions are concerned with stupid things, with rituals which are non-essential, with gods which are created by man’s imagination. The only authentic concern for a seeker is to find the center of his own being ... and he has found the center of the whole existence. A poem by Basho reads: WITH YOUR SINGING MAKE ME LONELIER THAN EVER ... The birds are singing – WITH YOUR SINGING MAKE ME LONELIER THAN EVER, YOU, SOLITARY BIRD, CUCKOO OF THE FOREST. Because of this poem the new series that we are entering will be called ZEN: THE SOLITARY BIRD, CUCKOO OF THE FOREST. Hofuku wrote this poem on the Way ... DON’T TELL ME HOW DIFFICULT THE WAY. THE BIRD’S PATH, WINDING FAR, IS RIGHT BEFORE YOU. WATER OF THE DOKEI GORGE, YOU RETURN TO THE OCEAN, I TO THE MOUNTAIN. Such a tremendously beautiful statement. A river may be going to the mountain, or to the ocean. As far as reasoning is concerned it appears they are going in different ways, diametrically opposite. The river that goes towards the ocean we know; we can see it. But every time the river comes, riding on the clouds, back to the mountains ... that is a little subtle and one needs a poet’s, a mystic’s understanding to see. The river is coming back to its original source. This statement of Hofuku ... YOU RETURN TO THE OCEAN, okay; I am going to the mountain. But that does not make you superior or inferior, neither does it make me superior or inferior. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 6 Osho"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. THE WAY OF THE BIRDS This whole universe is ours and all the dimensions are ours. Wherever your original nature takes you, wherever your spontaneity takes you, it is your home. Zen makes this whole existence our home. ... Do you hear the river going back to the mountains? Question 1 Maneesha has asked: BELOVED OSHO, IS IT NOT TRUE THAT, PARADOXICALLY, THOSE WHO ARE AT HOME IN SILENCE CAN USE SOUND – MUSIC OR WORDS – MOST POTENTLY? It looks paradoxical but it is not, because what is sound? Just a ripple in silence. A lake is silent. Then comes a breeze and leaves the whole lake full of ripples. When silent, it was reflecting the moon. When ripples come, the moon is shattered in a thousand pieces all over the lake, making it pure silver. But anyway, it is the same lake reflecting the same moon, either in silence or in sound. Remember always, Maneesha, that wherever you find something paradoxical, you will be closer to reality than ever, because paradox is the very nature of existence. Those who are at home in silence can use sound; they are the master, the sound becomes their servant. They can use music as an expression of their silence, they can use words as an expression of their experience of the mystic, of the poetic nature of existence. Question 2 Her second question is: I HEAR THE GOSSIP HAS SPREAD IN THE GARDEN – THE BAMBOOS HAVE TOLD THE BIRDS – THAT YOU DEDICATED ONE OF THESE ZEN DISCOURSE SERIES TO THE BAMBOOS. IS THAT WHY THE BIRDS WERE SINGING SO FERVENTLY LAST NIGHT? Maneesha, I have heard them. That’s why I am dedicating this series to the birds. I knew that they were feeling neglected: the bamboos were standing proudly in the sky and the poor birds were thinking, ”Nothing is being said about us, and we are singing here and nobody is being even thankful to us.” I am thankful to the birds. This series will be known in Basho’s words – ZEN: THE SOLITARY BIRD, CUCKOO OF THE FOREST. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 7 Osho"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. THE WAY OF THE BIRDS Zen is very pagan; it trusts in nature, not in nurture. It trusts in the original, not in the carbon copy. It wants you to make your statement, but don’t repeat the scriptures; they take away your dignity as man. Find your own signature. This is our whole search – finding your own signature. Before we enter into our daily meditation ... now I have to mention also the birds. They are silent, being happy and proud. Soon the clouds will start asking! Before they ask ... the coming series will be devoted to them. To the birds and to the bamboos and to the clouds, a few laughs, because they cannot understand our language but they can understand our laughter. Sarjano goes into the medical center and asks Dr. Azima for some condoms. ”These-a are the best-a ones,” says Azima, handing him a packet. But Sarjano interrupts him and says, ”Don’t-a worry – the cheapest will-a do.” So Azima gives him the cheapest and Sarjano pays. Then he immediately opens the pack, pulls out a condom, unrolls it, throws it on the floor and begins to stamp on it with his foot. ”What-a the hell are you-a doing?” cries Azima. ”Don’t-a stop me,” says Sarjano. ”This is-a exactly the way I-a gave up smoking!” Doctor Feelgood is in the habit of smoking huge cigars in his office. Nobody likes it, but nobody complains, because he has been doing it for years. One day, a pregnant woman comes into his office. ”Hello, Mrs. Lovejoy,” says Feelgood. ”I see you are pregnant again. How many kids will it be now?” ”This will be my fourteenth,” replies Mrs. Lovejoy. ”My God!” cries Feelgood, almost choking on his cigar. ”Why on earth do you have so many children?” ”Well,” says Mrs. Lovejoy, ”I love my husband very much.” ”And I love my cigar,” replies Feelgood. ”But I take it out of my mouth once in a while!” Kowalski meets Slobovia at the Pig and Whistle Pub for a few after-dinner beers. ”Hey Kowals,” asks Slobovia, ”how come you let your wife do whatever she wants to do?” ”Well,” replies Kowalski, ”because she has a perfect right.” Then Kowalski adds, ”And she has a pretty good left, too!” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 8 Osho"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1.

I will go through your whole anecdote but I’m bringing the conclusion first, because it is the very essence of Zen. It tears down everything that you think you are. It breaks up everything that you 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. TEARING DOWN, BREAKING UP think you are. It shatters everything that you have ever thought to be identified with and then what is left ... Just a pure silence, a nobody. To find this nobodiness is the ultimate peak of experience, of existence. A MONK ONCE ASKED UMMON – Ummon being one of the great masters – ”WHEN NOT A THOUGHT ARISES, CAN THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG?” The question is absolutely absurd, because if no thought arises how can there be anything right or wrong? They are both thoughts. When no thought arises you simply are. The sky is without any clouds. But just like all intellectuals of the world, the questioner is asking without understanding, without experiencing. The question is coming out of intellect, not out of inner experience. Out of inner experience such a question cannot arise. When there is no thought, nothing arises – neither good nor bad, neither right nor wrong. One simply rejoices in oneself. But because he has asked, UMMON REPLIED, ”MOUNT SUMERU!” I will have to explain to you ... Mount Sumeru is a mythological mountain in paradise. It is all gold. Our Himalaya is nothing in comparison to it; it is millions of times bigger, just pure gold. It is a mythology, it is not a fact. But the mythology has a certain meaning, that’s why Ummon replied, ”When there is not a single thought, you have entered into paradise. You will be facing Mount Sumeru, the golden peaks spread from end to end over the whole universe.” Mount Sumeru is accepted by Buddhist mythology, Hindu mythology, Jaina mythology – all the three religions born in this country have accepted the story of Mount Sumeru. It will be good for you to understand what is the purpose of Mount Sumeru. The purpose is that only chakravartins – and a chakravartin is an emperor who has conquered the whole world – are allowed to sign their names on Mount Sumeru when they enter into paradise. One great emperor died with a great desire, because there is nothing greater than signing your signature on Mount Sumeru. It was the tradition of those times that the wife of a man who died would commit sati, and the kings used to have many wives, not just one. All the wives had to commit sati – sometimes a hundred women, sometimes five hundred women. Krishna had sixteen thousand women! So it was a massacre; whenever an emperor died, hundreds of living women .... When this emperor reached the gates of heaven with his hundreds of wives who had died with him on the funeral pyre, the gatekeeper said to him, ”You take these instruments and sign on Sumeru, but don’t take anybody else with you.” The emperor said, ”These are all my wives, and what is the point of signing on Sumeru if there is nobody even as a witness? I want all my wives to be with me to see it.” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 12 Osho"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. TEARING DOWN, BREAKING UP The gatekeeper laughed and he said, ”I have been here ... for generations we have been the gatekeepers. Before me, my father and before him, his father ... as long as existence, our family has been on this gate. And everyone on this gate has given the same advice that I’m giving to you. You will be thankful for it. If you insist, I will allow – but then don’t be offended.” The emperor could not understand, but perhaps the gatekeeper knows more about things ... He went alone and was simply amazed at the gatekeeper’s compassion. Because he could not find a small place anywhere on Mount Sumeru to make his signature. All over there were signatures and signatures and signatures. The meaning is clear: ”You are not the only one. Millions of emperors have passed before you.” He said to the gatekeeper, who was with him, ”This is very humiliating. I used to think I would be the only emperor who is going to sign. And this whole mountain, miles and miles ... there is no space for a signature!” The gatekeeper said, ”Do one thing – another advice that we have been giving since my ancestors. Here is the instrument. Remove somebody’s name and put your name. And this is not new; this has been happening for centuries as far as I know, my father knew, my father’s father knew. You have to remove somebody’s name and create space for your signature.” The emperor said, ”But that takes all the joy out of it. Somebody will come and remove my name.” The gatekeeper said, ”That, of course, is going to happen. It is up to you.” This is the failure of success. Ultimate success brings ultimate failure. And this story may be not a fact; the Sumeru Mountain range does not exist anywhere, but all these three religions have accepted it for the simple reason to show you: Don’t run after the ego. Your ego can take you at the most to the Sumeru Mountains; and then you will see you have wasted your whole life, just to remove somebody’s name. What is the joy of being the greatest celebrity in the world? One great philosopher, Rousseau, wrote in his autobiography that, ”When I was not known to anybody, I was hankering to be known to the whole world. That was the only desire and the only dream, to be known by the whole world. I never thought of what I was going to do then. And now that I have become world famous it is such a failure. I am so ashamed that now I want to hide from people, because they gather everywhere, wherever I go. I am not left even for a single moment without a crowd. I have to hide in my own house. In this house I used to dream about becoming a famous celebrity, and now I have become famous and my eyes are filled with tears at my stupidity. I wasted my whole life in becoming famous and now I am trying to hide from the same people I wanted to be known to.” Ummon’s reply simply means that if thinking ceases and you are still asking for something, then you are only asking for a dream, a golden dream, a paradise, a Sumeru Mountain. The fact is, the moment thought ceases, you disappear too. And in that disappearance you can hear the solitary cuckoo, the birds chirping, the great silence raining on you with great blessings.

Listen to the cuckoo ... particularly because this series is dedicated to a solitary bird, a cuckoo in the forest. ANOTHER MONK ASKED UMMON, ”WHEN ALL MENTAL ACTIVITY IS AT AN END, HOW IS IT?” The same question, asked by millions of people down the centuries. Rather than entering into yourself and finding the silent space, people have been intellectualizing, philosophizing. It is certain that this monk who is asking Ummon, ”WHEN ALL MENTAL ACTIVITY IS AT AN END, HOW IS IT?” is a stupid intellectual – as all intellectuals are stupid. When all mental activity has ceased, there is just pure space, a peace that passeth understanding. UMMON SAID, ”BRING THE BUDDHA HALL HERE, AND WE WILL WEIGH IT TOGETHER!” The Buddha Hall is in every Zen monastery, where the monks gather to hear the master. Ummon must be sitting in the garden under some tree by the side of some lake. He said, ”Before I can answer, it is better to bring the Buddha Hall here, so that the whole assembly of the Buddha Hall together can weigh what remains when mind ceases.” THE MONK SAID, ”AREN’T YOU GETTING AWAY FROM THE POINT?” Bringing the Buddha Hall ... ”You are asking something impossible! And I have asked a simple question – what is the need of the whole assembly? Between two of us, we can weigh what remains after there is no mental activity.” UMMON EXCLAIMED, ”KWATZ!” KWATZ! is a Zen stick. When the master has not the stick with him, this is a substitute for it. He shouts, ”Kwatz!” With that shout he is hitting you to understand a simple thing: No question, no answer ... just be. But the poor monk seems to have not understood. The masters have been shouting from mountaintops and the questioners, curious, are still deep down in the dark valleys – almost deaf and blind, they can neither see nor hear. UMMON SAID, ”YOU PLUNDERER OF VACUITY!” ON ANOTHER OCCASION, UMMON WAS ASKED, ”HOW ABOUT WHEN THE WORD IS UTTERED THAT EXPRESSES ALL THINGS?” UMMON SAID, ”TEARING DOWN, BREAKING UP.” KWATZ! It is a sound, found by Zen, that shatters your mind. At least for a moment you simply remain silent, amazed. Because it is not language. You have not expected it. But it shatters you and that is the whole purpose of a master – to destroy the disciple so that the disciple himself can rise Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 14 Osho"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. TEARING DOWN, BREAKING UP as a master of himself. Only pseudo masters go on forcing disciplehood on people. The authentic ones initiate you just in order to destroy you, because unless you are destroyed you will never be your real self. You will always remain a persona, a personality. Persona is the root from where the word ‘personality’ comes. In Greek drama the persona was used. It was a mask. You can hear the sound, but you cannot see the face of who is behind it. You can see that in the root, sona is sound. So you hear the sound but you don’t see the face. Out of that has come the word ‘personality’. It means you see people hiding behind all kinds of garbage. Somebody thinks he is the president of his country. Somebody thinks he is the prime minister. Somebody thinks, ”I’m the most beautiful person.” But all the presidentship withers away, the premiership is wavering just like a bamboo in a strong wind, ready to fall any moment. And the beauty of today will be tomorrow just a faded painting. Personality is not you. That which changes with time is not you. Hence, remember the distinction between personality and individuality. Individuality is your real, authentic being, not given to you by anyone. You have been it forever and you will be it forever. Everything can be thrown away – TEARING DOWN, BREAKING UP – still you are, as a consciousness. There will be no I, no ego, but a beautiful awareness. And this is the great experience that makes someone a buddha. In this very moment, you all are buddhas. But what to do? You go on forgetting. But I am also very adamant, I will go on reminding you. You can escape but I will follow. I will come into your dreams, I will haunt you wherever you are. Because once I have taken you into the field of my love, you can be anywhere; my work on you continues. And my work is to cut out of your block of marble a Gautam Buddha. Koko wrote: THE WORD AT LAST, NO MORE DEPENDENCIES: COLD MOON IN POND, SMOKE OVER THE FERRY. He’s just giving expression to the inexpressible. THE WORD AT LAST – that is what he is saying about Ummon’s statement, ”Tearing down, breaking up.” THE WORD AT LAST. Ummon has said it. NO MORE DEPENDENCIES: COLD MOON IN POND, Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 15 Osho"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. TEARING DOWN, BREAKING UP SMOKE OVER THE FERRY. Even the most beautiful words indicating the experience are nothing but a reflection of the moon in the cold water of a lake, or smoke over the ferry. Fumon commented: MAGNIFICENT! MAGNIFICENT! NO ONE KNOWS THE FINAL WORD. THE OCEAN BED’S AFLAME, OUT OF THE VOID LEAP WOODEN LAMBS. This has been a tradition in Zen, not to speak in prose but to speak in poetry if at all you decide to speak. Because poetry comes closer to the experience than prose. Maneesha has asked a question: IS THERE A WORD IN THE END? Maneesha, neither is there a word in the beginning nor in the end. It is always silence, eternal silence. Words are very small, they cannot contain it. Question 1 She has asked: I HAVE UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY THAT IN THE BEGINNING WAS NOT THE WORD, BUT SILENCE. IS NOT SILENCE THE BEGINNING, THE END, AND THE CONTINUUM BETWEEN BEGINNING AND END? Yes, a thousand times yes. I have been speaking about the Bible, which says, ”In the beginning, there was the word.” Now that is sheer nonsense. How can the word be of itself? Somebody has to utter it. And what is a word if there is nobody to understand it? It becomes just a sound. But what is a sound if there is nobody to hear it? Certainly the Bible is wrong. In the beginning was silence, in the middle it is silence, in the end it is silence. Silence is the very soul of existence. Before we enter the silence, because it is an arduous journey to be in your very innermost core – arduous and unknown and forgotten – a few laughs will prepare you. I am using laughter to create a preparation for you to dive deep into silence. After laughter, it is simpler. Ace psychiatrist, Dr. Feelgood, is waiting impatiently for the first patient of the day.

Bones gives him an examination, makes a few tests and then says, ”Mr. Kowalski, you are a very sick man.

And always, just as Ronald stands up to speak, Nancy passes him a small note. Everyone is curious to know what is written on the note, but no one dares to ask. Then one day, the note falls out of Reagan’s pocket, and Ed Meese picks it up. He sees that only one word is written on it, ”KISS.” ”That is amazing,” says Meese. ”You have been married for forty years, and still Nancy sends you a kiss before every speech you make.” ”You don’t know Nancy,” snaps Reagan. ”That message does not says ‘Kiss,’ it says ‘K-I-S-S,’ which means, ‘Keep it short, stupid.’” Now, Nivedano give the beat and everybody goes into gibberish, making any sound, any craziness ... just throw it out.

All great philosophies are born out of this basic question, but no philosophy is the answer. Zen, for that reason, should never be understood as another philosophy. It is an anti-philosophical attitude. It is non-thinking, no-mind – just a straight penetration into reality. Mind has a habit to go round and round. Its existence is peripheral. Only on your circumference does it exist. The moment you jump towards your center it disappears. It cannot go with you, within yourself. It can go with you towards the farthest star – and it is a great companion as far as objective 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3. DON’T WOBBLE research is concerned. But the same companion becomes the greatest barrier when you turn from the outside and start searching within. Mind is the instrument for outside inquiry; no-mind is the opening of the door of your inner world. You are not just the body and you are not just the mind. You are much more, you are a mystery that can never be reduced to any language. These anecdotes are efforts out of compassion to bring to your notice this inexplicable, inexpressible reality of your inner world. ONCE IN AN ASSEMBLY OF MONKS, UMMON, a great Zen master, HELD UP HIS STAFF, AND SAID, ”WE ARE TOLD IN THE SCRIPTURES THAT AN ORDINARY MAN THINKS THE STAFF IS A REAL EXISTENCE; THAT THOSE OF THE HINAYANA SCHOOL OF BUDDHISM TAKE IT AS NOTHING; THAT THOSE BELIEVING IN THE PRATYEKABUDDHA – that is another school of Buddhism – TAKE IT AS AN ILLUSORY EXISTENCE.” Pratyekabuddhas, Hinayana, Shankara, Bradley, and there are many philosophers who think that the world you see is simply made of the same stuff as dreams – it is nothing. Although they say so, their behavior does not prove their philosophy. Even Bradley, when going out of his house, does not go out through the wall; he finds the door. If the wall is made of the same stuff as dreams, why bother about the door? Just pass through the wall! You can pass through the mountain if your standpoint is really correct. Why do you go on eating, drinking, clothing your body, when everything is nothing? These philosophies can be reduced to a single word – maya, illusion; everything is illusion. And there is a very subtle reason for the insistence on illusion. They want you to renounce the world because it is illusory. As far as I’m concerned, if it is illusory, then there is no need to renounce it. It is not there – what are you renouncing? Your very effort to renounce it makes it real! All the monks and the saints who have renounced the world, have given a certificate that the world is real. You don’t renounce dreams ... I have never heard of a single man in the whole history of humanity renouncing his dreams. One simply wakes up, looks here and there, and finds that there are no dreams. He was simply asleep – now he is awake. There is no need to renounce that which is not. But all these philosophers were trying by every means and argument to prove that everything is unreal – money, power, prestige, relationship, husband, wife, children, parents, all are unreal. So don’t waste your time with unreality. Renounce! so that you can attain to the real. But I hope it is absolutely clear to you that you can renounce something only if it is real. Your very renouncing proclaims its reality, and also your cowardliness. You don’t have guts to encounter it, that’s why you are escaping. It is not renunciation, it is escape, pure and simple escape, out of a cowardly mind who cannot encounter the arduous realities of life. Zen is not in favor of renouncing anything.

DON’T WOBBLE BODHISATTVAS SAY ITS REALITY IS EMPTINESS. Ummon is simply one of the most insightful masters who has walked on the earth. He says, BUT I SAY UNTO YOU, TAKE THE STAFF – and he is holding his staff in his hand – AS JUST A STAFF. MOVEMENT IS MOVEMENT; SITTING IS SITTING. There is no need to talk about whether it is real or unreal; the very division between reality and unreality makes all kinds of confusions in your mind. What to choose, what not to choose, whether it is real or unreal. Take everything as it is, without any judgment about its reality or unreality. BUT DON’T WOBBLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! What is wobbling? The arising of thought – whether this is real or unreal – and you have started wobbling. Just see things straight as they are, they don’t need any judgment from you. A staff is a staff. UMMON PICKED UP HIS STAFF, AND, SHOWING IT TO THE ASSEMBLED MONKS, SAID, ”MY STAFF HAS TURNED INTO A DRAGON AND SWALLOWED UP THE WHOLE WORLD. WHERE ARE THE POOR MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS AND GREAT EARTH NOW?” His meaning is that if you can realize a non-judgmental clarity, even this simple staff becomes your greatest meditation. And in that meditation the oceans will disappear and the mountains will disappear, because in that meditation you will disappear. The observer suddenly becomes the observed.

Question 1 Maneesha has asked: BELOVED OSHO, WHY DO WE GO TO SUCH PAINS TO AVOID THE OBVIOUS? Maneesha, the mind is interested only in the difficult. The obvious is not difficult. The mind is interested to go to the Everest; it can go to the moon; it is trying to reach to the further stars and planets. The mind enjoys conquering, and you can conquer only that which is difficult. The obvious has no appeal for the mind. On the contrary, the obvious is the danger; it is the death of the mind and its desires and longings. You are the obvious. That’s why mind never looks inwards. It is so simple, it is already there – what is the need? First become the world’s greatest celebrity, become famous, become powerful. As far as your own self is concerned, it is already there, you don’t have to conquer it. And mind is a conqueror; its whole joy is in victory. But being yourself is not a victory. You have always been yourself, knowingly or unknowingly. Your buddhahood is your essential existence. Mind will never become interested in going inwards, because there awaits its death. There is no function for it, there is nobody to conquer. Just a pure space, a silence. Mind, in fact, tries to avoid the obvious. It goes away as far as possible, so that the obvious cannot destroy it. It will think about God – you cannot go farther away than God – it will think about heaven and hell, and it will not for a single moment stop in silence to see, ”Who am I?” And miraculously, it is by entering into your isness that you have entered into the very mystery and the poetry and the music and the dance of existence.

SUCH A MOON ONE DAY, KYOZAN WAS LOOKING AT THE MOON TOGETHER WITH SEKISHITSU AND ASKED HIM, ”WHERE DOES THE ROUNDNESS OF THE MOON GO WHEN IT BECOMES SHARP, CRESCENT?” SEKISHITSU SAID, ”WHEN IT IS SHARP, THE ROUNDNESS IS STILL THERE.” When it is round it is still sharp. Nothing goes anywhere. Sometimes it is manifest, sometimes it is unmanifest, but it is always here – just like the moon. On the full-moon night you see its roundness, and then slowly slowly that roundness is no more round. Something starts disappearing from your vision which is not disappearing in the moon itself. A day comes that the whole moon disappears. And on the first day of the moon it is just a small arc, it shows only for a few minutes and then is gone. But the moon as such is always there. Sometimes only a part of it is reflected by the sun – you see it. Sometimes the whole of it is reflected by the sun – you see it. But as far as the moon is concerned, whether the sun reflects it or not, it is always there. Just think of a mirror. You are standing before a mirror – if the mirror disappears do you think you disappear? And you must have seen mirror houses, where there are many kinds of mirrors. In some mirrors you appear to be very tall, defeating the bamboos; in some others you appear to be very short, but very fat. What the mirror says is not the truth. The truth is in you, unreflected. You don’t need any mirror to find it. You don’t need any lamp to go inside because inside you, there is neither darkness nor light. It is something like twilight, when the sun sets and the night has not come yet – the gap. In that gap, there is a light which is not coming from the sun. This moment in India has been called sandhya. The word comes from a root, sandhi, the boundary line. From day to night, there is a gap when the day disappears and the night begins – a discontinuity. Ordinarily sandhya means evening. But the mystics have used sandhya to mean meditation. They have used it as an indication of a quantum leap, when you move from the mind to no-mind. This anecdote says that the moon remains itself, whether it is known or not known. And you are the moon. It is your freedom to know yourself or to remain ignorant. Nobody can force you to be enlightened and nobody can force you to remain unenlightened. It is just your mood. Just a small moment of silent watching ... and the explosion. The moon has been one of the greatest objects of Zen poems, for the simple reason that it disappears and still it is there in its totality. In some way, it becomes your symbolic representation.

THE MOON HAS NO INTENT TO CAST ITS SHADOW ANYWHERE although the shadow will be cast in thousands of places: in rivers, in ponds, in lakes, in the ocean. But the happening is not an intention, not a desire. On the other hand, NOR DOES THE POND DESIGN TO LODGE THE MOON. The silent pond has no desire to reflect the moon either. HOW SERENE THE WATER OF HIROSAWA! There is a life which we are aware of, a life of desire, longing, greed, lust, power. A life, in short, of motivation; a life of goals, of achievements. There is another life where Zen opens the door for you, a life without motivation. Everything happens – why bother? Even desiring enlightenment is preventing it. It will happen. Just become the silent lake of Hirosawa. When no motivation is there, your consciousness is unclouded. No question arises, no answer is needed. You simply are, a pure existence. Another Zen master, Moan, wrote: CLEAR, CLEAR – CLEAREST! I RAN BAREFOOT EAST AND WEST. NOW, MORE LUCID THAN THE MOON, THE EIGHTY-FOUR THOUSAND DHARMA GATES! Mythologically, Buddhism believes that dharma, the nature of existence, has eighty-four thousand gates. That is only symbolic. It means there are as many gates as there are living beings. You don’t have to enter through anybody else’s gate. You are carrying your gate within you. Moan is saying: CLEAR, CLEAR – CLEAREST! I RAN BAREFOOT EAST AND WEST – unnecessarily.

Without you there is no danger – all is absolutely beautiful and silent. It is within you that jealousy is burning, anger is poisoning; it is within you that greed is growing. And all these together are clouding your consciousness and destroying your individuality, your essential existence. Zen is not concerned with words, it is concerned with your being. It is not a philosophy. It is not even a religion. It is a way of seeing, a way of being, a very strange style of living through consciousness and not living through unconsciousness. Before I enter into this sutra, I am reminded of Gautam Buddha, who is the original source of the only religiousness that has come into existence in the world. There have been religions – many, almost three hundred religions are already in existence – but religiousness is absolutely absent. Religion is possible to practice, just like an actor practices. Religion is possible through knowledge, because mind is a great bio-computer; you can accumulate as much knowledge as is contained in all the libraries of the world in a single mind. But knowledge is not knowing, knowledge is not wisdom, knowledge is not awakening. On the contrary, it may help you to sleep a little deeper because it will give you a false sense that you know. And this is the greatest tragedy that can happen to a man. Knowing nothing, but filled with borrowed knowledge, a great ego arises but your moon disappears in the clouds, in the dust of old scriptures and doctrines. Your presentness is covered by many layers; you are almost lost in a jungle of concepts, theologies, philosophies, dogmas. Gautam Buddha is perhaps the first man in human history who has made the distinction between knowledge and knowing. Knowledge is always borrowed – knowing is your own understanding. Knowledge is cheap. Knowing is a tremendous revolution, a metamorphosis. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 34 Osho"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5. A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE One day Gautam Buddha and his disciple, Ananda, are passing from one village to another village. On the way, a fly sits on Buddha’s forehead. He was talking with Ananda – he continued talking, just as you would have done, and moved his hand to make the fly go away. Then suddenly he stopped, and again moved his hand ... very consciously, although there was no fly. Ananda asked, ”What are you doing?” He said, ”I am showing you that you can act unconsciously, the way I acted, and you can act consciously. When you act consciously there is grace and there is beauty and there is you. When you act unconsciously, it is just acting in sleep.” This small anecdote contains many significant points – not for the curious one, not for the knowledgeable one, but only for the seeker. DOKIN’S DISCIPLE, DORIN, BECAME A MONK AT THE AGE OF NINE, TOOK THE VOWS AT TWENTY-ONE AND STUDIED THE Kegon Sutra. LATER IN LIFE HE ENTERED THE DENSE PINE FOREST OF MOUNT SHIMBO, AND DID ZAZEN UP A TREE. Zazen is simply sitting, doing nothing ... not even thinking, just pure being. From my own experience I can say to you that sitting on a tree is the best place; just you have to be very friendly with the tree. The tree supports your silence; it is rooted deep in the earth. It has no mind, it does not chatter with you, but it surrounds ... its aura, its sensitivity helps you, in a synchronicity. Gautam Buddha became awakened under the bodhi tree. The bodhi tree got its name bodhi because Gautama became Buddha under it. Scientists have been looking into the constituents of a bodhi tree – is there something special under it? And they have found that the same element that makes a man more intelligent than others, makes the bodhi tree more intelligent than other trees. It has a tremendous amount of intelligence. So it was not a coincidence that Buddha, sitting under the bodhi tree, became enlightened. He owes his gratitude to the bodhi tree also. And he showed it. Before dying he told his disciples, ”There is no need to make a statue of me. You will make temples, but in your temples make a statue of the bodhi tree. My gratitude is tremendous towards the bodhi tree.” For three hundred years after Gautam Buddha the temples carried, in place of Buddha’s statue, marble carved as a bodhi tree. Zazen simply means not to think, not to dream, not to imagine. Become one – as the tree – sensitive, alert, dancing with the wind, rejoicing in the sun ... surrounded by the fragrance of the tree, but with no activity on your part. FOR THIS REASON HE WAS CALLED CHOKA ZENJI, MEANING ”BIRD-NEST ZENJI,” AND JAKUSO ZENJI, MEANING ”MAGPIE NEST,” BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES BECAUSE THE BIRDS AND MAGPIES BUILT THEIR NESTS BESIDE HIM.

But Dorin said, ”YOU ARE IN A MORE DANGEROUS ONE!” HAKURAKUTEN ASKED, ”WHAT IS DANGEROUS ABOUT BEING IN CHARGE OF THIS PROVINCE?” DORIN REPLIED, ”HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT IN DANGER WHEN YOUR PASSIONS ARE BURNING LIKE FIRE AND YOU CAN’T STOP WORRYING ABOUT THIS AND THAT?” The real danger is not from the outside, the real danger is from the wrong functioning of your mind. And you never get out of the wrong functioning of the mind into a space where mind is no more, but only a pure consciousness. HAKURAKUTEN THEN ASKED, ”WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHISM?” DORIN ANSWERED IN THE WORDS OF SHAKYAMUNI, Gautam Buddha: NOT TO DO ANY EVIL, TO DO ALL GOOD, TO PURIFY ONESELF – THIS IS THE TEACHING OF ALL THE BUDDHAS. HAKURAKUTEN SAID, ”ANY CHILD OF THREE KNOWS THIS.” DORIN SAID, ”THAT’S SO – ANY CHILD OF THREE knows IT, BUT EVEN A MAN OF EIGHTY CAN’T do IT.” Knowing and knowing – and the difference is great. Knowing from the outside, knowing from scriptures or teachers or priests, is a false knowing. All scholars are false. Knowing as your own experience ... it is a taste. Nobody else can do it for you. It is a deep smell of a roseflower – nobody else can do it for you. It is the experience of your own existence, entering into your deepest core. Out of that experience, what Buddha says ... NOT TO DO ANY EVIL, TO DO ALL GOOD, Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 36 Osho"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5. A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE TO PURIFY ONESELF – THIS IS THE TEACHING OF ALL THE BUDDHAS. You will have to understand things differently. It is not the beginning, it is the outcome of your self- knowledge. As you become centered in yourself, you cannot do what is evil, you cannot do what is ugly. Centered within yourself, grace arises, a beauty fills your heart. A creativity, a song, a poetry, signifying the unknowable and the unreachable by the mind ... you for the first time become a creative individual. Nothing destructive can come out of you anymore. The scholar reads Gautam Buddha, repeats the words correctly, but the seeker finds the source from which this understanding of Gautam Buddha has arisen. He does not practice it. Anything practiced is false, pseudo. And you have been told by all your religions to do this, not to do that; you are all carrying ten thousand commandments. But because they have not arisen from your own being, they are just a burden. They don’t make you free, they make you Hindus, they make you Mohammedans. They make you Buddhists, they make you Christians, but they don’t make you divine beings. They don’t give you your godhood; they don’t give you your own buddha nature. Dorin is right when he says, ”THAT IS SO – ANY CHILD OF THREE KNOWS IT, BUT EVEN A MAN OF EIGHTY CAN’T DO IT.” The question is not knowing the words, the question is knowing the source from where all these roses grow. Going to the very roots, watering and taking care of those roots, the flowers will come in their own season. But people are topsy-turvy. They start from the roses. Then, naturally, they end up with plastic roses. Begin with the roots! They are hidden deep in the earth. Your flowers also have roots – unless you go deep inside you, you will not find out how Buddha blossoms like a lotus, how fragrant a mystic becomes ... how in the presence of the awakened person there is a magic, a song without sound, a poetry without words, and a tremendous magnetic force which gives stupid people a wrong idea, as if the awakened person is hypnotizing you. The awakened person does not do anything, but his very presence is hypnotizing. He does not hypnotize you. You suddenly fall into a deep silence, a peace that you have never known before. IN AN INCIDENT BETWEEN A MONK AND SEPPO, A MONK ASKED SEPPO, ”I HAVE SHAVED MY HEAD, PUT ON BLACK CLOTHES, RECEIVED THE VOWS – WHY AM I NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A BUDDHA?” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 37 Osho"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5. A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE This is what I was saying: you can act exactly like Buddha – you can shave your head, you can eat the same food as Buddha, you can walk the way Buddha walks, you can sit in the lotus posture as Buddha sits. But don’t think that you have become a buddha; you are just acting in a play. Every discipline imposed from outside is destructive because it does not allow you to see your ignorance, to see that you have not even made an attempt to enter into your own being. You are satisfied with words? You cannot eat words; they will not nourish you. You have to know on your own; then only there is nourishment. This poor fellow is asking Seppo, the master, ”I HAVE SHAVED MY HEAD, PUT ON BLACK CLOTHES, RECEIVED THE VOWS – WHY AM I NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A BUDDHA?” SEPPO SAID, ”THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN AN ABSENCE OF GOODNESS.” This is a very significant statement. A buddha does not know that he is good, that his actions are virtuous. Do you think the cuckoo knows that her song is sweet? Do you think a flower knows that its fragrance is magnificent? A buddha simply is a buddha. He is not even able to say, ”I am good.” He has gone beyond good and bad. He is simply an isness. Is the sky good or bad? To become aware of your own consciousness is to become aware of your inner sky. It is neither good nor bad; it is neither right nor wrong. A buddha is not a saint; that is a misunderstanding – a misunderstanding of the priests. A buddha is far away from any division and duality: the saint and the sinner, the good and the bad, the right and wrong. A buddha is a transcendence. He is a watcher, far away from all our dualities. Seppo has said it in a really difficult way for scholars or the so-called priests of religions to understand: THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN AN ABSENCE OF GOODNESS. Have you ever seen? – the so-called good people are so full of ego. The very idea that ”I am good” is dangerous. A buddha simply knows he is nothing, nobody, a pure cloudless sky. A buddha is not a saint. All saints are actors. I am saying it unconditionally: All saints are actors. They are trying in every way to behave like a buddha. Sometimes they can even behave better than a buddha because Buddha has not rehearsed and they are rehearsing perfectly, disciplining themselves, for years; they can defeat the real Buddha. It happened that on the sixtieth birthday of Charlie Chaplin, his friends arranged a competition all over England, so that whoever performed the best as Charlie Chaplin was going to be given a great prize. There were three prizes – first, second and third. From different places, different theaters, different drama companies, people tried. And in the final stage, Charlie Chaplin, being a man of tremendous humor, entered himself into the competition from a faraway village. He believed that he would be the first – ”Who can perform better than me?” But to his surprise, he came second! Somebody managed better than Charlie Chaplin himself. When it became known to people that they had given the second prize to Charlie Chaplin, they said, ”My god – we were celebrating, and what kind of stupidity this is! Why did you enter? It was Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 38 Osho"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5. A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE not supposed to happen that you should enter the competition, and if you had entered at least you should have made us aware. Now it looks so foolish that somebody managed to be more Charlie Chaplin than you are! Be ashamed!” And this is what has been happening down the ages. Your so-called saints, mahatmas, are just practicing to be buddhas. But a buddha is not a practice, a buddha is a revelation. It is an inner exploration. And out of that exploration your actions change, your presence changes – not because of any scripture, not because of any other source of wisdom, but just because you are conscious you start acting, working, being, differently. Guido wrote: RIGHT IS FINE, WRONG IS FINE – THERE IS NOTHING TO NIRVANA. AND WHAT IS ”DEFILEMENT”? SNOWFLAKES IN THE FLAME. To a buddha even nirvana is nothing. AND WHAT IS ”DEFILEMENT”? What is sin? SNOWFLAKES IN THE FLAME. From that height of consciousness all dualism, all duality disappears. There is only one consciousness pervading the whole universe, and its heartbeat is your own heartbeat. Rijunkayaku said: IRON WILL IS DEMANDED OF THE STUDENT OF THE WAY – IT IS ALWAYS ON THE MIND. FORGET ALL – GOOD, AND BAD. SUDDENLY IT IS YOURS. If you have to remember continuously what is right and what is wrong and what is good and what is bad ... That’s what your religions have been teaching to you. In Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram even drinking tea was a sin – not a small sin. And when something becomes a sin, it becomes very sweet. It becomes almost a challenge. Almost everybody was drinking tea, hiding. And when one man was found red-handed, Gandhi went on a fast! There are ways of torturing people ... you can torture people the way Adolf Hitler did, you can torture people the way Mahatma Gandhi did. Mahatma Gandhi’s way is very subtle and escapes the Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 39 Osho"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5. A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE ordinary mind. Now do you think, if I go on a fast because someone of you has been found smoking or drinking tea ... Although I am torturing myself, I am making you feel guilty and the whole ashram will be harassing you, that ”It is because of you!” And the man was praying, holding Gandhi’s feet – ”Please forgive me, I will never do such a thing as drinking tea. You come back” ... because the fast was unto death! In Gandhi’s ashram love was abandoned – obviously, where you cannot drink tea, do you think you can love? But his own secretary, Pyarelal, fell in love with a woman ashramite. Gandhi expelled Pyarelal although he was the best secretary that Gandhi ever had in his whole life. But he has committed a great sin, he cannot enter into the ashram gates. Falling in love? He has not done anything, just a romantic idea! Nothing actual or biological has happened, but just the idea ... He had written a love letter and that love letter had been found. That was enough for the saintly mind to condemn a man of great intelligence and a man of great creative activity. And he said, ”I can take that letter back and burn it and I will never look at that woman.” But it is impossible to expect compassion from the saints, from the mahatmas. They have created hell. Bertrand Russell, in his autobiography, denies Christianity saying that, ”I am not a Christian for these reasons. And the most important reason is that Christianity says that if you commit sin, adultery, you will be thrown into hell for eternity.” Bertrand Russell was one of the greatest mathematicians of this age. He said, ”I can understand ... I have looked into my whole life. If I expose all my sins that I have committed, and the sins that I have dreamt about, even the hardest judge cannot send me to jail for more than four or five years.” Eternity? You will never be out of hell. Hell has no exit, only an entrance. And the Devil grabs you, gives you a good bone-crushing hug and takes you in. Bertrand Russell’s statement was, ”I renounce Christianity because it is a stupid idea.” In the first place the things that are thought to be sins, most of them are absolutely innocent. For example falling in love. It is simply a biological phenomenon – nature itself has managed certain chemicals, hormones, which make you fall in love with a certain woman or a certain man. I don’t see that there is any sin. And if there is sin in falling in love, then why has God created a man with the capacity to love? He is responsible, ultimately. And if people simply accepted the idea, which they did not, you would not have been here! Your parents were not very religious. That’s why you are here, because they were a little irreligious. It is said that after making the world, God went around asking Babylonians, Egyptians and others, ”Do you want a commandment?” And they all asked, ”What is the commandment?” He said, ”You should not commit adultery.” And the Babylonians said, ”Then what else should we do? Take your commandment with yourself; find somebody else.” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 40 Osho"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5. A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE And finally he ended up with Moses. Just being a Jew, Moses asked the wrong question. Everybody else asked, ”What is the commandment? Because before we accept it we must at least know what we are accepting.” When God said, ”Do you want to have a commandment?” Moses said, ”How much?” God said, ”It is free!” Moses said, ”Then I will have ten.” If it is free, then a Jew ... Those ten commandments have been torturing the Jews for four thousand years. IRON WILL IS DEMANDED OF THE STUDENT OF THE WAY – IT IS ALWAYS ON THE MIND. FORGET ALL – GOOD, AND BAD. SUDDENLY IT IS YOURS. The truth, nature, your very destiny, suddenly is fulfilled. But don’t divide. Before you have attained your being, there is no right for you to decide what is right and what is wrong. Question 1 Maneesha has asked: BELOVED OSHO, IS NOT THE WAY OF THE BIRDS BEYOND MORALITY? It is. Morality is only for mediocre people. Morality is a strategy of the priest to exploit the masses. And it differs from place to place. What is moral to a Hindu may not be moral to a Christian, what is moral to a Christian may not be moral to a Jaina. A Jaina saint was asking me, ”Do you consider Jesus in the same category as Mahavira? Because he used to eat meat, drink wine – how can you say that he was a saint, or even a good man?” But the Christian would ask, ”How many orphanages did Mahavira open? How many poor people did he manage to help survive? How many schools for the aboriginals did he open? What kind of goodness, what kind of morality did he have? Standing naked, that’s all that he did!” For the Christian, Mahavira cannot be considered a saint. For the Jainas, Mohammed cannot be considered to be a saint – he had sixteen wives! Now this is not right for a gentleman, what to say about a saint. Only Hindus will be a little less disturbed, because Krishna had sixteen thousand wives; Mohammed is just a poor fellow. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 41 Osho"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5. A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE And Mohammed at least married those sixteen women. Krishna had married only one woman; the rest were other people’s wives. Whoever he found to be beautiful, his soldiers would force her into his palace. He never considered whether they had children, a husband, old parents to look after – it did not matter. Anything that he liked ... And Hindus say that he is the perfect incarnation of God. Of course he must be perfect, because I don’t think anybody else can defeat him. People have tried. The Nizam of Hyderabad, just forty years ago when he died, had five hundred wives. But five hundred is not much compared to sixteen thousand. Who is going to decide what is moral and what is immoral? The Bird’s Way does not divide into morality and immorality, into goodness and badness. It simply says that the decisive factor is your awareness: if your awareness acts in a certain way, that is moral for you; it does not matter what others say. You should be satisfied that you are acting out of awareness. Then whatever you do is right – right for you. But if you are unconscious, as people are, and go on doing things which others are doing, copying, imitating ... They may become saints, but deep down they are simply actors. They may do good, but their goodness is just a practice. Not their awareness, not their intrinsic being, blossoming into their acts. The Birds’ Way is beyond good, beyond bad. And the way of Buddha is the Way of the Birds. It does not leave any footprints behind. Every bird is free in the sky to move in any direction. No bird leaves any footprints for other birds. It is only the human beings who write scriptures for others to follow. They not only become decisive for themselves, they become slave-creators. Everybody has to follow them; they don’t want you to be conscious of what you are doing. They want you to do it because they have decided what is right. But remember, in every disease the same medicine will not do. And in every time, in every age, the same criterion will not do. And with every individual, other than his own consciousness there is no criterion. Nobody can decide for anybody else. This is simply the meaning of freedom. The Bird’s Way is the way of freedom. It is the individual as the ultimate value. Before we enter into our daily meditation, just to take away your seriousness ... and the bamboos are waiting so silently for your laughter.

There is no door, and there is no possibility of doing anything. You have simply to relax so totally that you sink deep within yourself. Remember, relaxation is not an activity. It is absence of all activity. And only in the absence of all activity, when you are relaxed to your very being, the door opens to all the mysteries of the world, all the miracles of existence. It fills your being with great dance, although you cannot utter a single word. You hear the music that you have never heard, although there is no way to translate it to anyone else. You see flowers blossoming ... their colors are absolutely unknown to you. Your whole being becomes a fragrant luminosity. There is nothing to say about it; you can just be it. And the rays of your silence will start creating and weaving a field around you. That’s why a master in Zen is not simply a teacher. In all the religions there are only teachers. They teach you about subjects which you don’t know, and they ask you to believe, because there is no way to bring those experiences into objective reality. Neither has the teacher known them – he has believed them; he transfers his belief to somebody else. Zen is not a believer’s world. It is not for the faithful ones; it is for those daring souls who can drop all belief, unbelief, doubt, reason, mind, and simply enter into their pure existence without boundaries. But it brings a tremendous transformation. Hence, let me say that while others are involved in philosophies, Zen is involved in a metamorphosis, in a transformation. It is authentic alchemy: it changes you from base metal into gold. But its language has to be understood, not with your Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 46 Osho"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6.

These anecdotes, when first translated by Christian missionaries, were translated to show the world that ”Christianity is the only civilized religion, and as a proof look at these stupid dialogues, with no reason and no rhyme!” But everything backfired. They wanted to prove Zen to be a very primitive religion. But to those who were real seekers, it proved that on the contrary, every other religion may be primitive; at least Zen is not. In the first place, it is not a religion at all. It is not in competition with Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism or Mohammedanism; it does not belong to that category at all. It has its own category, its own language, its own world, and there is no competitor to it. Its uniqueness is absolute and categorical. But you will have to be very loving, very careful in understanding these strange dialogues, because the language seems to be the same as we use but hidden between the words and between the lines there is a different poetry, a different song, which we are not accustomed to. But my people will understand it, because we are entering into the same space which Zen has been pointing towards. These dialogues can be understood only by meditators; otherwise they look stupid. THE MONK, KANKEI, ONCE VISITED THE NUN, MASSAN RYONEN. HE SAID TO HIMSELF, ”IF WHAT SHE SAYS HITS THE SPOT, I WILL REMAIN THERE. IF IT DOES NOT, I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT!” He was a seeker in search of a master, and when he came to see Massan Ryonen, a woman Zen master, he thought in his own mind, IF WHAT SHE SAYS HITS THE SPOT ... it is not a question of reasonability. Not that what she is saying is very wise, but if it hits the spot, my own being – if the arrow of what she says reaches to my being, I will stay; otherwise I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT. When a disciple comes, a seat is offered by the master for him to sit. And if the disciple rejects the master, he overturns the seat gracefully – showing that ”this is not my place” – and leaves. That overturning of the Zen seat is symbolic that ”I don’t accept you as a master, but I will not say it. Saying is so crude. I will just give you the hint, that you could not hit the spot of my being, for which I am searching; I will have to go to another master.” HE ENTERED THE HALL, AND MASSAN SENT A MESSENGER TO ASK, ”HAVE YOU COME ON A MOUNTAIN-VIEWING JOURNEY, OR FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM?” IN RESPONSE, KANKEI SAID, ”FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM,” SO MASSAN SAT UPON HER SEAT, AND KANKEI APPROACHED HER.

The removing of the hat is simply signifying that ”I am available, in humbleness, open; I’m not covered or defensive. Even if you want to cut my head, I am ready.” In the first court in America where my case was presented after I was illegally arrested, the woman magistrate was in a puzzle – because in America, you cannot wear your hat in the court. Wearing your hat in the court is insulting the court. Such are the different attitudes of East and West. I could see that she was a little bit puzzled what to do. She sent an attendant to tell me, ”Perhaps you don’t know that in the court you have to remove your hat. To keep your hat on is to insult the court.” I said to him, ”Go back to the magistrate and tell her that if she has courage, she should ask the question herself. Because according to me, to remove the hat is insulting and I will not insult the court.” The man thought for a moment, went back to the magistrate. The woman was even more puzzled! She simply thought it was better not to get into an argument. Because it is not written in the constitution; it is just a formal tradition. I am not legally bound to remove my hat. I will remove my hat only when I see a buddha – not for a magistrate. Seeing the situation, the woman behaved sanely. She said to the attendant, ”There is no need, just don’t raise the question again.” Different worlds, different symbols .... When Massan asked, ”WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE YOUR BAMBOO HAT?” she was saying that if you have come for the sake of Buddhism – and that means for the search of the buddha within you – then be graceful. Remove the hat, be humble and be receptive. KANKEI HAD NO REPLY, AND MAKING HIS BOWS, ASKED, ”WHAT IS MASSAN?” Massan was the woman master’s name. SHE ANSWERED, ”IT DOES NOT SHOW ITS PEAK.” The woman got the name Massan because of the Massan Mountain where she had her monastery. The peaks are so high that they are almost always covered with snow and clouds; they rarely show. And that is exactly the situation of consciousness. It is so much covered with thoughts – the past, the conditionings ... so much smoke – that it rarely shows.

One gets bored: a woman every day, a woman again, and again. A man ... in the morning again you wake up a man. And one starts thinking, is there some way to change? People change clothes, people change shoes, people change ties. Up to now it was not possible, but now it is possible – many, many more people are going to change their sex. For the first time, a man will be standing behind a woman’s body, or a woman may be standing behind a man’s body.

In a single moment of sudden awakening, he understood that up to now he has unnecessarily carried the staff; he was just a teacher, not a master. He broke his staff. These are all symbolic things in Zen. Breaking the staff means, ”Now you are the master and I’m the disciple. I will not say it in words, because words are very polluted; I will make the symbol that I’m no more a master. I was living in a false identity – I break that identity and throw it away. Now you are the master and I will live in your presence, drinking as much as possible the waters of life.” A poem of Chikusan reads: HE IS PART OF ALL, YET ALL IS TRANSCENDED; SOLELY FOR CONVENIENCE HE IS KNOWN AS MASTER. WHO DARES SAY HE HAS FOUND HIM? IN THIS RACKETY TOWN I TRAIN DISCIPLES. These last lines are particularly important: IN THIS RACKETY TOWN I TRAIN DISCIPLES. He must have been in Poona! You cannot find a more rackety town. But strangely, masters have chosen rackety towns in search of a few intelligent people. The rackety town has a good quality: in the beginning it becomes a little disturbed, but slowly slowly it accepts that these people are a little different, and it does not bother. Now we are here, and in this rackety town, people will not be aware at all that five thousand people are in search of themselves, and sometimes they touch the very buddhahood, the pinnacle of consciousness. But they will go on standing in queues before movie houses, shopping in the marketplaces, never being aware ... It is a strange unconsciousness, that five thousand people from all over the world are gathered here – they must be doing something – but they won’t even look inside the gate. Such unconcern about the grandeur of man, such unconcern about the splendor of your innermost being. Chosha wrote: EVERYTHING, EVERY PLACE IS REAL.

HOW CAN ANYONE TRUST YOU!” AT ANOTHER TIME, UMMON ASKED A MONK, ”DID YOU HEAR THE LONG-BEAKED BIRDS PREACHING ZEN IN KOZEI?” ”NO, I DIDN’T,” REPLIED THE MONK. UMMON THEN RAISED HIS STAFF AND SAID, ”ZEN!” These are not, Maneesha, ordinary dialogues; these are dialogues between the valleys and the peaks, between those who are in dark and those who have themselves become light. It is a difficult situation – the communication between darkness and light or death and life is bound to be difficult; their spheres are so diametrically opposite. But Zen, and Zen alone, has at least made an effort. You will see, in this dialogue.

FENCES, WALLS AND BROKEN TILES NANYO REPLIED, ”IT IS FENCES, WALLS AND BROKEN TILES.” THE MONK ASKED, ”FENCES, WALLS AND BROKEN TILES ARE INSENTIENT, ARE THEY NOT?” ”THAT IS SO,” REPLIED NANYO. ”DO THEY EXPOUND BUDDHISM?” ASKED THE MONK. ”ALWAYS, AND BUSILY,” REPLIED NANYO. THE MONK SAID, ”WHY DIDN’T I HEAR IT, THEN?” Before we go deeper into the anecdote ... So many golden treasures in simple words. The way Nanyo replied ... ”The mind of the buddha – even of the buddha – is nothing but fences, prisons, boundaries, walls and broken tiles.” You may be a buddha, but have you ever thought that you are imprisoned in bones, in skin, in flesh, in marrow? This is your house, this is not you. You are the one who is living in this house, behind these fences, walls and broken tiles. It does not matter whether the mind is of a buddha or of someone who is asleep, the nature of the mind is the same. No other religion has the courage to speak so straightforwardly as Zen. No Christian can say this about Jesus; he will think this is disrespectful. No Hindu can say this about Krishna; he will think this is absolutely irreligious. But Nanyo himself is a buddha and what he is saying is not irreligious, is not disrespectful; he is simply stating the fact. Mind is your bondage. The moment you drop your mind, your buddhahood arises out of the smoke – a high mountain peak, covered with eternal snow, virgin and pure. But the poor monk could not understand it. That is the difficulty with communication between someone who knows and the one who knows not. Misunderstanding upon misunderstanding ... The monk was shocked. Buddha is worshipped and this Nanyo himself worships him, himself teaches his teachings, and is talking in such offensive terms! THE MONK ASKED, ”FENCES, WALLS AND BROKEN TILES ARE INSENTIENT, AREN’T THEY?” ”THAT’S SO,” REPLIED NANYO. ”DO THEY EXPOUND BUDDHISM?” The monk is still thinking with his mind, with his logic, with his reason. And his question is reasonable. If this is the mind of Buddha, then they must be teaching Buddhism. He is trying to prove Nanyo to be utterly ignorant of the mind of Buddha. His questions are not just questions, but arguments. ”DO THEY EXPOUND BUDDHISM?” ASKED THE MONK. ”ALWAYS, AND BUSILY,” REPLIED NANYO. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 57 Osho"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7. FENCES, WALLS AND BROKEN TILES As far as teaching is concerned, mind is busy all around the world, teaching this religion, teaching that religion, teaching this philosophy, teaching that theology. Nanyo is saying that Buddhism – or any ”ism”, it does not matter – is always taught by the mind. But the buddha himself is silent. The buddha teaches not; only the house goes on resounding with sounds. But the one who lives in the center of the cyclone is absolutely silent. The monk still goes on: THE MONK SAID, ”WHY DIDN’T I HEAR IT, THEN?” Again it has to be understood, that that which is beyond mind can neither be said nor can be heard – but it can be understood, it can be realized; it is your very nature. And the master’s function is not to teach you theorizations, hypotheses, but to provoke you. Just the way if somebody tickles you, and you start laughing for no reason at all. Soon you will see in our meditation: even without tickling, people go mad! And I have said that if anybody sits silently like a buddha, everybody is allowed to tickle him. It is not the place for any spectator. The master only tickles you to laugh. But he cannot create laughter by words; he creates devices – tickling is just a name of a device. It says nothing. The very presence of the master is itself a device. Without saying anything, he penetrates those who are receptive, who have opened the doors of their hearts. But the poor monk is in the same situation as the whole world is. Rather than asking, ”Why can’t I receive? Why can’t I realize the unsayable?” he asks, ”WHY DIDN’T I HEAR IT, THEN?” NANYO ANSWERED, ”YOU DON’T HEAR IT, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT PREVENT OTHERS FROM DOING SO.” It is a misfortune that the people who have no understanding are professors, priests .... Almost half the world is communist and denies the very experience of religion as having any validity – and none of them has ever meditated, none of them has ever explored in. Those who have gone in have always come back with a smile, expounding without saying a word the blissfulness, the fragrance, the whispering silence. Nanyo said, ”You don’t hear it, but please don’t start telling other people that Nanyo is mad because he says that the mind of a buddha is nothing but fences, walls and broken tiles, and he also says that they expound Buddhism always and busily. Please don’t do that. If you cannot hear it, keep it a secret.” ”WHO HEARS IT?” ASKED THE MONK. ”ALL THE SAINTS,” ANSWERED NANYO. To hear or to listen makes the whole difference.

If your mind is silent ... that is the block. If it is removed – and if this silence cannot remove it, nothing else can remove it – then this bird chirping is teaching you the eternal truth of life; then this very silence becomes the teaching. Nothing is said, but a deep understanding starts arising within you. ”WHO HEARS IT?” the monk asked. ”ALL THE SAINTS.” In Zen, a saint means one who can listen, who can listen to the profound silence of existence. It has nothing to do with virtue, with doing good things. It has something to do with your being conscious, alert, aware ... waking up, and suddenly you see the bamboos are saying the same truth that the buddhas have said. The birds are singing from the same life source that you are breathing from. It is one cosmic mystery, in which we all share. The monk must have been utterly stupid, because he goes on asking questions without understanding any answer that has been given. But the compassion of the master tolerates it. He again asks, ”DOES YOUR GRACE HEAR IT?” ”NOT I!” REPLIED NANYO. He was such a great master. Because if he says ”Yes, I hear it” ... the ‘I’ is the barrier; you have to drop it. And there is no reason to hear it, because you are it. That’s why he simply denies; he says, ”NOT I!” The monk still goes on being stupid. ”IF YOU DON’T HEAR IT, HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE TEACHING OF THE LAW BY INANIMATE CREATURES?” ASKED THE MONK. He seems to be thinking in his mind that he is winning a debate! The experience of existence is not a debate. It is not debatable. NANYO ANSWERED, ”IT IS MY GOOD LUCK THAT I DO NOT HEAR IT.” Strange are these statements, but absolutely true. IT IS MY GOOD LUCK, because I am not there. It is my good luck that I don’t hear it – I am it, I have dissolved myself into this silence. I have become this fire; everything else is burned in it. Nanyo must be very compassionate, he said: ”IT IS MY GOOD LUCK THAT I DO NOT HEAR IT. IF I DID, I WOULD BE THE SAME AS ALL THE SAINTS, AND THEN you WOULDN’T HAVE THE CHANCE TO HEAR MY TEACHING.” Looks like a very absurd answer – it is not.

It is the same life source, without any discontinuity ... the heart of the cuckoo and her song is also your being. You don’t hear it, you simply become it. You forget the distance between the singer and the listener, you simply become the song. In this silence, this cuckoo is doing her job, knowing perfectly well that these lectures are dedicated to the solitary cuckoo, deep in the forest. Nanyo said, ”IF I DID, everything would be wrong.” That’s why he is using the word ‘if’. IF I DID – hypothetically, just to carry on the dialogue – IF I DID, I WOULD BE THE SAME AS ALL THE SAINTS. In fact he is talking about all the so-called saints, who are preaching without knowing. ”AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE CHANCE TO HEAR MY TEACHING.” My teaching is not in words. Words are being used, but the teaching is slipped through to your being in the gaps between the words. In the silences of the heart, there is a meeting between the master and the disciple. Both know that something has moved, some energy has been transferred, transmitted. The flame that was asleep in the disciple is asleep no more; it has jumped into aliveness and consciousness. This is the transmission of the lamp. But you can do it only if you have it. A strange situation is needed: the master has to have it and the disciple has to be ready to receive it. Nothing is said, nothing is heard and the dialogue is over. THE MONK SAID, ”IF THAT IS SO, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NO PART IN IT.” NANYO SAID, ”I MYSELF EXPOUND IT FOR THE SAKE OF PEOPLE, NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE SAINTS.” I am speaking for those who do not understand, who cannot hear, who are still not open to receive. I’m not saying anything to the saints who know. THE MONK ASKED, ”AFTER THE PEOPLE HEAR IT, WHAT THEN?” NANYO REPLIED, ”THEN THEY ARE NOT JUST PEOPLE ANYMORE.” That is the only difference. If you can feel the buddha, the master, you are no more a disciple. And there are idiots in the world ... I have talked to you about starting an anti-Fischer-Hoffmann therapy, because the Fischer-Hoffmann therapy is trying to get people to be stronger egos. Even here, there are people who have passed through that therapy. The therapists know nothing about me, and they are even saying that ”you have to drop Osho, you have to be independent.” But it is strange ... nobody here is dependent; you are making independent people again independent, liberated people again liberated?

FENCES, WALLS AND BROKEN TILES that first they should be here and see how people are enjoying independence, freedom. Nobody is forced to follow a theology, a religion, a philosophy, a doctrine. Everybody is asked to be just himself. It is their absolute duty first to be here, and then tell my people to be independent of me. They are independent. Freedom is my message, because the moment you become a buddha, hearing silently your own heartbeat, you are no more a disciple. But it is a little subtle to understand. You can be an egoist in the name of independence and freedom – and then you are as far away from your authentic reality as you can be; stars are not that far away from you. Your ego takes you for a ride. And it becomes more and more difficult, as the ego becomes more and more crystallized, to come out of the prison to freedom – to break the chains, to jump the fence. And that’s exactly what Fischer-Hoffmann therapy is doing. It is against human beings and their growth. They need to be with a master. But this need is not dependence, this need is simply a device so that the master can share his light and his space and make you aware that now you need not be here, you are a buddha yourself. Either you can be a buddha – then you are in freedom, real freedom. Or you can be an egoist – then the freedom is just a name, you don’t know anything about freedom. Nanyo said, ”THEN THEY ARE NOT JUST PEOPLE ANYMORE.” I teach people ... the moment they understand they are buddhas, this much is the difference between the sleeping person and the person who is awake. What I am doing here continuously is pulling on your legs – ”Come out of your blankets, it is time to wake up! It has already been long that you should have been out of bed.” But you are clinging to your bed, clinging to your blanket; it seems to be secure, comfortable. Who knows what awakening will bring? You have to be awake to know. Nobody else can be awake in your place. ONE DAY WHILE GENSHA WAS THINKING, HE HEARD THE VOICE OF A SWALLOW AND SAID, ”HOW WELL IT HAS EXPLAINED THE BUDDHIST TRUTH.” I would like to say only one thing to Gensha: truth is not Buddhist. Truth makes one a buddha – it will make a Mohammedan a buddha, a Hindu a buddha, a Christian a buddha, a Parsee a buddha. It does not matter who becomes awake – the word ‘buddha’ simply means ‘the awakened one’. Truth is not Buddhist; neither is it Mohammedan, nor Hindu, nor Christian. Truth is simply your awareness. But he is saying something beautiful. Drop the word ‘Buddhist’ – ”HOW WELL THE SWALLOW HAS SAID THE TRUTH, SPEAKING PROFOUNDLY OF THE REAL NATURE OF THINGS!” That’s what I was telling you about the cuckoo here! And I am continually reminding you about the bamboos. They are all expounding the truth ... in their silence, in their dancing in the wind, in their joy in the sun, in their beauty with the rain. In every moment, everything around you which is alive is expounding the truth. AND HE CAME DOWN FROM HIS SEAT.

HOW CAN ANYONE TRUST YOU!” I have not said a single word! Go and ask the swallow, learn the language of existence. Otherwise you remain deep in your dreams, drowned, and a tremendous life passes by. AT ANOTHER TIME, UMMON ASKED A MONK, ”DID YOU HEAR THE LONG-BEAKED BIRDS PREACHING ZEN IN KOZEI?” ”NO, I DIDN’T,” REPLIED THE MONK. UMMON THEN RAISED HIS STAFF AND SAID, ”ZEN!” Those long-beaked birds were preaching Zen, because whatever was coming out in their songs was coming from their very center of being. They were not musicians – trained, practicing, disciplined in a school. They were just poor birds without any training and education. Whatever was coming had to be coming from their very being, not from their minds. Ummon’s raising the staff is symbolic. He was saying, ”Everything is teaching Zen.” Everything is teaching to be yourself. Everything is itself except man, who has gone astray. No bamboo is worried, no cuckoo is worried; they don’t go to the psychoanalyst. And your psychoanalyst himself needs psychoanalysis. After every six months he goes to another psychoanalyst because he becomes tired, every day listening to all kinds of crazy, stupid people. You can understand – by and by he himself starts partaking something of their stupidity. A man had the idea that he had died. Now the whole family was worried; they all told him, ”You are alive – who told you this?” He said, ”I don’t need anybody’s advice, I know I am dead!” At first they thought it was a joke, but soon they realized, ”That man has simply gone cuckoo.” They took the man to the psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst said, ”Don’t be worried, it is my profession. I will bring him down.” He asked the man, ”Do you know the old proverb that dead men don’t bleed?” He said, ”Yes, I know – I used to know in fact, before I died, but I still remember. What of it?” The psychoanalyst took a knife and cut the patient’s finger and brought a little blood. The patient said, ”Aha!

Such cases I have heard about, but he will be okay.” And the man sat on the chair and he was continuously throwing off those creatures, all Italians, just spaghetti types. First the psychoanalyst tried to tell him, ”Don’t be worried, nothing is ... I don’t see anything.” He said, ”It does not matter whether you see it or not, they are creeping all over me. I am tortured and you are watching! At least help me to throw them away!” And he pulled his chair close to the psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst said, ”Be off, away, because a few of them have already started crawling over me! I don’t want to take this case, it is dangerous.” It is only a man like me ... You all go crazy and then when I go back to my room I say, ”Great, you survived again so many crazy people!” Never before has any psychoanalyst encountered thousands of people going absolutely crazy, throwing away all their creatures all over the place. What you experience in a few minutes, psychoanalysis takes years to analyze! And still nothing helps. I have not heard that a single patient has been helped to sanity by psychoanalysis or psychiatry. They themselves recognize that nobody in the whole world is perfectly psychoanalyzed, because it takes years, ten years, fifteen years continuously. But they don’t know that here, within five minutes, five thousand people go crazy and come back immediately. Nivedano just has to give the sign – ”Come back, enough!” – and they all sit silently like buddhas. It is a miracle!

Pope the Polack and President Ronald Reagan are meeting in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. They have come for the official opening of the first public swimming pool in the city.

Listen carefully to the birds, because these sounds are coming from the very center of existence. It is life singing, dancing, rejoicing. Before I discuss the anecdote before me, I have a few things to say to you. First – you have to be aware that you are living in an insane world. Unless you see the insanity of the world and its behavior, you will never get rid of it. You will always be in bondage. Just today I came across the statistics: one million children every year are being sold at the high price of twenty to forty thousand dollars, for sexual abuse. And this figure of one million is not the total number, because many countries don’t allow any survey. It is absolutely certain that at least three times more children from poor countries, poor parents, will be sold for sexual abuse. And we call this world sane. Just in New York last year, hundreds of small just-born babies were found thrown into junk yards, into gutters, flushed into toilets. What can be more barbarous? And all these people pretend to be part of some religion – Christian, Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Mohammedan. Why this kind of insane behavior? Because nobody is objecting, because great vested interests are supporting the whole mafia. Your politicians are involved in it, your religious leaders are involved in it. Otherwise, such inhuman acts cannot continue. One suspects whether humanity will ever become a culture, a civilization. Just today I have received a letter from the Shankaracharya of Puri saying that he wants a debate with me. I am perfectly willing, but on what grounds is he going to debate with me? He has said that if a woman is burned alive, becomes a sati, then in Hyderabad rains will come. Now on what grounds can we discuss it? The only way is that the Shankaracharya should become a sati in Hyderabad! And if rains come, I will accept that he was right. If rains don’t come, everybody will know that he was wrong. He thinks in terms of scriptures, not in terms of real life. He thinks that he can discuss with me because in the Hindu scriptures the idea is that a woman whose husband has died has to jump into his funeral pyre. To him, it proves that sati pratha is right. To me, it proves that the scripture has to be thrown into the fire! On what grounds can we discuss? Even so-called great saints, avataras ... I don’t bother how ancient they are. The more ancient, the more rotten. A single act is enough to prove that all the statues of Rama should be removed from all the temples. He killed a young harijan boy, because Hindu scriptures say that the poor harijans cannot read Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 69 Osho"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8. LIKE THE TONGUE OF A DEAD MAN the religious scriptures and this boy – although he was not reading, because they have never been allowed any education – was curious. A few brahmins were doing a ritual, chanting Sanskrit mantras, and this boy, out of curiosity, hiding behind the bushes, heard the Vedic scriptures. This was his crime. And a man of the quality of Rama, whom Hindus believe to be a god, poured hot, liquid lead into the ears of the boy because he had heard the holy scriptures, which was prohibited. The boy died – and still nobody has objected to Rama. To me this is enough to prove that this man is a politician and nothing else. The letter that I have received from this Shankaracharya is an absolute lie. He says, ”I challenged you to a debate twelve years ago.” I have been in Poona from 1974 – twelve years means somewhere near 1976. I have not received any challenge. And anyway, there is still time, but what is he going to prove to me? I encountered him in 1965 in Patna during a world Hindu conference and criticized every point that he was making. And I asked one hundred thousand people who had gathered for the international conference, ”Are you in agreement with me? – then raise your hands!” Not a single person was there who did not raise his hand. He is already defeated! But he is old, and getting more and more senile. To me, just because something is written in a book does not mean that it has to be right. The criterion for its being right has to be humanitarian. The Hindu scriptures say that the women have to be categorized just like animals. The great Hindu saint Tulsidas says that every woman has to be beaten at least once a week. Just because it is written by Tulsidas, it does not become a truth. It simply shows the stupidity of the man, the inhumanity of the man, and his book should be burned. At least all the women around the country, wherever they find Tulsidas’ book, should immediately burn it. It is male chauvinistic. To me, who is not part of any religion, there is no prejudice. Everything has to be clear-cut and straightforward, no politics in it. That’s what the Shankaracharya is doing. And opposing him, another Hindu sannyasin, Swami Agnivesh, is doing the same. Politics is such a game. It makes people like footballs. Their interests are different; Agnivesh is against the Shankaracharya. I am against both, because they are two polarities of the same politics. The Shankaracharya does not want Hindu harijans to enter into Nath Dwara, a temple in Rajasthan. And Agnivesh is determined to take a big crowd of harijans and enter forcibly into the temple, where never in the whole of history has any harijan been allowed. It is not because of great compassion that Agnivesh is trying to bring harijans. And the Shankaracharya is determined that they cannot enter, and he will do everything to prevent the entry because that will spoil the purity of the temple. The harijans should see a simple point, that for centuries Hindus have been entering that temple – what have they gained except poverty, slavery, starvation? What are harijans going to gain by entering in Nath Dwara uninvited, rejected? If they listen to an unprejudiced approach, they should spit on this temple which has never in centuries allowed their ancestors to enter. They should refuse. Even if the Shankaracharya touches their feet and asks them to come into Nath Dwara, they should not enter such ugly places, so inhuman, so violent ... Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 70 Osho"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8. LIKE THE TONGUE OF A DEAD MAN But the poor harijans will not understand a simple fact: you have been tortured for ten thousand years and still you go on thinking of yourselves as Hindu. You are not! Hindus themselves have rejected you; you are not allowed to enter their temples, you are not allowed to read their scriptures. On what grounds do they say you are Hindus? They burn your villages, hundreds of people burned alive – strangely, young children, old men. They just save young girls, to rape, and this has been going on and on for centuries. It is for the harijans to reject Agnivesh and tell him, ”Go and jump into the ocean. Don’t bother us, we are not Hindus.” And tell the Shankaracharya, ”Why are you unnecessarily making a fuss? Who wants to enter your temple? Keep your temple!” Harijans should declare themselves independent from Hindus. They are such a big force that they will change the whole character of Indian politics. They are one fourth of all Hindus; one fourth of the power should go to them. Even Mahatma Gandhi deceived. Before India’s independence, he was saying that the first president should be a harijan girl. He was proposing two things: raising the respect towards women and the respect towards the harijan. And when the country became independent, he forgot it completely. Again the brahmins, the Nehrus ... and they have made themselves a dynasty. They call it democracy. As an individual, I don’t belong to any party or to any religion. I am not a politician and I am not a religious man in the ordinary sense because I am not Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian. I don’t feel that I have to belong to any organization; I am enough unto myself. And that is my whole teaching, that you should not belong to any organization; you are enough. Your splendor has to be independent. The women also have to come to a conclusive decision that they will not vote for men. Half of the country belongs to women – half of the parliament should also belong to them. They should ask for a separate vote; no woman is going to vote for any man of any party. It is not a question of party, it is a question of a long slavery that man has imposed on women. All women should fight against this slavery. In India, the harijans and the women are the two most oppressed, insulted, humiliated beings. If they get together, this country will belong to them. Let these Shankaracharyas and these Nehrus be forgotten. It is a simple fact that freedom has not come to the country. Britain has gone but slavery is still here. What kind of spirituality is it, that does not allow human beings to enter temples? I accept the Shankaracharya’s challenge, but because he is giving the challenge, he will have to accept my conditions. He has to come here, because I don’t go anywhere. And because this gathering is international, he will have to talk in English. No rotten Sanskrit will do. It will be perfectly humorous, we will all enjoy it, but that old goat has to come here – that is the first condition. Second, the language in which the conversation is to happen will be international: the English language.

Now, Maneesha’s Zen anecdote: SEPPO FIRST VISITED ENKAN, THEN TOSU THREE TIMES, AND TOZAN NINE TIMES, WITHOUT RESULT. ... Because Seppo was a great scholar, and all these people were men of reality, not men of knowledge. So although he could feel there was something... but he could not come to a conclusion about what it was. There is something – otherwise why should he go first to Enkan, then to Tosu three times and Tozan nine times, but without coming to a conclusion about what it is? The reason was, he was trying to approach reality through the mind. Mind can only weave philosophies, theorizations, but it cannot know. It is blind as far as your own being is concerned. And that is, emphatically, the only religious experience: where your logic and your reason and your mind no longer function; when you are simply a pure space, unclouded. WHEN AT LAST HE VISITED TOKUSAN, SEPPO ASKED HIM, ”IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SHARE WITH THE PATRIARCHS,” the buddhas, ”IN THE SUPREME TEACHING?” TOKUSAN STRUCK HIM WITH HIS STAFF, SAYING, ”WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?” Intellectually, what he is asking is perfectly valid. Existentially it is absolutely wrong. This distinction you have to remember. He had asked, ”Is it possible for me to share the experience of a buddha?” Nobody can experience through the mind. And without the mind, there is no need to share because you are the buddha. That’s why Tokusan struck him with his staff, saying, ”WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?” THE NEXT DAY SEPPO ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION. TOKUSAN SAID, ”MY RELIGION HAS NO WORDS AND SENTENCES. IT HAS NOTHING TO GIVE ANYBODY.” At this point, SEPPO BECAME ENLIGHTENED. Enlightenment is not something that you can get from somebody else. Tired ... he must have been going to one master, then another master, then another master – three times, nine times. Tokusan was the last master. His intellect tired, his mind tired, he simply sat there when Tokusan hit him with his staff, saying to him, ”MY RELIGION HAS NO WORDS AND SENTENCES. IT HAS NOTHING TO GIVE ANYBODY.” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 72 Osho"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8. LIKE THE TONGUE OF A DEAD MAN In that silence, he suddenly became awake. In this silence, anyone can become awake. I am inviting the Shankaracharya to see for the first time in his life what silence means – it is not a scripture. What a gathering of buddhas means – no mind, but just a dance of being, a rejoicing inside, in your eternity, immortality, in your very truth. And if he comes here, I will have to bring my staff, too. He is old and I don’t want to hit him, but at least I can show him the staff and show him your presence, your silence. This whole silence says more than any scripture can say. One never knows, perhaps even the Shankaracharya of Puri can become enlightened! As far as this moment goes, he is the most unenlightened man on the earth, but from this point, the quantum leap can be possible. Because the road ends; he cannot be more stupid than he is. He cannot fall more, there is no way. He has to turn back. And I would like Swami Agnivesh to know ... Why bother forcing people into Nath Dwara when the priests of Nath Dwara are unwilling? My doors are open. Bring all your harijans and my people will hug them. Give dignity to people! This is very undignified. But politics is politics. Agnivesh knows that the Shankaracharya is going to fight hard. He will not allow harijans to enter and this gives Agnivesh a chance to become a leader of harijans. He belongs to the same old rotten gang, but harijans will think, ”He is our friend.” He is your enemy – as much, or perhaps more, than the Shankaracharya of Puri. All that he wants is votes. I know him. This is a great strategy. Two hundred and fifty million votes are there. Agnivesh is trying to make himself a great leader of the downtrodden and the oppressed, but the real desire is to have power. When this temple’s doors are open, Agnivesh should bring his followers here. We will give them more respect than has ever been given to harijans in the whole of history. They have been treated as cattle. But he will not come here. He also needs a good beating of the staff! He knows nothing of religion. If he knew even a little bit, he would not put harijans into an insulting, humiliating state. This is not giving respect to those who have been treated like animals. Even their shadows make things impure .... In the whole world nobody has been so badly treated as harijans, and still you ask – from the same people, the same temples, the same priests! Harijans should destroy these temples and burn these scriptures and throw these priests into the ocean. They are enough, and they have every right. For thousands of years they have been treated like shoes. Even shoes are treated better. But one never knows, perhaps Agnivesh may become enlightened. It is everybody’s right. If the Shankaracharya of Puri can become enlightened, everybody else in the world becomes entitled to enlightenment.

TOZAN SAID, ”IT IS LIKE THE TONGUE OF A DEAD MAN.” Just as the dead man cannot speak, the mystery of mysteries cannot be spoken. It can be lived, loved. You can be the mystery, but you cannot say anything about it. As far as saying is concerned, a dead man’s tongue is as capable as your tongue. ON ANOTHER OCCASION A NUN ASKED JOSHU, ”WHAT IS THE SECRET OF SECRETS?” JOSH TAPPED HER ON THE ELBOW. THE NUN SAID, ”YOU ARE STILL HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING.” ”NO,” SAID JOSHU. ”IT IS YOU WHO ARE HOLDING ON TO IT.” Joshu’s tapping her on the elbow shows, ”I can tap your elbow – if you are receptive, this much is enough for you to enter into the secret of secrets.” But the poor nun did not understand. She said, ”YOU ARE STILL HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING.” That something was the nun’s elbow. ”NO,” SAID JOSHU. ”IT IS YOU WHO ARE HOLDING ON TO IT. It is not my elbow.” In these small anecdotes tremendous secrets are revealed. He is saying, ”I am not the body. And I am not the mind, because I have not said anything. I just tapped your elbow to make you aware that you are also not a body.” Ordinarily, a Buddhist is not allowed to touch a woman, but only a Zen master can do that because he knows that no one is a body. What nonsense, about male and female – inside is simply a silent space, and that is your eternity. But it is certainly difficult for a woman – more difficult than for a man – not to hold on to the body. A fact is a fact. One day, Mulla Nasruddin caught four flies and told his wife, ”I have caught four flies. Two are women and two are men.” The wife said, ”My god, how do you know who is male and who is female?” He said, ”Very simple. Two were sitting on the mirror for hours, and two were reading the newspaper! And I have been watching. It proves it. There is no need for any other proof.” Why is the woman so attached to the body? It is not only her fault, it is our whole process of upbringing. We make from the very beginning a distinction between boys and girls. In my childhood, I had long hair.

Whatever I am, I am. And just because of my hair, if somebody thinks I am a girl, it is perfectly good! Just a misunderstanding, it harms nobody.” But he was angry and he cut my hair. With the same scissors that he used to cut the cloth in his shop, he cut my hair. I said, ”You will repent.” He said, ”What are you going to do that I will repent?” I said, ”Within a few minutes you will see.” He knew me. He said, ”Don’t do anything dangerous.” I said, ”Now it is going to be dangerous. You have stepped on my freedom. This is my hair.” And I went to an opium-addict barber who was my friend, because nobody else would do that .... In India, when your father dies – only then your head can be shaved. I told the opium-addict barber, ”This is a critical period of our friendship. Shave my head!” He said, ”But what about your father? And everybody will be against me ....” He said, ”I will do it.” And he did it – shaved, within seconds I was back. And people started asking me, ”Has your father died?” I said, ”He must have died. You see my head? That is enough to prove it.” When I entered his shop, the customers said, ”My god! What happened to this boy’s father?” And my father said, ”Unfortunately I am the father, and I am still alive. And look – he was right in saying that I would repent.” He called me inside and told me, ”This is the last time I have done anything to you; just forgive and forget. Never again will I do anything. But this is too much!” – because people from the town started coming. Wherever I went ... and I went all around the town just to bring everybody. They would come and they would say, ”You are still alive? We saw your boy shaved completely. What happened? Who shaved him?” My father said, ”The whole day people were coming to mourn, to sympathize.” When they found that he was alive, they were very much shocked themselves. And I was standing outside watching. One never knows when the moment comes .... From that moment my father had a respect towards me that I don’t think any father has ever had.

Maneesha, these small anecdotes are not just for reading, are not just to become more acquainted with different worldviews. Zen is not possible to capture in scriptures, in doctrines. By thinking, by concentration, by contemplation, you cannot find it. The strangest thing about Zen is that it is hidden in the seeker, and the seeker is running from master to master, from philosophy to philosophy – thinking that by gathering much knowledge he will be able to understand the truth of existence, that he will be able to experience the significance and meaning of life. But going from one master to another master one simply gathers words. And if those masters are not authentic, but only teachers ... Always remember the difference: the teacher is knowledgeable, but it is not his own experience. Somebody has been drinking the water and he is talking about the thirst and the quenching of thirst – for the teacher, these are not his experiences. Perhaps he has seen somebody thirsty and then after drinking water feeling satisfied. He has seen the difference, but still he does not know what happened inside the man who was in thirst and then in contentment. The master knows directly, immediately; it is never, never a borrowed thing. It is his own. It is his own song, it is his own dance. He is not imitating anyone and he is not in any way pretending. The teacher is doing that. The teacher can pretend to be a master – out of a hundred masters, ninety-nine are only teachers. And it is very difficult for people to make out the difference, because both talk the same language. The teacher’s words are empty, but how can you know? The master’s words are breathing, alive, are surrounded by silence and peace. But in your state it is very difficult to make the distinction. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 82 Osho"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9. NO WORDS, NO MIND, AND YOU ARE IN But in Zen, it has been a longstanding tradition since Bodhidharma left India: the disciples wander from teacher to teacher, master to master, listening to this, listening to that, hoping that somewhere they will find the man who triggers in them a flame that was already there, but needed to be triggered. HOGEN BECAME A PRIEST AT THE AGE OF SEVEN. He must have been a very intelligent child. To become a monk at the age of seven is nothing ordinary – an extraordinary perception, at the age of seven, the quest for truth. Even at the age of seventy people are not aware of what this truth is all about. In fact they wonder why people unnecessarily talk about truth, the ultimate, the being – there is so much to do in the world. Money, power, prestige, respectability ... there is the whole world to conquer. Certainly, a boy of seven must have been of immense intelligence to see the futility of all power, of all that the world can give. The very fact that such a small child starts moving from master to master is enough proof of his intelligence. ... STUDYING BUDDHISM AND CONFUCIANISM. Buddhism and Confucianism can be said to be polar opposites. Confucianism is an ancient type of communism – no God, no soul, but only morality, social conduct, social ethics ... a better way of behavior, of being a gentleman, nice and cultured. Confucianism is an education of the personality, while Buddhism is not a study at all. And secondly, Buddhism is absolutely against personality. The more cultured the personality is, the more difficult to penetrate in, because the cultured personality becomes a solid rock. An innocent child has no personality. He is vulnerable; and vulnerability is one of the greatest values for those who are seeking for truth. So Hogen must have been in great difficulty, moving amongst Confucian teachers. They can never be masters, they have never tried to enter in. They have been always cultivating the garden outside the house, painting the house from the outside. They have completely forgotten that the real house is inside. The painted wall, the beautiful garden around, are perfectly good, but one should not end with them. One should not start living in the porch! And that’s what is happening with almost everybody, all around the world. Confucian ideology was prevalent all over the great empire of China and the neighboring countries, and for twenty-five centuries Confucius has been held up as one of the greatest men. Buddhism is a totally different approach. It penetrates within you, it does not bother about your porch. It wants to reach to the center of consciousness, not the garden surrounding your house; not the body, not the mind, but you in your essence. It is a very different way, almost opposite. Confucianism is going outwards. Zen is going inwards. Between these two, this small child of seven, Hogen, must have been in great torture. ONE DAY, SOME YEARS LATER, WHEN HOGEN WAS ON THE WAY TO THE LAKE, IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND HE TOOK SHELTER IN JIZO’S TEMPLE. Jizo is a Zen master. JIZO, WHO WAS SITTING BY THE FIREPLACE, ASKED HOGEN, ”WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 83 Osho"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9. NO WORDS, NO MIND, AND YOU ARE IN These simple questions in Zen have a very different meaning. When a Zen master asks, ”From where are you coming?” he does not mean the place, the village from where you are coming. He means ”From what source have you attained your consciousness? From where are you coming, and where are you going?” These questions are not at all concerned with your outer coming and going. When Jizo said, ”WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” HOGEN REPLIED, ”JUST WANDERING FROM MASTER TO MASTER IN SEARCH OF ENLIGHTENMENT.” At that age, perhaps very few people in the world have even thought about the word ‘enlightenment’. ”WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?” ASKED JIZO. ”I DON’T KNOW,” SAID HOGEN. This purity and this innocence and this exposure ...”I don’t know. I don’t even know why I am trying to find something about which I cannot even say a word. And I am wandering from one master to another master – I don’t know.” ”DON’T KNOW IS THE MOST INTIMATE,” SAID JIZO. A tremendous statement: DON’T KNOW IS THE MOST INTIMATE. All knowledge is far away from you. Only innocence is at the very center of your being. It is the most intimate. This statement of Hogen, ”I DON’T KNOW,” is of tremendous value in Zen. It does not mean that he is ignorant, it simply means he is perfectly aware that he is still not at the center of his being. All that he knows is not worth mentioning. Socrates reached the same statement at the age of seventy: ”I don’t know.” Hogen, at his age, has the same genius, no ordinary thing. Even a man of the quality of Socrates realized it only at the very end of his life – that he knows nothing, and all that he knows is futile. He knows about things, a thousand and one things, but he does not know about himself. Death will take all that knowledge and will leave him alone. And he has not tried, in his whole life, to know that aloneness which will be left ultimately in his hands. That should have been his first concern, because death can come any moment. His last moment he recognized. Although he was known as a great teacher ... he was a great teacher; because of his teachings he was being poisoned. But in the eyes of Zen his knowledge and his logic are just useless. Unnecessarily they poisoned him – an innocent person who does not know himself, who has not yet come home, who has been wandering into words, linguistics, grammar, philosophy. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 84 Osho"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9. NO WORDS, NO MIND, AND YOU ARE IN Hogen is certainly a Himalayan height in consciousness. As far as age is concerned he is only a child, but his mental age is nearabout Socrates’ – seventy. He said, very innocently, ”I DON’T KNOW.” And it needs a man like Jizo, a great master, to understand such a statement. Otherwise you will think, ”What is there in it? He is simply ignorant.” But Jizo could see in the eyes of Hogen that his statement, ”I DON’T KNOW,” is not an expression of ignorance, but an expression of immense awareness: I DON’T KNOW. That’s why Jizo says, ”DON’T KNOW, at this age ... It is the most intimate thing in the world.” Because it opens the doors of wonder and the doors of mysteries. The day you drop all your knowledge, you become unburdened. You can fly, you lose all weight. All religions teach doctrines; Zen simply points to the one who is hiding inside you. There is no other scripture and there is no other God and there is nothing else to learn. First be and explore your inner consciousness, and you will find all the treasures that even Alexander the Great could not find by conquering the world. Conquer yourself. And in conquering yourself is the greatest victory, the most precious experience, because now you know your eternity, beginningless. Now you know death is a lie, it never happens. Only the consciousness moves from one house into another house. It is a house-changing, but the one who changes the house is invisible. Jizo loved the small boy when he said, ”I don’t know.” THE TWO SAT TOGETHER BY THE FIRE, TALKING OF A TREATISE ON BUDDHISM, AND WHEN THEY GOT TO A SENTENCE THAT READ, ”HEAVEN AND I ARE OF THE SAME ROOT,” JIZO ASKED, ”ARE MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS AND THE GREAT EARTH DIFFERENT FROM ME OR THE SAME?” SHINZAN, WHO WAS WITH THEM, REPLIED, ”THE SAME.” In our innermost core we are joined with the stars. It is one organic whole, the whole existence; we are just dewdrops in this vast ocean. JIZO HELD UP TWO FINGERS ... A great genius, this boy Hogen. Jizo has recognized his search and his authenticity. He HELD UP TWO FINGERS, AND, LOOKING AT THEM EARNESTLY, SAID THERE WERE TWO, AND THEN WENT OUT. IT HAD NOW STOPPED RAINING, AND JIZO ACCOMPANIED HOGEN AND SHINZAN TO THE GATE. ON THE WAY, IN THE GARDEN, THERE WAS A STONE, AND POINTING TO IT, JIZO ASKED A QUESTION: ”IT IS SAID THAT IN THE THREE WORLDS, ALL IS MIND. IS THIS STONE IN THE MIND OR OUTSIDE IT?” HOGEN ANSWERED, ”INSIDE IT.” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 85 Osho"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9. NO WORDS, NO MIND, AND YOU ARE IN JIZO SAID, ”YOU PEOPLE ON A PILGRIMAGE, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE STONE IS IN YOUR MIND? Why carry such a load? HOGEN WAS AT A LOSS AND COULD FIND NO ANSWER, SO HE UNDID HIS BUNDLE AND ASKED JIZO TO HELP HIM RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. He stopped going out. He dropped his bag and he said, ”You have to help me resolve this problem: is the stone outside the mind or inside the mind?” AND AFTER A MONTH, HOGEN EXPLAINED HIS VIEW OF PHILOSOPHY, BUT JIZO SAID, ”BUDDHISM IS NOT PHILOSOPHY.” There have been philosophers who say that the stone exists only within you: what you see outside is only a projection, just as you see a projection of a film on the screen. There is nothing outside, you are projecting everything. These philosophers – in India, the Adi Shankaracharya; in England, Bradley ... and Bosanquet, and there were many others in different countries – are trying to say that the outside is only dream. It is your projection, it is not really there. It is your imagination, it is maya, just hallucination, a mirage. In a desert you see a mirage, far away a small pool of water, but as you come closer the water disappears. There was no water; it was only sun rays reflected back from the desert. Because of their reflection and wavering, from far away they created the illusion of water, as if water waves were there. Even if there is a tree, it is reflected in those wavering sun rays. That becomes absolute proof: the tree is reflected in the water; it cannot be reflected in the sand. But when you come close, the tree is standing alone. What you have seen was not true. That is the standpoint of these philosophers, the mayavadins, the illusionists. Jizo became very interested in Hogen and after one month he asked him – Hogen has been studying with him – what was his view. Whatever that small boy must have understood, he said. Jizo said, ”Remember, Buddhism is not philosophy. You have to understand clearly: this is not a school of philosophy; you are not here to inquire intellectually what is true and what is false. You are here to experience what your consciousness is, where your roots are. This is not a school of philosophy, this is pure existentialism.” ... But not the existentialism that is prevalent in the West, because that existentialism has again become intellectual. Zen has been fighting against intellect, against mind, and pushing aside the mind so that it can see directly without thinking. Thinking creates waves, distorts things. The moment you can see without thinking, the truth is revealed in its immense beauty. First it is revealed inside, and then you can start experiencing it spreading all over the universe. Then in every flower it is you; then in every star, however far, it is you. Jizo’s showing two fingers is not the same as Winston Churchill’s two fingers! Winston Churchill means by his two fingers, ”victory.” He is making the ”V” sign. Jizo is saying something else, totally Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 86 Osho"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9. NO WORDS, NO MIND, AND YOU ARE IN different. He is saying, ”Although these two fingers look like two, they are joined deep in oneness. These two fingers are not two, these five fingers are not five; deep down they are joined in oneness.” HOGEN THEN SAID, ”I HAVE NOW GOT TO THE POINT OF AVOIDING ALL WORDS AND GIVING UP ALL PHILOSOPHY.” JIZO SAID, ”IF YOU now EXPLAIN BUDDHISM, EVERYTHING IS ACCOMPLISHED” – without words, without philosophy. AT THIS, HOGEN WAS PROFOUNDLY ENLIGHTENED. Nothing was said. Nothing can be said. He was absolutely silent. Two things joined, and the miracle happened. First he was innocent, and he was aware of his innocence. Secondly, he went into philosophy but when Jizo told him Buddhism is not philosophy, it is actual experience, actualization ... He must have been a very rare child who said, ”If Buddhism is not philosophy, I discard all philosophy, all words. I remain alone in my ignorance.” JIZO SAID, ”That is great. IF YOU NOW EXPLAIN BUDDHISM, EVERYTHING IS ACCOMPLISHED.” But how to say anything when you have discarded words, you have discarded philosophy, you have discarded mind itself? Now you cannot even say ”I do not know,” because that too is using words. Jizo remained utterly silent. In that silence, HOGEN WAS PROFOUNDLY ENLIGHTENED. No words, no mind, and you are in. No words, no mind, and you have realized the ultimate source of your being. And once accomplished, you cannot lose it. Once becoming aware of it, it remains with you twenty-four hours – in life, in death, just an undercurrent of a vibrating and dancing consciousness. That is your reality and that is the reality of the whole existence. Different waves, different wave rhythms, different vibes, but everything is just a vibration of consciousness.

NO WORDS, NO MIND, AND YOU ARE IN NOTHING ON THE MIND, YOUR CHAIR IS WIDE ENOUGH. Zen uses strange ways of explanation because ordinary ways are spoiled by being used for ordinary things, commodities in the marketplace. NOTHING ON THE MIND, YOUR CHAIR IS WIDE ENOUGH – in fact, the whole existence is your chair. It is your mind that is making you so small, so confined, so enslaved. Once the mind is not there, you simply start widening, spreading, and that widening has been found to be the most ecstatic experience. Daito wrote: AT LAST I HAVE BROKEN UNMON’S BARRIER! Unmon was one of the famous masters and he used to call the mind ”the barrier.” Daito must have been a disciple to Unmon. AT LAST, he says, I HAVE BROKEN UNMON’S BARRIER! THERE IS EXIT EVERYWHERE .... All doors and all walls have disappeared. The whole universe has become available. ... EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH. IN AT THE MORNING, OUT AT EVENING, NEITHER HOST NOR GUEST. MY EVERY STEP STIRS UP A LITTLE BREEZE. Just everything is gone, all duality has gone. At the most, MY EVERY STEP STIRS UP A LITTLE BREEZE. In this silence, even that little breeze is not stirred. Question 1 Maneesha asks: IS IT TRUE THAT THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER, ONLY AN APPROPRIATE OR INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE? Maneesha, there is neither a right or wrong answer, nor is there an appropriate or inappropriate response. Because even appropriate and inappropriate will create the distinction of duality. There is only spontaneity, without anything to qualify it as right or wrong. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 88 Osho"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9. NO WORDS, NO MIND, AND YOU ARE IN There is only spontaneity. You fall in love; you can’t say why, you can’t show the cause. You can’t rationalize, you can simply shrug your shoulders. You will say, ”I cannot say why – it just happened.” That which just happens is the most beautiful, the most graceful. There is no question of duality. This is a problem, Maneesha. You can get rid of one duality, and mind immediately provides you another duality – better, refined, a little more difficult to figure out that it is a duality. You have understood that there is no right or wrong but perhaps there is an appropriate or inappropriate response. No. There is only spontaneous response, neither appropriate nor inappropriate – just spontaneous, without any qualification and without any judgment. That’s why the awakened ones have been insisting continuously: don’t judge – judgment creates duality. Non-judgment, and you are at ease, at home. Judgment brings mind in – whether you think it is appropriate or inappropriate. The mind has come in from the back door. You had pushed it out the front door because it was continuously saying, ”This is right and this is wrong.” It has come from the back side, more refined, with a better commodity to sell – the mind is such a good salesman. Now it says, ”Think in terms of appropriate or inappropriate.” But it is again the same game of dividing things. Existence is one; it simply is. To realize this isness is to realize the ultimate freedom from mind and its dualities. Before we enter into this isness, a little laughter – appropriate or inappropriate – is absolutely needed. It will not harm anybody. But it will wake many who have gone to sleep by this time. I have to take care of the sleeping ones before they start snoring! Calvin Dufus, Kowalski’s cousin, is at a nightclub where a ventriloquist and his dummy are telling nothing but Polack jokes. Finally Calvin stands up. ”I’m tired of all these Polish jokes!” he shouts. ”What makes you think that we are all so stupid?” ”Please, sir,” says the ventriloquist. ”They are only jokes, and I have never met a Polack without a sense of humor.” ”I’m not talking to you!” shouts Dufus. ”I’m talking to that little jerk on your knee!” In a big divorce case in Hollywood, Horace Kringecock is in the witness stand. ”Now, as I understand it,” says Babblebrain, his attorney, ”every night you would come home from work, and you would find a different naked man in the clothes closet.” ”Yes,” replies Horace, ”that is right.” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 89 Osho"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9.

He is riding around in the popemobile when he sees two white men pulling a black man out of a river with a rope. The pope directs his popemobile to the water’s edge and leaps out to meet the two white guys. ”Well done,” cries Pope the Polack. ”You have completely restored my faith in the people of South Africa by courageously saving the black man from drowning.” He then throws himself down and kisses the swamp, jumps back into the popemobile, and drives off. ”Who was that?” asked one of the white guys. ”Oh, that was Pope the Polack,” says the other. ”He knows everything about everything.” ”Well, maybe he does,” says the first white guy, throwing the black man back into the river, ”but he doesn’t know shit about hunting crocodiles!” Kowalski finds himself drunk in a train compartment with Father Blessbutt. ”What is yer reading, Yer Holiness?” asks Kowalski. ”It is the Bible, my son,” sighs the priest. Father Blessbutt smells the whiskey on Kowalski’s breath, and continues, ”Right now I am reading the amazing story of Samson. He was the strongest man in the world. ”One day, out in the fields, he saw five thousand Philistines coming over the hill. Samson took the jawbone of an ass and slew five hundred of them. And then he routed the rest.” Kowalski is very impressed. That night he is telling everybody in the pub all about it. ”I’m going to get a Bible,” Kowalski announces. ”My god!” says Nurdski. ”What for?” ”Well,” says Kowalski, ”this priest was telling me that all sorts of amazing things are in it.

SUIBI ASKED TANKA, ”WHO WAS THE TEACHER OF ALL THE BUDDHAS?” A very common question in the Zen tradition. One naturally wants to know who was the teacher of the buddhas.

Their death is also as silent, as peaceful, as their life has been; death cannot be otherwise. You are afraid of death because you are afraid of life. If you love life, if you enjoy life, if your life is a dance, you will never be afraid of death because you know that you can dance through death just as well as you can dance in life. A poem by Reizan: THE MYRIAD DIFFERENCES RESOLVED BY SITTING, ALL DOORS OPENED. IN THIS STILL PLACE I FOLLOW MY NATURE, BE WHAT IT MAY. Just by sitting silently, all doors of existence open. Zen simply means sitting silently, not doing anything. Everything happens spontaneously. It is ready to happen. You are preventing it by being busy – busy without business, doing all kinds of stupid things. This is sheer wastage of a tremendously valuable lifetime. A single moment of silent sitting is an eternity in itself. You have come home. FROM THE ONE HUNDRED FLOWERS I WANDER FREELY. THE SOARING CLIFF – MY HALL OF MEDITATION.

BE AT THE CENTER NOT EVEN THE SHADOW OF A BIRD. Everything is so quiet and silent once your mind is put aside. Question 1 Maneesha has asked: FOR THOSE OF US WHO CONTINUALLY FORGET THAT WE ARE BUDDHAS, IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE SPONTANEOUS, OR ARE WE ONLY EVER IMPETUOUS? Maneesha, you cannot forget to be buddhas, you just have not remembered yet – because once remembered, I cannot conceive of how you can forget. You don’t forget that you are a woman, doing thousands of things; you don’t forget that you are a man, doing a thousand things; you don’t forget that you are alive. And these are very ordinary things. Once you know that you are a buddha, there is no possibility of forgetting it. The real thing is to remember. You forget because it is only intellectually understood that you are a buddha. Naturally, you forget. Intellectually, you cannot breathe – you will forget. You may get engaged in something and forget to breathe. Intellectually, you cannot have your heart beating because somebody insults you, and you will forget completely that the heart has to remain beating. Intellectually, everything is superficial. But to understand existentially is to know by your very marrow, by your very heart, by your very beyond. There is no question of forgetting, ever. I can give you the proof: for thirty-five years I have been trying to forget it and I have failed. I try, day in and day out, to forget. It is so easy to be unenlightened – everybody is enjoying spaghetti. But because of this enlightenment, just the remembrance of spaghetti and I start feeling it is better to commit suicide. Spaghetti? And people are enjoying all kinds of nonsense .... Unfortunately, I became enlightened. You are very fortunate. A little more, enjoy. But one day, remember, if you linger long enough by my side, you are going to become enlightened and never forget it. And you will never forgive me either! Father Murphy is in the church one Friday night when the door bursts open and Paddy stumbles in, very drunk. The priest watches him stagger around the church until he finds the confessional booth and goes inside. Father Murphy feels compassion for the poor drunk Paddy, and goes to hear his confession. He enters his side of the booth and waits for Paddy to begin. Paddy says nothing, just grunts and groans a bit, and then there is silence. The priest becomes impatient and starts knocking on the wall, to encourage Paddy to begin his confession.

But shortly after arriving at the honeymoon hotel, the still nervous Sammy becomes worried about the state of his bride’s innocence. Deciding on the direct approach, he quickly undresses. Then pointing at his exposed manhood, he asks Clarissa, ”Honey, do you know what this is?” Without hesitation, she blushes and says, ”Why yes, that is a wee-wee.” Delighted at the idea of instructing his innocent wife in the ways of love, Sammy whispers, ”From now on, dearest, this will be called a prick.” ”Ah, come on!” says Clarissa. ”That’s a wee-wee. A prick is big and black!” Bernard the bartender owns a dog called Bessie, who always hangs out in the bar during the evening. But one day, just after Bernard has opened the bar, Bessie wanders over to the entrance and deposits a big shit just inside the door. Bernard does not notice this, and the first customer to come in is Kowalski. Kowalski’s first step inside lands straight in the pile of shit. He slips ass over tit, slides along the floor and hits his head against the bar. ”Wow!” cries Kowalski, rubbing his head. ”Give me a double whiskey.” The next guy to come in is McCabe, a huge Irishman. He also steps in the shit, slips ass over tit, slides across the floor and hits his head on the bar. ”Jesus Christ!” cries McCabe, rubbing his head. Kowalski is watching all this, and says sympathetically, ”I did that.” So McCabe picks up Kowalski, carries him over to the shit, rubs his nose in it and then throws him out of the door. It is January, 1989, and Osho has been elected President of the United States. Swami Deva Coconut has just moved back to the States and he goes into his favorite bar, The Hilarious Horse Pub, and says to the bartender, ”Give me a glass of beer. And put on the six o’clock news – I want to see President Reagan’s latest speech to the nation.” ”I am sorry,” says the bartender, ”but Reagan is no more in office; Osho is president.” The next evening Coconut goes into the same bar and says, ”Give me a beer, and put on the six o’clock news. I want to see Reagan’s latest speech to the nation.” ”But I told you yesterday,” says the bartender, ”Osho is president now.” But the same thing happens every day that week. Finally, on Saturday, the bartender loses his temper.

It is a miracle that in such small dialogues, the greatest of experiences, which are inexpressible, are expressed. Look at this small anecdote: KINZAN, GANTO AND SEPPO – all masters – WERE DOING ZAZEN WHEN TOZAN CAME IN WITH THE TEA. Zazen, as you know, means simply sitting and doing nothing. Not even thinking, because thinking is also doing. Simply not doing anything – physical, mental, or spiritual – just being like a flame, unwavering, without any wind around. TOZAN CAME IN WITH THE TEA. KINZAN SHUT HIS EYES. TOZAN ASKED, ”WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” Do you see the point? By closing your eyes, certainly you are going inwards, but exactly where? Because just the word ‘inward’ is not indicative of any destination. The inwardness is as vast as outwardness. ”WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” KINZAN REPLIED, ”I AM ENTERING DHYANA” – meditation. In an ordinary way, his answer is perfect. But Zen is not ordinary – never for a single moment. It is always and always extraordinary. Because Tozan immediately said: ”DHYANA – meditation – HAS NO GATE; HOW CAN YOU ENTER INTO IT?” Now ... great masters, just at tea time, talking of great things ... Tea time becomes absolutely sacred. Tozan’s point is that dhyana has no gate; it is all openness, it is the whole sky inside – how are you going to enter? From what gate? It has no gate. Out of the remaining three, nobody said anything. It is true; there is no gate inside. And this is also true, that just by sitting silently, doing nothing, without any gate, you enter in. The gate is not a necessity. Can’t you enter this Buddha Hall without a gate? Inside there is no wall, no question of a gate; hence the remaining three masters did not say a single word. Tozan has uttered an ultimate question; only silence can be the answer. A MONK ASKED JOSHU, ”WHAT IS THE WAY WITHOUT MISTAKES?” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 103 Osho"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11. DHYANA HAS NO GATE JOSHU SAID, ”KNOWING ONE’S MIND, SEEING INTO ONE’S NATURE, IS THE WAY WITHOUT MISTAKES.” Mind can commit mistakes but once you are beyond mind, there is no one to commit mistakes. Mind can go wrong, but beyond mind there is no way of going wrong. Beyond mind, you are simply drowned into your own nature. A MONK ASKED GANTO, ”WHEN THE THREE WORLDS ARE ATTACKING US, WHAT SHALL WE DO?” By the Three Worlds is meant heaven, earth, and hell. And they are all attacking us, throwing us this way or that way, pulling this way or that way. WHEN THE THREE WORLDS ARE ATTACKING US, WHAT SHALL WE DO? GANTO SAID, ”SIT STILL!” THE MONK WAS SURPRISED AND SAID, ”PLEASE EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE.” A little more is not possible. SIT STILL is more than enough already. Sit still and there is no hell, no heaven, no earth. Just one single universe, all boundaries dissolved, all divisions disappeared. Now what more can be said? But the poor monk could not understand. He asked, PLEASE EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE. Ganto said, BRING ME MOUNT RO ... RO is Japanese for Mount Sumeru – I have explained it to you, the gold mountain in heaven, a thousand times bigger than the Himalayas. Nobody knows its end and nobody knows its beginning. Ganto said, ”Bring me Sumeru and I will tell you.” He is saying to the monk, ”Don’t ask stupid questions; otherwise I have to answer stupidly. Don’t be idiotic; otherwise out of compassion I have to be idiotic with you, just so you have companionship.” Nobody can bring Mount Sumeru. It is just a mythology, it exists nowhere. And even if it exists, how can you bring it? Asking a question that assumes something more can be said about meditation than ”Sit still” is asking something absolutely impossible. Sit still and all three worlds disappear. In this moment, listening to the cuckoo, all has disappeared. There is only a deep silence, in, deepening within your being. ON ANOTHER OCCASION, ZUIGAN ASKED GANTO, ”WHAT IS THE ETERNAL AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THINGS?” GANTO REPLIED, ”MOVEMENT” – change. ZUIGAN ASKED, ”WHAT IS THIS MOVEMENT?” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 104 Osho"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11. DHYANA HAS NO GATE GANTO SAID, ”WHEN YOU SEE THINGS MOVE, CAN’T YOU SEE THIS ETERNAL AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THINGS?” A rosebush growing, bringing roses ... a cuckoo suddenly starts singing, and each moment everything is growing that is living. The bamboos are becoming bigger, and even the Himalayas are becoming bigger. Howsoever slow the change ... the Himalaya becomes one foot higher every year. But in this eternity that is too much. Finally, you can imagine, if it does not stop growing it will become absolutely impossible for another Edmund Hillary to reach Mount Everest. But existence is growing. Trees are growing, you are growing, your consciousness is growing. Nothing is static. Movement is the fundamental question, and Ganto has put it correctly: When you see things move, can’t you see this eternal principle of things? Life is growth, in short. The moment you stop growing, you are dead. Life has to be a river, always moving. The moment you become frozen somewhere, the movement is stopped, life disappears. Even your going in is growing every day, deeper and deeper and deeper. You have to find the eternal source of your being. It is a great dive inside. And every day, every moment, you can go on growing in it. There is no end to it. You don’t simply become a buddha and stop. If you stop, then you become just a stone statue. I sometimes wonder ... all these stone statues of Buddha around the world – are these real people who have stopped growing and become stones? Will they ever understand and start growing again, and talking and walking? Even Gautam Buddha has accepted that there is something still beyond him. He is not the end, he is only the beginning. A true understanding, an honest expression – Buddha says, ”I am only born, now the growth begins.” ZUIGAN WAS LOST IN THOUGHT – listening to Ganto – AND GANTO SAID, ”IF YOU AGREE TO THIS, YOU ARE STILL IN THE DUST OF THIS WORLD.” This is a very beautiful point to be remembered. If you agree to this, to what I have said, remember: agreement means movement has stopped. You have already agreed. If you agree to this, you are still in the world. AND IF YOU DISAGREE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SUNK IN LIFE AND DEATH. What a great insight, that even agreement or disagreement are not allowed. You are to grow beyond all dualities, it does not matter what the duality is. Because every duality means choosing one against the other, and growth stops. Life is a choicelessness. Never choose. Just be, and allow your being to grow to unknown skies, to unknown spaces. And you will find your buddhahood bringing more and more flowers, showering more and more blessings, bringing greater and greater ecstasies. And there is no end to it.

LIKE LIGHTNING, ALL THOUGHTS COME AND PASS. JUST ONCE LOOK INTO YOUR MIND DEPTHS: NOTHING ELSE HAS EVER BEEN. Two points he is making in his small poem. ONE MINUTE OF SITTING – even one minute of sitting without doing anything, no thought is stirred inside you, all is utterly silent – ONE INCH OF BUDDHA. You have found at least one inch of buddhahood. And you don’t need much more. Each moment, go on. And whatever you have found will also go on growing. From one inch to one yard, and from one yard to one mile, and from one mile to one light year, and it will go on and on. Buddhahood is a pilgrimage which ends nowhere. And what is the meaning of sitting? Like lightning, all thoughts come and pass; you just remain watchful. Don’t make any judgment or identification. Just like lightning, let them come and go. You remain in your depths, just silent and witnessing, and you will be surprised: nothing else has ever been, except your inner depth. Your innermost silence is the stuff existence is made of. Question 1 Maneesha is asking: BELOVED OSHO, THE STORY OF ZUIGAN SEEMS TO HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD, DOESN’T IT? IS IT NOT SO, THAT WE ARE LITERALLY ”LOST IN THOUGHT” AND FOUND AGAIN IN MEDITATION? Maneesha, ordinarily what you are saying is absolutely right. In thought, you are lost, in meditation you are found. But if you want to listen to the answer in Zen language, there is no losing and no finding. There is simply silence. You are not. These songs of cuckoos pass through you just as through a hollow bamboo. In thoughts, you start imagining that you are. When thoughts are not there, don’t start imagining that now you are really. Once thoughts are gone, you are also simply a thought; you are also gone. Then what remains is only a pure consciousness, without any ”I” attached to it.

DHYANA HAS NO GATE You don’t find yourself, you simply lose yourself, both the ways: either you lose yourself in thoughts or you lose yourself in no-thought. But losing yourself in thought is very ordinary; losing yourself in no-thought has a splendor and an eternity of joy and bliss. You are not there, but there is a dance of pure consciousness. It is not your dance – you are gone with your thoughts. You were nothing but the combination of your thoughts. As one by one your thoughts disappear, part by part you melt away. Finally, you are no more. And this is the moment – when you are no more – that the ultimate is in your hands. It is a strange situation: When you are, your hands are empty. When you are not, your hands are full. When you are, you are simply misery, anguish. When you are not, there is bliss. You cannot say, ”I am blissful”; there is only bliss. There is only silence. There is only truth. The cuckoos have become silent, waiting for a few laughs from you. Remember, laughter is one of the ways in which you can disappear. Only laughter remains. ...

When it is done he says, ”How much do I owe you, my good man?” ”Nothing, Father,” replies the barber. ”No charge for a man of the cloth.” The next day a big box of chocolates for the barber’s wife is delivered to the shop.

BANZAN SAID, ”THIS LUNATIC WILL PERVERT THE TRUE WAY FROM NOW ON.” Maneesha, Zen is more a gesture than an explicit explanation. It is a very subtle fragrance. You need immense sensitivity to feel the breeze and its coolness. It does not speak loudly, it whispers – but whispers immense music, great poetry. It only hints, without any explanation. If you are centered in yourself the hint is enough; if you are not centered in yourself, even the whole explanation will be of no use. It will give you more knowledge, more ego, a more sophisticated personality, but it will not make you wise ... as wise as an innocent child, those clear eyes which can see without any judgment .... In these anecdotes you will find again and again the indication of the wordless. The whole process of Zen is that nothing has to be disciplined, nothing has to be achieved. All that has to happen has happened; just you have to be awake to see it. You are already at the point where you want to be, but you have never looked underneath your feet. Zen is only a warning: ”Don’t run, just sit still.” In your very stillness is hidden the whole splendor of existence. Out of context, these Zen anecdotes will look a little crazy. But in the context of Zen they have immense meaning, although the meaning is not logical. The meaning is existential. ONCE A MONK MADE A PORTRAIT OF JOSHU AND GAVE IT TO HIM ... Joshu being one of the greatest masters. JOSHU SAID TO THE MONK, ”TELL ME, DOES THIS LOOK LIKE ME OR NOT? IF IT LOOKS LIKE ME, I WILL BEAT ME TO DEATH; IF IT DOES NOT I WILL BURN YOU TO DEATH!” Zen is going beyond I and you; the portrait can only be of the body, which is not you. The portrait is only of your skeleton but not of your consciousness. Of course it cannot be like Joshu. I am reminded of a great painter. A beautiful young lady was visiting him. The painter was immensely impressed by her beauty – the painter was no one other than Picasso. And Picasso had made a self- portrait, which was hanging on the wall behind him. The young lady asked, ”Is it your self-portrait?” Sometimes poets and painters and musicians and dancers, whether they belong to the East or to the West, come very close to the Zen understanding. Picasso said, looking at the portrait, ”I think it is not me.” The lady said, ”This is strange ... you have been telling people that this is your self-portrait.” Picasso said, ”If it were me, it would have kissed you! And this idiot is simply hanging on the wall. How can it be me?” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 112 Osho"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12. HIDDEN BEHIND THESE REFLECTING EYES Joshu is asking, ”Tell me, does this portrait look like me? IF IT LOOKS LIKE ME I WILL BEAT ME TO DEATH.” Me is not your real life. Me is only a utilitarian word: it is useful but it is not real. There is no one inside you who can say ”Me.” The moment you are silent there is no ‘me’, no ‘I’, no ‘thou’. Joshu is making the point, according to Zen language, that ”if you say it looks like me, I will beat me to death, because the death of me can only be my life.” In the death of the ego you are resurrected; you find a new space, a new being, a new eternity. ‘Me’ is just for the marketplace. And he said, ”IF IT DOES NOT, I WILL BURN YOU TO DEATH” – because you and I are just a polarity of the same non-existential but utilitarian subject. Joshu is saying, ”Just tell me – whatever you say, either I am going to kill myself or I am going to kill you, but murder is going to happen!” THE MONK HAD NOTHING TO SAY. The monk was not a man of great understanding. He may have been a good painter, but he had no perception of the reality which is faceless, egoless, which is not a personality. Joshu is trying to remind him, ”Don’t waste your time in making portraits of illusions.” Why do you go on painting the moon reflected in the water? When the moon is available, why don’t you look up? But you are too attached to the reflection in the water, even though it brings only misery ... A reflection cannot give you nourishment; a reflection is continuously changing, it is in the hands of the winds. You cannot hold the reflection of the moon in the water. And that’s what everybody is trying to do. Somebody is trying to hold power – a reflection of the moon in the water. Somebody is holding on to prestige, respectability, to richness. Anything that is outside you is only a reflection in your eyes. Your eyes are functioning like a silent lake of water. Rather than bothering about what is reflected, go in and see who is hidden behind these reflecting eyes. But the monk was not able to say anything. He failed. ONE OF KINZAN’S MONKS PAINTED A PORTRAIT OF HIM AND PRESENTED IT TO HIM. KINZAN SAID TO THE MONK, ”IS IT LIKE ME OR NOT?” THE MONK MADE NO ANSWER.

And things which are false, whether they are ugly or beautiful does not matter. What matters is reality. Whatever you think you are is just your portrait. When you stand before a mirror, you are standing before your portrait. Just look in the mirror and see: is this portrait you? All personality is given by society.

That which is natural you can find only in deep silence. Your words, your mind, are continuously distracting you, taking you away from yourself. Kinzan is saying, LET THE ASSEMBLY DECIDE, because neither you know nor I know. Then let the people decide, because this portrait, this personality that appears on the outside, can be decided only by others. Just think for a moment: do you ever feel, from inside, many things that are imposed upon you by the outside? For example, in the East the old man becomes more respectable. He does not feel any problem in becoming old; the more elderly and ancient he becomes, the more respect is available to him from the society. But in the West, to become old is thought to be like a disease. One avoids it as much as possible, by all kinds of means – plastic surgery ... But whatever you do ... even those who have gone through plastic surgery will one day enter the grave. It cannot be avoided; you cannot say, ”This is not right – I have gone through plastic surgery and still the oldness is coming.” And after oldness is death. The West worships youth, but youth is fleeting. The East shows a better understanding by giving respect to the old. It is saying, just as oldness makes you wise, death will make you wiser! Don’t be worried – all these things change, and that which changes from childhood till death is not you. Within all this change there is something that remains unchanging, and nobody can make a portrait of it. FUKE WAS THE CHIEF DISCIPLE OF BANZAN, AND WAS THE MOST ECCENTRIC OF ALL THE ZEN MONKS. WHEN BANZAN WAS ABOUT TO DIE, HE ASKED HIS MONKS TO BRING HIM HIS PORTRAIT, BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH ANY OF THEM. AT THAT TIME, FUKE HAD ONE OF THEM, AND BANZAN SAID, ”WHY DON’T YOU SHOW ME IT THEN?” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 114 Osho"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12. HIDDEN BEHIND THESE REFLECTING EYES FUKE TURNED A SOMERSAULT AND WENT OUT. BANZAN SAID, ”THIS LUNATIC WILL PERVERT THE TRUE WAY FROM NOW ON.” You should not think that Banzan is condemning Fuke. These words are very loving, and Banzan in fact is saying that what other learned, so-called scholarly people have not been able to do, the man who was thought to be eccentric has managed. He simply turned a somersault and went out. He is saying something through his gesture – ”At this moment of death, why are you worried about your portrait? What will you do with it? Just take a somersault and go out!” Zen has never taken death seriously. Nobody can take death seriously who knows. It is a fiction. BANZAN SAID, ”THIS LUNATIC WILL PERVERT THE TRUE WAY FROM NOW ON.” He is not condemning him, he is simply saying that this lunatic has proved wiser than the other so-called wise monks. And from now on he will be followed, but following is a perversion. Zen wants you to act authentically. You should not repeat, you should not imitate. Now you can understand what Banzan is saying. He is saying, ”This lunatic has done the thing. He has shown me the way – ‘Don’t bother, just take a somersault and go out! It is time to go out, you have lived enough in the body. Now what are you going to do with the portrait?’” But only people deeply nourished in Zen will be able to understand why Banzan says that Fuke will ”pervert the True Way from now on” – because many will follow what he has done. At this moment it was spontaneous; from now on, anybody doing it will be just an imitation. He has done it so perfectly that there is every possibility he will be imitated, and that imitation is the perversion of the True Way. When Rinzai was dying he asked his disciples, ”I have lived my life always authentically and originally. Now I don’t know how to die originally. You are my disciples – will someone suggest a way?” Just see the point that even death is just a game: ”Will someone suggest how I should die? – so nobody can say that I was not original.” The disciples looked at each other. It was a very difficult question. Almost ninety-nine point nine percent of people die lying on the bed. But that is not original, that is a very traditional way of dying. Someone suggested that an ancient monk had died sitting in the lotus posture .... Rinzai said, ”If somebody has died sitting in the lotus posture, now that is no longer original. You suggest something that is ORIGINAL.” Somebody suggested, ”You can die standing.” But one monk said, ”I have heard about one monk who died standing, so I don’t think that is original.” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 115 Osho"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12. HIDDEN BEHIND THESE REFLECTING EYES Rinzai said, ”Such a difficulty! Can’t anyone suggest to me, in my old age ... I have been teaching you my whole life and you cannot even help me to die originally?” One disciple said, ”The only thing I can conceive is to die standing on your head. I don’t think anybody has done that before.” Rinzai said, ”This looks right. Is there any objection?” And there was no objection from his thousands of disciples, so he decided to stand on his head and die. And he stood on his head and died! Now the disciples were in difficulty: What to do with such a man? Is he really dead? Can somebody die and still remain standing on the head? Should we burn him, or wait? Perhaps he is not dead .... They tried in every way to find out: the breathing is not there, the heartbeat is not there, and my god, he is standing on his head! Even people who are alive and are not practicing yoga will find it very difficult to stand on the head. And dead people don’t practice yoga. Somebody suggested, ”The only way to be on the safe side is ... his elder sister is a nun, living in a nearby monastery. It is better that we call her and tell her, ‘Your brother is dying and he is making a fool of himself, standing on his head. He is creating trouble for us.’” The nun came and she said to Rinzai, ”Rinzai, you have always been mischievous from your childhood. Now this is no time to be mischievous – just get up and lie down and die the way people usually die!” Rinzai stood up, laughed ... and the whole assembly laughed – ”This is strange!” And he lay down on the bed, and the sister went away. She did not even wait, and he was dying! Now it became even more difficult for the disciples to decide whether he was dead or not. He opened one of his eyes and said, ”Don’t be worried, I am dead. You just prepare for the funeral; otherwise the sun is going to set and it will be night. You prepare the funeral while I rest.” Great people ... strangely great. But they have happened only on the path of Zen, because Zen does not take anything seriously – neither life nor death, neither good nor bad. Its insistence is very simple and single: just find your inner center, from where your consciousness arises and radiates. Then do whatever comes spontaneously to you and it is right. Even if the whole world says it is wrong, it does not matter. Ryokan has written: I SEEM TO HEAR YOUR VOICE IN THE SONG OF THE CUCKOO.

Life and death are nothing; they are just like another day passing in the mountains, or the song of the cuckoo suddenly bursting forth and then disappearing.

It does not matter whether you go on living or you stop breathing, but first fulfill a simple requirement: NOTHING IN YOUR MIND AND NO MIND IN THINGS. Vacant, and you are spiritual, empty, and you are marvelous. Now you can live or you can die; they are just two sides of the same coin.

Then one morning a letter arrives, but all it says is, ”I am fine. How are you? Your son, Paddy Dunn.” There is no address on it, so they look at the postmark, which says ”London W.C.1”.

Prem Hasya has been on a world tour with a project of creating the atmosphere amongst scientists, artists, painters, musicians, for a World Academy – which belongs to no race, to no religion, to no nation, and whose concern is absolutely the whole world. Just today she is back, and she reported to me that she had gone to see the chief editor of the German newspaper, DIE WELT. The journalist who had taken her was immensely interested in the project and wanted to write a detailed article about it. He could see the potential of a World Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 123 Osho"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13. THE PRICE OF RICE IN JOSHU Academy of Creative Science, Art and Consciousness as a defense against those who are preparing to destroy the whole world in nuclear warfare. But the journalist, of course, wanted to ask the permission of the chief editor. Coming out of the chief editor’s office he told Hasya that the man had thumped the table and shouted, ”I am a Christian and I will protect the Fatherland!” when the journalist had said he wanted to write a positive article about Osho. What kind of Christianity is this? Thumping on the table is showing your immense violence. It does not indicate any relationship with Jesus, who said, ”Love your enemies ... even love your neighbors.” Unfortunately he forgot to say, ”Love your tables.” They are absolutely innocent .... Thumping the table and calling himself a Christian is contradictory. Either start learning drum-beating or be a Christian. To be a Christian ... in its essence, it is a message of love. And unfortunately his famous newspaper is called DIE WELT; in English it means ”The World.” And exactly for that purpose Hasya had gone there – to save the world from the destructive politicians all around, all over the world. Right now there are five nations with nuclear weapons; by the end of this century there will be twenty-five members in the nuclear club. Every day the possibility to save the world becomes less and less. He should resign immediately from his newspaper. He does not deserve to be the chief of a newspaper called ”The World.” And he also seems stupid in saying, ”I will protect my Fatherland.” Only German stupidity calls their country ”Fatherland.” The whole world calls their country ”Motherland,” because every child is born out of the mother, not out of the father! The earth is our mother – that seems to be a more symbolic and sensible proclamation than to call one’s country the fatherland. It is male chauvinistic. He is neither a Christian nor a gentleman, and he is the chief editor of the famous German newspaper, ”The World.” I am going to send Hasya again: go directly to the chief editor, and if he hits the table, hit on his head! He is fast asleep, he needs to be awakened. These are the people who are going to destroy the world. He talks about protecting his fatherland and the whole purpose of the World Academy is to bring you to your senses that now nations are out of date – it is either the whole of humanity or no humanity. The alternative is absolute and categorical: either we can protect all ... but then we have to drop our old prejudices. What is it to be an Indian, or to be English, or to be German, except a prejudice? Protecting prejudices, protecting your darkness that you have inherited from the past ... these are the people who are going to destroy the world. Humanity in general has to be made aware that these people should not be in any positions of power; these are fascists, hidden enemies of mankind. I have taken up the issue particularly because there is a German photographer here who is going to take the message to Germany. But anyway, whether he takes the message or not, Hasya as my international secretary is going to hit this son-of-a-bitch who thinks he is a Christian. And all my sannyasins who are German should remember: it is their duty, their responsibility to go around to such people and force them to change their minds.

Otherwise politicians are determined to bring about a third world war. The name of his newspaper reminded me of the name of President Truman. He was responsible for dropping atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and his name was ”true-man.” Couldn’t America find an UNtrue man to destroy more than two hundred thousand people within three minutes? Now this fellow is editing a newspaper called ”The World,” but his mind is very small, very tiny, just German, prejudiced. Deep down Adolf Hitler is still there in his thumping on the table. By the way I want to remind you also that Jesus was never a Christian. He lived as a Jew, he was born a Jew. He died on the cross as a Jew. He had never heard even the word ‘Christianity’. The word ‘Christianity’ came into existence three hundred years later. It came because the Hebrew gospels were translated into Greek and the Hebrew word messiah becomes christ in Greek. Because of this translation, the whole religion has become ”Christianity.” Otherwise, Christianity is nothing but a projection of the Jewish mind; they are followers of a Jew. And it is a strange twist of fate that they have been killing Jews. Sigmund Freud, himself a Jew, perhaps got the idea from this phenomenon that somewhere in the past man created a situation in which the father was killed, and the guilt of killing the father has created God. It looks very farfetched, but there seems to be a reason for killing fathers. If they are too dominant, and go on living like the Polack pope ... now somebody is bound to shoot him. How long can you tolerate ...? He has forgotten to die. All the cardinals are waiting like vultures on the trees for when this idiot dies. But there seems to be no sign, every week he is checked and he is perfectly healthy. Perhaps in such a situation the son has no chance to assert himself ... but it is a psychological myth, although significant. But as far as Christians are concerned, they are killing Jews – who are their fathers, who were father to their messiah, Jesus. And it is very strange that the people who call themselves Christians are the cause of most of the bloodshed on the earth. The whole approach of Jesus is of love. He even says God is just love. Strange love, strange idea of love – and then crusades, burning living human beings, all out of love, just for their sake. And whenever violence is done ”for your sake,” it is the ugliest. It does not even leave you a chance to protest. You are being killed so that you can enter into paradise – it is strange that people are sending others to paradise. Why don’t they commit suicide themselves? Who is preventing them from going to paradise? They have to stop this public service of sending others to paradise. First they should go. If every Christian goes to paradise by committing suicide, I think perhaps many will follow. That will be the right way. Particularly this chief editor of ”The World” has to commit suicide on his table. And when my German sannyasins who are here go back, go to his office, continuously harass him, bring him to his senses. Because it is not a question of a single person, this is the mind of all politicians, all so-called great journalists. And this attitude is immensely dangerous. We have to get rid of all these prejudices if we want to live in peace, in love, in joy, in ecstasy ... in dance, under the stars.

The Nirvana Sutra cannot be separate from existence.” He is bringing the existential to an intellectual scholar.

THE PRICE OF RICE IN JOSHU What does it matter whether Jesus was born out of poor Joseph or the Holy Ghost? What difference does it make to you? In fact, if he is born out of the Holy Ghost, your Holy Ghost becomes unholy. He has destroyed the virginity of a poor girl. And Christianity says that God, the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ are all one, three sides of one reality. Just look at the absurdity of it: God the father, Jesus the son, and the Holy Ghost – the real father – all are one. At least one has to be the uncle. And if the Holy Ghost corrupted a virgin girl, that really means God is also involved in it. For eighteen centuries, Christianity has been continuously discussing – as if it is of much importance – whether the Holy Ghost really corrupted her. And why are you so insistent that Jesus should be born out of a rape? What is the interest? All these theologians seem to be sex maniacs. Just a few days before, the Polack pope declared, ”It is our fundamental principle: Christianity cannot be Christianity if Jesus is not born out of a virgin woman. We cannot drop this idea.” Don’t drop it, carry it – make a few more virgins pregnant! Anyway, you are against condoms .... But it seems that after Jesus Christ, God and the Holy Ghost both have started using condoms. The condom is a religious symbol now. And if you look at other religions, the same is the situation.

But what does it matter whether he was riding on a horse or on a donkey or in a Rolls Royce? What does it mean? What has religion to do with it? Zen is not concerned about all these things at all. It is concerned with the very essential: You! And everything else is nonsense. Find yourself and don’t be bothered with scriptures, there are millions.

Question 1 Maneesha has asked: BELOVED OSHO, IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS NOTHING AS UNCOMMON AS THE SO-CALLED ”COMMON SENSE.” WILL THE ORDINARY ALWAYS BE SO RARE? It is true, Maneesha, common sense is very rare because to be ordinary ... the ego prevents you. It wants you to be extraordinary, to be special, to be a V.V.I.P. It does not allow you to be ordinary, simple, nobody, a nothingness – which is your real nature. In that ordinariness, in that nobodiness, is your real home. Outside it is only misery, suffering, death, anguish, angst. Settling in your simple innocence, knowing nothing ... just being, and you have become an emperor without any empire. No anxiety of the empire at all, just a pure emperor. This pure essence of your being is called the buddha, the awakened, the enlightened. There is no other dance and no other joy. There is no other poetry, there is no other music which can go higher, deeper, which can be without limits, than the joy of an awakened being. It is your birthright.

Tomorrow will be too late, so I have to deal with it today. I used to think that idiots don’t grow, they always remain idiots. Today I found that they do grow – they become more idiotic. The whole credit goes to that old goat of Puri, the Shankaracharya. For almost two weeks he had been insisting that no untouchable, no sudra can enter into the temple of Nath Dwara. It will destroy the purity of thousands of years; no sudra has ever entered it. He has even challenged me to a discussion on the point; and he has asserted in a press conference that he is ready to be arrested, but he won’t allow any untouchable to enter the temple of Nath Dwara. But in these ten days, from every nook and corner of the country, he has been bombarded. He was hoping at least that the orthodox will support him, but they have remained silent. No intelligent man can support him. Seeing that the situation is getting out of hand, today he has made a statement, that ”I have been misrepresented.” Hundreds of newspapers in all the thirty languages of this country for ten days continuously have been misrepresenting him and he has been silent. Now he has come with a new statement and the statement is, ”I never said that harijans, the untouchables, cannot enter Nath Dwara. I said they do not need to enter Nath Dwara; they are God’s people” – the word ‘harijan’ means God’s people – ”and they don’t have to go to any temple, God will come to them himself.” In the first place no Hindu scripture calls them harijans, they are called sudras, untouchables. The word ‘harijan’ was invented by Mahatma Gandhi for his own politics. Sometimes just by changing a name a great consolation comes. He started calling the sudras God’s own people, but nothing changed. And it is very strange that God’s own people should always suffer and the others, who are not God’s own people, should enjoy richness, respectability and all the advantages that are available. But harijans were happy to lose their name ‘untouchable’. It means that they are so dirty that they cannot even be touched, not even their shadow can be touched.

But with the changing of their name to harijans, God’s own people, sudras felt very good, very consoled. This is how the politicians and the priests work. In reality nothing changes, just the label. But now it makes them feel that they ARE God’s own people. This Shankaracharya of Puri is saying something which is even more stupid than his earlier statement that he will prevent harijans from entering Nath Dwara. Now he is saying, ”They are God’s own people, God will come to them.” I want to ask him – what about others? What about himself? Why are others going to the temples? Nobody should go. At least the temple of Puri should be closed to the Shankaracharya. If God is going to come to people of his own choice, then the brahmins – who have been the people of his choice for thousands of years – should not go to the temples. In fact nobody should go. I agree perfectly, there is no need. These temples should be changed into schools, into hospitals, into anything utilitarian. They have accumulated most of the money of the country, and it should be used for schools and colleges. Now he will be in more difficulty. If God comes to meet his own people, the Shankaracharya has saved himself from his previous statement but he has put himself into a more difficult and complex position. Now all the Hindus other than sudras should ask him, ”What about us? Is God going to meet us outside of the temple or in the temple? If he meets the harijans – who have been for thousands of years condemned – outside of the temple, then why should we go to the temple?” Then in fact the very necessity for temples is no longer there. God has to be met outside under the trees, under the stars. Up to now the Shankaracharya was against harijans, and he is still against them. He thinks he is being a great politician by saying that they need not go to the temples. But I want to create more difficulty for him. All the remaining Hindus should ask him, ”What about us – you are putting us lower than the sudras. What about yourself? Why do you go to the temple? And what is the need of all your scriptures?” Just meet God outside in the open air, by the sea, by the side of the river, anywhere. Wherever you remember him, he will be there. If he can come to meet the untouchables ... you are touchables, he can even touch you. Because of this I have had to change my standpoint. I used to think that retarded people never grow. They grow. They become more retarded! The Shankaracharya is a living example. Now he has to tell the whole country what the status is of temples and scriptures and what need there is of worship, yagnas, statues, and what need there is of caste. If sudras are people of God, then others also are people of God; or do you want to say that only harijans are people of God and others are not even cousin-brothers to harijans? This fellow should be put right. He is getting more and more senile, he needs to be hospitalized.

He will have to be forced to realize that he is suffering from psychological illness. He should renounce the post of Shankaracharya and just get entered into a madhouse, where he will find very similar souls, speaking the same language – which nobody understands. One of my friends, Narendra’s father, had a strange illness. Six months of the year he used to be mad and the remaining six months he was absolutely sane. Whenever he was sane he was ill, with always this problem and that problem and a headache and a stomachache, and he looked very sad. But whenever he became mad he was perfectly healthy, no sign of any sickness. Once when he was perfectly mad and healthy he escaped from the house. He was caught by the police in Agra, where the Taj Mahal is, because of a very strange linguistic problem. He entered a sweet shop. There is a sweet which is called khaja. But ‘khaja’ also means, ‘eat it’. He asked the shopkeeper what it was, and the shopkeeper said ”khaja” so he started eating it. The man said, ”Are you mad?” He said, ”You must be mad, you told me ‘khaja’.” A crowd gathered and the police came and he was brought to the magistrate and the magistrate was also at a loss, because the poor fellow was not wrong – why did they make such names for sweets? He was simply following what the shopkeeper said. But by asking other questions he figured out that he was mad. He was sentenced to the madhouse for six months. But they did not know his psychological history, that three months of his madness were over and after three months he would become sane on his own. There was no problem, it was simply a swing from madness to sanity, from sanity to madness. His whole life he had been on the swing. So in the madhouse the first three months were perfect. He enjoyed himself with all the mad people, he loved the place. But in his madness he drank something that was brought to clean the toilets. He drank the whole bottle. He suffered for days from diarrhea and vomiting. But because of this diarrhea and vomiting, within fifteen days he became sane. All heat went out of him; he became completely calm and quiet. And then he became afraid, surrounded by all the mad people – somebody was pulling his hair, somebody was trying to put a finger into his ear, somebody was sitting on his shoulders. It had all been good up to that point, but now he tried hard to convince the superintendent that, ”I am no longer mad.” The superintendent said, ”Don’t bother me, every madman says that. That is no argument! You will have to remain here until you fulfill your sentence of six months.” He said, ”In three months these mad people and you will kill me!

But he had to suffer, law is law. When he came out I asked him, ”Uncle, how have things been?” He was very friendly to everybody, and except for his family everybody enjoyed him. The family was suffering, because he was stealing things and distributing them to the beggars, borrowing money from anywhere and the family had to pay it, purchasing anything that he wanted. He was a great shopper, all kinds of junk, it did not matter what it was. Just if it was cheap, he would purchase it. So the family was in difficulty. I remember Narendra was so small, but these small children used to watch him and shout to their mother, ”He is trying to take something away, he is trying to open the locker.” Everybody was on watch. He said to me, ”Everything was so good for three months. I enjoyed it, I had found my people. But when I became sane, I found that these were not my people.” I hope that the Shankaracharya of Puri, in any madhouse, will find his friends with similar ideas. He will enjoy it. It is not going to be a suffering or a punishment, it will be a promotion. And to leave him out in this insane condition is harmful to society. For the sake of society he should be forced into a psychiatric clinic. I never thought that after ten days he would start lying. Now he says he never made any such statements and thousands of newspapers all over India have been misrepresenting him. If one paper had done it one could believe it, but these thousands of papers cannot be in a conspiracy. And they are all owned by high-caste Hindus – they were ashamed that he was making such statements. The untouchables have been kept out of the temples; there is no need to make statements, no need to make any fuss about it. In fact they themselves don’t go. Other politicians are trying to persuade them to enter into the temples, but they know that they will be beaten, they know that their houses will be burned, they know that their women will be raped. They know perfectly well that the police will stand there in favor of the richer high-class Hindus, and nobody is going to protect them. But politicians use human beings just like things, commodities. The politicians who are trying to get them to enter the temple, their whole object is to have their vote, temple or no temple. They want the harijans to be rejected from the temple so that they can sympathize with them, ”We have made every effort for you, we risked our lives; now at least give us your votes.” And the Shankaracharya was defending the higher class Hindus, who are three times more numerous than the sudras. His interest is also in votes. Just two days ago he said, ”Perhaps I will have to enter into politics.” It is better that he enters. At least this mask of a religious saint will drop and he will be just an ordinary gutter politician. It will be a great day of celebration – at least we will celebrate. He should drop his Shankaracharyahood and run for election. But he should not lie to people or make such stupid statements. Everybody is as divine as everybody else. There cannot be any distinction. Anybody who makes a distinction is the enemy of the people. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 138 Osho"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14. KWATZ! Maneesha has brought a beautiful, very significant dialogue: HOFUKU SAID, ”THERE IS A MAN NOW PASSING BEHIND THE BUDDHA HALL, AND HE KNOWS THIS IS TOM, THIS IS DICK, OR THIS IS HARRY.” Strangely enough, when I entered I found three women, not three men, just walking behind the Buddha Hall. But times have changed. And it does not matter who was walking, the question can still be asked. ”AND THERE IS A MAN PASSING BEFORE THE BUDDHA HALL. SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE SEES NOTHING AND NOBODY. TELL ME, WHERE IS THE PROFIT AND LOSS OF BUDDHISM?” He is asking, in other words, to make it simple: ”These persons I see behind the Buddha Hall, the person I see in front – they seem to be almost frozen statues. They must be in meditation. They don’t see anything, they don’t bother about anything.” This man Hofuku, the master of the temple, is asking, ”WHERE IS THE PROFIT AND LOSS OF BUDDHISM if people become so careless that you pass in front of them and they don’t even look at you – as if nobody has passed? They are so self-centered that the whole world outside has disappeared. Then what is the point of Buddhism? Is this a loss or a profit?” A MONK SAID, ”BECAUSE HE DISTINGUISHES THINGS BADLY, IT MEANS HE CAN’T SEE.” HOFUKU SAID, ”KWATZ!” to the monk who was giving this answer – because he divides things into good and bad, into black and white, into dead and alive. He cannot see what those persons are doing. Hofuku shouted the Zen KWATZ! which is equivalent to the stick hitting your head. Because the master cannot always carry the stick, they found an equivalent. And certainly when a Zen monk or master shouts ”Kwatz!” it hits harder than any stick can. It keeps you utterly silent – ”What happened? Why has he started shouting in a strange way, a sound which means nothing?” But it can wake you. Any sound, meaningless or meaningful, can wake you up. The Zen experience is that certain sounds reach into certain centers of your being. That is the experience of all the mystics of the world. For example, Sufis have found the sound HOO. If you repeat ”Hoo” continuously, you will find that the center of your life, just two inches below your navel, is hit again and again. Soon there will be sparks coming out of your life center. In this country, they have found OM – which is mild, in accordance with the character of the people who have lived in this country. It does not hit very hard, but it pushes. ”Om, Om,” again and again – it pushes you into a different space that is not mind. Zen has found KWATZ – it is like their character, their training, their samuraihood. They are warriors. ”Kwatz!” – it hits exactly the same center as ”Hoo.” When you greet each other with ”Yaa-Hoo,” you are hitting the same center.

KWATZ! HOFUKU SAID, ”IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUDDHA HALL THAT HE CAN SEE ANYTHING.” Now in the language of Zen, anything and nothing are equivalent. To see nothing is to see all because nothing is the very source of all. The question is about the Buddha Hall. The monk is saying that if these people were not in the Buddha Hall, they could see everything. You all see everything outside the Buddha Hall, but in the Buddha Hall, you stop seeing all kinds of stupid things. You become almost blind to the world. Your eyes turn inwards. You start seeing only your own being as if nothing else exists. HOFUKU SAID, ”IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUDDHA HALL THAT HE CAN SEE ANYTHING.” A very illogical dialogue, but if you understand, I have made it absolutely logical. Sitting like a buddha, you stop seeing the whole world because you start seeing your inner being. And running around seeing things, you forget all about yourself. ON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK SAID TO BOKUSHU, ”I BEG YOU TO EXPOUND TO ME THE GREAT MEANING OF BUDDHISM.” BOKUSHU SAID, ”YOU BRING IT TO ME, AND I’LL EXPOUND IT.” These were great masters. You cannot drag them into intellectual thinking; you cannot drag them down from their hilltops, from their watching silence. He says, ”You bring it to me. You want to understand Buddhism? Just bring it here.” Now, nobody can bring Buddhism, it is not a thing. ”Bring it to me and I will expound it. And if you cannot bring it, I am sorry.” The monk said, ”Please, don’t ask such an impossible thing. Just tell me the meaning of Buddhism.” BOKUSHU SAID, ”WHEN WE BREAK THE EASTERN HEDGE, WE MUST MEND THE WESTERN FENCE.” By saying this, he is saying, ”A dialogue between me and you is almost impossible. It is like a man whose eastern hedge is broken and he starts mending the western fence. He is an idiot. You are doing the same. The only way I can expound Buddhism is if you bring it to me.” How can one bring Buddhism? If one comes in silence and stillness and sits by the side of the master without even asking, just waiting in deep trust and love, the very presence of the master will become a great sermon. Zen is not a theorization, it is not some philosophy. It is a very real experience, almost tangible, but you have to understand its way. If you are open, silent, the master will pour all that he has. But in words you can get lost, you will not understand the essence of being a buddha. The only way is to be.

When Gautam Buddha was alive, he used to always sleep in the same posture; and the whole night, he would not move from side to side, he would not change his posture, not even an inch. Just nearby, in the Ajanta caves, in the last cave there is a sculpture of Gautam Buddha sleeping. That pose has become known as the ‘Lion’s pose’ because the lion also sleeps on its side without moving. Ananda was very much troubled because every night he could see – sometimes in the middle of the night he would wake up – that Buddha was absolutely still, just as he had always been. One night, he could not resist the temptation. He said, ”It is not good to disturb you in the night, because the whole day you have been walking and teaching, but I cannot resist. For twenty years I have been watching. You can understand how long I have waited, but now I have to ask it anyway. How do you manage to remain in the same posture that you go to sleep in, the same posture for the whole night? Do you sleep or do you simply go on keeping the posture? – because I have to move continuously.” Gautam Buddha said, ”I have found the right posture. Now there is no need to change it. And I am as awake as anyone, even while my body is asleep. I have found the right posture for the body ... you are still searching for it. It is not simply a question of tossing and turning the body, it is because your mind is tossing and turning. I have gone beyond – there is no mind. The body simply lies down like a corpse. Have you ever seen any corpse changing its posture?” In one story a woman reached to the Pearly Gates. And as Saint Peter opened the door, she asked immediately about her husband, ”Where is Tom?” Saint Peter said, ”Dear lady, there must be millions of Toms. You will have to describe him to me in detail. Just tell me something about which Tom, and I will try my best to find him.” She said, ”I don’t know how to describe him. Only one thing I remember is that when he died, before dying he said, ‘Remember not to be unfaithful to me because if you are, I will toss and turn in my grave.’” Saint Peter said, ”Aha, don’t be worried. He is a well-known figure here. We call him Whirling Tom. I will find him for you. Somewhere he must be whirling.” It is your mind. Once your mind is at rest, once it disappears, your body can remain asleep but your inner eye, your inner sensitivity, your awareness, can remain burning like a small flame – not only watching your body, but also watching the silent mind, and the stillness surrounding you. The enlightened man cannot sleep in the same way that the unenlightened one sleeps. When the unenlightened man sleeps, he is simply unconscious. The enlightened man sleeps but he is not unconscious. JOSHU SAID, ”THE PHYSICAL EYE OF THE ORDINARY MAN.” HE ADDED, ”THOUGH HE MAY BE SAID NOT YET TO HAVE THE SPIRITUAL EYE, THE PHYSICAL EYE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE SAME THING.” The question is that if your mind is silent then even your physical eyes stop moving.

And now, there is much research going on about dreams and dreamless sleep. It has completely overturned the ancient idea. The old idea was that there are a few dreams once in a while, mostly early in the morning when you are going to wake up; otherwise, you sleep soundly. Modern research says that you dream six hours out of eight. If you sleep eight hours, then for six hours you dream. Those two hours of dreamless sleep are also not solid, but broken here and there – ten minutes here, fifteen minutes there. But this proportion had never been mentioned anywhere in the world before. And the second revolutionary discovery which has come out of it is that when you are watching somebody sleeping, you can know the type of sleep just by looking at his eyes. They are closed, but if he is dreaming, then you can see that under the eyelids, the eyes are moving. That movement is absolutely clear. It is just like when you read, you have to move your eyes; when you see a film, you have to move your eyes. Dreaming is a kind of film running on the screen of your mind, and the eyes have to move with it. The traditional wisdom was that if you don’t dream very much, it is a sign of health. The modern researchers have found just the opposite – of course this research is done with ordinary people, not those who are meditating, otherwise the results would be different. They have found that dreaming is a way of throwing away all the dust that people have gathered during the day. If they don’t dream they will go mad, because every day the dust will go on collecting. Soon they will be surrounded by dust, thick layers of thought, incomplete experiences, all kinds of junk, and they will not be able to find the way out and come back home. Every day, just as you take a bath or clean your teeth, your mind automatically tries to throw away all kinds of dust that has gathered during the day. This needs six hours, so the healthy man dreams six hours and sleeps two hours. That brings many implications. The researchers have been experimenting with a few people in one lab, and a few people in another lab .... In one lab they try to disturb the people whenever they start dreaming. Whenever they see that their eyes are moving, they wake them up. In the other lab, they wake them up whenever their eyes are not moving. In one lab they disturb their sleep, and in the other they disturb their dreams. And the strange result is that the people whose sleep is disturbed and whose dreams are allowed, wake up profoundly refreshed without any trouble. And the people whose dreams are disturbed and whose sleep is allowed, wake up utterly tired, tattered. It seems that dreams are more significant than sleep. But this research is only confined to non-meditators. A meditator throws away all the dust himself, he does not wait for the biological sleep to throw it away. He throws it away consciously and with full awareness. Then his sleep becomes a deep silence and also a deep awareness. This awareness has been called the third eye, but the third eye is only a symbol. What we are doing here every day in meditation ... within two minutes you are throwing away almost six hours’ load. It is a question of totality. Don’t hold back, don’t think of what people will think about you. Here, there is nobody even listening to you. Everybody is so much involved in himself and everybody is competing with everybody else! This throwing away gibberish will reduce your dreams, and if you were brought to be examined for your sleep, the results would be different. Your dreams would be far less and your sleep would be longer. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 142 Osho"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14. KWATZ! And a new factor will have arisen in you: a thin line of awareness, which as you go on growing in meditation becomes bigger and bigger. A point comes in that fire of your awareness where all your dreams burn, and only sleep is left. The body sleeps, it is tired – it needs rest. But your consciousness is never tired. It burns bright, day in, day out. THE MONK ASKED, ”WHAT IS THE EYE OF THE ONE WHO SLEEPS?” JOSHU SAID, ”THE BUDDHA EYE; THE EYE OF THE LAW IS THE EYE OF HIM WHO SLEEPS.” In fact, your sleep is as insane as your waking. Just consider for a moment: is your waking sane? Are not insane thoughts moving inside you – anger and greed and hate and possessiveness? And thousands are the names of all the kinds of madnesses that are going on inside you, although you are trying to hide them. You are wearing a mask; just as you are hiding your body with clothes, you are hiding your mind with smiles, with thoughts, talking with people. Your conversations are nothing but distractions, distractions of your insane mind. I traveled in this country for almost twenty years. And it was an experience, because I traveled only in the air-conditioned coupe, so once in a while there was another passenger but otherwise I was alone. The other person would usually try to make some conversation immediately ... and I had a beautiful opportunity. I would tell him my name, my father’s name, my father’s father’s name, how many brothers my father has, how many children my uncles have. And he would be amazed because he had simply asked me my name. I would say, ”You were going to ask all these things. I am settling everything right now, so we can be silent. Twenty-four hours we are going to be together ...” The man would look at me a little strangely, but I would close my eyes. Once in a while, I would open them and see what he was doing. These travelings have been my labs with thousands of people. I have not missed a single moment of watching and seeing what is happening. The man will read the same newspaper again and again and will start getting angry – angry at me, but he cannot say it, because I have told him, ”Don’t say a single word. All inquiry is finished. I have told you everything about me; more than that, I don’t know either.” He will open his suitcase and close his suitcase, open the window and close the window. And I am watching. And in an air-conditioned compartment, he will start perspiring, he will call the conductor, ”Can you change my place to some other compartment? Because I am going to go mad.” The conductor said, ”I don’t see what is bothering you.” He said, ”That is the problem! Nobody is bothering me. This fellow is simply sitting and looking at me as if I am an experimental zoo. And I am behaving insanely, I know. But because of him I have to do something, otherwise ... And he has closed the conversation from the very beginning. No conversation! So I am reading the same newspaper and getting angry. I open the suitcase and I know there is no need to open it; I put my clothes this way and that way but what is the point? I go unnecessarily to the bathroom and then I look stupid ... ‘This is strange, you don’t have anything to do in the bathroom. Why are you going?’” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 143 Osho"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14. KWATZ! Almost all the conductors knew me because in twenty years’ traveling every driver, every conductor, every stationmaster ... The conductor would say, ”When will you stop being mischievous? That poor fellow is going mad and I knew from the very beginning that this was going to happen.” One night I was leaving Bombay. Nearabout fifty friends had come to see me off. In one compartment there was a Mohammedan, and in another compartment – because in Indian trains there is only one long car which is air-conditioned, divided into small cabins – in another cabin, there was a brahmin. You can tell these people by their appearance. The brahmin was declaring it on his forehead, the Mohammedan with his cap. The conductor asked me, ”With whom would you like to travel? One is Mohammedan, one is a brahmin. Other compartments are full.” I said, ”The brahmin will be more hilarious.” He said, ”You never get tired of traveling and I know now that this brahmin is going to be in trouble.” And as I went in, the brahmin, just as the brahmins do, lay down on the floor and touched my feet, thinking that I am a great mahatma because fifty people had come to send me off and they had touched my feet and garlanded me. I said, ”What are you doing? I am a Mohammedan.” And he stood up and he said, ”If you are a Mohammedan, then why did you not say so before? You have spoiled my whole night. Now I have to take a bath in the cold night. Don’t you consider ...?” I said, ”What can I do? I entered, I had not even a chance to say a word and you touched my feet. Obviously, you have to take a bath.” So he went to take a bath in the cold night, but when he came back he said, ”Are you really a Mohammedan?” I said, ”I was just joking.” ”What do you mean, joking? And the water ... it was ice cold.” I said, ”I thought you would understand the joke.” He said, ”This is not right. I was certain that you are not a Mohammedan. But when you said you were, there was no question of not believing it.” He touched my feet again and said, ”Forgive me.” I said, ”You will have to take another bath.” He said, ”What? What happened?” I said, ”Really, I am a Mohammedan. Can’t you see my beard?” He looked at me and he thought about again having a bath. He called the conductor immediately and he said, ”Can you find a place somewhere else?” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 144 Osho"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14. KWATZ! The conductor said, ”What is wrong? Are you in some trouble?” He said, ”Some trouble? I have to twice take cold baths in the middle of the night. And now I cannot sleep because I cannot convince myself that this fellow is Mohammedan. He is not.” The conductor said, ”As far as I know, he is not.” He said, ”You are a very good man; you saved me ... but he was torturing me.” I said, ”I was simply testing whether you are a real brahmin or not.” He said, ”That is the way of the great saints.” He touched my feet again. And the conductor said, ”What are you doing?” – because he knew me – ”he is a Mohammedan. And a brahmin touching the feet of a Mohammedan? You will go direct to hell.” He said, ”Rather than going to hell, I will go direct to the bathroom again.” But this is the world – unconscious people. Joshu’s statement is that the inner eye is THE BUDDHA EYE, THE EYE OF THE LAW ... the law according to which the whole universe runs. AND ONCE A MONK ASKED TENDO, ”WHAT IS THE EYE THAT LACKS NOTHING IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO LIFE?” TENDO ANSWERED, ”IT IS JUST LIKE BLINDNESS.” The man who has known himself becomes almost blind to all distinctions, discriminations, divisions, dualities. He becomes almost blind to all the things that you see and live and behave according to. But his blindness is far more important than your eyes. To be a buddha and blind is far more significant than to have eyes and not to be aware of oneself. For centuries, there has been a discussion about whether the eyes should be open or closed on a statue of Buddha. The discussion became so hot that finally they decided, ”Let his eyes be half open and half closed.” Everybody was satisfied. I was in a Buddhist temple, having a meditation camp there, exactly where Gautam Buddha became enlightened in Bodhgaya. I said to the priest, ”This is not possible. Buddha must have been blinking his eyes. He cannot keep them always half open and half closed. It is possible to keep them closed, but it is not possible to keep them half open or half closed.” The priest said, ”Nobody has ever asked about it. And for centuries we have decided, because of conflicting groups ...” Another sect, born side by side with Buddhism, is Jainism. There is the same problem, whether Mahavira’s eyes should be closed or open. On this stupid question, Jainas have become divided into two sects: one that keeps Mahavira’s eyes open, one that keeps Mahavira’s eyes closed. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 145 Osho"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14. KWATZ! At a Jaina conference I said to them, ”Now electricity is available. You can make the eyes blink. That will be truer to life.” And they said, ”You are joking about Mahavira too!” I said, ”I am simply suggesting an idea to keep closer to reality. Mahavira was not blind, nor could he have managed to keep his eyes open completely, twenty-four hours. Up to now it was okay that you managed to divide into two sects, but now there is no need. Just connect the statue with electricity and Mahavira will go on blinking, twenty-four hours a day; and that will be joyous also, to look at Mahavira blinking. And sometimes to make it hilarious, you can make one eye blink.” Religion should be a joy. It is stupid, making Mahavira blind. And the other party is doing the other stupidity, keeping his eyes open continuously. The problem is with our unconsciousness; we decide things and we also decide things about the people who are enlightened, but we don’t have any right to. We are going to make mistakes in making any judgment about the enlightened ones, because we cannot see that far, that deep, that high; we are creeping on the earth, we cannot see the eagle far away in the sky. The people who have lived inwards have entered into a different world, to which you are blind. And naturally they have become blind to you, because they don’t see your world as being any longer significant. They have found a more authentic life, a more beautiful existence. This inner clarity, this seeing into oneself, is called the third eye, or the Buddha Eye. When you look inwards in your meditations, remember just one thing: your interiority. Forget everything else as if it was all dream, and you have entered into a different area of existence where dreams cannot follow you. A Zen poem: THE WIND DROPS BUT THE FLOWERS STILL FALL; A BIRD SINGS AND THE MOUNTAIN HOLDS YET MORE MYSTERY. It is not that a man of inwardness becomes blind to the beauty of a bird on the wing, or the mystery of the mountains, or the flowers falling; he simply becomes blind to all that is nonsensical in our minds. He becomes blind to our jealousies; he does not know what it is, he has forgotten that language. He does not know what greed is, he has forgotten that language. He has forgotten your ordinary mind completely. He has entered into no-mind, into universal mind. There, another law – more fundamental than any law that we have created in our courts – prevails.

You may have lived with her and you may never have looked into her eyes. People live together but remain strangers, keeping a little distance always, fearful of being dominated by the other. The flowers and the stars ... they come every day, every night, but how many people see the sunset and the immense beauty and color that the sunset spreads on the horizon? The roses may be blossoming in your own garden, but you don’t have time. You are reading a third- rate yellow newspaper, you are reading about politicians and all the nonsense that they go on doing to humanity. But you will not look, you don’t have time. You will not look at the night when all the stars arrive, your vision is very small. The man of the inner eye not only becomes aware of the inner mysteries, he also becomes aware of the mysteries that are just around him everywhere. A buddha, one who is awakened, is awakened to truth, to beauty, to goodness. His riches are great. Nan-O-Myo has written: NOT FALLING, NOT IGNORING – A PAIR OF MANDARIN DUCKS ALIGHTING, BOBBING, ANYWHERE. Zen is in its very essence a great poetic, aesthetic sensibility. It gives you more aliveness, it gives you and your senses their maximum. A man of Zen lives at the optimum – one cannot live more than he lives. Each breath is total in itself and each moment is so full of blessings, of ecstasies, of a great love, not directed to anybody but simply spread like the fragrance of flowers. Whoever is ready to receive it can have it. But whoever wants to grab onto it will lose it. Question 1 Maneesha’s question is: BELOVED OSHO, IS THE MEDITATOR’S VIEW, THE BIRD’S-EYE VIEW?

The bird can see; his vision is far bigger than yours because he is at a higher altitude. But the man of awareness is not only at a higher altitude, he is also at a deeper interiority. A bird cannot become a buddha. It is man’s right, only man’s right, to become a buddha. Man is evolution’s highest peak, but don’t stop at it.

A Russian, a Cuban, a Catholic priest and Swami Deva Coconut are on a train traveling across Europe. The Russian takes out a large bottle of vodka. He pours each of his companions a drink, and then throws the half-full bottle out of the window. ”Why did you do that?” asks Swami Coconut. ”There is so much vodka in my country,” replies the Russian. ”We have more than we can ever use.” A little later, the Cuban passes around a box of Cuban cigars. Everyone takes one, then he throws the rest of the box out of the window. ”My god!” says Coconut. ”Why did you do that?” ”Cigars,” replies the Cuban, ”are a dime a dozen in my country. We have more of them than we know what to do with!” Coconut sits in silence for a moment. Then he gets up, grabs the Catholic priest and throws him out of the window.

Half an hour later, they meet again outside. ”What did you get?” Melvin asks Billy. ”I got this super basketball, so we can all play basketball like those guys on TV,” says Billy. ”What did you get?” ”Wow, man,” says Melvin, ”just like I saw on the TV, I got this skateboard so we can skate all over the place.” Then they turn to Dings-bums. ”What did you get?” Dings-bums pulls out a box from his bag and says, ”A box of tampons.” Melvin and Billy look puzzled.

RYUGE WAS ASKED BY A MONK, ”WHAT WAS IT THE ANCIENTS FINALLY GOT, SO THAT ALL THEIR LABORS WERE OVER?” RYUGE ANSWERED, ”IT WAS LIKE A ROBBER BREAKING INTO AN UNINHABITED HOUSE.” Maneesha, before I enter into the world of Zen, something has to be said about the Shankaracharya of Puri. His declaration that the untouchables are God’s people makes it absolutely necessary that God’s people should be allowed in every temple which claims to be God’s temple. Secondly, by declaring the untouchables to be God’s people, he himself has become untouchable. He is also part of God’s people. He has made the whole Hindu society harijan. Either all will be allowed into the temples or nobody should be allowed into the temples. Poor harijans are being used by politicians for their own ends. But fortunately Swami Agnivesh, who was trying to take a procession into Nath Dwara temple, could not gather more than one hundred and fifty people. And as they came closer to Nath Dwara they all disappeared! Even the son of Doctor Ambedkar, who was the great leader of the harijans, did not appear in the procession. He had promised to come. This is a great defeat of Agnivesh, and if he has any intelligence he will see that it means that harijans are so afraid ... thousands of years of conditioning cannot be removed by politicians. The only way for the harijans is to ask for a separate vote. Other than that, there is no solution. And no harijan should try to enter into any Hindu temple. They can have their own small temples, even in small bamboo huts. But it is insulting to go somewhere where you are unwelcome; there is a limit to everything. But it seems that with thousands of years of condemnation, even the harijans have taken it to heart that they are untouchable, that by touching them, anyone will become dirty. This kind of conditioning cannot be broken by politicians. Harijans need a psychological insight; first they have to be free from being untouchables. Just by entering a temple they will not be in any way free from their untouchability. First they have to gain their dignity, their respect. They should refuse to enter any temple, because what kind of temple is this, which refuses people? A temple should be open for all. God is not a monopoly of anybody. On the one hand, Agnivesh could not collect people, but Nath Dwara temple collected five thousand people to fight if Agnivesh had reached the temple. Fortunately he could not reach; otherwise those harijans would have been massacred. It has been done in this country for centuries: living harijans have been burned, their villages completely burned. Nobody is allowed to escape, and their women have been raped. They have become accustomed to this kind of humiliation. Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 152 Osho"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15. THE HOUSE WHERE NOBODY LIVES So it is not a question of politicians, it is a question of people of intelligence raising harijans to their dignity and reminding them that, ”You are human beings and you need not beg for it from anyone. It is your basic right to be individuals. And it is perfectly right to deny the Hindu fold completely, because it has repressed you for ten thousand years and it is ready, even today, to do the same.” It is good that the harijans did not follow Agnivesh, who is just a tiny politician. He is not interested in harijans; otherwise he would see that the whole point is to clean the unconscious of the harijans. That cannot be done by entering the temple. That needs a tremendous movement for meditation so that harijans can throw out all the conditioning that has been imposed on them. Only through meditation can they regain their dignity, their humanity. This way it is so insulting .... Now Agnivesh is responsible, because the whole country will laugh: ”Look what happened – the harijans escaped from the procession, they never reached Nath Dwara.” Agnivesh is responsible for this ugly situation. Again the Hindu mind of casteism has been victorious. It will remain victorious, unless harijans themselves deny Hindu temples, deny Hindu rituals, and ask for a separate vote for themselves, saying they will not vote for Hindus. Then, and only then, there is a possibility for this slavery – perhaps the longest slavery in the world – to end. This temple is open for all. Harijans should come here to meditate and to understand the whole process of why they have accepted this degradation. And even to say that you want to enter the temples is to accept that those temples are holy places. Those holy places have been cause of all oppression, suppression, suffering, burning living human beings. Those temples are no longer holy. And anybody who wants the harijans to enter, they should make it clear to him: ”Don’t play politics. We don’t belong to the Hindu fold and we need not belong to any other fold. We will exist as harijans, people of God. We will make our own gods, as you have made your own; we will make our own prayers, as you have made your own. We will not accept your scriptures or your traditions. We will begin a new brotherhood.” Only this, a meditative revolution, can free them into liberation. But the human mind is a very complex thing. I have been for women’s liberation, and my secretary Hasya was in Europe, meeting different groups. She went to see women’s liberation groups also, but because a book is written by a man, they will not accept it. The same stupidity – I am for their liberation, but because I am a man, they will not accept my book or my ideas for how women can attain liberation. And they themselves are doing stupid things in the name of liberation. What is their liberation? Just smoke like a man, dress like a man, use dirty words like a man. Soon they will ask to urinate like a man. This is their liberation! It is the same question with all kinds of slavery: the slave himself is unable to get free of his conditioning. Otherwise, it can happen in a single moment. Here nobody even inquires who you are, we simply give you the opportunity to drop your conditionings. Whatever those conditionings are, whoever has imposed them, Hindus or Mohammedans or Jews or Christians, it does not matter. The question is to drop them and just be yourself, clean, as if you are just born. This is the only revolution that can make all kinds of slaveries disappear from the world. And we need a world of freedom, of all kinds of freedom – of speech, of movement, of dignity. The whole past is so dark that it is time to disconnect ourselves from the past absolutely and to create a new future.

THE HOUSE WHERE NOBODY LIVES And particularly in these moments, during the last part of the twentieth century, it is becoming more and more imminent: either you create the new man and a new humanity or you are going to destroy this beautiful planet. Either a tremendous revolution, that throws away all the past that we are loaded with, or we will be killed with the weight. And not only we will be killed – the trees, the birds, the animals, the flowers, everything will disappear. This cuckoo will not sing. There will not be a silent assembly like this. In the past it was just a philosophical, ideological question. Now it is a very practical, pragmatic, factual question: Do you want to survive? Then drop all kinds of slaveries and all kinds of unconscious superiorities, inferiorities. Just let each human being be himself, accepted, respected. If existence respects you, who are the brahmins to condemn you? If existence accepts you, then you can have a feeling of tremendous responsibility: you are needed by existence, and this is enough to feel fulfilled and contented. But this fulfillment comes only through a deepening of meditation. I am interested in Zen only because Zen is pure meditation. The very word ‘Zen’ means meditation. It has nothing else, it requires no rituals. Just as you are, the only requirement is to go in and discover your eternal self. That eternal self is neither brahmin nor harijan; that eternal self is neither man nor woman. That eternal self is a blissfulness, a peace that passeth understanding. That eternal self is pure ecstasy. You can sing and you can dance and your singing and your dancing, if they are coming from your innermost core, become your only prayers. They are the only authentic prayers; all others are composed by man, and a prayer composed by man is of no value. A prayer that arises within you, like a flame ... and that is what happens in deep meditation. Suddenly you start experiencing a new warmth and a new flame, a new joy that you have never experienced before. It has been dormant, it has been repressed continuously, for millions of years. It has gone so deep that you will have to go that deep to find it. That’s why I go on insisting: go on, deeper and deeper, and go on throwing the garbage that the past has left in you. These small anecdotes are all concerned with meditation in different ways. WHEN THE HEAD MONK, RYOSUI, WENT FIRST TO SEE MAYOKU, MAYOKU TOOK UP HIS HOE AND BEGAN TO WEED. Zen is such a symbolic and poetic phenomenon, each gesture signifies a tremendous philosophy. Now, you would have missed, as Ryosui missed. Without even a single word being expressed on either side, MAYOKU TOOK UP HIS HOE AND BEGAN TO WEED.

But what he is saying is, ”There is no point in coming to me unless you have taken out all the weeds from your being. Unless you come with a clean soil, I cannot sow the seeds.” He has not said a single word, although he has made it absolutely clear. THE NEXT DAY THE SAME THING HAPPENED, BUT THIS TIME RYOSUI KNOCKED AT THE DOOR. The first day Ryosui could not figure out what was happening, why he was being treated this way. Not even taken notice of, not even a hello ... but he must have pondered, meditated over the fact that there must be something, some reason why a great master should behave with a new seeker in this way. ”Certainly I must be wrong. He cannot be wrong ...” And he must have, in his silent moments, seen the point that unless you take all the weeds out, there is no point in coming to a master. The next day he went again: THE SAME THING HAPPENED, BUT THIS TIME RYOSUI KNOCKED AT THE DOOR. Now he had some confidence. He had understood the message: the master was not rejecting him but provoking him – ”Unless you knock on the door, the door will not open by itself.” MAYOKU SAID, ”WHO IS IT?” Just the word WHO ... RYOSUI HAD HARDLY UTTERED HIS NAME WHEN HE WAS ENLIGHTENED AND SAID, ”DO NOT MAKE A FOOL OF ME ...” Don’t ask me who I am. The question makes me simply a fool. You know who I am, because we are not different. This time I have come without the weeds and this time I have gathered courage to knock at the doors. IF I HAD NOT VISITED YOU, I WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED ALL MY LIFE BY THE TWELVE DIVISION CANON. The Buddhist scriptures are divided into twelve divisions. It is among the greatest literature, no other religion can compete with it. He said to Mayoku, ”IF I HAD NOT VISITED YOU, I WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED ALL MY LIFE BY THE TWELVE DIVISION CANON, I would have gone on reading and reading and reading. But with a single act you have taken me to a state of no-mind.” MAYOKU OPENED THE DOOR AND CONFIRMED RYOSUI’S ENLIGHTENMENT.

THE HOUSE WHERE NOBODY LIVES There is no way of knowing oneself through words, systems of beliefs, scriptures. There is only one way, and that is to enter immediately into your own self as deeply as possible, cutting all weeds, not being prevented by any thought, and suddenly you come to the source of your life. It is fire and it is eternal fire. Once you have experienced it, it is always with you. It will radiate in your presence; even others will feel the radiation. Those who are a little receptive, those who are not utterly blind, will even see the change, the rebirth, the revolution that you have gone through. ONE DAY SEKITO WAS WALKING IN THE HILLS WITH HIS DISCIPLE, SEKISHITSU, AND, SEEING BRANCHES OBSTRUCTING THE PATH, ASKED HIM TO CUT THEM AWAY. ”I DID NOT BRING A KNIFE,” SAID SEKISHITSU. SEKITO TOOK OUT HIS OWN AND HELD IT OUT, BLADE END FIRST. SEKISHITSU SAID, ”PLEASE GIVE ME THE OTHER END.” Naturally, when you give a knife to somebody, you keep the blade in your hand. You don’t give the blade, because that can cut the other person. But this is what Sekito did: blade end forward, he offered his knife. The disciple said, ”Give it to me from the other end.” A small incident, but sometimes these small incidents trigger great phenomenal changes. ”WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT?” It cannot cut the weeds, you need the sharp blade to cut the weeds. Hearing this, SEKISHITSU CAME TO REALIZATION. We all are beginning with the wrong end. People who want to know about themselves ask others. People who want to know about themselves read scriptures. You are beginning from the wrong end. If you want to reach yourself, just enter yourself as a sharp knife, cutting all mind rubbish, reaching to the very consciousness which cannot be cut. And there is no need to be worried. The consciousness cannot be cut, cannot be burnt. There is no way to destroy it. It has no form, it never dies. It only goes on moving from form to form, to higher and higher peaks. The highest peak we have attained up to now is the buddha nature. If you go deep within yourself, you will find a buddha. It does not matter whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian, a harijan, a man or a woman; the buddha is your very nature. The question is just of going deep enough. RYUGE WAS ASKED BY A MONK, ”WHAT WAS IT THE ANCIENTS FINALLY GOT, SO THAT ALL THEIR LABORS WERE OVER?” RYUGE ANSWERED, ”IT WAS LIKE A ROBBER BREAKING INTO AN UNINHABITED HOUSE.” Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 156 Osho"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15. THE HOUSE WHERE NOBODY LIVES A very beautiful statement ... Ryuge is a master, and a disciple monk is asking him: what was it that Gautam Buddha or the other ancient masters got through all their labors, disciplines, methods? What was it? The answer is tremendously beautiful. It can come only from a man who knows. Ryuge said, ”IT WAS LIKE A ROBBER BREAKING INTO AN UNINHABITED HOUSE.” A robber makes great efforts – breaking the wall, being afraid somebody may hear the noise and he may be caught red-handed. But when he enters into the house, he finds there is no one. All your meditations are the robber’s effort. When you succeed, you will find a pure, uninhabited space inside. Its virginity, its purity, is its power. On his enlightenment, Bunan wrote: THE MOON IS THE SAME OLD MOON, THE FLOWERS, EXACTLY AS THEY WERE, YET I HAVE BECOME THE THINGNESS OF ALL THE THINGS I SEE! THE MOON IS THE SAME OLD MOON – nothing has changed in the moon. THE FLOWERS, EXACTLY AS THEY WERE – they are still the same. YET I HAVE BECOME THE THINGNESS OF ALL THE THINGS I SEE! When a man of enlightenment looks at a roseflower there is no division between the knower and the known; he becomes the very heart of the roseflower. When he looks at the sunrise he becomes the sunrise, when he looks at a white cloud, he becomes the white cloud. It is not by any effort. He has just become a mirror, so clean that everything that comes before it is reflected in it. He becomes it. And to be identified with everything that surrounds you is the greatest experience man has ever come across. Then the cuckoo singing is not something outside you, it feels as if the song is arising within you. The flower is blossoming within you. The idea of yourself has become so wide that it covers the whole of existence. The moon is the same, but it is no longer outside. The flowers are the same, but they are blossoming inside. It is the exact meaning of the word ‘transformation’: you become the very things you see. And another poet, particularly for this Zen series ending today: THE CUCKOO: ITS VOICE ALONE FELL, Zen: The Solitary Bird, Cuckoo of the Forest 157 Osho"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15. THE HOUSE WHERE NOBODY LIVES LEAVING NOTHING BEHIND. When every day in meditation you throw away all your garbage, what is left behind is pure silence. A poem by Tokugako: ORIGINAL FACE IS THE REALITY OF REALITIES: STRETCH YOUR HAND TO THE WINGING BIRD. VERTICAL NOSE, HORIZONTAL EYES – AND THEN? WHAT IF YOUR MIND IS EMPTY? Just hold a bird in your hand and don’t think about it ... or a flower in your hand, and don’t think about it. Just see it. Without any thoughts moving between you and the flower, what happens? Suddenly you are the flower. And if you feel one with the flower you have felt one with existence. A man of enlightenment, feeling one with existence, needs no morality, needs no ethics, needs no teachings about what is right and what is wrong. He is so in tune with existence that everything that happens through him is bound to be just right. There is no possibility of anything going wrong. Meditation is an art of bringing you closer to the heartbeat of existence. The deeper you go within you ... you will find the very heartbeat of existence. Then there is no morality for you; all that you do is beautiful. Then you love without conditions, without demands, without possessiveness. Then you give out of joy, not to oblige; then you share because you are so full that if you don’t share, the burden of your joy will be too much. You become a raincloud which has to shower somewhere, because the rain is becoming heavier and heavier. If the buddhas have spoken, it is nothing other than rainclouds showering spontaneously. Then each gesture is automatically right; then each word comes out of your deepest being, brings some dance and some joy and some fragrance with it. Question 1 Maneesha has asked: BELOVED OSHO, WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE CUCKOO THAT WILL BRING US CLOSER TO YOU? Maneesha, there is nothing to be learned from the cuckoo. Just listen .... And as you listen to the cuckoo, the sound disappears, the song disappears. Even its echo, far away, disappears. Only a silent space is left behind. Then you have come closer to me, because I am not there. I am the house where nobody lives. If you also become a nobody you will know the taste of my being, because the taste is the same, whether it is your being or my being.

THE HOUSE WHERE NOBODY LIVES Gautam Buddha is reported to have said that the taste of sea water is the same whether in the east or in the west, in the south or in the north. Whenever you come to utter emptiness, you have come close not only to me, you have come close to all the buddhas of the past and all the buddhas of the future, because it is the same reality which is throbbing in all of us. Before we enter into our meditation, just a little cutting of weeds. And laughter is just like a very sharp sword – it cuts. Paddy and Sean stumble out of the pub late one night, very drunk. They are heading for home when Paddy stops, points up to a street light and says, ”Sean, look at that beautiful full moon!” ”Don’t be an idiot, Paddy,” says Sean. ”That is the sun!” They argue back and forth for a while, but cannot come to any definite conclusion, so they decide to get a third opinion. The next person to come along happens to be Kowalski, also very drunk. ”Excuse me, sir,” says Paddy, pointing to the street light. ”But would you mind telling us whether that is the moon or the sun?” ”How the hell should I know?” replies Kowalski. ”I don’t live around here!” It is three o’clock in the morning and Paddy and Seamus are absolutely drunk, trying to find their way home. But the street is dark and completely lined with trees. They keep hitting one tree after another, staggering on, trying to pass their whiskey bottle back and forth. It seems impossible to walk as they knock into this tree, bump into each other, and knock into that tree. This goes on for twenty minutes when Paddy, totally exhausted and bruised, stops and turns to Seamus. ”I think maybe we should stop drinking so much,” groans Paddy, ”and wait for this goddam parade to finish!” Now, Nivedano, give the first beat and everybody goes into absolute craziness. Say the things that you have never said, use any language that you don’t know – even sounds will do, but beat everybody else around you. Nivedano ... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) (Drumbeat) Be silent. Close your eyes, no movement ... just get deeper into your being. Deeper and deeper. This moment you are the buddha.

The great bliss that has been known only by very few, but which was the right of everyone. If you miss, only you will be responsible. To make it go deeper ... Nivedano ... (Drumbeat) Relax ... let go, almost die. The body goes on breathing, you go in. This is the uninhabited house, the place where roses grow. This space makes you one with existence. Your heartbeat becomes in tune with the universal heartbeat. Other than this, there is no religion. Nivedano ...
