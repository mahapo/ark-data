The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH SUNDAY TIMES, LONDON, UK Q: CAN I BEGIN BY ASKING YOU ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER COMMUNE? A: It's always difficult for me to say an ything about the future. I have lived my whole life moment to moment without an y planning, without ever thinking of the morrow. So something must be beginning but I cannot say what it is. Q: BUT I'VE READ REPORTS BHAG WANJI THAT YOU'RE LOOKING OR DISCIPLES OR YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING (INAUDIBLE)."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" A: Yes. My friends are looking because they are not living moment to moment. Nobody listens me. Q: SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT MA NY PEOPLE LISTEN TO YOU. A: No. They hear me but listening is very difficult. Q: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE DIFFERENCE IS? A: Everybody who has normal ears can hear but listening needs something more than ears. It needs a silent mind behind it. Listening means you are not interfering in any way, not interpreting, not saying yes, not saying no, neither believing it nor disbelieving it. Simply listening the way mirror reflects. Only out of su ch listening, understanding arises. Understanding is not a belief. The person who only hears may start believing in it but believing is not unde rstanding. It is blind. Q: DOESN'T UNDERSTANDI NG LEAD TO BELIEF(*)? A: No. Understanding is yours. You may have listened to me, you may have listened to the sound of the running water, you may have listened to thousands of things, but understanding is yours, belief you simply heard and borrowed it without bothering even to listen what you are believing in. The world is full of believers but the world is not full of understanding. Q: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A MAN WHO HAS BELIEFS? A: I don't have any belief and I am against all beliefs. Belief as such is poison. Q: DID YOU HAVE ANY BELIEF IN AMERICA WHEN YOU WENT THERE? A: No. I have never had any belief in my whole life. I have lived as an agnostic. Q: THEN WHAT DREW YOU TO AMERICA? A: America is new, only three hundred ye ars old. The whole world is very old. A country like India is very ancient. It's conditionings have gone very deep, they have become its blood, bones, its very marrow. I wanted to see how a new mind, unburd ened from the past responds to me. Unfortunately even three hundred years are old enough. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Q: HOW DO YOU MEAN... OLD ENOUGH TO FORM THE SOCIETY WHICH HAS ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS TO YOU? A: Yes. It has already prejudices. And it was a great revelation that because its beliefs are new, it is more fanatic about them. Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK AMERICA BELIEVES IN? A: First, it believes in a rotten Christia nity. At least in the old world there are other religions to create doubt. For example, in India there are so many religions that nobody can safely believe. From everywhere there is criticism. America can believe in Christianity withou t any criticism and whenever there is no criticism of your belief you started thinking as if this is the truth. Criticism is absolutely necessary to keep people alert, not falling into the sleep of blindness, unconscious faith. Even the very intelligent people in Ameri ca came across and I was surprised, I could not believe that a well educated man, a professor in the university, tells me that Bible is the word of God. I asked him, \"Do you know that Hindus believe Vedas are the words of God, Mohammedans believe that the Koran is the word of God, and all the religions have thei r own holy book. On what criterion you choose which one is right? Because they are all contradicting each other. And on what grounds you can say that Bible is the word of God?\" And his answer was so stupid. He said, \"Because it is written in the Bible. \" I said, \"It is like a man who told to his fr iends that my wife is the most beautiful woman in the world.\" The friend said, \"But how you came to know about it?\" He said, \"My wife said it to me herself.\" Q: SUCH CERTAINTY? WAS THAT A COMMON EXPERIENCE FOR YOU IN AMERICA? A: Very common. I have not seen very intelligent people. Q: DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ROTTEN CHRISTIANITY AND LESS ROTTEN CHRISTIANITY, OR DO YO U THINK ALL CHRISTIANITY IS ROTTEN? A: All Christianity is rotten because it is based on very idiotic belief systems. For example, it believes that God created the world four hundred, four thousand four years before Jesus Christ was born. Now that is sheer nonsense. That means th e world is only six thousand years old and we have proofs in the pyramids that th ey are far older than the world of the Christians."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We have proof in the Rig Veda that it is far older than the world of the Christians. We have proof in the cities like Harrapur and Mohanjodro in Pakistan that they are at least seven thousand ye ars old. And now we know that there are skeletons found which are thousands of year old and Christianity still goes on believing that the world was created four hundred, four thousand four years before Jesus Christ -- they have not changed it. Q: I THINK VERY FEW CHRISTIANS NOW HOLD THAT BELIEF. I MEAN POSSIBLY FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIA NS IN OREGON DID BUT I THINK THAT CHRISTIANS (INAUDIBLE) A: No, very few Christians know what Christianity is. That also shows a very unintelligent state. You call yourself Ch ristian and you don't know what is means. Q: BUT IS THIS, IS THIS THE REASON THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES? DO YOU BELIEVE IT WAS SOME KIND OF CHRISTIAN PLOT TO MAKE YOU LEAVE? A: That was one of the reasons. There was a Christian pressure because people who were coming to me cannot remain Christians, cannot remain Jews, cannot remain Hindus. I am not telling them to drop anything, I am simply making them aware that anything that you have not discovered on your own cannot be a truth that liberates, it can only be a lie that binds you and makes you a mental slave. My whole approach is of deprogra mming people and I don't have any programme of my own. So I simply de programme -- whether you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan, it doesn't matter. You may be a communist or a fascist. I simply deprogramme you and leave you clean and innocent as you were born. Q: BUT CAN YOU DEPROGRAMME AN AGNOSTIC OR AN ATHEIST? A: The atheist can be deprogrammed ce rtainly but the agnostic cannot be deprogrammed because he has no programme. Q: SO IF AN AGNOSTIC CAME TO YOU, AS BHAGWAN, WOULD THAT BE A WASTE OF HIS TIME? A: No. He has come to me from where the real search begins. The unnecessary work of cleansing him is no more needed. We can start searching for truth. Q: BUT ISN'T THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH A PROGRAMME?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" A: No, it is not a programme.... Q: AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN SO METHING CALLED TRUTH, THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF A PROGRAMME? A: It is not a programme. If you believe in certain things as true then it is a programme. But if you simply seek and search and explore into your own consciousness, you become more aware an d more alert to whatever is the case. You discover the truth by becoming more aware. The truth was not part of the programme. Q: BUT YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING CALLED TRUTH? A: I do not believe, I know. Belie f is for those who do not know. Q: SO YOU KNOW TRUTH? A: Certainly. Q: TO GO BACK TO AMERICA AGAIN, APART FROM THE CHRISTIAN PRESSURE ON YOU, WHAT OTHER PRES SURES DO YOU THINK WERE ON YOU? A: The political pressure was there because I had created a commune which was really a far more superior form of comm unism that exists anywhere else in the world because there was no dictatorship, no government at all, yet five thousand people were living, working, meditating. These five thousand people transformed a de sert into an oasis, made it capable of feeding all the people, made the houses fo r all the people -- beautiful houses with all modern facilities. The whole city was centrally airconditioned, perhaps the only city in the whole world. Five thousand people were eating into on e restaurant, one kitchen for all. There was no use of money in the society and th at was my basic idea: to drop poverty, richness, without any dictatorsh ip, without any enforcement. Everything that you needed was provided by the commune. Money could not be used. You can donate to the commune but you cannot purchase anything by money. Money was just useless. People started to come to see because this land has been lying dead for almost fifty years. Nobody was ready to purchase it. And it was not a small piece, it was one hundred twenty-six square miles. It was almost a small country. And they were all thinking th at we are going to fail, we cannot make that land to produce anything. And we produced everyth ing. Food, vegetables, fruits, milk"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"products... and our people lived with such comfort and luxury that it became necessarily a target for jealousy of the neighbors. They have been working in their ranches which were better lands, for generations and they could not manage to have such luxury. And the government became aware that we don't have any power, we don't have much mo ney, and yet we have been able to manage a society for four years without any crime, without a single beggar. No rape, no murder, no suicide, nobody going mad. The politicians certainly became aware th at soon this will become a comparison: `What you are doing?' And we had invited the president, the go vernor, the attorney-general -- all the people concerned, to come and be our guest and see what we have done. And we are ready to teach the other ranchers in Oregon whatever we have done. But not a single politician dared to come. On the contrary they started hundreds of legal cases against us, unbased becaus e we won almost in all the cases but it was sheer wastage of energy. Four hu ndred sannyasins were continuously engaged in legal battles with the government and soon they became aware that legally they cannot defeat us. Then they started being illegal, and arresting me was absolutely illegal. They had no warrant, they could not show me any reason why they are arresting me and they arrested me with twelve guns surrounding me, a man who has nothing but a robe on his body, and in the court for three days they could not prove anything against me. The U.S. attorn ey accepted on the last day that \"We failed to prove anything, but still we will not give bail to Bhagwan here, we would like him to appear in Oregon's court... the bail will be decided there.\" Now this was very strange because six of my companions were given bail. To me they will not give bail and they have not proved any crime. Q: HAS ALL THIS MADE YOU FEEL VERY BITTER (INAUDIBLE)? A: No. Just it gave me a good experience which I may have missed. I loved those twelve days in jail. They prolonged it, it was only eight hour journey to reach to Oregon and that's what the court ha s promised, that they will not give bail to me, they will send me immediately to Oregon and then they started moving me from one jail to anothe r jail trying indirectly to harass me in every possible way. They knew that I have allergies so I was put with inmates who were continuously smoking and that gives me tears in the eyes, coughing, and finally asthma attacks. They will put me just between two television sets and those television sets will start six in the morning and will go on full speed, loudly till the middle of the night so that I cannot even sleep for a single moment. And after the television sets will stop they must have managed that the cell mates will start talking cell to cell loudly, and this will continue the whole night. Twelve nights I had no sleep. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Q: WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WERE IN JAIL WITH YOU? A: They were very beautiful people. Bette r than the bureaucracy, better than the politicians. And I was really surprised th at the criminals are far better than the people who think they are maintaining justice. They were more human, more loving. Th ey took care of me in every way. Whatever they could bring: soap, toothp aste, or a toothbrush... and they will say that it is absolutely new, we have not touched it, we have not used it. And I will ask the authority's for the same things, I will ask and after twenty-four hours, toothpaste will appear, then there will be no toothbrush. And I will ask them, that \"What kind of stupidity is this? What I will do with this toothpaste? Where is the brush?\" Then again twenty-four ho urs I have to wait for the brush to appear. I will ask for vegetarian food -- it is not available. I will ask for fruits -- they are not available. And the inmates in the jail will bring fruits for me and they will say, \"They are available for us, but for you they are not available. So we can give you our share because we can eat everything else, you cannot eat anything else.\" And I saw a very human, loving heart in the prisoners. One thing more I was surprised to know. Th ey took me in five jails in twelve days. I could not come across a single white prisoner, all were black. Q: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? A: That simply means that those jails are not really to prevent crime and those black people are rebellious people and they are a threat to the government and they are in jail six month, eight mont h, nine months, without any trial. And they all ask me that \"Tell to the press that they don't give us any trial. They don't show us what crime we have comm itted except that we are black, we are not aware of any other crime.\" So it seems that all those jails are main tained to prevent th e blacks becoming a power. Q: COULD IT NOT BE THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE POORER THAN THE WHITE PEOPLE? POOR PEOPLE ARE MORE CRIMINAL THAN RICHER PEOPLE. A: They are poor but even a poor man cannot be kept in jail for nine months without trial. And to keep a person ni ne months without trial means you are afraid that he has not committed crime, and by the court he will be released. And you are punishing him already without proving the crime. It is true that poor people are more pr one to commit crimes th an the rich because the rich have already committed all the crimes and they have been successful."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"To commit crime is not criminal, it is to be caught that is criminal. And to catch the rich person is difficult. To catch the poor is always easy. Q: TALKING OF CRIMINALS OR PE OPLE WHO ARE ACCUSED CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE BEHAVIOR OF ONE OF YOUR FORMER DISCIPLES, SHEELA. WHAT'S YOUR EXPLANATION ON THAT? A: It is really human. To commit cr ime is human. The way the society is managed, the way we create ambition through our education, promotes crime. We create the desire in people for power, for riches, which they cannot fulfill by direct means. Then there are only two al ternatives. Either to remain your whole life suffering with inferiority complex, or to go criminal -- find some shortcut to become rich and be powerful. And that's what happened to Sheela. And particularly because she was a woman, it is even more obvious. Because women have been kept out of powe r, out of positions for centuries. In the commune my effort was that th is should not be the case. The women should be given equal opportunity. In fact, more opportunity than men to compensate. And for three and half years I was in silence, in isolation, and she had all the power, so it is very human. She was from a poor family, she was ju st a waitress in a hotel when she had come to me. She had never seen so much money -- three hundred million dollars suddenly can make anybody mad. Q: SO IT WAS JUST TOO BIG A TEMPTATION? A: Yes, it was too big a temptation an d she could not tolerate. She could not manage. So I am not angry at her at all. I simply feel compassion. Q: WOULD YOU WELCOME HER BACK IF SHE CAME....? A: Certainly, if she comes she is welcome. Because I can understand human weakness and human weaknesses should not be punished. They should be understood and they should be helped to be cured. And she had immense power because fi ve thousand sannyasins were there under her and one million sannyasins aro und the world were under her because I was in isolation and she was my secret ary and she was the only communication between me and the sannyasins. Seeing so many people under her power she got suddenly an unconscious urge to remain in this power forever. Now the only problem for her was if I start speaking again that will be the end of her whole power trip. So she was afraid, she wanted to kill my personal physician for the simple reason so she can plant her own pers onal physician for"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"me, who can keep me alive but not healthy enough to be active again in the commune -- a simple logical thing. She was persuading me that I should not start speaking because it will endanger my health. I said to her, that \"I have always lived spontaneously... the moment I wanted not to speak I stopped speaking. Now I want to speak. Tomorrow morning I will start speaking. I never think of the consequences.\" And the day I started speaking the whole commune was dancing out of joy in the streets except Sheela, she was very sad an d after that I have not seen her happy, joyous, smiling... in fact she started disappearing from the commune for long trips to other communes in Europe, in Australia, in Japan. And as she was away people started open ing their mouth that what she has been doing in these three and half years. I had no idea that she could even bug my own room. But I can understand the fear that perhaps I am thinking to ma ke somebody else my secretary, or something, so she must be aware. She bugged almost two hundred houses in the commune. She far exceeded Nixon -- that was the comment of the F.B.I. people when they ca me to find out all the bugging and she had used far more sophisticated instruments. She was taping all the telephones that were goin g out of the commune, just out of fear that somebody may be speaking against her. And as she became aware that I am becoming aware of all these things she escaped. (Tape side B) And I invited all law enforcementing authorities, state police, federal/government police, F.B.I., and for one month we gave them places to live, they were our guests, and we helped them to find out everything that she has done. And this is where I am surprised: we helped them to find all the crimes that she has done and the people, a small clique of her... who have all escaped. And in the court they started throwing all those crimes on me. It was really surprising that the politic ians can be more criminal minded than anybody else. Q: BUT THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO SURROUND YOU OR WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOU YOURS ELF, ARE CONCERNED WITH THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH. BUT ISN'T IT VERY SAD AND VERY IRONIC THE REASON THAT YOU'RE SO FAMOUS NOW IN THE WORLD HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH. IT'S GOT TO DO WITH COURT CASES, SECRETARIES WHO TR IED TO POISON, THE NUMBER OF ROLLS ROYCES YOU HAVE -- HASN'T SOMETHING GONE TERRIBLY WRONG.... "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A: No, nothing has gone wrong. It simp ly shows the mind of the world. The world is not interested in truth, the worl d is interested in something sensational. Truth is not sensational. The world is not interested in enlightenment, the world is more interested in Rolls Royces. It simply shows the mind and the psychology of the world, and I don't own a single Rolls Royce. Q: BUT YOUR COMMUNE IN OREGON CERTAINLY (INAUDIBLE) A: My commune owned ninety-three Rolls Royces. And I want to know the world that if five thousand people together can manage ninety-three Rolls Royces, five hundred other cars, one hundred airconditioned buses, five airplanes, and they can live in perfect luxu ry, there is no need for anybody to be poor.... Q: WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD'S INTERESTED IN TITILLATION AND SENSATION, SPECIA LLY THE WORLD'S NEWSPAPERS AND WORLD'S TELEVISION STATIONS, ISN'T IT IN WAY PERVERSE TO HAVE NINETY-THREE ROLLS ROYCES KNOWING THAT THAT WHAT'S THE WORLD WILL BE INTERESTED IN? A: No. In fact I wanted the world to kn ow that we have ninety-three Rolls Royces because that is the only way to make any bridge to the world. And then I can talk about truth and enlightenment too, by the side. Without Rolls Royces there is no communication at all. I know my business perfectly well. Q: SO YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT THE ROLLS ROYCES WERE A KIND OF GIMIC WHICH WOULD INTEREST PEOPLE. A: Yes. Certainly everything I did and I do is concerned with the people's psychology, in what they are interested. And then I can turn them in what I am interested, but first let me have their hand in my hand. You just see they are interested in di amond watches but this is not a diamond watch, these are just stones, ordinary st ones. But it is enough to befool them. It has no value at all, it has been ma de by my own sannyasins and they have done it, such a beautiful job, that it is almost half a million worth watch if it is made in real diamonds.... But it can defe at real diamonds. And my purpose is served. Q: BECAUSE THE WORLD'S INTERESTED IN YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE A WATCH.... "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A: Yes, my purpose is served. Once they get interested into anything with me, they are caught in my net. Q: THIS SEEMS TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF THE TRADITIONAL INDIAN SWAMI.... A: It is, it is. Q: .... RENOUNCE THIS WATCH. A: It is because I am absolutely opposi te the Indian ancient tradition, I am against it and I want it to be complete ly dead. It has destroyed the country. Those people who renounce the world are the people who have kept the country poor because in their renunciation the country could not develop science, technology. It is such a vast country, sm all countries have been invading it and defeating it. For two thousand years it has remained a slave to anybody. Who is responsible for this slavery, this poverty? If you make people's mind against the world you are making their mind against all progress. Q: SO YOU WOULD HAVE NO TIME FOR PEOPLE LIKE GANDHI, OR.... A: No place. Q: HOW ABOUT SWAMI VIVEKANAND? A: No. Q: RABINDRANATH TAGORE? A: Rabindranath Tagore is a different pe rson. I love him. And he was never in agreement with Mahatma Gandhi. Q: SO WHAT WOULD YOU BLAME, HINDUISM, FEUDALISM? A: All the religions, all the religions in India, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Mohammedism, Christianity... they all have done simply destructive acts against this land and its people and they are still doing it. Q: BECAUSE THEY TEACH PASSIVI TY AND RENUNCIATION, THAT YOU ARE PLACID AND RENOUNCE THE MATERIAL WORLD? "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A: First they are all against materialism, that creates an schizophrenic mind because you are not just spirit. You are as much matter as you are spirit. To me matter and spirit are not two things. Matter is visible, spirit is, spirit is invisible matter. We have to drop that dichotomy between matter and spirit. All dualities are dangerous because then either you become a spiritualist against materialism or you become a materialist against spiritualism -- in both the ways you remain half. So the East remains poor as far as mate rialism is concerned and the West remains poor as far as spiritualism is concerned. But both are poor. While both could have been rich. Just the division has to be dropped. So the first thing: renunciation of the world is simply nonsense. I teach the art of living. Not of renouncing, but of rejoicing. Q: WOULD YOU SAY THAT ANY OF THIS YOU OWE TO HINDUISM? A: No. Q: WOULD YOU SAY THAT ANY OF YOUR PROVINCE(*) YOU OWE TO HINDUISM? A: No. Q: WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS ASSEMBLY THAT NOW SURROUNDS YOU WITH BARE FEET, SITTING CROSSLEGGED, OWES SOMETHING TO HINDUISM? A: No, nothing, nothing. Q: HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THEY ALL SAT ON CHAIRS? A: They can. Nobody is preventing. Q: BUT NONETHELESS, YOU ARE THE GURU AND THEY ARE DISCIPLES. A: No. I am not the guru and they are no t the disciples. I am just a friend and they are my fellow travellers. And it is not expected from my side that they should be grateful to me. But if being with me they feel love, they feel gratitude, that's a totally different story. It is not expected, it is simply a happening. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Q: HAS ALL THIS SURPRISED YOU, THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BECOME VERY FAMOUS, INTERNATIONAL FAME, AS A BOY FROM MADHYA PRADESH? A: It just appears to me a misfortune. It was far more beautiful not to be known at all. It had more freedom, more silence. Q: I THINK IN MANALI SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO YOU SPOKE. WAS THAT ONE OF YOUR FIRST MEETINGS? A: Not my first meetings but the first ti me I started the movement of sannyas. And it seems we have come round the whole circle. Q: IS THAT WHAT DREW YOU BACK TO THIS PLACE? A: Ya, I love this place. Q: DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS AN INDIAN? A: No. I never think in terms of any division: of nation, of religion, of caste, of color... no. I belong to this earth and the whole earth belongs to me. Q: AND YOUR FAMILY, YOUR MOTHER AND (INAUDIBLE). THEY ARE YOUR SANNYASINS (INAUDIBLE). HA S THAT BEEN CONFUSING; THE FACT THAT YOUR MOTHER IS A DISC IPLE OF YOURS AS WELL AS YOUR OWN MOTHER? A: No, not at all. Because to be a moth er is nothing special. Every woman is doing it and all the animals are doing it. But to be a mother and yet to have courage enough to listen to one's own so n is something special and rare and in that way my family is rare. My father wa s a disciple, my mother, my all brothers, my uncles -- my whole family. It needs guts. They have taken a great step. Q: YOUR MOTHER IS A LADY OF WHAT, SEVENTY-FIVE OR EIGHTY? A: Must be seventy-five. Q: AND YOUR FATHER WAS A CLOTH MERCHANT? A: He was a cloth merchant. Q: DID HE WISH THAT YOU WENT INTO THE FAMILY BUSINESS?"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" A: In my childhood certainly and the ...( inaudible). From my very childhood I was a problem to him and to my family be cause whatever I wanted to do I will only do that; whatever the cost and what ever the consequence. It took few years for them to understand me but finally they realized that it is better to let me go on my way and not to interfere but just to help me whatever I want to become, let me become. And before my father died he had tears in his eyes and he said, \"Please forgive me if I have been rude to you in your childhood and sometimes tried to force you to do things that you never wanted to do. Just forgive me, because I was not aware what you can become and it was out of simple ignorance that I was trying to force things on you and I am sorry for that\"... just before he died. Q: YOU SAID IN AN INTERVIEW LA ST WEEK OR THE WEEK BEFORE THAT WHEN YOU DIE YOU WANTED TO BE FORGOTTEN AS AN (INAUDIBLE). DID YOU REALLY SAY THAT? A: That's true. Q: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? A: That simply means my whole approach to life is that the past should not be a burden on the present. The past is like dust covering a mirror. It distorts the vision and it becomes heavier and heavier and does not allow you to live in freedom in the present and the same is true about the future. If you think too much of the future wh ile you are thinking of the future the present is slipping by from your hands which is the only reality. If this is my approach about others, that the past should be forgotten, I don't want to be a burden for anybody in the future, because then I will be a past. I would like to be forgotten completely as if I had never been here. Just the way a bird flies in the sky and leaves no footprints in the sky, I would like to disappear like those footprints. So that I am no more a burden on anybody. This is simply part of my philosophy and the very logical conclusion of it. Q: BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GATHERED WITH YOU HERE OBVIOUSLY TEND NOT TO BELIEVE THAT.... A: That is up to them. That is their freedom. Q: DO YOU TRY TO DISSUADE TH EM FROM THE IDEA THAT YOU WILL SOMEHOW LIVE ON IN SOME KIND OF PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"A: No. I will try to do what I am doing, that: be here with me while I am here with your totality, don't think of the future and when I am gone, I am gone. And if you have lived with me you woul d know how to say goodbye. One has to learn to say goodbye too. Even if with tears you have to say, but you have to say goodbye. If Gautam Buddha has taught that there would have been no Buddhism. If Jesus has taught that there would have been no Christianity. These people are responsible for all that has happened in the history -- bloodshed, wars, unnecessary tortures... people were burnt alive. The best thing will be that we learn from these people, we live from these people and then when they are gone, they are gone. We are again free, we are again alive and the future is there which is always growing. There will be always people who can be your friends. Why I should prevent you from having fresh friends, why should you carry my corpse on your shoulders? Q: BUT THEN BHAGWAN WHY BOTHER TO WRITE BOOKS? A: I have not written a single book. Q: THEN MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN YOUR NAME. A: They are just my talks, my discourses. I have not written anything. Q: DO YOU BELIEVE IN ANY KI ND OF LIFE AFTER DEATH? A: I don't believe, I know. Q: DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING? A: With me belief word is non-existent. Either I know or I don't know. When I know, I know. There is life before birth, there is life after death. In existence nothing dies. In existence everything continues, moves, in new forms but there is no end to anything. Q: BUT DO YOU THINK THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF YOURSELF CAN EXIST AFTER YOU HAVE DIED, SOMEWHERE. DO YOU BELIEVE IN TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS OR (INAUDIBLE)? A: Yes, it can exist because your mind has a certain capacity. If it has a motivation, a certain intensity of desi re at the time of death then your consciousness will move in that direction an d you will be born into a form that is your desire."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"But if you die without any desire, withou t any motivation, then you are not born anywhere; you are simply dropping like a dewdrop into the ocean, becoming one with the whole. And that is the goal. Q: THAT IS YOUR GOAL? A: Yes. Q: IS IT DISAPPEARING? TO DISAPPEAR, TO DIE. A: Yes. And this time I am going to disappear. Q: BUT NOT FOR SOME TIME YET. A: No, not for some time now. Q: WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT END UP? I MEAN, IN THIS WORLD. DO YOU THINK YOU'LL END UP IN (INAUDIBLE) OR SOME PART OF INDIA? DO YOU THINK YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF HERE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS? A: Difficult to say because I have my people around the world. They have beautiful communes everywhere and they are all inviting me, so anything is possible. But there are idiotic politicians everywhere, you cannot think to what limit they can be stupid. The German parliament has passed a law. This seems giving me too much importance... that I cannot enter Germany. I enjoyed it. I had never th ought that Germans are so cowards. I am going to inquire whether I can fly over Germany. Q: BUT INDIA IS NOT A PROBLEM? A: Right now it is not but it can be any moment. It all depends on me. Q: IF YOU KEEP QUIET IT WILL BE OKAY? A: Yes, if I keep quiet. (laughter) Come again whenever you feel. Q: THANK YOU.

It is for reference use only.] INTERVIEW WITH CHANDRIYHA BHAGWAN: Please will you start your questions. Q: GOOD MORNING. YOU HAVE CO ME BACK TO INDIA AFTER FOUR YEARS. BHAGWAN DO YOU FIND ANY CHANGE? A: There are many changes and changes for good. The first thing that is the most importan t is that the politicians are out of the government and non-politicians have come into power. The politician is always interested in hi mself and how to get higher and higher, how to reach to the highest point in th e bureaucracy. He sacrifices all the interests of the people. Unfortunately for forty years we have b een under political minds. Hence forty years have been just a wastage. We have not used freedom to create, to become rich, to become more cultured, civilized, educated. But it is good that now a new generation has come into power. This generation as yet is not polluted and there is a possibility that it will do some good for the country, it will not think only of its own power and its own position. And they are taking small steps in the direction, they are opening the country to technology which was impossi ble for forty years. Because for forty years the politicians who were in rule were dominated by Mahatma Gandhi and his philosophy of very primitive ideas. To Mahatma Gandhi all science and all progress stopped with the spinning wheel. After the spinning wheel everything is evil. Even telephone, telegraph, railway -- Gandhi is not ready to accept them. These forty years the people who ruled the country were trained by Ma hatma Gandhi, influenced by him, impressed by him. They did not help the country to bring more technology, that's the only way now with the populati on growing so fast. We have to grow technology faster than the popula tion, then only we can survive. We have to open the country to the wealt h of the whole world. There is so much wealth lying around in the world, unused. We have labor but no wealth. There are people who have wealth but no labo r. Our labor and their wealth together can create this country into a paradise. All that is needed is a guarantee to the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"whole world that, \"Your wealth will not be nationalized, that your wealth will be in safe hands. And whenever you want it back it will be yours.\" With the collaboration of all the industries from all over the world we can create so much because we have labor and cheapest labor possible. In America I saw everything is almost ten times costlier than here, and the reason is simply because the labor is costly , even the richest man cannot afford a servant. And here even a middle class man can afford three/four servants without any difficulty. Open the country to the whole world. These forty years we were creating barri ers for other nations to bring their wealth into our country, for one single re ason: to protect the Vila's(*), Tata's, Dalmears(*), because these were the people who were giving support, finances to the politicians in their elections. So it was a conspiracy. These people were giving financial support to the politicians to remain in power and th e politician was preventing all outside capital so that these people can go on creating third rate things. Now in a world where you can have ten times better, beautiful, more highly technical car, cheaper than Ambassador... if in collaboration with Japan, in collaboration with other countries, you st art creating cars which will be cheaper than Ambassador, who is going to buy Ambassador? In forty years Ambassador has remained th e same. There was no reason, only the price has gone higher and higher. So it was a conspiracy between the capitalists of this country and the politician to prot ect each other. Now that can be broken because the new people are not politicians and they have not come by support of any finances from these Tarta's and Vila's (*), and others. They have come into power on their own merit. They are under no obligation. So they can open the doors. It does not matter if Ambassador disapp ears. It should disappear, it simply makes noise and nothing else. They say ev erything in it makes noise except the horn. And this is the situation about everything else. The world is producing so refined mechanisms, we can produce the same mech anisms on a far lower price and sell them to the whole world and it will be tremendous earning. And why be afraid that a little bit of it will go to the people who will put their wealth in it -- it should go, it is natural... you put your la bor, you get for your labor. They get for their wealth. You both are getting richer.... There is a difference but much more differences will be needed. There are few things which go on contin uing the same, perhaps the people who have come into power are unaware of many currents of ideologies which are against the growth of the nation. For example, anybody teaching against birth control. He may be a Christian priest, he may be Hindu Shankaracharya, or he may be a Mohammedan Iman. It"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"does not matter who he is, but anybody who is teaching against birth control and telling to people that using birth contro l methods is against God is committing a crime. He should be prevented with all the means possible. By the end of this century the population of this country will be one billion, one hundred crore. We will be beggars, almost fifty percent will be dying and starving on the streets. It will be a ni ghtmare and we will be utterly helpless to do anything. It is better to be aware now. It is already late. I started talking about birth control th irty years before and I was condemned because all the religions and their head s condemned me, because I am teaching people immorality. But when I started talking, the population of the country was only forty crore. If they had listened to me today we would have been in a far prosperous state. Today our population is eighty crore. In thirty years we have doubled. Now who is responsible? All those religious leaders who condemne d me are religious, are responsible for it. And they are still doing the same. Christians want that the people should remain poor because only poor can be converted to Christianity. I have never co me across a single person in India who is rich, educated and who has accepted Christianity as his religion. Only the beggars, orphans, aboriginals, so poor th at it does not matter what religion is, what matters is bread, clothes, shelter. Christianity wants people to remain poor because that is their politics. Now there are six hundred million Catholics in the world and they hope that if the world continues to be poor soon they will have the whole world in their grips. If is a very subtle way of spreading an empire without armies, just by keeping people poor, it is enough that in one hand BIBLE, and another a bread, that's enough. There is no need for a sword, ther e is no need for any argument, there is no need to convince anybody philosoph ically that we are better than your thinking. Hindus, Mohammedans, other religions -- it is strange that on one point they all agree... that birth control is something ev il. But they don't see the consequences. Birth control today is the only moral thin g. Every religious person should adopt it if he has any sense of humanity and re spect for life then birth control is not evil. But not to use birth control methods is evil because you are bringing so many people in the world who will be dying and starving. But all the religions somehow agree, and there must be some reason... there is, there is some vested interest. Only the poor are easily exploited by th e priests. The educated, the rich are not so easily gullible. They may formally belong to this religion or to that religion but it is just formality. The poor is in absolute need for solace. He is hungry, he needs somebody to give him hope that, \"In the next life -- life af ter death -- you will not be hungry. Not"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"only that, you will not be hungry; the ki ngdom of God will be yours. That don't think that poverty is bad, you are blessed to be poor. It is a blessing in disguise, it is a test of your trust and if you can rema in contented with it, in the next life you will be immensely rewarded.\" The poor needs the hope of the next life. The rich has no need of any hope. He has everything that he needs right now, why he should bother about next life? The poor needs some kind of opium and th e priests of all the religions are giving some kind of opium, that gives him so me hallucination of paradise and some consolation that rich will not enter into the kingdom of God. So some great consolation that rich will fall into the eter nal darkness of hell and the poor will be raised to the golden glory of God. These psychological reasons are there that the priest wants the poor because they are the only ones who hear him, who are gullible, who believe in him. But he is unaware what harm he is doing. There may not be any need of third world war, just the population itself increasing so fast.... India has never been bigger than China as far as population is concerned. But by the end of this century India will be bigger than China. Out of five persons in the world, one will be Indian. China is far more intelligent. It has slowed down its growth, it is not very rich but it is not poor either. It is comforta ble. And the reason why China could do it was that communism destroyed all the priests of all the religions who were causing the whole problem. I don't say that you should destroy your priests, but you should at least stop them talking nonsense. There are better things to talk. About population something has to be done very fast, because it is growing fast and unless we are ahead of it, it is going to destroy us and destroy all our other efforts. Secondly, we are still living with ideas th at were developed five thousand years before -- everything has changed but our ideas have not changed. We are still believing in Manu, still believing in the brahmin, in the sudra; still burning the sudra alive. This seems to be a very ugly situation. We have to pull ourselves to be contemporaries even if though we have to say goodbye to Manu; say goodbye to Manu. It won't do any harm to anybody. Manu has tortured us for five hundred years. It is time that in India there should be no brahmin, no kshatriya, no vaishya, no sudra. Why we can't be just human beings? We are born human beings. There is no need for somebody to be higher and some body to be lower and somebody to be so lower that he is untouchable. We have done crimes against humanity. So we have to drop many old ideas and once we drop it we will find tremendous energy released which is blocked by those old ideas."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"We have to start thinking more on our own than just quoting like parrots VEDAS, UPANISHADAS, just like parrots. A parrot can quote the VEDA but it means nothing. And that's the situation for our scholars, our pundits, our so-called great wise men -- they are nothing but quotation m arks. They have nothing of their own and it is time that a vast country like In dia which is almost a subcontinent should have its own thinkers, contemporary, be cause every problem has changed and your solutions never change -- that is creating the whole difficulty. Your solutions were created for the bullock cart. You are flying in the airplane and you are still using the techniques of bullock cart. You are bound to create difficulties. (Tape side B begins, no overlap) A contemporary India is needed. Almost a rebirth. And it is not against the past, it is not ag ainst your forefathers. Each child has to go ahead than his father. That should be the blessing of the father, that the child should transcend him. Otherwise what is the need of the child? He has done. If the child goes on doing the same he is useless, he is unnecessary. Every teacher should think in terms that his student should defeat him, that will be his victory. And each father should th ink that his son should go ahead of him -- that will be his joy, that will be his pride. So it is not against the past. I have been continuously being misunder stood. It is easy to misunderstand me because what I am saying it is a lonely voice in a crowd of millions, but I am not speaking against the past... I am saying that the past can grow in you if you drop it and if you are fresh and young and you start thinking on your own. Then the country lives, grows, blossoms, otherwis e it becomes retarded. That's how we have become retarded. So much has to be done. It should be taken as a challenge, as a joy, because it is an opportunity to do something and it is only in such times when there are great challenges that you have to face that your real potential starts growing, exploding. The people who fought for freedom had no idea what they are going to do after the freedom is achieved. My whole family was involved in the freedom struggle and I used to ask my father, my uncles, that \"I can understand the struggle for freedom but I do not understand that no body of you has any idea what you are going to do when you are free. You will be at a loss. Right now you are working with such joy, sacrificing with such joy ... once you achieve freedom then you will be in difficulty -- what to do now? Because your whole training is to fight for freedom. You don't know what to do with freedom.\" And that's why we wasted these forty years. Because the people who had fought for freedom became the rulers. They had no idea except going to jail. They had no idea what to do now."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"It is good now we are finished with th at generation and the new generation is there. It should be supported, helped by the whole country. Because these are young people -- if they get the support, the cooperation, they may be able to do miracles. Q: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE SAID TIME AND AGAIN THAT ONE WHO IS SLEEPING, HE WILL WAKE UP. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE COUNTRY IS NOW INCREASINGLY RECEPTIVE TO YOUR MESSAGE -- CAN INDIA BE TRANSFORMED? A: Certainly it can be transformed. And it is time, perfect time because if it is not transformed it cannot live. People change only under tremendous pressure, otherwise people are lazy, by nature . Who wants to change? Because every change means making new adju stments, learning new things. One becomes accustomed of old habits, old things, and one knows about the old way of life -- everything. And he is comfortable, convenient. Change is possible only when there is su ch a pressure on him that rather than choosing a comfortable, an old style of life, he has to choose something unknown, something new... and that pressure is present. It is present in many ways. It is present in the popu lation. The growing population is growing death. It is pres ent in the nuclear weapons in the world, the growing nuclear weapons mean there is not much hope if man does not change. They have already so much nucl ear weapons that they can kill humanity seven hundred times. And in the West, in America, in Africa, a new disease AIDS is spreading which has no cure. It is spreading fast, like wi ldfire. It is out of homosexuality and sexual perversions. You can get it so easi ly -- it is not that you need a sexual contact, just kissing somebody the saliva is a carrier of it. Just wiping a tear of somebody, the tear is a carrier of it. And even children are born with the disease. A child may be weeping and you may simply try to console the child and wipe his tears, not knowing at all that wh at you are doing is killing yourself. Once the virus gets into you your life is at the most two years and there is no cure, and all the scientists are agreed th at there seems to be no possibility in future that we will be able to find any cure . And that disease is spreading so fast. These three things: population, nuclear weapons and AIDS are attacks -- a three- dimensional attack of death on man. You cannot conceive of a greater pressure to change. Just we have to make India conscious of the situation. And I don't think that India is an unintelligent country. It may be burdened with the past but still it has a certain intelligence which can be provoked, which can be sharpened. It cannot lose it, because it had it when Buddha was here, it had it when Nanak was here, it had it when Kabir was here -- where it can go? It is still there;"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"perhaps just under the dust we have lost the sharpness of it. Just the dust has to be removed. And India's intelligence can be challenged that this is time to change all our old ways. And my feeling is that certainly it is more receptive to me now, it was good that I left the country for four years. Sometimes distance creates love. When I was here... one tends to take gran ted. I was surprised that people who had never come to see me in India came to see me in America, and poor people who had never thought that they will go ever out of India. And they came, they sold their houses, their lands, just to come to see me. And I was here and they never came. So it has been good this gap for four years. Now I am back and I can see it is more receptive, more loving and perhap s ready for the revolution I have been always hoping for it. Q: BHAGWAN, WHY HAVE YOU BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD? A: It is absolutely natural. If you su pport people's old mind you are never misunderstood because you are saying exactly what they believe, you are supporting them, they feel very happy wi th you, you gain respectability, you support their ego. I have been doing just the opposite. I have been trying to show you that your old mind is out of date, that you need a n ew mind, that your old ways of thinking and living, social behavior are all rotten and they need to be changed. Naturally, there are only two possibilities: if yo u are very intelligent, open, clear, straightforward you will agree with me. If you are not that inte lligent, not open, not straightforward you will disagree with me. But to disagree also needs intelligence. You have to argue against me if you want to disagree. In that way agreement is easier but disagreement means you have to fight against me, argue against me and you don' t have that intelligence. So the only way is: you cannot fight against what I am saying but you can distort what I am saying and then you can fight with it, with the distortion which I have never said. First create a misunderstanding then fight with it which is easier. You have already put loopholes in it and you are fi ghting with a bogus thing. I have never said it. So the people who don't have enough intelligence and yet want to disagree naturally try to change the statements, make them according to their own ideas so that they can easily fight with them. For example, I have been speaking on sex that how it can be transformed into su perconsciousness; and so much has been written about it. But everybody condemns about my statements on sex. Nobody talks about superconsciousness. And sex was not my purpose at all."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I was saying that the sex is a basic energy. Either it can reproduce children or it can create a new consciousness in you. It is a creative force. If it goes downward s it creates children, if it goes upwards it creates the highest consciousness for whic h we have been for centuries searching. We have called it buddhahood, enlightenment, awakening, illumination, samadhi, sambodhi... whatever the name, bu t it is the sexual energy that moves upwards. It is a creative force. But strange that my basic point was not discussed at all. Those who have criticized me have criticized not me at all. They were criticizing their own imagined idea which has nothing to do with me. But this is how lower class of intellectuals will do. First they will make the argument in such a way that it can be uprooted, dissolved. They do both the things: th ey make the argument and then they destroy it, but it has nothing to do with me. One of Hindu leaders, Karpatri Maharaj has written a book against me and he goes on making statements which I have never made. I wrote him a letter that `I simply want that wherever you make a statement as mine, at least give the source from where you got it; in which of my books, on what page that statement is because I have read your whole book. A ll your statements are just made up by yourself.' Now ordinary people will never be able to find. They will not bother to go, and I have four hundred books, that they will look into those books and find whether this statement is true or not. They will simply think that Karpatri Maharaj has done great work. He has demolished ev ery statement and all those statements are his own. He is demolishing himself. It has nothing to do with me, the whole book. And it propounds to be an argument against me. So it is very natural. I don't feel any grudge or any complaint, I understand that whatever I have been doing is bound to be misunderstood, misquoted. But how long? It takes just patience -- go on fighting, somebody somewhere who is intelligent and who has a heart to understand will understand. And I don't need crowds to understand me, I need only few people of guts because it is always few people of courag e who bring revolutions in the world; it not the masses. And I have not been misunderstood by peop le of intelligence, by people of heart. They have loved me. I have received more love than perhaps anybody else in the world has ever received.

It is for reference use only.] INTERVIEW BY ITALIAN PRESS? Q: WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT SI TUATION WITH REGARDS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF USA? A: It is a government which pretends to be democratic but it is not. On the contrary democracy is only a mask and be hind it is a very fascist government and my attitude is that it should be exposed to the whole world because the whole world has been believing in its democracy. In the first place, the people who are known as Americans are none of them Americans. The real Americans are called red indians and the unreal people who are all foreigners and who have invade d the land of the poor red indians, destroyed their freedom, almost destroye d the whole race of the red indians.... These people who call themselves democratic and think that they are protectors of democracy in the world are really imperialistic and the first step that democracy will be to give back the land to the people to whom it belongs. The foreigners are in power and the native people have lost all power and they have been forced to live in reservat ions which are almost American name for concentration camps. In Germany the concentration camps wer e more primitive. In America the reservations are more sophisticated so from the surface you will not be able to see that they are concentration camps beca use there are no barbed wires around, people are free, but that is just a facade. The reality is they have created psycholo gical imprisonment. They are giving the red indians pensions so all the red indians have become lazy -- nobody works, there is no need to work, and they get so much money that they simply gamble, fight, murder, rape and drink ... they are all drunkards. Now this is destroying them psychologica lly. And they go on reproducing more children because more children mean more money. Each children brings more pensions. Perhaps this is the first instance in th e whole history of man where a people has completely forgotten that they are slaves, that they have lost their country, that they have lost their freedom."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"They are almost in a state of sleep -- drinking, gambling, fighting. And these people have no more consciousness or dignity to fight for freedom. This is destroying somebody's soul completely and that's what American government has done. I myself have been for twelve days in Ame rican jails and then I could see it more closely -- the fascist structure. I wa s arrested without any warrant, without showing me any cause why I am arrested -- that is absolutely undemocratic. I was not allowed to call my attorney. And they forced me into jail and they w ill not supply me even a bed or a pillow, just a steel bench... and they know that my back is bad and that's why that arrangement was made. Because all prisoners were getting beds, mattresses, pillows and everything... I was not given anything except that steel bench. The whole night I was sitting, I could not lie down on it. Even sitting, by the morning, my back was so bad I could not even walk. And I told them that, \"This is inhuman be havior. In the first place you don't have any warrant, you don't have any cause to arrest me, you don't allow me my right to call my attorney and you force me to sit on a steel bench the whole night.\" And this went on for twelve days continuously. They did everything to harm me indirect ly. And finally they forced me, under oath that I will speak only truth and nothing else... th ey forced me to lie. The government knew that they have nothing agai nst me so if there is a trial they are going to lose the case. All that they ca n do, they can prolong the case and force the court not to give me bail on the grounds that I have thousands of followers, enough financial resources, that if I am bailed I may leave the country. I don't care how much money you put for the bail, you may put one million or two million.... That was their argument th at any amount of money does not matter to him, so bail should not be allowed. But still they were afraid that even if bail if not allowed they can torture me but finally they will have to be defeated. So they asked my attorneys for a private meeting before the trial began that some negotiation is possible. If Bhagwan acce pts on two counts `guilty' then we will ask the court to fine him and release him an d the case if finished. If he does not accept that he is guilty, then the tria l will begin but we will not allow the bail in any case. And we will torture him for as many years as possible. So you can choose: we know you know that we don' t have any grounds to win the case. Now this is justice, democracy or pure use of power? My attorneys thought that there seems to be no other way than to accept guilty knowing that there is no guilt. The charges are false. When they came to me their eyes were fu ll of tears. They were the best attorneys in America that I had hired but I asked, \"Why you are crying?\" They said, \"Because there is nothing against you and we cannot protect you and they have made the situation in such a wa y that you will have to accept that you are guilty.\" But I said, \"Under the oath I cannot lie.\""},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"They said, \"You forget the oath because if you don't lie, just think of all your friends around the world... you will be to rtured in the jail and they will be tortured outside.\" Just twelve days there were thousands of people who had not eaten, they were fasting, so just think of those people . And out of compassion, lie. And we are with tears because we feel so helpless that it is absolutely illegal advice that we are giving to you. But there is no other way. Seeing the situation that they can not only torture me for years: that was no t a big problem, I would have accepted to suffer for truth. The problem was that millions of my people would have unnecessarily gone into torture for five years, six years, seven years.... They may have even killed me. They have tried. In those twelve days they have been pu tting me with inmates who had infectious diseases. They put me with one inmate who was living alone for six months, nobody was allotted the same cell because he had very serious case, high risk, confirmed Herpes; and he was al most dying because of Herpes. They allotted me that room. Even the man who was there was shocked. He could not write English well, he was from Cuba, but he tried to inform me that, \"I am suffering from high risk Herpes and Bh agwan they have put you knowingly here so that you can get infection. For six months they have kept me alone, nobody has been allotted the room.\" And when I left the jail I was surprised to see that the whole ground floor was empty. For three days I have been coming in and out every time it was always full, people were working. \"What happened?\" I asked. They said, \"It is change of shift.\" But I said, \"This is not the way of changing shifts. First the people should come in then only the older shift can leave. Giving gap is not the way. I have not seen it happen before. Just today, it seems a little bit strange.\" And there is only one man to give me my clothes back, because I am released, and that man too for the first time in t welve days leaves me alone, otherwise I was in chains... chains in the legs, ch ains around my waist, my hands were chained and they were chained with my waist chain also. So no movement of any kind was possible and still there were two persons with guns with me. That was the first day there was nobody and he, the only person, told me that \"I am going to look for my boss because I need his signature to release your things.\" Later on I came to know that no signat ure was needed of anybody. My signature was needed that I have received my things. And that man closed the doors, went out, came after fifteen minutes, looked a little embarrassed, perspiring. I asked, \"What is the matter? It is an airconditioned place -- why you are pers piring? And why you look so nervous?\" And the reason was that they have pl anted a bomb in the room where I was sitting. Just the problem was that they coul d not figure out the right time when I will be coming out of the court to the jail, and it was a time bomb. And I had"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"come early because the case finished wi thout any trial... I accepted that I am guilty, and there was no question of an y argument so there was no time lost. The judge knew perfectly well that I am not guilty. The judge knew the settlement because exactly on two points which the government has asked me to accept `guilty,' only on those two points he asked me, \"Are you guilty or not?\" There were eighteen points, specifically on those two points he asked. That means he was perfectly aware that these are the two points under the settlement. And I accepted those two points... still four hundred thousand dollars were fined. Under oath of speaking only truth the gove rnment forces me to lie and then they fine me four hundred thousand dollars, and I have not committed anything. Now what to say about a government who functions in such ways. And then too they had managed that if by chance I deny that I am guilty they had made another arrangement of the bomb. These people are criminals. America is being ruled by a criminal government. It should be exposed to the whole world. Its mask should be taken away. It is not a democracy, it is purely a hypocrisy. Q: WHY WAS YOUR SECRETAR Y ARRESTED IN GERMANY? A: I was for three and half years in silence and isolation. I was not meeting people, my secretary was the only commu nication between me and my people. If there was any spiritual need, any spir itual guidance for somebody then she would bring the question to me. Otherw ise she was having all the power... and power corrupts. And particularly because she was a woma n, it corrupted more. Because women have been repressed for centuries and ha ve not been given any power, so it is there in their unconscious hungry... ther e is great lust for power in women. They try in their own small way nagging the husband, crying and throwing things, and tantrums... these are simply feminine power tricks. But my secretary was a woman. When I had chosen her she was an innocent woman as any woman, but you cannot say what is hidden in people's unconscious mind. When she got the power and the power was big -- three hundred million dollars we were using to create the commune, and she came from a poor family, she was only a waitress in a hotel when she came to me. She may have never dreamt of three hundred million dollars. Naturally, lust for money arose in her. She stole fifty-five million dollars and opened a ba nk account in Switzerland in her own name. Then there was this great power becaus e my people love me and she was my representative so whatsoever she said, they accepted it, they thought it was coming from me. She always managed to say that it is coming from Bhagwan. Whatever she wanted them to do was coming from me. And whatever she was"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"afraid to say to them, even if I had to ld her, she remained silent. And it was impossible for me to figure out whether sh e is telling to the people the things I am saying or not. And there was no reason to suspect. She bugged my own room just out of fe ar that perhaps somebody, the cleaner, my personal physician, my dentist -- so mebody may say to me, inform me... she was afraid because she was doing someth ing wrong. Not only she bugged my own room, she bugged almost two hundre d other sannyasin's houses. All the intelligent people in the commune: the chancellor of the university, the vice- chancellor of the university, the professors , the psychologists, the therapists -- all the intelligentsia she bugged everybod y's house because she was afraid these were the people who could be competitors to her. Now bugging is a crime. Just for one ho use bugging you can go for jail for five years and she bugged two hundred houses . One thousand years' jail just for bugging. She was taping all the phones going ou t of the commune or coming in the commune, just out of fear because she has stolen the money, she has made a small gang and then this is how crime le ads to more crime. Now she was afraid of her own husband because he knew that she has stolen fifty-five million dollars. She tried to kill him, to poison him in a cup of coffee. She tried to kill my personal physician -- four times she pois oned him. She wanted her own person to be my personal physician. She was asking me continuously, that \"We have better doctors.\" I said, \"It is not a question of better doctor -- he has been looking after me for ten years and I am perfectly happy. And he ha s taken absolute care about my health and I am perfectly healthy. So there is no need to change.\" Then she started thinking of killing the person so she can put her own person as my physician, in case she wants to kill me. Then that man will be able to poison me. So she has committed many crimes. She has tried to kill one of the judges of the Wasco County because he was voting agains t some of the proposals that she was making, she wanted to finish him. She tr ied to kill the attorney of another county -- Jefferson county, because our commune was a big land -- one hundred twenty- six square miles. Half was in Wasco coun ty, half was in Jefferson county. That Jefferson county attorney was creating trou ble. Rather than fighting legally she started fighting in a criminal way -- finish the person. She burnt the planning office of the Was co county because it has some papers against her, she burnt the whole office completely, with all their records of hundreds of years. When I started speaking then people started coming to me to inform me that, \"Strange things have been happening he re.\" The moment she became aware that I am being informed about things, she escaped with her clique and she was hiding in Black Forest in Germ any where she has been arrested."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Because I asked law enforcement authoritie s, the state police, the federal police, F.B.I.; I invited them to the commune, I gave a press conference -- an open invitation to the government that they sh ould come and look into everything that my people want to inform and testify. And we gave them... they remained for one month our guest and we supplied every testimony for all the crimes that she has committed. And the most insane(*) is that they tried.... I was the person to invite them, I was the person who was th eir host for one month. We took every care of them, we... otherwise there was no way for them to know of anything that has happened unless we were going to test ify. And in the court they started throwing all those crimes on me. I had simply to laugh. My attorney told them that \"This is sheer nonsense because I have been bringing sannyasins on Bhagwan's suggestion to the F.B.I. to report all these crimes and you are throwing all those crimes, dumpin g on the same person who has invited you and made all those crimes available to you.\" Now they have caught Sheela and two, three other persons, but few more persons are missing. I feel sorry for he r because when I had chosen her my secretary she was an innocent person, very capable of doing things but this is the tragedy that we are all carrying an unco nscious of which we are not even aware. That what kind of animality, crimina lity will come up from the unconscious when the opportunity is there. And this is my whole work, I call it meditation. That the unconscious should be change d into consciousness so that nothing remains inside you that you don't know. Th at is the only possibility that you may not fall into darkness and you may not do things which are inhuman, that you will not go in the ways of evil. The only possibility is that your whole mind is simply consciousness -- there is no unconscious part at all. And this is one of the greatest contribu tion of the East to the world. Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung, Alfred Adler an d other psychologists in the West, only in this century have been able to find that there is someth ing like unconscious. In the East for five thousand years we ha ve been aware of the unconscious. Not only that, we have been aware how to tran sform it into consciousness. The West has accepted now that there is a unconsciou s but it has not yet been able to find how to transform it into consciousness. The East has the methods but the ego of the Western psychology prevents it to accept the methods which are already available. Thousands of people have been meditating with me and have come to the same experience of illumination that the dark ness disappears, that one becomes full of light. And after that it is impossible to fall. Q: WHY THE POLITICIAN AFRAID OF YOU? "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A: The politician are afraid of me because I am against all politics. To me it seems keeping humanity retarded because the vested interest of the politicians is that humanity should not be very intelligent. If humanity is really very intelligent who is going to accept a man like Adolf Hitler as a leader of a nation -- who is simply insane. Adolf Hitler needs an insane humanity to support him. Just look at your politicians. They are not the most intelligent people in the society, they are the most cu nning, certainly. But cunningness does not mean intelligence. The politicians are afraid of me becaus e I am teaching intelligence, awareness, consciousness. My whole effort is to ma ke every person so intelligent and clear that no idiots like Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini or Mao Tse-tung or Joseph Stalin can deceive people, can cheat people. It is a basic truth that only people who are suffering from inferiority complex go into politics. It is the inferiority complex that leads them into politics so that they can prove to themselves and to the world that they are not inferior, they have power. A real superior man never goes to politi cs. It is below him. It is always the inferior who go to the politics. And thes e inferior people have all the power of the armies, of atomic energies, of nucle ar weapons. It is a very strange world. The best of the minds create atomic ener gy. For example, Albert Einstein creates atomic energy. He was creating it in Germany. (Tape side B) If he had not left Germany the atom bo mbs would have been in the hands of Adolf Hitler. But there is not much di fference. The atom bombs were in the hands of Roosevelt or Truman. And Tr uman used those atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki uselessly, with out any purpose. Germany has already failed and Japan could have lasted not more than two weeks. There was no need to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki and to use atom bombs. But Truman was in a hurry. He wanted to use them to show the power to the whole world. It is a strange coincidenc e that his name is Truman . His name should be un- Truman. And when next day in the morn ing he was asked by the journalists, \"Could you sleep?\" He said, \"Yes. I slept very well because the project was successful.\" And the project was to destroy two beautiful cities, innocent people, children, women, old people, civilians who has nothin g to do with war. In both the cities nearabout two hundred thousand people were destroyed by president un- Truman and still he had a good sleep. Can you think this man as human? Albert Einstein was immensely hurt and befo re he died he said, that \"If there is another life I would like to be a plumber, I don't want to be a physicist again.\" The best of the minds create, and the wo rst of the minds use -- all the power, all the energy. I am against this situation. I would like best of the minds to rule and the power should be in the hands of more alert, more conscious, more human, beings."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"I am in favor of a new kind of government . I call it meritocracy: that merit should be the criterion. There is no need of politic al parties. If you n eed a health minister you have all medical experts, let them stand for the post, let the country choose the best physician, the best surgeon -- th ere is no need for any politics in it. You need an education minister, let a ll the educationists... you have all the chancellors and vice-chancellors in the universities, you have great professors, you have scientists -- let them stan d and let people choose the best. The world will be far better if we are in th e hands of intelligent people, creative people who cannot destroy, whose intelligence won't allow them to do all stupid things that politicians go on doing. An d the power should always be with the more alert, more aware, more conscious people. Then only we are safe. Otherwise, power is going to destroy the whole humanity. Q: WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO COME BACK TO INDIA? WHY NOT ANOTHER COUNTRY? A: India cannot prevent me because I am bo rn here. There is no other reason for my coming to India. You will be surprised... in Germany the parliament has passed a law that I cannot enter Germany. I have never been to Germany, I have never committed any crime in Germany and they can pass a law that I cannot enter Germany. I am going to ask them, \"Can I fly over Germany or not?\" Because I have six communes in Germany, I can at least fly and drop flowers on my communes, perhaps they will not allow even that. In any other country I would have enco untered the same problems. I was four years in America without any visa. They will not give me visa. I asked them, \"Then you can simply tell me that you are not going to give me visa.\" They will not say even that in writing because they knew I will go to the court and they don't have any reason why they are refusi ng. Because I fulfill all their categories, not only one. They have six categories, only one category I don't fulfill -- that is marriage, which I can do any moment. The remaining five categories I fulfill. And I asked them, \"You tell me, whichever category you want me I can apply for it.\" And I had applied on five grounds, `no' they could not say because in the court they will be in difficulty. And `yes ' the politicians will not allow them to say. So four years I was there without any vis a. I told to the immigration department that you are making me unnecessarily criminal and really you are criminal. You are forcing me to live here without visa. I am ready to go -- you just tell me `no.' I need some kind of reply or not. I knew the same will happen in any country. Coming back to India is for a simple reas on that they cannot at least make a law against me that I cannot enter into the country."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Otherwise to me all the countries are the same and I don't believe in nations, I believe this whole earth is one. And that day will be the most fortunate when nations are dissolved and we have one government and one world. Because unless nations are dissolved we ca nnot get rid of wars. The only way to get rid of wars is dissolve nations, have only one world so there is no reason for war -- unless you find some other planet where there are similar beings like you ready to fight, which is a very rare and almost improbable possibility. I have come here because there was nowhere else to go. I would have loved to go to Germany because I have the greatest number of sannyasins in Germany than in any other country. That's why the gove rnment is so much afraid. That even before I was told that I cannot enter Ame rica for five years, they immediately passed a law that I cannot enter into Germ any. They must have been afraid that from America I will enter into Germany. And in Germany I could have really created great trouble for the politicians. But their very fear shows their inferior ity. Their very fear shows lack of intelligence. Otherwise they should invi te me, they can argue with me, I am ready to argue on each point. That will be more human. Rather than arresting me on the point of twelve guns... a single man who has nothing in his hands, who has nothing on his body except his robe -- you don't need twelve guns to arrest a man. It simply shows your stupidity and your fear. In the first place we had created such a beautiful commune in America. We transformed the whole desert which was lying dead for fifty years. And nobody was ready to purchase it. We purchased it, we changed the desert into an oasis. We made lakes, we make a small river joining the lakes, we made houses for our sannyasins -- five th ousand people were living. And we did everything ourselves. We had not taken an y support from outside. We made the roads, we made the houses and we were livi ng as comfortably, as luxuriously as possible. Because the desert started yiel ding more than we needed: enough food, enough vegetables, enough fruits, enough milk product... and we had all kinds of intelligent people. Coincidentally only intelligent people become interested in me. So we had scientists, we had doctors, we had our own medical hospital, we had a university, we had many professors, we had many psychologists, we had many psychotherapies. We had engineers, we had all kinds of talented people and geniuses. All five thousand people were graduates -- most of them had masters degrees and a large amount had doctorates. And these people put their whole energy and intelligence in creating a beautiful commune. They started with meditation in the mornin g then they listened to me, then they went to work. Then in the evening they danced and sa ng and it was the most rejoicing and happy place on the earth. And that became their jealousy. That"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"became their fear, that people are coming to see the commune from all over America. Televisions, news media, radios, newspa pers are all coming from all over America to see how we have managed it. And it was a superior kind of communism because we have stopped any money circulation in the commune. No mone y was used inside the commune. Whatever you needed you got from the commune's central office. Whatever you needed was given to you so there was no need for money. If you wanted money to donate to the commune, you could donate but you could not purchase anything by money. So there was no difference between the rich and the poor. Without any dictatorship we dissolved the class diffe rences of poor and the rich. Just by stopping the circulation of money in the commune.... You may have millions of dollars but they were useless. We had not a single beggar, nobody unemployed and for four years in the commune no rape, no murder, no suicide, no theft. This commune had a judge sitting useless for four years. The commune has a police force, they never used their force for anything because it wa s never needed. Nobody fought with anybody, their was no riots. And we had people from all nations, from all religions, from all races, and there was no problem. There were blacks, there were Jews, there were Hindus, there wer e Christians, there were Mohammedans. The politicians became very much worried that we, without any power have managed a superior kind of society. Five thousand people eating into one kitchen, into one place. It is stupid that there should be two thousand five hundred kitchens, twenty-five hundred women should be wasting their life in the kitchens. Just fifteen persons were taking care of the kitchen. And all wo men are not good cook s. We had chosen the best cooks so the whole commune wa s happy as far as food was concerned and we managed not only delicious food, we managed that it should be hygienic, that it should be healthy, that it sh ould be very balanced to everybody. In America there are thirty million people dying on the streets, starving. And there are thirty million people, the exac t number, who are dying in hospitals because of overeating. This seems to be stupid. A person is dying because he is overeati ng and another person is dying because he has nothing to eat. They both can live and both can live more healthily, just a little distribution and a littl e understanding is needed. The whole system of the commune worried the politicians. Children were taken care by the commune so they were not a burden on the pare nts. Parents were more freer and in four years' time not a single baby was born because I told to my people that this is not the time for giving birth to people, the world is over- populated. It is a crime to go on addi ng more people to this already over- populated world."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"And if you love your children what kind of world you are going to give them? A world which will be starving soon by the end of this century. Many countries will turn into Ethiopia. India will be turn ing into Ethiopia. There is going to be perhaps a nuclear war. A very strange dise ase AIDS is spreading like wildfire. In this world, if you love your child, this is not the time to give birth. And they understood. And not a single child was born. The way the commune functioned created a comparison that if these people can maintain, why America having all the po wer of the world and all the money of the world cannot manage? That was my crim e. And in any country if I am there I am going to create a commune and that is going to result in the same, there will not be much difference. Q: WHAT WILL BE THE FUTURE OF THE COMMUNES THEN? A: I never think of the future. I think only of the present. They are happy and they are rejoicing an d out of this happiness and rejoicing the future will be born. Future does not come from nowhere. It comes from the present. This moment gives birth to another moment so I think on ly of the present and I take care of the present, that is taking care of the future without taking care of the future. The tomorrow will be better if we have lived today intensely, totally... the tomorrow is going to be born out of today. So I don't think about future, it will take care itself. Q: AND YOU WILL BE CONTINUED LIVING HERE? YOU CONTINUE LIVING HERE, THIS PLACE? A: Nothing can be said. Right now I am here, tomorrow I don't know. Q: DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD? A: There is no God, so how can I believe? Q: WHAT'S YOUR PERSONAL OPINI ON ABOUT RELIGIONS AND SEX? A: There is no need of religions. All that is needed is a quality of religiousness and all organized religions destroy this same quality. They make you Christians, they make you Hindus, they make you Mohammedans, they don't make you religious. My effort is you should not be a Christian, you should not be a Hindu, you should not be a Jew, you should be simply religious. And to me religion means living life in its totality, accepting existence in all its beauty, with gratitude. It is so beautiful and it has been given to us just as a gift --"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"we should be grateful, grateful to the tr ees, to the birds, to the stars, to the flowers, to the oceans. To me there is no God, existence is enough unto itself. And a deep feeling of gratitude towards existence is what I mean by religiousness. And if you live totally then certainly sex is part of it. Sex is part of your life. And something most important. Yo u are born out of it, your every cell vibrates with it, it is your only energy. And if you love and love intensely, sex is the first thing that gives you a feeling of religiousness. To me the orgasmic experience is the first experience of religion. You don't get it in the churches, you don't get it in the temples. You get it when you are in total love, immersed with your lover, forgotten everything, thoughts stop, for a moment time stops and that is the moment when you first experience something beyond mind. So to me sex is something sacred. It shou ld be respected. And all the religions have been condemning it. They have created all kinds of perversions because of their condemnation. They have created celibates and nobody can be a celibate, it is impossible. Just it is against nature. So the celibate becomes a homosexual. It leads to perversions and finally it has come to AIDS which is an outcome of homosexuality. I call AIDS a religious disease and I want it emphasized that all the religions are responsible for bringing such a ugly disease which has no cure. Celibacy should be made a crime. Anythin g against nature should be a crime. And to me sex is something which should be more prayerful, more loving, more aesthetic. To my own sannyasins I say that you shou ld make in your house a small temple where you make love. It should be the mo st beautiful place in your house, and when you make love there should be music, there should be incense burning, there should be flowers all around. Lo ve should be made not under glaring electric lights but with small candles. Make it more of a dream, out of the real world, the mundane world. And treat the other person with deep respect. Don't use the other person because that is not re spect, that is prostitution, that is not love. And before you make love dance, sing, let your energy vibrate your whole body. Love should be the climax of your da nce otherwise you will never achieve those orgasmic moments I am talking about. Millions of people live and die, give birth to children, but have never experienced any orgasmic phenomenon. The reason is because it can happen only at a climax so you have to bring your energy at a climax. Don't make love while you are tired, don't make love just as a sleeping pill so that you can sleep. Don't ma ke love out of duty, that she's your"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"wife and you have to make love. Make lo ve only when you are full of energy and when you would like to dance, when yo u would like to explode. And make the situation as sacred and as aesthetic as possible. To me sex is sacred and the first step towards religiousness. I have immense respect for it. Q: WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR TH E HUMAN BEING IN THE WORLD, SCIENCE OR RELIGION? A: Both. And both more than the other be cause science is the search for truth in the objective world and religion is also search for the truth in the subjective world. In fact, they are two wings of one bird, of one inquiry -- two sides. Ultimately there is no need to have two names. My own suggestion is `science' is perfectly beautiful name because it means knowing. So science has two sides, just like ever y coin has two sides. Knowing into the dimension of matter you can call it objective science, and knowing into the dimension of your interiority, of your inner being, of your consciousness, you can call it subjective science. There is no need for the word religion. Science is perfectly good. And it is the same search. Just the directions are two. And it will be good that we make one supreme science which is a synthesis, a synchronicity of the outer science and the inner science. And there will be no need then of so many religions and there will be no need then even for somebody to be an atheist. Because thei sts are gone, then th ere is no need for atheists -- they are only reactions. There are believers in God so there are disbelievers in God. When the believers are gone what is the need of disbelievers. There is no need to believe in anything -- that is the fundamental of science; that is the scientific approach to reality: do not believe, inquire. The moment you believe, inquiry stops. Keep your mind open -- neither believe nor disbelieve. Just remain alert and search and doubt everything. Unless you come to a point which is indubitable, that 's what truth is. You cannot doubt it. It is not a question of believing in it, it is a totally different phenomenon and you cannot doubt it. It is so much a certainty, so overwhelming you that there is no way to doubt it. And this is knowing and this knowing transforms a man into a Buddha, into an enlightened man. This is the goal of all human growth. Q: WILL YOU CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE FOR ADVICE? A: Yes. I am available always to anybod y who is searching and seeking, who is courageous enough not to believe but to inquire. Okay. Q: THANK YOU VERY MUCH."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Last Testament, Vol 5 Chapter #5 Chapter title: None 12 December 1985 pm in Kulu/Manali, India [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only.] INTERVIEW BY THE RA JNEESH TIMES, GERMANY Q: IN THE GACHCHHAMIS WE ARE STILL SAYING, `SANGHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI.' DOES THE SANGHA STILL EXIST? WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU USE THE WORD COMMUNE? A: Yes, it still exists; and exists on a more subtle level. Wherever there are sannyasins meditating, loving (inaudib le) with me, celebrating moment to moment whatever life brings, they are creating the energy which makes the commune. Now the commune is all over the world. It is not destroyed by the American politicians in(*) Rajneeshpuram. They are be fooling themselves if they think it is destroyed. It is simply diffused, more in the atmosphere, the biosphere that surrounds the earth. Now th ere is only one commune. There is no change as far as your goin g to the feet of the Awakened One, His commune and His truth is concerned. It remains the same. Of course it becomes more invisible. And the visible can be destroyed very easily. The invisible cannot be destroyed. We have moved from mortal communes to something immortal and eternal. THE STRUCTURE IN THE COMMUNE HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE SHEELA LEFT. IT SEEMS MUCH MO RE MATURE NOW. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THAT SPIRIT OF THE MYSTERY SCHOOL IS MISSING, WHICH WAS ALIVE IN EACH COMMUNE OF YOUR SANNYASINS. DO WE HAVE TO GO ON OUR OWN NOW? I don't want any structure, because all stru ctures create a certain kind of slavery. And that's what was being done by Sheela and her gang. She was creating structures; structures can function be tter. Slavery always functions better. An independent and free mind is always a problem, because he thinks. He may not agree with you. But freedom is more valuable than any functional, practical gains. Everything can be sacrificed to freedom. Freedom cannot be sacrificied to anything."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"So now there will be no more any structures. Each commune should try to live intelligently, rather than following a certain structure unintelligently. Now sannyasins will have to learn to live intelligently, and yet in agreement, in harmony. Intelligence does not mean necess arily conflict. It is only a lower kind of intelligence that always brings co nflict. Higher the intelligence, more harmonies. It seeks more the points of m eeting, creating a cosmos out of a chaos. And remember one thing, th at a structure gives you a solidity, a stability. You feel as if you have a backbone. But it ki lls your soul. It makes you robot like. You work more, you produce more. In ec onomic terms it is perfectly good. And that's what Sheela was trying to do. When there is no fixed structure, when you move day to day with your intelligence, creating momentary tempo rary structures which can be changed any moment, they don't have any ultimacy about them, it will look like a chaos, because so much change will be going on. But remember, it is always out of chaos that stars are born. We don't want to make our communes assembly lines, mechanical, where machines are produc ed. We want to produce a new man. That's where I differed from Sheela. As I started speaking, I found that she has done absolutely the opposite of what I have been teaching for thirty years. I am for individuality, I am for freedom, I am for the beauty of a chaos. I am not very favorable to the deadness of an ordered world, obedience of an army. I hate it; because these are the problems that humanity has suffered all along. I would love my sannyasins to be intelligently disobedient. And if they are obedient, they have to be intelligently obedient. Not just because the order is there it has to be followed. Unless the orde r fits with you, unless the order rings some bells in your heart, unless it be comes something of your own, it is meaningless. It is better to rebel than to follow. Sheela destroyed small centers while I was in silence and isolation, and she created big communes. Her mind was that of a materialist. I want my small centers back, because in a small center you can have more freedom, more independence. In a big co mmune, necessarily, you have to bring some kind of a structure, some kind of obedience, some kind of order, otherwise it becomes too difficult to manage. And ba sically, I value the individual. So bring back the small centers -- and they were functioning perfectly well, and nobody was ordering them. They were working out of love. While I was in Poona, thousands of centers around the world were working without any order, without any structure. Each had its own uniqueness its own individuality, and it was up on themselves what to make of it, how to make it. She dissolved all those small, beautiful centers and created big communes simply so that more money can be generated. My interest is not money. My intere st is how more consciousness can be generated. But her whole effort and her whole clique was concentratedly working at one goal: how to create more money. And this was necessary, that small centers should be dissolved, people should move into bigger communes,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"and there should be strict discipline, strict orders, and everybody should be dependent on the commune for everyth ing. Naturally, more money can be produced. But what we are going to do wi th the money? Money is not a value. It is useful, but it is not something that has to be worshipped, that you have to make a goal of it. So my situation now is that if you feel bigger communes are difficult to maintain -- they will be difficult -- without st ructures, without somebody dictating everything from higher up and you have simply to follow... now there will be nobody else to do it. I have never ordered anybody to do anyt hing and I have never dictated anybody -- that is against human dignity. So I would like that if your bigger communes are becoming difficult to run disperse th em, let your small communes sprout up again in different places. And we have nothing to do by generating money. We have to generate more consciousness and more living and loving people. For that bigger communes are not needed. You unnece ssarily create trouble by collecting too many people in one place. Someho w or other everybody's freedom will be cut. Everybody is unique and wants to live in his unique way. Now they all cannot be fixed in the same pattern. So it is a moment of transition in which you may find it a little difficult because Sheela was ru nning things absolutely against me. Whatever she did was absolutely against me. She tried to create an organized religion -- I have always been against organized religion, she even created a small holy book of Rajneeshism -- I had to burn it because I don't want any holy books. There are good books and there are bad b ooks but there are no holy books. But she has no understanding of any higher qu alities of consciousness. She belonged to a very pragmatic, practical, lower stag e of mind. So she was good at work, she was just like a rough uncut ugly stone th at you use in the fo undation when you make a building. It has its us e but it remains underground. I had chosen her because in Rajneeshpu ram we were just putting the foundation of a commune and I was completely aware that sooner or later I will have to change her because once the basic founda tion is complete she is useless, and dangerous. Because she can only become a foundation, she can go on making big walls of those ugly stones and it will become a prison not a temple. I was going to change her in anyway, but in my whole life this has been my experience that existence has been very compassionate to me. She escaped before I had to change her. She must be thinking that she has been very clever because she has accumulated money in Switzerland -- that's why in Germany she has created these six communes, destroyed all small communes. And Germany has a tendency -- you have to be aware of th at -- Adolf Hitler does not happen from nowhere. It comes from your consciousne ss, it is something in your unconscious that creates that monster."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Why she concentrated on Germany? She could see that Germany can be structured, people can be enslaved, disciplined... they love me. In the name of my love they will be ready to do anything. And all the money she was siphoning into Switzerland and it is just a guess -- American government thinks twenty million dollars she has in one bank account. Her own secretary who left her two years before because she had cancer and had to go for treatment in California rememb ers that at the time she left she had forty-three million dollars in two bank accounts. And she left two years before. So there is every possibility that she ma y be having someth ing nearabout sixty, seventy or eighty million dollars in her own name. But this is what I was saying. That money is not a value. Now she will rot in a jail her whole life and the money will rot in a bank. And you all worked for that money and for Sheela unnecessarily. It wa s a sheer wastage. So now make it a point that no more of anything that Sheel a may have left in your minds should remain in the communes, in the sa nnyasins -- it has to be cleaned. So if big communes can be run without destroying people's freedom, individuality -- good. If you feel it is difficult, make smaller communes, smaller centers and let people live according to their own ideas. That's my whole message to the sannyasins. Now whatever Sheela has done has to be undone. And it has been in a way a blessing in disguise. It has been a good learning. It should not happen again. BHAGWAN, I KNOW THE MONEY SOURCE OF THE COMMUNES -- OF COLOGNE AND MANY OF THE OTHE R COMMUNES -- TWO OF THE BIG COMMUNES, AND I KNOW THAT THEY WERE HARDLY, OR WE WERE HARDLY ABLE TO GATHER THE MONE Y FOR GOING TO THE FESTIVALS. SO JUST FROM THIS FACTUAL SI DE, I KNOW THAT THIS MONEY SHEELA HAS IS NOT COMING FROM THE BI G COMMUNES. JUST THE FACTUAL INFORMATION, I DON'T KNOW WHICH INFORMATION YOU GET. BUT KNOWING THE COLOGNE BUSINESS AND THE MONEY FLOW IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HER OR FOR ANYBODY TO TAKE OUR MONEY BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY WORKING HARD TO GET THE MONEY TOGETHER TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL . IT'S LIKE A COMMUNE OF THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE, WE COULD TAKE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DEUTSCHE MARKS TO BRING EVERYB ODY OVER TO THE FESTIVAL. I can understand it may not be coming from the communes, then it must be coming from rich sannyasins directly of which you were not aware and you cannot be aware that, and she will not make anybody aware. Money must have been coming because even in my case the government raised again and again the question that twenty million are there in Swiss accounts, in Sheela's name. And Sheela's old secretary says there were forty-three when she left. And it is possible because in the commune in Rajneeshpuram we have"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"invested almost more than two hundred million dollars. So it is possible that from individual sources... and more in formations are coming that Sheela was also dealing in heavy drugs. These wer e just known to few people who were partners in it. That she was also dealing in gold and this de aling was continuing from Poona days and now everything that people who have been participants in those dealings are going to be witnesses in the court. So the money may have come from drugs, from gold, from individual people -- it is difficult for us to figure out. It may not have come from the communes. But the effort was to structure communes in such a way that soon they can become sources of money. Money was some kind of phobia in her mind but now you have to start fresh from the scratch and don't expect anyth ing that you have become accustomed with Sheela and her group. I will not be giving you directions how to run your communes, how to make more money... I wi ll not be dictating anything because I trust in your intelligence -- you should function out of your intelligence. It is better to fail, but work through your own intelligence. Rather than to succeed on somebody else guidance. That success is not of any value. So spread the idea that sannyas is reborn, it was a nightmare that is ended and now we have to function in freedom , with intelligence and if we harmonize through intelligence, good. If we feel there is disagreement then there is no need somebody to suffer and fit with your ideas. He can have his own way. And all communes need not be on the sa me pattern. Each commune should find its own way, its own individuality. And that will be more colorful and more richer. BHAGWAN, THE FACT THAT SH EELA COULD STAND BETWEEN YOU AND US HAS CREATED LOTS OF MI STRUST AND SKEPTICISM AMONGST SANNYASINS. WHEN NOW WE GET MESSAGES FROM HASYA OR ARUP FOR EXAMPLE, THE SAME MISTRUST ARISES. HOW CAN WE AVOID ANYBODY BETWEEN YOU AND US? You need not be worried now because th e mistrust is natural, because Sheela really did a great betrayal. Not to me because nobody can betray me for the simple reason because I never ask anybod y's loyalty or anybody's faith so there is no possibility to betray me. But she betrayed the whole movement of sannyasins, all the communes who truste d her as my representative and she deceived them. So it is absolutely natural that there will be mistrust but you have to clear it now. That I was silent and in isolation, that 's why Sheela could do it. The moment I started speaking and meeting the sannyasin s face to face direct Sheela escaped. She knew now that there is no place for her. So now anybody, for example Hasya, cannot deceive you. I am always available for you to check. And Hasya cannot do an ything, because I am available to you."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"So there is no problem. Hasya is in dire ct contact with me and I am fully aware that the same thing should not happen so I will remain in contact with the sannyasins. And whenever you feel that something seems to be going against my basic ideology, you can always write a letter and ask me. There is no problem. Even if the letter is against Hasya there is no problem; you can directly write to me. The letter has not to go through Hasya. So now the management is going to be a little different. Hasya will be the president of the international and she will be my secretary to the international; but I will have also a small campus, I am not going to create another commune around me, just few sannyasins to look after me. And this campus will have a separate secretary, Neelam is going to be the secretary of my household campus. So you can write directly to Neelam whic h has nothing to do with Hasya and it will reach to me -- even if it is against Hasya she cannot prevent it. So now two ways are open to you. You can talk to Hasya, you can tell her, that \"We suspect this is going against Bhagwan. You check it. Are you sure that it is coming from Bhagwan, otherwise we are going to ask directly.\" And I am making a direct source available to you and Neelam will be nobody in the organization of the international. She will be simply the secretary of my household campus. She has no power, nothing, just she has to maintain things in the campus... the people who will be living and the guests who will be coming -- taking care of them. So just make it clear to people that it cannot happen and we will make every possible way. And their mistrust will disa ppear -- there is no problem. Few days, it is bound to linger on; but when they will see that it is no more there, things are coming clear. And I am directly available, I am available to your newspapers, to your magazines, to every commune, to every individual personally so you can check everything. No need to mistrust. Checki ng anything is not mistru st: it is simply making things clear to yourself. Don't call it mist rust, simply call it `I don't feel clear about it. That word mistrust is derogato ry.' If Hasya says something to you and you don't feel clear about it, for clarity you can inquire, and there will be no problem. AMERICA WAS A BIG EXPERIENCE, BHAGWAN. DID WE MISS? DID AMERICA MISS? WERE THE POLI TICIANS STRONGER THAN US? (TAPE SIDE B; NO OVERLAP) ... was really a great experiment but we neve r miss. That is not my style of life. We only win. America missed, and mi ssed badly and will repent, is already repenting. And the politicians cannot win. Power is absolutely powerless when it faces innocence, when it faces love, when it faces meditation. An d that's what has happened. For the first thing, they accepted their defeat in the very fact that they"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"became afraid of a single individual who had no power, no nuclear weapons. They accepted their inferiority of power before a single individual. It would have been far better and far more democractic to invite me for a discussion. If they thought that I was wron g and what I am doing is wrong, then the democratic way is to discuss. To arg ue... and I am ready to argue about each point. We invited them times and again, they never came. We wanted them to come and be our guest and just see the experi ment and show us where we are wrong. And if you can make your point logically , we will change it. But if we can make that what we are doing is right then yo u have to start doing something on the same lines, on a vaster scale. If we have succeeded with five thousand people to change a desert into an oasis, if we have succeeded five thousand people to make them rejoicing, happy, loving -- why you cannot do it? You have all the power of the world, you have all the money of the world -- we don't have anything. If we can make a society for four years where there has never been a rap e, a murder, a theft, any other kind of crime... why can't you make such a socie ty? There is nobody unemployed, not a single beggar. America has thirty million beggars on the streets dying. We had accept two hundred street people and they mixed and they rejoiced one thing most -- that they had been treated for the first time in their life as human beings. Otherwise they have become accu stomed of being treated as dogs. Even they have started accepting the idea that they are not human beings, they are not worthy of any respect. And in these four years they, who had been to jails many times on different crimes, who had been brought up in the world of crime, did not commit a single crime. We proved a far better communism in the commune because we stopped the circulation of money in the commune -- nobody should use money in the commune. You can donate to the commune but you cannot purchase by money. So you may have million dollars and somebody may not have a single dollar, but you are not rich by having a million do llars because you cannot use those million dollars. And the person who has not a single dollar is as rich as you are because your needs are fulfilled by the commune, his needs are fulfilled by the commune. They became afraid that is where their defeat is: that we are creating, we have succeeded almost in creating a higher qua lity of communism that exists in Soviet Russia without any dictatorship, with out any enforcement, without any government -- just depending on people's love and intelligence. Their fear was that the whole America will ask them: \"Why you cannot do it?\" The commune has to be demolished becaus e it is a dangerous model and they could demolish the commune only if I am somehow removed from America. They were in a difficulty how to remo ve me because I had not committed any crime. I lived in America for four years without any visa because they will not issue the visa. And they will not give me in writing that we are not issuing the visa; they were afraid because I will move the court, that I have every right to"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"remain in America, why they are refusing me, and they have no answer. So they will not give me in writing and they could not say yes because the political pressure was there that \"Don't give visa.\" So for four years I lived without visa. I wa s asking for the visa and they will not give, and they will not even say that, \"We cannot give,\" or that \"You are not to remain in the country, you have to leave the country.\" They could not arrest me. For two years they have been trying to arrest me. Such a big power. The biggest power in the world was afraid of five thousand sannyasins because to arrest me in the co mmune would mean they will have first to kill five thousand sannyasins, only then they can reach to me. And this will destroy their whole image in the world forever. So they could not manage to come to the commune. It was just a coincidence that I had gone to visit few sannyasins in North Carolina in their mountain homes -- they had beautiful mountain homes and have b een inviting me and I loved North Carolina... was really a beautiful part of America. Not only as land, but people also are more loving, more in telligent than anywhere else. They got this chance, they arrested me on the airport in the middle of the night. You can see their defeat on every step . Twelve guns to arrest a man who has nothing in his hands, who ha s nothing on his body exce pt a robe... this shows the poverty of power, and the stupidity of those who have the power. And they had no arrest warrant which was illegal. They had not even any cause to show me why they are arresting me -- what kind of democracy is this? That a person can be arrested without even telling him. Don't give me in writing, but at least tell me why I am arrested. They won't allow my attorney to be called because they have no reason to arrest me. If the attorney was there they will not be able to prove anything legally. They refuse that I cannot call the attorney and we are not going to give you any reason and we don' t have any arrest warrant, but you are arrested. On each step they were defeated. In the court for three days continuously they tried but they could not bring a single point against me. And the U.S. Attorney himself said, concluding his remarks in the court, that \"We have not been able to prove anything. Neither the other par ty has been able to prove anything.\" Now this is an stupid remark -- the se cond part. Because innocence needs no proof. It is for you to prove, you have arrested me! It is for you to prove why I have been arrested. My attorney's have nothing to prove. Otherwise every innocent man can be caught into the court and he has to prove his innocence. Innocence cannot be proved; guilt can be proved, crime can be proved -- they were defeated on each.... They had to rele ase the six people with me but they forced the magistrate not to release me on bail because I am a dangerous person and I have enormous financial resources and I have thousands of devoted people in the world who can do anything for me. This shows the poverty and the defeat of a great power. Are you saying that I am more powerful than America ? That's what they were saying... that I cannot be"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"bailed because I will leave America, I will not care about the bail and they will not be able to prevent me from leaving. Now this is a good news for Soviet Union to understand that these people are not to be worried about.... If this cannot prevent me from getting out of America, with all their forces and all their nucl ear weapons, these are not the people who are going to win in the third world war. On each point we went on winning and th e final victory was that they started being illegal. Finding no legal way, the la w is theirs -- I have not made it, the courts are theirs and the case was U. S. Government versus Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. A single man against a whole country. But they were worried that they cannot manage legally so they started using illegal means. For example, it takes only eight hours from North Carolina to Oregon. It took me twelve days to reac h Oregon. They will take me from one jail to another jail, and they were lying contin uously that \"You are going to Oregon.\" And I will end up in anothe r jail and I will ask, \"Where is Oregon? This place is not Oregon. And why you are lying? Jus t you want to punish me without proving any guilt. Without any trial you wa nt to harrass me as long as possible. Eight hours journey you have prolonged to twelve days.\" And in all these days they were defeated on every moment and they accepted the jailers, the marshalls that \"You are a strange man. We are gi ving you every kind of harrassment and you are taking it as if it is an experime nt in meditation.\" And that's what I was doing. They knew all my medical history because I had presented it to the I.N.S. -- that I have allergies of smoke, dust, perfume ... and they will put me in a cell where twelve people are continuously smoking and my eyes will be red and with tears and my breathing will be di fficult, my throat was not ev en able to speak. But I remained with closed eyes sitting wi th those people. I did not complain. One jailer said me, that \"You are the fi rst man who has been being harrassed in every possible way who has not complained.\" I said, \"What is the point of complaining -- I am enjoying everything that you are doing for me. You are taking so much tr ouble creating situations to harrass me, but you don't know that you cannot harrass me, you can torture my body, you can kill my body but you cannot touch me.\" They went to the extent that in one ja il the U.S. Marshall himself asked me to sign under the name of David Washingto n. I asked him that \"You are supposed to be the highest law-imposing authority. What kind of law you are imposing on me. That is not my name. You are asking me to do something absolutely illegal. And on your coat is written Department of Justice -- at least put the coat away, be a little ashamed. And what is the pu rpose -- do you think me that I cannot understand the purpose. The purpose is simple: you want the whole world to remain ignorant that I am in this jail so that whatever you want to do with me you can do. And the world news media will not be even aware. You can even kill me and there will no record even that where I disappeared because on your"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"record there is David Washington. I have ne ver entered in the jail, the question of my getting died or murdered, does not arise.\" So I told him, \"You write in your own hand writing. I will sign it.\" And I made him write in his own hand writing to make it a document that U.S. Marshall himself writes a wrong name, forces me... I sign my own name. And of course I signed in Hindi as I always sign. He could not figure it out what it is. He said, \"What it is?\" I said, \"It must be David Washington. As f ar as I understand.\" But I said to him, that \"These illegal things will not help. These are simply showing that you are desperate and you don't have anything in your favor. And now you are going even to absolute criminality, but in th e morning every television station, every newspaper and every radio will know that if you want to talk to me, ask for David Washington.\" He said, \"But how they will know?\" I said, \"You will see tomorrow morning. \" And tomorrow morning it happened because on the airplane there was one gi rl who was going to be released that night. I told her that, \"You listen silently whatever transpires between me and the jail authorities and then you will be releas ed. The first thing you have to do, just outside, because the news media help me immensely\".... It was news media who did not allow them even to touch my body. \"They are outside, hundreds of cameras and journalists -- you just go outside and tell them, that `Bhagwan has been forced to sign under a false name.'\" She has listened the whole thing. I just waved her and she said \"I will do.\" And she did. And next morning they had to rush me to another jail immediately because that was such an illegality and such a criminal act that if they were caught in it.... I was inside the jail and there was no record. And where is David Washington? And how I happened inside the jail? And where David Washington has disappeared? They became so desperate... He was so nervous in the morning when he wake me up. I said, \"What is the news.\" He sa id, \"You were right, you just come out and we will take you to the airport.\" Agai n lying. And they took me to F.B.I. Concentration Camp, far away from the city, thinking that now nobody will know but they were wrong. Because the press was aware that now they will be doing something, so the press remained there the whole night and the press followed on their helicopters and their cars and they could not manage to keep me hidden anywhere. Twelve days, they made every effort to keep me in a place where nobody should know. And in a stupid way, this man who is U.S. Marshall -- I asked him, that \"I would like to call my attorney to tell him that I have changed my name. I will not blame you, just... I have every right to change my name, I have changed my name. I have to inform my attorney that if he calls me, he has to call me David Washington.\" \"No, you cannot call your attorney. Your attorney can call you.\""},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"But I said, \"Either you are absolutely ret arded or what to make of it. How my attorney is going to know that I have changed to David Washington? He will ask for me and the clerk on the counter will say, that `Nobody of this name is here.'\" After twelve days continuously trying and being defeated in finding a place where they can hide me from the world finally they brought me to Oregon and there was their greatest defeat. They ha d nothing against me and they knew that if the trial begins they are going to lo se. And they have made a case, the whole nation versus against a individual, and United States of America will lose the case. Perhaps in the history no nation has lost a case against a single individual. They became aware that they have got into a mess. They don't have anything. So they asked my attorneys for negotiat ions. My attorneys said, \"There is no need for any negotiations. We are going to fight.\" And what they said that, \"Yes, we know that our points are weak but we want to make it clear to you that if you want to fight the case and if Bhagwan says `I am not guilty' then we will not let the court give him any bail. Then as long as the trial continues he will be in the jail and that can mean four years, seven years, ten years -- one never knows. We can manage to postpone it as long as possible. And you can understand what that means.\" They made it clear that \"We will torture. \" So the alternative they gave is that \"Bhagwan should accept that I am guil ty. The judge will fine him and the case will be dismissed.\" When my attorneys came to me they had tears in their eyes. They were the best attorneys America has and working with me they started loving me. And they said that \"We are feeling so helpless that we have to tell you to accept that you are guilty while you are not guilty. And that too, under the oath in the court, `that I will speak only the truth, nothing but truth' and the government is forcing you to speak a lie that `I am guilty.'\" And they said, \"We understand you would like to fight. We would like to fight because there is nothing in their case. We are sure to win but they can torture you, they can even kill you. And you have to think also of your thousands of sannyasins around the world -- they will be suffering all these five, seven years you will be in jail.\" So they said, \"It is not right at all what we are asking you to do but you accept guilty. Just out of compassion for your own sannyasins. And the government is absolutely defeated because they asked for negotiations. We have not asked for negotiations and they have managed negoti ations in such a way that they have not left us any outlet.\" The judge was perfectly aware of the se ttlement because exactly on those two points, they had eighteen points all bogu s against me... only on those two points he asked me, \"Are you guilty or not?\"... wh ich they wanted me to say that `I am guilty.' So that means the judge was absolutely aware of what settlement is happening between government and my attorneys."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"So this whole democracy is fraud. This whole justice and the name of great values, of fairness, is simple hypocrisy. And I accepted that I am guilty and still I was fined four hundred thousand dollars -- almost half a million dollars. The charges are false, you force me to acce pt first.... At that time it was not said that I will be fined half a million dollars. It was not part of the negotiations. I was only told that I accept my guilt and the judge will only give me the fine that for five years you cannot enter America. I said , \"That is not a fine because I am not going to enter America my whole life.\" But this fine was kept secret. Even my attorneys were shocked, but what else to do? They have forced me to accept that I am guilty -- now because I am guilty, the fine of half a million dollars and fi ve years I cannot enter America. I told the judge, that \"There is no need to make an y limitation. I am not going to enter this wretched land again in my life so you can make it lifelong.\" So we are not defeated in any way. We ha ve not lost any case. America got into unnecessarily exposing its own fascism, it s own ugly face to the world, and now they are very angry with me because I am talking to the whole world press and now they are not in a position to defend because whatever I am saying is true. They were not aware that provoking me is dangerous. A single man can destroy their whole integrity, their idea of being the greatest democratic nation. And I will continue to hammer that America is not a democracy, it is a hypocrisy. And it is basically fascist. And at least Soviet Union is straightforward. It is not hypocrite. It says that it is a dictatorship. America is exactly the same, perhaps wo rse and pretending to be democratic. Now my sannyasins have to expose this f raud to the whole world, wherever they are. And I have made it a point that if th ere is going to be a third world war ever, it will not be between Soviet Union an d America -- it will be between the whole world and America. It is the ugliest monster hiding behind a beautiful facade. Okay. Q: THANK YOU BHAGWAN.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH BY DELHI RECORDER Q: COULD YOU TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR ROUTINE OVER HERE? A: Coming to India, I have not started my work yet, otherwise it was too much for twenty-four hours to contain. Before it starts again, there is in fact no routine. I am sleeping from seven in the evening to eight in the morning, then taking my bath. At nine visitors come just to see me. That is one of the conditions of Span that I cannot hold meetings here, so they just stand on the gate and I go and receive them. And for half an hour I go around just for a walk. Nine-thirty to eleven is given to news media, becaus e from all over the world people are coming, so it is for their interviews. Elev en I take my lunch, and eleven-thirty I go back to sleep. At three I wake up. Th ree to three-thirty is for photographers, and just a walk around the ground, and th en again an interview with the press. Five to six I listen to some classical musi c. Six I take my supper, and seven I go to sleep again. So it is not much of a routine, mostly I am sleeping. Q: BUT YOU HAD STOPPED GIVING IN TERVIEWS IN THE LAST FIFTEEN DAYS. I BELIEVE WE ARE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE GOT AN INTERVIEW TODAY. A: Yes, for fifteen days I had to stop, because everywhere is so much ugliness. All over the world we talk about freedom of thinking and freedom of expression, but nowhere it is allowed. As I landed in Delhi after America, I gave my first press conference. In that press conferen ce I have not said anything about any religion because it was not the context. Still from far away Bengal a summons has come I have hurt their religious feelings, so I have to appear before the court in January. Second summons have come and third we are informed is coming. So my people thought that it will be better before we establish... In America I had five thousand people's commune. Four hundred were legal experts. We had the biggest legal firm in the whole world. They were taking care of all th e cases which I was creating. Right now we"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"don't have even a single legal person, so they suggested that for ten, fifteen days I should wait. Our legal persons are coming , and then they can take care of all these cases. These are harassment cases and it is very easy to put a case against anybody that you have hurt my religious feeling... In fact it is such a stupid and silly thin g that courts allow it. For example, I have said in one interview that I will not cons ider Rama of a great spiritual height, because whatever he has done is almost inhuman. First s son of a Brahmin dies in Ayodhya... And the Brahmin comes to Rama and says that there must be happening some great sin, otherwise the son of a Brahmin cannot die before his father. So a great search.... thousand mile away it has been found that a sudra -- an untouchable -- has heard few Brahmins reading Vedas, hi ding behind trees. That was the great sin, thousand miles away from Ayodhy a, that the Brahmin's son has died. The sudra was caught, and Manu Smrati(*) provides only one punishment: that melted lead, absolute fire, should be pour ed into both his ears. And that's what Rama did. I cannot conceive Rama even hu man. To talk of him as incarnation of God is simply nonsense. Now I have sa id this, those who follow Rama, their religious feelings are hurt. My own unde rstanding is that if their religious feelings are hurt, they should be hurt by the act of Rama, not my statement. I have not done anything, I have simply repeated what is written in their scriptures. I have not written them. Q: BUT DO YOU THINK THERE IS A CONCERTED MOVEMENT TO HARASS YOU? A: Certainly. Q: WELL, WHO WOULD YOU SAY WOULD BE BEHIND THIS MOVEMENT? A: American government. Q: THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT -- EVEN HERE IN INDIA? A: Even here. Q: APART FROM THIS CASE, IS TH ERE ANY OTHER CASE IN WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN SUMMONED? A: Yes, three other summons have come . And from very reliable sources the information that more summons will be coming to harass me: one from Madras, one from... Q: I SEE, FROM DIFFERENT PLACE..."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" A: From different places, so I have to appear. And meaningless.... they cannot win th ese cases because I am not saying anything on my own. I am simply making a statement which is in their scripture. If their religious feeling is hurt, they should drop Rama. And if their religious feeling is not hurt even by destroying the ears of a poor man, I don't think their religious they have any religious feelings at all, that they can be hurt by my statement. So I am, I have been fighting these cases my whole life. Not in a single case they have won... But harassment certainly is there. Q: BUT WHY SHOULD THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT BE SO INTERESTED IN HARASSING YOU? NOW? HERE IN INDIA? A: Yes, they are interested in for ma ny reasons. One is they destroyed the commune in America... Out of great jealousy. The commune has come to such a standard of living that it was higher that the American standard of li ving, that they think is the best in the world. We have changed a desert into an oasis. Five thousand people for four and a half years managed to do everyth ing without any support from outside. We made our roads, we made our houses, we cultivated vegetables, food, fruits. We made lakes, because it was a desert, there was no water. And it was almost a miracle. And news media started coming to Rajneeshpuram -- that how could we manage, we don't have any power, the go vernment is continuously harassing us. There was one hundred twenty cases by the government in which they were being defeated on each single case, but they were going on finding new.... Destroying the commune in America.... Now they don't want that I can create a similar commune anywhere, for the simple reason because that commune will prove what they have destroyed. Now they have a desert again. Now there is no proof, only in the memories of those five thousand people who had lived there, and in the memories of the news media who had been coming there. I invited the president, the governor and other officials and politicians just to come and be our guest and see what is happening. They never came. Now their whole effort is th at this should not happen anywhere, for two reasons. One, that if it happens again then ther e will be a proof that they have done something immensely ugly. And the whole America feels it. People have been phoning, and cryi ng on the phone -- non-sannyasins, Americans who don't know us -- and saying that \"This is the ugliest thing that American government has done ever, beca use you have not done any harm, and they have destroyed a whole city whic h you had made with so much labor.\" Our people were working twelve to fo urteen hours a day, and we had made such a beautiful place. That may have b een the only city which was centrally air-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"conditioned. We made the desert green, we made birds to come, swans, peacocks. When I had reached there, there was not a single bird. What bird will do? -- because there was no water. We made all kinds of trees grow. The second thing that they were afraid was is more important which was: we created a better quality of communism than exists anywhere in the world, either in China or in Soviet Russia. And by ve ry simple means. In Russia they have created through a very dictatorial regime, forcing people, and they killed almost one million people after revolution; and th en too if freedom is given again, the communism will disappear, because there is something intrinsically wrong in Marxian understanding. Man is not equal. You cannot make another Albert Einstein and you cannot create another Karl Marx. People are uniq ue. So the whole idea of equality and inequality is baseless. You cannot compare two unique beings. You don't compare a man with a chair. It is stupid -- they are simply different. People are different, so they should be given equa l opportunity to be different, but they should not be forced to be equal -- which is against human nature, against human psychology. So what they have not been able to a ccomplish in seventy years in Soviet Russia, we accomplished in four years by a si mple thing: we simply stopped using money in the commune. Inside the commune no money can be used. You can donate to the commune, but you canno t purchase anything by money in the commune. Q: SO HOW DID IT FUNCTION? A: Whatever you need, the commune will provide, and our needs are not much. And if we go intelligently... for example, for five thousand people we have only one kitchen, one dining hall. Rather than having two thousand, five hundred kitchens and engaging twenty-five hu ndred women, their whole life into kitchens and wasting their life there and then getting angry and then becoming a pain in the neck, then torturing the child ren, torturing the husband, and always ready to fight. We changed the whole system, and th e result was tremendous benefit economically: twenty-five hundred kitc hens are reduced into one. And all women are not good cooks. In fact all g ood cooks are men; not a single book on the science of cookery has been written by a woman, they are all written by men. And in all the best hotels, the best cooks are men, not women. So we had chosen the best c ooks. Why give food to people when you can manage better, more scientific, more hygienic food for all? So we had better food, more food. There was not a single beggar, th ere was nobody unemployed because there was no question of employment. Everybody was working because it was their commune, and they had to make it as beautiful as possible. In four years' time not a single crime, no rape, no murder, no suicide, no theft. There was no"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"need -- when you can get everything that you want, why you should steal somebody's used thing s? There was no need. Q: HERE CAN I INTERRUPT YOU? A: Just a moment. This created an idea all over America that communism is not necessarily connected with the dictatorship of the proletariat; in fact it is not connected with government at all. We had no government; we were just loving each other and we found that what works better, we should do it. And the question was being raised against th e politicians, that if these people can do it by such a simple means -- because there was nobody poor. You may not have a single dollar, and I may have millions of dollars, but I am not rich as far as commune is concerned; we are in the same boat. I cannot use those million dollars, so in no way I am rich than you. We destroyed poverty and richness without even touching the rich or raising the cry of war, of class struggle, of violence. They became immensely afraid of the ph enomenon. They have destroyed there -- absolutely illegally, because they had no legal reason. Now they don't want me to establish another commune anywhere. What they did as I was released by the court -- they had to release me because I have not done anything -- they immedi ately did the first thing in Germany because in Germany I have six communes running on the same principles, so they were afraid that I may go to Germany, and may make a big commune, bigger than existed in America, because six communes are already in existence. And West Germany is just under their pressure, under their domination. They immediately passed a law that I cannot enter Germany. This is such nonsense! I have never entered Germany, I have never committed any crime in Germany. Just in anticipation , in case I enter Germany they make a law. In fact there was no need to make a law; you could simply have refused a visa. But they may have been afrai d: perhaps some ambassador may be influenced with me and may give a visa. It is better to make it clear-cut law that I cannot enter Germany; otherwise I will be immediately arrested. And what reasons they have given? -- be cause I am a dangerous man and I have a great number of followers who love me so totally that they can do anything for me and we don't want to take any such risk. The same was the reason give n in America that they don't want to give me a bail. Not that I have committed any crime, th at I am a dangerous man. And they can see the connection clearly, that I am a dangerous man, that I have immense financial resources, that I have millions of friends around the world who love me so much that they can do anything; that no bail can prevent me. If you give me bail I will leave America. So they were not ready to give bail. And the same reasons are shown in German parliament that I should not be allowed to enter Germany. Here I have been"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"informed by very intimate sources to th e government that first they don't want any foreigners to be here, so anybody who wants to be here cannot get a visa. The people who had come with me, they gave only a standing ticket for three weeks and they will not extend it into visa. It is against their policy; their policy is to increase as much tourism as possi ble. And through me they can increase their tourism to thousands. In America every year at least fifty thou sand people were coming from all over the world, so to cut all the foreigners from me who are accustomed to do my work -- printing, editing, filming, making houses, making roads. In these four years we have trained all kinds of skills. So those people particularly who have been in American commune should not be allowed. And that's what they have been doing; they are not allowing them. Left alone to myself I cannot create a commune. With Indians it is very difficult to create that kind of thing. Q: SO THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER RAJNEESHPURAM? A: It will be, I am finding a way, because I am already invited by two governments. Q: CAN YOU NAME THEM? A: Not yet, because... Q: WESTERN GOVERNMENTS? A: Western governments, two governments who are not pro-American have already invited me, that they are absolute ly ready to accept my people and give land on their own, all support. An injustice has been done to me. Q: BUT ARE THEY EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS, OR OTHER WESTERN GOVERNMENTS? A: They are South American governments. Q: WHAT ABOUT YOUR PLANS FOR THIS PLACE? YOU ARE ALREADY BECOMING QUITE AN ATTRACTION HE RE, AND AS YOU HAD SAID ON TELEVISION ALSO THAT SUPPOSE THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT WERE TO COOPERATE WITH YOU... A: Indian government is not cooperating. Himachal people are very cooperative, very loving. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Q: WE BELIEVE YOU HAVE RECEIV ED OFFERS OF LAND DONATIONS FROM FAR AND WIDE. A: Yes, many, not one, many people ha ve come to donate their own land -- people who have never known me before. Punjats and their heads have come to offer, the Bar Association of Mandi has come to invite me to be here and to tell me that if there is any legal problem they will be available to me without any fees or any burden on us. And other corporations in Mandi, in Kulu, in Manali -- they have approached; individuals have approached... many. But the problem is: the land alone is not enough. What I will do with the land? Q: BUT HERE THERE'S ANOTHER TH ING: WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT SO HOSTILE TO YOU... I MEAN, ANY GOVERNMENT ANYWHERE THEY ARE ALWAYS VERY HOSTILE. A: The same reasons. For example, Indian government would not like just because of me to create any antagoni sm with America, particularly for the reasons that they have been begging them for nuclear plants to be made here, and only America and Russia have... (lights go out). The Indian government or any government who is in need of any American support can bargain very easily. And it is a simple thing for them; my commune or me or my idea does not matter to th em; what matters is nuclear energy. And America can give them plutonium. So that is a pressure on them. Indian government has not been help ful anyway. One month I have been waiting; my people have been approach ing -- they have not shown any interest of any kind. In fact they have shown it clearly that they are not interested. While I was in jail in America Indian government did not took any step to ask American government that, \"You are hold ing a person in jail without arrest warrant without even saying him what crime he has committed. That is absolutely illegal! You are punishing a pers on before you have proved that he is guilty.\" And they tortured me for twel ve days. And when I was released the Indian ambassador phoned that, \"D o you need any help from us?\" I said, \"This is absolutely stupid. Where you have been for twelve days? And the whole America is agog with only one news -- all the television channels, all the newspapers, all the radios -- and you ha ve been fast asleep! And when I am released, what help you can give me?\" Q: IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAD SAID THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER BHAGWAN? A: No, I have never said that. Q: IT HAS APPEARED EVERYWHERE."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" A: It is absolutely wrong. Q: YOU AR STILL VERY MUCH THE SAME PERSON YOU WERE? A: Yes, I am still the same person. Q: IT'S NOT THAT YOU DISBANDED YOUR COMMUNE? A: No. I have... Q: WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE OR SO WHO WERE LIVING IN RAJNEESHPURAM? I MEAN, THEY CANNOT BE ACCOMMODATED HERE... OR ARE TH EY BEING ACCOMMODATED IN YOUR COMMUNES ALL OVER THE WORLD? A: They are being accommodated in othe r communes, or they are making small groups and arranging themselves and wait ing if I can manage somewhere, then they will be immediately coming. Any statement that said that I have said that I am not Bhagwan is absolutely wrong. Q: WHAT ABOUT THOSE MANY PEOPLE -- HUNDREDS COME TO YOU HERE FOR DARSHAN AT THIS RESO RT: HAVE YOU GOT ANY PROGRAM FOR THEM? -- BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING TO YOU WITH A NEED. A: I know, they are coming, but my conditio ns of staying here are such that I will not be even talking to any gatherings, an y meetings, so I cannot talk to them. But they are happy enough just to see me sa fe. They can see me, they can cry, they can weep and they can hold my hand -- and they are happy. This condition will not last. We are searching all over the world, but this time we are being very much clear about any conditions that may arise later on. So first we are trying to find an island which is independent, which belongs to no government; and we have located two islands which are tremendously beautiful, and which are not for sale. Q: WHICH PART OF THE WORLD? A: One is in Europe and one is near Canada. Q: IN THE MEDITERRANEAN? A: In the Mediterranean."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" Q: AND CANADA? A: Just near Canada. Q: TOWARDS THE PACIFIC SIDE OR THE ATLANTIC? A: Yes, east side.... So my first preference is going to be an island which can be under no pressure of any government. Second, these countries which have invited -- I am sending my people to see what places they can o ffer and what kind of help on what conditions. And we have our own conditions because we will be bringing five thousand people; then you should not create that visas cannot be given and people cannot stay long. So we have to manage. But within a month I will have the place. And this time it is going to be far bigger than it was in America. It was five thousand; this time it will be fif ty thousand, not less than that, because I never go backwards -- that is not my idea. Q: AND IT WILL BE ON THE SAME LINES AS THE ONE IN OREGON? A: It will be on the same lines... Q: ONLY BIGGER? A:... only bigger. Q: AND BETTER, PERHAPS? A: And better, certainly, because we have al l the intelligent people in the world, because my way of thinking is such that only very educated, very intelligent people can be interested in it. So we have engineers, doctors, scientists, Nobel prize winners... Q: WHICH NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS? A: One economist from England, I don' t know the name because we change the name so we don't know their real name, what their real name is. Q: WHAT'S HIS NAME NOW; DO YOU RECALL THAT? A: No -- because I have one milli on sannyasins around the world! Q: I SEE. DO YOU PERSONALLY GIVE THEM A NAME?"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" A: I was giving up to Poona; now it becomes difficult. Q: IT MUST HAVE BECOME VERY BIG NOW. A: Now it is too difficult, so many pe ople are giving who are old sannyasins. Q: SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT TH IS OPEN UNIVERSITY AND WHAT EDUCATION MEANS TO YOU? A: First: education means to me a man wi th a balanced growth -- of body, mind, heart and soul. So up to now there has neve r been any education which is total. It is at the most a training of the mind, at the cost of the body, at the cost of the heart, and finally at the cost of the man's innermost being. This education has proved dangerous. It creates only clerks; it cannot create anything else because it diverts all the energy into those three \"r's\". I am not against it, they should be absorbed, bu t they should have their proportion. Physically, much can be done which is neglected. For example, no education system bothers about exercises or about food. For example, vegetarian food. For thousand of years in India the Jainas an d the Brahmins and all high caste people have been vegetarians, but they have no t produced any geniuses; they have not received a single Nobel prize. The three Indians who received Nobel prize were all non-vegetarians. The vegetarian food as it has been up to now, lacks something, some proteins which help the intelligence to grow. So if we depend on vegetarian food then those proteins have to be added. If yo u don't add those proteins then you are killing the person's intelligent growth. So in my commune what I have do ne... we were using non-fertilized eggs, because non-fertilized eggs are just vege table because they don't have any life; and they have all the proteins that are needed by a mind, intellect, intelligence. So now, because I used the eggs, Jainas are against me; just the word \"egg\" is enough to make them against, they w ill not think twice what I am saying. And the non-vegetarians are also against be cause their only argument is finished. Their only argument for non-vegetarian food was that it is the only food that can help intelligence to grow; vegetarian food will keep you vegetables! So they are angry because I have now found something -- that meat is not necessary, not only necessary but in fact, ugly. And in total perspective of education, a man who eats meat, fish or anything living will not grow into his heart. His heart will remain insensitive. If just for eating you can kill, then your heart will remain a stone. Q: BUT AREN'T PLANTS ALSO ALIVE? "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A: They are alive... they are alive, and if one is really to be a vegetarian then one should eat the fruits which are ripe an d fall from the trees; then you are not killing anybody. And the crops, wheat or rice, which are ripe -- you are not killing anybody. Plants should be respected just as we respect people. In my garden nobody can pluck a flower for the simple reason because that shows the beauty of the flower but ugliness of you. You are destroying it, you are taking it away from its life's source, and you are showing a certain kind of insensitivity. Then what is the differenc e between a cannibal.... In fact cannibals say that the most delicious food is human children. If you are for delicious food, if that is the goal of life then the whole humanity should be cannibalistic. And they may be right, that small children's meat may be the most delicious thing -- about that all cannibals are agreed, there is no disagreement. But when we can manage with out hurting, then in a right kind of education we should help the person to become sensitive also. Q: THIS IS WHAT YOU PLAN TO HAVE ON YOUR ISLAND? A: Certainly. We had a university even in America. Q: IN RAJNEESHPURAM? A: In Rajneeshpuram; and now we will be having on a wider scale. Q: BUT HAS THERE BEEN ANY RE SPONSE TO YOUR OFFER FOR A UNIVERSITY THAT YOU HAD MADE ON TELEVISION? A: No, no response. Q: BUT HOW WOULD THIS THING BE HELPFUL TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE INDIAN NATION IN GENERAL? BY MAKING BETTER PEOPLE? A: It will not be helpful to the government. It will be helpful to the people but it will not be helpful to the politicians. Q: WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? A: Because these people who are sensitiv e and intelligent wi ll not choose these idiots as politicians. Not a single polit ician in the whole history has proved a genius, they have all proved third grade. People like Adolf Hitler were rejected from art institutions, he was rejected fr om architecture institutions, because he was not capable so the entrance examinat ion he failed. But he became a world"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"hero; he had almost conquered the world. These people will not be helped, if the people are most sensitive and more inte lligent, and their growth is balanced. For example I was talking about their sensitivity. They will be more loving; no government wants people to be more loving. Q: WHAT ABOUT PANDIT NEHRU? A: Pandit Nehru was not a politician -- an d that's why he failed. He was more a poet. He would have been more fitting with Rabindranath Tagore than with Mahatma Gandhi. He was a sensitive soul and he has an intelligent approach towards history and human evolution. And he was never convinced about Mahatma Gandhi and his primitive ideology of going back to the spinning wheel. But one thing he could see -- that Gandhi can influence the whole nation, and without Gandhi, this nation is impossible to take it into the struggle for freedom. He followed Gandhi but he was never a Gandhian. Q: BUT WASN'T THAT BEING A PRAC TICAL POLITICIAN? TO TOE THE LINE OF GANDHI AND KEEP YOUR OWN IDEAS AT THE SAME TIME? A: It was simply a deceptive thing, I will not call it practical politician. Q: AND WHAT ABOUT OUR PRESENT PRIME MINISTER, RAJIV GANDHI? HOW DO YOU RATE HIM? A: There is not yet time enough to say an ything about him. It takes a little time to show the person, his reality; and particul arly a person who is a non-politician, when he comes into politics he is very nice to everything, to everybody. Just give him time and let power corrupt him. Q: YOU MEAN THAT WILL BE THE TEST? A: That will be the test, that is the only test. If power does not corrupt a person then only he has some authentic being; otherwise power corrupts. It can corrupt anybody because power is su ch a thing, that for example, I have received information from the central go vernment highest sources -- they have a file on me, and in the file they say ri ght now the government is watching; they are neither positive nor negative . All will depend how I behave. What it can mean \"how I behave\"? I will behave the way I have always behaved. Q: YOU WILL NOT CHANGE TO PLEASE THEM? "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A: No! I am not going to change to please ANYBODY; I will simply behave the way I feel right. Q: DON'T YOU THINK ALL THESE EX PERIENCES HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT ANY CHANGE IN YOUR PERSONAL CHARACTER? A: No... no, they have made me more stronger and more convinced about my truth. Q: WHY DO YOU EVOKE SUCH EXTREME REACTIONS IN PEOPLE? -- EITHER THEY ARE READY TO KILL FOR YOU OR THEY ARE READY TO KILL YOU? A: Yes, that is true. It always happe ns if you are saying something without considering the people, just saying becaus e you see it in that way and you feel that it is truth. And I am ready to argue for it; I have been arguing my whole life. Then only two possibilities exist: if you are intelligent you understand the argument. And if you are not intelligent then you feel irritated because that argument disturbs you, your settled dogma, your creed, your religion. So to me it is a criterion of truth, that it will always divide people in two: either they will be all for you or they will be all against you, but it will not leave a single person who is indifferent. Q: HAS POWER CORRUPTED YOU? A: I don't have any power. Q: BUT YOU HAVE; YOU WIELD TREMENDOUS POWER WITH YOUR FOLLOWERS AT LEAST. IT HAS BROUGHT NO CHANGE IN YOU? A: It has not brought any change in me because I don't consider it a power. Q: IT'S A WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS? A: Yes. I simply love my people, and my people love me. Q: EVEN LOVE HAS A LOT OF POWER. A: Love has a totally different power. It is not the power of the gun. It is not the power of nuclear weapons; it is not th e power of harming anybody. It is the power of helping someone. People love me not because I have any power -- I am not a president of any country or a prime minister or a king or.... I am nobody, I don't possess a single"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"thing. Even my robe and everything -- th ey belong to my people. They make them for me, I don't possess them. I have not purchased anythin g for thirty years. Even my watch you see is made by my own people. And it is not diamonds; these are just poor stones. Q: SO YOU HAD ALL THESE NEWSPAPERS WRITING ABOUT DIAMOND- STUDDED WATCHES, AND REAL GOLD CADILLACS! A: Yes, that's how I check how much intelligence the press people have. Q: TALKING OF LOVE AND THE WA Y YOU TALK ABOUT LOVE OVER HERE, DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL AFFI NITY FOR THE SUFI SAINT POETS LIKE VARDISHAH, BABA FREE, OR GURU NANAK? A: I have... I have certainly. Anybody who has attained to a state of silence, light, blissfulness and who has been able to sh ower all these qualities in his own way on other peoples -- I have love for all of them. It does not matter whether they are Mohammedans or Hindus or Christians or Buddhists; to me what matters is whether the man has attained to his in nermost core, has he reached to his innermost centre? Q: BUT THEN DIDN'T GANDHI ALSO ASPIRE TO THE SAME THING? A: No, Gandhi was a simple politician. Gandhi was a simple political figure. He talked about religion, he lived like a religio us man, he tried to create a a synthesis between Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, but the whole idea behind it was that the country remains undivided. And an un divided country means a Hindu India. Gandhi calls GITA his mother, but he never calls KORAN his father. He should have remembered it; otherwise his mother will be a widow. I mean that Gandhi is talking every day morning, evening, to his disciples about GITA, and anybody can see that GITA is a pure philosophy of violence. And you can see that man, Gandhi, is talking of non-violence. But to keep Hindus under him he is raising GITA to the highest, holiest scripture in the world. Otherwise anybody can see that GITA and Mahatma Gandhi are contradictory. Gandhi has no argument; he has never given any argument what about Krishna who is continuously trying in the wh ole GITA for Arjuna to fight, to kill? because this is your religion and this is God's will -- you have to do it. Q: DO YOU AGREE WITH THE GITA AND ITS PHILOSOPHY? A: No! If I had been in place of Arjuna I would have told Krishna clearly that, \"Who are you to decide God's will? I ca n hear my own heart and I feel God's will is that I should go to the Himalayas and meditate. I don't want to fight. Why"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"should I listen to you? Why should I have a mediator between God and me? I can listen to my own heart.\" Q: BUT ISN'T KRISHNA SUPPOSED TO BE GOD HIMSELF? A: But that is himself he is saying -- so anybody can say. This is as stupid as.... One man went into a restaurant and told hi s friends that, \"My wife is the most beautiful woman in the world.\" And so mebody asked, \"But how can you say that?\" He said, \"I can say because my wife herself has said it!\" It is so stupid Krishna saying himself that, \"I am God\" -- it is simply stupid; there is no point in it, anybody can say. Gandhi was asked by Louis Fisher who has written his biography that \"When India becomes independent, what w ill happen about the armies and all the armaments -- because in your concep tion they don't have any place.\" And Gandhi said, \"Yes, they don't have any place. We will throw them into the ocean, and we will send all soldiers to work in the fields.\" And when Independence came he forgot all about it; not only that, when Pakistan attacked India, three airplanes who were going to attack Pakistan flew over Birla House to get his blessings, an d he came out of the house and blessed the three airplanes who are going to bomb Pakistan. Now what happened? Q: THIS WAS IN THE TIME WHEN PAKISTAN WAS GOING TO ATTACK KASHMIR, JUST AFTER? A: Yes, just after. So this man was as ked by Louis Fisher that, \"If somebody attacks you, what you will do?\" Gandhi said, \"We will come out and we will say, 'We are here -- if you want to kill us you can kill us; if you want to live with us, you can live with us.'\" It is so easy to talk -- but that time it was useful because it gave a great aura of saintliness but when the reality came in his hands, then all things changed; then he was not the same man. He was absolutely a cunning politician, an d in fact as far as I am concerned -- and I have looked into his life as deeply as anyone can -- his eldest son, Haridas Gandhi, became a Mohammedan. That was su ch a shock to him that he told his wife that, \"I don't want to see the face of Haridas again.\" Now, this is strange! If Mohammedans and Hindus and Christians are all the same, then what does it matter that H aridas has become a Mohammedan? If he feels better with Mohammedan approach, Gandhi should bless him! But Gandhi cannot bless his because the Hindu politics -- the Hindu will get angry, annoyed.... He made it a will that Haridas should no t be allowed to put fire when he dies into his funeral. Haridas was there, crying, weeping, in the crowd, but he was not allowed to put fire as the eldest son."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"And why he had become Mohammedan? -- just to show to the world.... He has written letters to friends that it was just to show to the world that what Gandhi says is all hypocrisy. When he changed his name he told the maulvi that, \"Make it exactly of the same meaning as 'Harida s'.\" So he gave him the name \"Abdullah Gandhi\". Abdullah means Haridas: God's servant. And why he was doing it? -- because Gand hi has tortured him very badly. He wanted to study and Gandhi was agains t this whole education so he will not send him to school. And he revolted against it and he went to on e of his uncles to live with, and passed matriculation and ca me to get the blessing; but Gandhi closed the door on his face and told him that, \"You are dead for me.\" This is not the approach of a non-violent, loving man. Q: COULD YOU NOW EXPLAIN: WH AT DO YOU MEAN BY 'SANNYAS'? WHAT IS THE CONCEPT? A: Is your open university finished? -- beca use that is your main thing. First, the word 'university' itself comes from 'univer sal'. it means open; it cannot be closed. For example, no university can call itself Hindu university; that is contradiction in terms. No university can call itself Mohammedan university; it is a contradiction in terms. A university has to be open, available to all. And my idea of openness is multi-dimens ional. For example, right now I have been a teacher in the university. Two years are wasted for a small course that can be finished in two months. The whole six years which make you a master can easily be finished in one year. It is on e of the capacity of human mind, that the greatest challenge you give to it, the mo re powerful and more intense it comes. Our whole education is lazy. I was surp rised because I was expelled from many colleges when I was a student for the simple reason that I told to the professor of philosophy that, \"Whatever you are teaching can be finished within six months; there is no need for six years.\" And he was so annoyed by it he took me to the principal. And I told to the principal th at, \"I can accept the challenge -- because this man had his master's degree thirty year s before and all that he is teaching is all bullshit because it is no more releva nt. In thirty years philosophy has gone so far that he does not know even the name s of the latest philosophers; he has not read a single book. And he is teaching us something which is already out of date. I can teach within six mo nths, six-years course.\" The principal said, \"Perhaps you are right -- this is my feeling also, being a principal for many years -- that our education system is really very lazy. It simply goes on and on; and finally, even when you become a master, what kind of mastery you have got? Q: NO, BUT WHAT SORT OF SYSTEM DOES YOUR UNIVERSITY HAVE? "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"A: My university will have... first: drop all that is non-essential -- and there is ninety percent non-essential which is bein g unnecessarily fed up into people's mind. Now, what is the need of Tamerlan e, Nardishah, Alexander the Great? In what way they make you more human? In what way they give you the pride of being human? They are being taught -- but not Farid, not Nanak, not Buddha. No. Q: BUT HOW SOON DO YOU THI NK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THIS SORT OF A UNIVERSITY? A: Once my commune is there there is no problem because I have professors, I have all kinds of people. Q: SO IN ONE MONTH, TWO MONTHS? A: Just as I get the land -- if I decide fo r an island immediately it starts working. Things will be... Q: BUT AN APPROXIMATE TIME-FRAME... HOW SOON? A: The university will take at least two years to begin with, but the structure will start immediately. So first I want to cut out all that is ug ly, because my understanding is: the more you feed people on ugly things, the more you make them accept the ugly. Slowly slowly they feel that this is how human beings are -- they kill, they murder, they war. They do all these things and this is natural, this is just how human beings are. Why, when you can have Buddha, Lao Tzu, or Kabir and beautiful people...? So these people can feel that there is so mething greater than they are; and that greater has to be achieved, otherwise they would have failed. Q: WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE A FREE MAN? A: I am. Q: ARE YOU A SANNYASIN? A: No. Q: WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS WORD? -- IT INTRIGUES ME. "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"A: \"Sannyas\" is an old word. It used to mean in the old context \"renunciation of the world\". I have still used it with a n ew meaning. My meaning is \"rejoicing the world\". Renunciation to me is ugly because renu nciation means cutting things from life, inhibiting, repression; leave the wife, leave the children, leave the... leave everything. And these people who have been teaching renunciation of life are the cause of poverty in the world, are the caus e of beggars in the world, are the cause of crimes in the world. In Buddha's time thousands of people became monks. Now, what happened to their wives, what happened to their children? They were dependent on them. Nobody ever bothers that these people did something good? Their wives must have become prostitutes; their childre n must have become orphans, beggars. And these millions of people who became monks, they became a burden on the society because they became non-productive. So they did a double crime: they left their duties, and on the other hand they became a heavy burden on the society. Still there are millions of sannyasins in India, and they are a burden; they don't pr oduce anything. This is strange, that in five thousand years of history, no Indi an sannyasin has created anything. He has not helped the world to become more be autiful, more richer, more human. How they can help? -- they have abandoned it. They have really taught people that it is not worth... their hopes are for paradise somewhere far away, beyond death. And my sannyas is rejoice the world, be in the world and be totally in the world. Q: I BELIEVE YOU STARTED ONE OF YOUR FIRST INITIATION CAMPS IN MANALI? A: Yes. Q: IS IT A COINCIDENCE YOU ARE BACK HERE OR WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? -- DESTINY? A: It is a coincidence because I don't believe in any destiny. Q: HOW DO YOU INTERPRET IT? WAS THIS THE WILL OF GOD THAT YOU SHOULD BE BACK HERE AGAIN? A: There is no God. Q: DOES IT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANCE, YOUR COMING BACK? No, nothing... just a coincidence... becaus e I like the place. When seventeen years before I had a camp here and started sannyas here, I had liked the place, so when"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"we were coming and it was a question where.... So I told them find out something in the Himalayas just for a few weeks to rest before you find a permanent place. And they found this \"Span\" was good. So it was just a coincidence.

Q: YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE AN ABSOLUTELY FREE PERSON: DON'T YOU FEEL HEMMED IN NOW BY TH E SORT OF CELEBRITY YOU HAVE ACQUIRED? A: No, nothing... there is no problem, because I have... Q: NO, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND YOU ALL THE TIME. A: No, that does not matter. Whether I am in the crowd or alone, I am alone. Q: I THINK THAT WILL DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A: Good!

WE DECIDED YO U WERE THE PERSON WE SHOULD WRITE ABOUT. SO IT'S NOT A RIGID SORT OF INTERVIEW WE WILL HAVE. A: That's good. Q: WE HAVE CERTAIN QUESTIONS... BUT IF YOU WANT TO TELL US SOMETHING.... A: No, you can ask any question. Q: WHEN YOU CAME HERE, BHAGWAN, THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN MINDS OF YOUR DEVOTEES AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT YOUR NEW HOME. HAVE YOU FOUND IT OR WHERE IT WILL BE? A: The home is something one never finds. One is always finding it, and the joy and ecstasy is in the search. I am reminded of a small poem of Rabind ranath Tagore. He is in search of God. He looks all over the world, and finally he finds the home of God. He goes up to the door, is just going to knock on the door. A question arises in his mind: If by chance he is in, then what ? Then what I am going to do? My whole life has been a search, I have been a wanderer, and this will be the end; this will be actually committing suicide.\" So without knocking on the door he escapes from the place as fast as he can. Now he is still se arching, knowing perfectly well where it is. Avoiding that place he goes on searching and enjoying the search. I love that poem immensely, because life should be a search, not a finding. The finding means the full point has arrived. Death is a finding. Life is gypsy."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"So I am still searching for the home. An d I will go on searching for the home, knowing perfectly well the home is not some thing that has to be found. It has to be searched -- but not found. Q: COULD IT BE, BHAGWAN, IN THE NORTH OF INDIA TO FIND A HOME? A: No, I am searching all over the worl d. My people are searching everywhere. Q: YOU SAID YOU ARE SEARCHING ALL OVER THE WORLD. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSI ON BECAUSE WHEN YOU CAME BACK YOU SAID YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE IN THE HIMALAYAS AND NEVER LEAVE YOUR HOMELAND, INDIA, AGAIN. SO I THINK IT IS MORE AS A SIMILE YOU SAID THAT. A: No. To me the earth is not divided by political lines, and words like \" India\" are certainly symbolic. It simply means the eternal search for truth. \"Himalaya\" is also a symbol, a symbol for peace, serenity, silence. The physical, the material, is not importan t. You should listen to the significance, the symbolic meaning in it. To me, India is not confined by the bo undaries. Anybody who has been a seeker of truth is part of India. He may be He nry Thoreau in America, he may be Martin Buber in Jerusalem, he may be Bertrand Russell in England, he may be a Socrates in Athens -- but these people belong to a certain, symbolic world which is not parallel to the geographical and the political. For example, most of the Indians are no t Indians. The majority of them has no concern for the spiritual. They are more greedy than I have found people anywhere else. They are more materialis tic than the people they condemn as materialistic. So when I said I will never leave India, that simply means wherever I am, India is there; and wherever I am, Himalaya is there. Q: BHAGWAN, THIS QUESTION MAY SOUND STUPID... A: No.... Q:... BUT I WANT TO ASK: ARE YOU THINKING OF NOMINATING A SUCCESSOR FOR YOUR MOVEMENT? A: First, I am not a founder of a moveme nt, I am not a head of a movement. How can I think of a successor? To me, spir ituality is absolutely individual. The moment you organize it, you kill it. You can see it all around the world in all the religions, just corpses."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"There is a very famous story that a man came running to the devil and told him that, \"What are you doing sitting here! A certain man on the earth has found the truth. Do something; otherwis e your business is finished!\" The devil laughed. He said, \"You are a new servant here -- you don't know me. My people have already reached there; they have become his successors his priests, his scholars. They are standing between him and the people. They will not let the truth reach the people without their interpretation -- and their interpretation is my interpretation.\" It is a tremendously beautiful anecdote. Mahavira was against Brahmanism, his wh ole revolt was against Brahmanism, but his eleven chief disciples were all Brahmins. He never wrote a single word; these eleven Brahmins wrote all th e scriptures, and Jainism has been worshipping those scriptures for twenty-five centuries. Now this is very strange: a man who is against Brahmanism is represented by Brahmins to the whole world. The same happened to Buddha. He was also against the Vedas, against the Upanishads, against the whole traditio n of Hinduism, but he found all his successors Brahmins. They tu rned, they changed, they made meanings that was easy for them. They listened from a Hindu mind. Whatever Buddha had said, they managed to support it, exactly what he was opposing. So I am not a founder. There have been many founders and nothing has been founded. I am just an individual seeker who has started alone, and then people went on coming; and the caravan became bigger and bigger, but the caravan has no leader, and each individual is responsible whether to be in the caravan or not to be in the caravan. It is his freedom. So my whole approach is individualistic, and against all kinds of organizations and the successors and the churches and the shankaracharyas and the popes an Ayatollah Khomeiniacs. All these are not s eekers of truth, they are exploiters of the masses in the name of truth. At the most I can call myself a friend. Nobody is my follower. I love them, they lo ve me; there is no question of putting me on any high pedestal. I am absolute ly happy where I am. And the best place is the lowest because from there you cannot fall. Q: IT IS THE THINKING OF PEOPLE, IS THAT YOUR STAY IN OREGON... WE HAVE SEEN PHOTOS AND VIDEOS... PEOPLE HAVE SEEN. IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF LIVING IN LUXURY. HERE IT IS MORE A SPARTAN EXISTENCE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS? A: To me luxury is something inner. A king may be living in misery, and a beggar may be living in luxury. It is the quality of your being, the flowering of your potential -- the peace, the silence, th e blissfulness. I don't see any difference."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"I can be in a palace or I can be in a sm all cottage, but I remain myself. Neither the palace affects me nor the cottage. So I am not here living in a Spartan existence; I am living as luxuriously as I have always lived. And you must know that for thirty years I have not possessed a single thing -- no bank account. I have been in America for five years but I have not seen a single dollar bill, I have not touched money. People have seen me in Rolls Royces -- th ey were not mine; they belonged to the commune. Everything belonged to the commune and th ey simply made it available for me to be used. And the moment I left America... I have not brought a single thing from there; they are all with the commune. Even from my shoes up to my cap, they are all made by my friends. They are not mine; they are gifts of love. Even the watch you see is being made by my friends. Q: IN DELHI YOU CALLED IT \"PROLETARIAN STONE.\" A: Yes, they are proletarian stones; they are not diamonds. It is the cheapest watch. It is a question of how you live, not in what you live. When after twelve days in American jails -- five jails -- I left the jail, the U.S. marshall told me, \"This is strange, you l ook better than you had come before! It seems jail life suits you.\" I said, \"Everything suits me. It is not a ques tion of things, it is simply an art how to make the best out of the worst. I was not miserable in your jails, I enjoyed the experience, it was so new, and I loved everything. I may have died without knowing it, so by the courtesy of the American government they have made my experience richer.\" I could see that the criminals are far mo re human than the bureaucrats. I was surprised to know that in all five jails where are four hundred, five hundred prisoners in each jail, there is not a single white man, all are black. It was really a surprise that in America whites don' t commit crime! And the blacks who are there, they have been there, somebody for six months, somebody for nine months without trial. They are waiting for trial. They have not committed any crime, nothing is proved against them by the court, so these are not jails -- you are befooling the whole world. \"You are keeping these black people -- and they are all young; I have not seen a single old black person here, they are all young. And you are afraid of these young people, that they are going to become revolutionaries. So you simply arrest them for no crime. They have been telling me that they have not committed any crime, they have not even dreamt of committing any crime, and suddenly they are being arrested in the midd le of the night and nothing is told to them and they are said that the court w ill decide. And for nine months they are"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"waiting and their trial number has not come, and perhaps it may come or may not come at all.\" So I said, \"I am more experienced abou t you about your politics and about your mask and what you are doing to people who have not done any crime and they are unnecessary being punished. And th ey are far more human than you.\" And these twelve days gave me a tremen dously significant experience, that you can throw me now in hell but you cannot disturb my silence.\" So I told him a small story. I told him about Edmund Burke, one English philosopher. He had a friend who was the archbishop of England. And the archbishop was asking him again and agai n that, \"Someday you should come to listen to my sermon.\" One day finally he went there, listened to the sermon, raised his hand and asked a question to the archbishop. He asked, \"My question is: You say that those who have faith will go to heaven; those who do good things will go to heaven; those who do not have faith will go to hell; th ose who do evil things, sinners they will go to hell. My problem is, a man can do good things without faith. \"Socrates was a good man but has no faith. \"Gautam Buddha was a good man but has no faith in any God. \"What about these people? And a man can have faith and still can commit all kinds of crimes, all evil possible. \"Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Alexander th e Great, all were faithful people but they killed millions of people. \"So my question is: If a man has no faith and does good works, what is going to happen to him? Have you any place where he is going to be sent? Of course he cannot go to heaven because he has no faith. He cannot be thrown to hell because he has not committed any evil acts. What about those who have faith but have committed evil acts?\" The archbishop was in a very difficult situation. He said, \"Nobody has ever asked such a question, I have not come acro ss in any theological treatise of such a question, so please give me seven days to think.\" Seven days he could not sleep because the question was not only Edmund Burke's question, it became his question also; the question was significant. Seventh day, the next Sunday, he reac hed early because still the question was there and there was no answer. He reached early in the church, prayed to Christ and asked that, \"I cannot find the answer; you give me the answer; otherwise your representative will be proved stupid .\" But he was so tired, for seven days continuously thinking and no t sleeping, that he fell as leep there on his knees and he had a dream. And in the dream he saw that he is in a train and he asked other passengers where they are going, and th ey said they are going to heaven. He said, \"That's good -- that's what I wanted.\" They reached heaven. He could not believe: it looked dirty, dusty, nobody laughing, nobody smiling; all faces long faces. He could not recognize anyb ody as Gautam Buddha, as Socrates. He inquired that, \"Is Gautam Buddha here, or Socrates?\""},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"They said, \"We have never heard of these names.\" So he rushed to the station, catched -- caught another train, going to hell. And he was surprised. The hell was really beau tiful! Lush green... and people were so friendly, loving. He inquired a man that, \"Do you know ab out Gautam Buddha or Socrates -- are they here?\" The man said, \"They are here, and because of them the hell has become heaven.\" And at that point he awoke. And he wa s a sincere man. He related the whole dream. He said, \"Forgive me, but the tr uth is that there are no geographical places like heaven and hell; it is a qu estion of man's inner being. Everybody carries his hell or heaven within himself.\" So I told him that, \"Your twelve days, you were trying to give me hell, not knowing that I have my heaven within myself.\" There is no way to throw me to hell. Q: ON THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY TO TH E TENTH THE POPE IS COMING TO INDIA. HOW DO YOU LOOK AT HIM, AND WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF HOW THE POPE STANDS TODAY? A: First, anybody representing somebody else is a carbon copy. He is not authentic, and he is not original. His auth ority is not in his own experience but in the books he has read, in the Bible. So the first thing: a man like pope has a pe rsonality, but he has no individuality. He is an actor, pretending to be someone who he is not. First, religion cannot be transferred; it is not a thing. So Jesus cannot transfer it to anybody. He cannot make anybody his successor. For two thousand years all these popes are deceiving the whole world, and they pretend that they are infallible. Obviou sly if they represent God and they represent the only son of God, Jesus Chri st, they are bound to be infallible. But their whole history shows just the opposite. For example, one pope declared Joan of Arc as evil, and burned her alive. But Joan of Arc was a woman of tremendous co urage, sincerity, and the whole nation loved her, so slowly the people became susp icious of the act of the pope. In three hundred years the situation became very worse. People started thinking of Joan of Arc as right and pope as wrong. Now, the only way was to somehow fix things rightly. Another pope -- the first pope was infallible who burned the woman as representing devil. The second pope, after three hundred years, pulled the bones of the woman from the grave and declare d that she was a saint -- because they were losing so many catholics on that point. Now, what kind of infallibility is thi s? Who is infallible? Was the first pope infallible or this pope is infallible who is declaring Joan of Arc that she was a saint and he worshipped her -- bones."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"For two thousand yeas the popes have done so much wrong to the world that no other religion can beat them. Hundreds of wars, thousands of people killed in the name of religion, millions of Jews bein g killed because Jesus was crucified. And the miracle is that Jesus was a Jew. He wa s born a Jew, he lived a Jew, he died a Jew; he had never heard the word \"Christian,\" he had never heard the word \"Christ\" -- because in Hebrew there are no words like \"Christ\" or \"Christian\"; he was called \"messiah.\" That is for \"Christ.\" And in India we are right to call Christians messiah. That is closer to th e original. \"Christ\" and \"Christian\" both are Greek. After three hundred years of Jesus' death when his sayings were translated into Greek he be came \"Jesus the Christ.\" Now, these popes have been killing Jews not knowing that they are worshipping a Jew in every church. And they ha ve not been appointed by Jesus. And as far as Christianity is concerned, to me it is one of the worst religions in the world. There is a book I would like to show you -- five hundred pages of pornography, in the Bible. And this is the word of God. Five hundred pages of worst pornography that has ever existed anywhe re, with all kinds of perversions -- homosexuality, sodomy. And this book is the book of the God; God wrote this book. If God wrote this book, then he is the worst criminal and the best pornographer. I am going to publish an illustrated ve rsion of it, because people reading pornography -- pornography is not for readin g, it is for seeing. So I am going to find the best pornographers and make ev erything in it a beautiful pornographic painting, and publish the whole book. It is strange that five hundred pages but no Christian reads them. I have given this book to one of my friends who is a bishop, and I told him that, \"Can you give a sermon on any of the pages in this book?\" And after one month he told me that, \"I cannot give a sermon on this book.\" But I said, \"This book is simply quoting Bible. You have been cheating the whole world; you have not been making them aware what your Bible contains. You have been choosing only selected passages and talking about.\" But this is the worst thing that any religion has done. Jesus himself to me is not a realized man for the simple reason that he declares that he is the only begotten son of God. That is nonsense. No man of intelligence will declare himself to be the only bego tten son of God. And on what grounds? He has no certificate for it. And everybody knows that he is a carpenter's son, but he goes on insisting that, \"I am the only ....\" And he is very jealous; he will not allow even a second son to God -- very monopolist. He is the only begotten son of God. And very strange. Where is the wife of Go d whom he is begotten, because in the Christian trinity there is no place for a wo man. So it is a very strange thing that God, the holy ghost and Jesus Christ within themselves managed everything without a woman! A man is dispensable as far as the birth of a child is"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"concerned. An injection can do that. But a woman is not dispensable. But just to degrade woman, just to make her inferior they could not accept a woman in the trinity; otherwise what is the need of th e holy ghost? A small family would have been perfect -- God, his wife, son. But th e problem is, if God has a wife then why only one son? Does he practice birth control? This pope is going in India to continue to preach to everybody that birth control is sin; and I want him to remember that God practices birth control. He has given only one son to the world -- and in the whole eternity! The teachings of Jesus does not show th e heights of an enlightened man. His behavior shows just the opposite. For example, he says, \"Love your enemies just as you love yourself.\" But he never teac hes his disciples to love themselves. The whole Christianity is based in hating your self. In fact all the religions more or less are based in hating yourself. Hate this , hate that. You are not to be accepted as you are; many things have to be cut from your life. Sex has to be cut, anger has to be cut. So many things have to be thrown out that I suspect, what will remain? If we listen to all these religions, I don't think that you will remain behind. And a man is an organic unity. You cannot deprive a man of his sexual energy because it is not somethin g like mechanical that you can take apart, away from the machine. It is his biology. He is bo rn in sex, his every cell in the body is sexual. Jesus never teaches people to love them selves. He is teaching to love your enemies just as you love yourself -- but in his behavior he proves to be really idiotic. He is passing from a village and the people are angry and nobody gives them food, and he is very irritated by this; fo r three days they have been hungry. And they come to a fig tree -- and it is not th e season for figs so the tree has no figs. And Jesus curses the tre that, \"You are not welcoming me and my friends with fruits.\" Now, a man who teaches to love your enemie s, curses a fig tree when it is not the season for figs is simply a crackpot! I cannot think of Gautam Buddha doing it; I cannot conceive even an ordinary huma n being with just a little intelligence cursing a tree. Q: THIS BOOK, BHAGWAN -- DO YOU PLAN TO PRESENT THE ILLUSTRATED VERSION BEFORE THE POPE ARRIVES HERE? A: No, because it will take time. It w ill take time because five hundred pages means the illustrated will be one thousand pages with all the passages and the illustrations -- and I want it to be really, really Holy Bible. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Q: BHAGWAN, ABOUT THIS PARTICUL AR JOHN PAUL II. PEOPLE SAY HE HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IMAGE. SO ABOUT HIM WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING? A: He is just an idiot. I was thinking th at people unnecessarily call polacks idiots, but this pope proves that they are -- be cause whatever he has been teaching is against humanity. He is teaching against birth control, against abortion, against the pill because he says children are given by God. So either the God is idiot that he gives children to Ethiopia where one thousand people are dying every day, or he is blind or he is only a computer. And he is going children, pouring on India. By the end of this century India for the first time will be ahead of China. Up to now we have not been ahead of China; by the end of this century we will be one billion people, and we will be for the firs time ahead of China. Out of five people, one will be an Indian in the whole world. People are already poor, people are alread y starving -- one billion people in this country.... I cannot conceive that God gives children to you. I was talking to a bishop. He had come in the jail to give me a Bible, thinking that that will be a solace to me. Out of compassi on he must be thinking that he has to visit and give me a Bible as a present becaus e in jail, what I will be doing? -- read God's word and have faith in Jesus Christ and he will save you. I said, \"You don't be worried about my sa ving; Jesus could not save himself! And as far as your coming here is concerned and your teachings that God gives birth to children: on the one hand you say th at God is omnipotent, all-powerful. He crated the world. What more power yo u can think? This whole universe he created out of nothing. But he is impote nt against a small pill, he cannot destroy the effect of the pill? Why teach people not to use the pill? The pill is the greatest revolution that has happened in the whole history of man because the pill brings woman equal to man, and the pill makes sex free from all kinds of ugly connotations; it becomes simple fun. It loses all seriousness -- children. And then bringing up children and the whole nonsense. And the woman's whole life is wasted in the kitchen and the children; and the husband's whole life is wasted in earn ing money the whole day. And then the woman is collecting anger the whole da y because all her life she cannot do anything else. So she simply becomes a nagging wife. Every wife is a nagging wife, and every husband is henpecked -- without exception. And the reason is simple, be cause you have created the situation. Otherwise, in my commune for four yeas there was not a single child born. And there was nobody forcing. Simple intell igence is needed to be explained to people that if it is God's will he w ill manage somewhere else to produce. There are fifty thousand planets, according to the scientists, where life exists; so if here he finds no vacancy he will find somewhere else. And God is omnipotent;"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"there is no need for popes to go on prea ching, but their preaching has a different meaning: they need poverty, they need more and more poor people in the world, because it is only the poor and the or phan and the beggars and the aboriginals who become Catholics who can be converted. In India I have seen not a single rich man, educated, cultured, who has become converted to Catholicism; there is no re ason. He has a far better religion and far higher flights of spirituality. Why he should become a Catholic and why he should become a Christian? They need poor people so they are crea ting a poor world but they are playing with fire, because these poor people will be dying by the end of this century -- without any nuclear weapons , without even a third wo rld war. These popes and the Mother Teresa and this kind of peop le are going to create as many poor people in the world that the world cannot support. In India, my estimate is that fifty percen t people will die just out of starvation by the end of this century if we do not pr event now. Thirty years before I started teaching birth control, the pill, abor tion, and I was stoned, I was poisoned, attempts on my life were made beca use I was \"creating immortality.\" Q: WHERE WAS IT, SIR? A: In Patna I was stoned, in Poona itself before ten thousand sannyasins and twenty police officers -- because they had got he information that some- thing is going to happen. A knife was thrown at me; and still the court dismissed the case, that, \"There has been no case.\" The knife was there, twenty police offices were there, and it was a police case! Ten thousand witnesses were there -- and still the court dismissed the case. And the magistrate sent me the message from a friend that, \"Just forgive me, I am sorry; I am a small man the pressure is too much. That man has a political standing, and there is great politics involved in it.\" Thirty years before when I started talk ing about these things, India had the population only four hundred million. Today it has eight hundred million. If they had listened to me thirty years before we would not have been eight hundred million now. We could have cut the population. We would have been far comfortable, far more healthier, far more educated in every way. But they did not listen, and they don't listen even now. Even now they will listen to the pope, and even now the Indian government will go to receive the pope. The president will be present there. And this is an insult! The president shou ld make it a condition that, \"If you are coming here, you can be a guest only if you promise not to talk about birth control, the pill, abortion. Don't you have anything else to talk? This is all your religion? Just leave these things; otherwise you will not be received as a guest in India.\" Mother Teresa wants orphans."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"It happened that one American couple wanted to adopt one orphan from Mother Teresa's nursing home.

Somebody else came an d told that, \"Right now there are no orphans so you will have to wait. When we have orphans we will inform you. Your address is here.

And this is the gate, and I have not sen any orphan going out.\" But the problem was he was a protestant -- that created the problem. He was not catholic. And he filled the form as a prot estant Christian; th at's where the whole problem begin. He wrote a letter in \"The Times of India\" explaining the whol e thing, that how MOther Teresa is playing the politics of numbers, turning catholics out of orphans. It is not a work of compa ssion or love; it is sheer politics. I spoke against Mother Teresa, referred to the letter. She wrote me a letter and she said that there must have been some misunderstanding; in fact, because these orphans are brought up by us by us accord ing to catholic religion, to give them to some other religion will create a mental difficulty, a conflict; that's why the person was refused. I wrote to her that, \"If this is the case, th en none of your orphans is a Christian; even they are Hindus or they are Mohammedans. And if you are a sincere woman, then a Mohammedan orphan should be given to a Mohammedan family, and a Hindu orphan should be gi ven to a Hindu family.

You are kidding!\" And then she was very angry because I e xposed again in a public meeting and I challenged her that I am available anyw here if she wants for a discussion I am available. She wrote another letter that, \"I will not discuss with you because that is not our way, to fight in any way, but I will pray for you to my God to forgive you for your sins.\" So I wrote to her that, \"There is no God, and please before you start praying for me you have to have my permission; otherw ise it is great trespass -- not only on the body, on the spirit.

At least in my imagination I was thinking that it is my motherland. Now I will think my motherland has died, because the Indian bureaucracy is creating every hindrance that they can, and it seems they are be ing dictated by the American government. Because one thing they are doing that no foreigners should be allowed to stay with me. Now this is strange for a country like In dia which wants to promote tourism. I can bring thousands of foreigners. But they are not giving visas to foreigner if they say they are going to see me, or if th ey come in orange cl othes -- they are not allowed.

Something said in Hindi. Q: BHAGWAN, IS YOUR EXPERIEN CE SHOWS THAT THE MESSAGE OF SAGES AND ENLIGHTENED PERSONS IS INVARIABLY MISCONSTRUED OR IGNORED. DOES IT MEAN THAT MANKIND IS DESTINED TO SUFFER PERPETUALLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN FOLLIES? A: I am not a pessimistic. I hope even agai nst hope. And this is something of that kind. The man of understanding, enlightenment has enormous difficulties. First his experience happens in a thoughtless state of mind. So when he tries to convey it to people, invariably he has to use words. Out of hundred enlightened people almost ninety-nine have remained silent for the simple reason because the moment you put a wordless experience into words something essential is lost. The difference is such as if you see a beau tiful bird on the wing in the open sky. It is so beautiful, the freedom, the space, the infinity... and then you catch the bird, put it into a golden cage, very prec ious... in a way it is the same bird, but truly it is not the same bird. Where is its sky and where are its wings an d where is its freedom? All is lost. It's infinity is gone. Now he is almost dead. The same happens with the enlightened pe rson. He experiences something at the very climax of consciousness where no word, no thought, can ever enter. From those sunlight peaks of the Himalayas he has to bring his experience to the dark"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"valleys where light has never penetrated . So the moment he speaks, something very essential is lost at that very time. The first fall has begun, the first misunderstanding has started. And it start s with the enlightened man himself, it is not to be dumped on the common man. When that word reaches to the ordinary people who are full of all kinds of conditionings, they cannot understand it in the same way the enlightened person means it. It is not their fault, they are not to be punished for it, they have to be pitied. They have never known anything like that. It is just like if you talk to a small child about a sexual orgasm -- you can talk about it -- but the small child will not understand anything what you are talking, you are simply talking nonsense. And if the small child sees you making love to your wife, he will think you are killing his mother. More than that he cannot understand. Yo u are having one of the most beautiful experience of your life and your child thinks you are killing your mother. You are fighting... at the most according to his state of mind he can think you are fighting. The similar is the state when the wo rd of the awakened reaches to the unawakened -- it changes its whole co lor. Because the unawakened hears it through his own conditionings. And this kind of experience has never happened to him, hence the misunderstanding. But even if misunderstood, it still has some flavor, some beauty, some grandeur that ordinary people become devoted to it, dedicated to it but their devotion and dedi cation is bound to be exploited. Not by the enlightened man but by a new kind of person, the priest and his whole race, the priesthood. They become mediators. They are scholars, they are men of words, they pretend to interpret the enlightened person to those who cannot understand. And they become the greatest barrier. And up to now this has been the case and I don't think it is going to ch ange. This is going to remain unless we make enlightenment something of a wide r experience -- nothing special... that few people reach only to the Gourishankar and everybody else believes that gourishankar exists because Edmund Hillary says so. Unless we can make it so widespread that no priest can deceive you. And this is one of my basic works: to make meditation as simple that anybody who is interested in being silent, anybody who is interested in being at ease, at home, peaceful. Anybody who wants to sleep a dreamless sleep.... I am not talking about God because then it becomes a very special thing. I am not talking about paradise, then it becomes a special quest. I am not talking about reincarnation. I am talking about things in which it is difficult to find a man who is not interested -- silence, peace, love, compassion, joy. And I am trying to connect meditation with these things rat her than with a god which nobody has seen, with a paradise which is beyond de ath, with reincarnation which may be just a hypothesis, and with all kinds of jargon all the religions have produced.

He may not be interested in God but he is bound to be interested in a certain well-being that comes out of his own innermost core. And meditation is only a way to reach to that innermost core. And I have found there are one hund red twelve methods of meditation exhaustive... you cannot add anything more to it, the science is complete. But in those one hundred twelve methods of medi tation I have found a running thread -- just as in a garland hidden behind th e flowers there is a running thread. You see the flowers, you see the garland but yo u don't see the thread which is really holding the flowers and making the garland. Those one hundred twelve methods have a running thread of meditation and that is very simple. The simplest man can do that. A child who can understand language can do it. The man who is on his deathbed, even in his last moments can do it and can transform himself. So the only possible way that I can see is: make meditation simple, make it associated with things which normal human beings aspire for. Don't unnecessarily make it complicated, religious , theological, philosophical -- let it be purely a scientific technique. It is just like you don't understand how electricity works but you know the switch. You don't know the inner working of the electricity. For that you need to study, you need to go to a university to understand and even people like Albert Einstein are reported to have said that, \"I do not know how actually electricity works and I don't know certainly what it is.\" But we know the actual application of it. Certainly meditation is far more subtle than electricity. All that human beings need to know is the simple application of it. And I have not come in my life across a single person who is not interested in things I have told to you. He may be afraid of the word meditation but he is not afraid of silence, he is not afraid of peace, he is not afraid of lo ve, he is not afraid of being full of joy, he is not afraid of knowing himself.... Once you connect these human aspirations wi th the science of meditation there is a hope that the humanity may not be destin ed to remain always in ignorance and there is a possibility that the enlightened person's statements can be understood. But they can be understood only if you ha ve some kind of experience to connect. Buddha failed, Mahavira failed -- the reason was simple. They had the experience -- as far as they themselves are concerned, they have succeeded; but they failed to convey the experience to other people because they were not aware that the common man is not interested in finding out the mystery of existence. He is so burdened with his life, there is no time for him to search for the mystery of life. And what he is going to do ev en if he finds the mystery of life? You cannot eat it, you cannot make a house out of it. They were talking from their heights withou t taking note that people who are in the darker valleys know a different language."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"It has been said that `if you are thirsty, you have to go to the well, the well cannot come to you.' In a certain sense it is true . But as far as spirituality is concerned I want to say it emphatically that `the thirsty cannot go to the well.' In the first place he is not aware that he is thirsty, he is not aware of what he is thirsty because he has never tasted wate r. He is not aware that there are wells available where his thirst can be quenched. So against the ancient proverb, I say to you that `the well has to go to the thirsty.' There is no other way. And the way for the well to go to the thirsty is to understand the ordinary man's conditioning, his aspirations and somehow join his aspirations with something which can take him out of his darkness. It is a difficult task; perhaps the most diffi cult task. But it is a great challenge too. I have been talking to ordinary people my whole life and I know how it is difficult to manage some kind of co mmunication, but I can say with great humility that I have been able to succ eed in reaching thousands of hearts. And if it is possible for me, it is possible for all. Because this is one of my basic dictums that whatever possible for one human being is possible for all human beings. Your so-called old founders of religions ha ve done a very basic mistake that they all claim they are special. Jesus is born out of a virgin Mary. You are not born out of a virgin mother, and if you were born you would be a bastard, not a Jesus Christ. His followers have created hundreds of stories which are all bogus: that he walked on waters, that he cured people of their diseases by ju st laying his hands on them -- not only that, he raised a dead man back to life. All these stories... if true, then just think of a simple thing: if all these stories are true then the contemporaries of Jesus have never noted them. Not a single Jewish book notes, and such miraculous acts! On the contrary, this is the reward that they crucify Jesus. I cannot think that a man who raises people from death can be crucified in any country, in any century! The truth is that all these stories are invented. But the followers have to invent these stories to make Jesus as far away from you as possible. Hindus say their Krishna, Rama and other autaras, are God's incarnations on the earth. You are not God's incarnation, Kris hna is. Naturally if Krishna attains to ultimate enlightenment, there is nothing to be surprised, he is already the perfect incarnation of God. You are just a small creature. The English word for `man' means mud. `Human' comes from humus. The Arabic word for `man' -- admi -- also means mud. You are just mud. There is unbridgeab le gap between you and your prophets and your founders of religions. Buddha is born while his mother is stan ding. No woman has ever given birth to a child standing, but it is not difficult -- perhaps she was a kind of some gymnastic. More puzzling is that Buddha is born also standing. Still more puzzling she(sic) walks seven steps -- this is the first act that he does on the earth."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"And after seven steps he declares to the whole world that \"I am the most enlightened being who has ever been on the earth or who will ever be on the earth.\" Now all this nonsense... the child is not ev en seven minutes old. He is walking, he is talking, he is declaring! The whole idea and the desire of all th e religions has been to separate their founders from the humanity, to create respect, to create worship, to create devotion. But all that respect, worship and devotion is nothing but spiritual slavery. If all these people have insisted that they are as human beings as you are and whatever they have attained is your pote ntiality, and there is no bridge between you and them because there is no gap -- the difference is only between the bud and the flower. What difference it is? In fact, the bud is in a better position, the flower by the evening will be gone. The bud has life ahead, the bud has future; the flower has blossomed, it has only pa ssed, it has released its fragrance, now the petals will fall down and the flower will disappear... the bud is still going to remain, its treasure is still to be unburdened. The difference is the same as in the risi ng sun and the setting sun. A Buddha is a setting sun -- beautiful, glorious, so many colors... but remember he is a setting sun, he has reached to his ultimate potentiality. You are a rising sun with all the potentiality in front of you, with the whole sky to travel, with all the colors to spread, with all the experience to go through. If all these religious people have insisted only on one point: that there is no difference basically between them and you, humanity would have been in a totally different state of a tremendous co nsciousness, awareness, alertness, and of a great self-respect. They denied self-r espect, they destroyed humanity, they forced you to be just cr eatures, humus, mud.... My effort is totally different. That's wh y I am condemned all over the world by everybody. I take it as a compliment because sooner or later there will be people who will recognize what I am doing. It takes time. Perhaps I may not be here when I am recognized, but I know that it is going to happen because what I am saying is absolu te truth: that there is no difference between Gautam Buddha and you. The only difference is you are asleep and he is awake. What kind of difference is that? The person who is asleep can be awake any moment. He has the potentiality to be awake, otherwise he cannot be asleep. A dead person is not asleep because he cannot be awake. Sleep and being awake are two sides of the same coin. That's why I go on insisting that I am not special, that I am not any incarnation of God, that I am not a prophet, that I am not a messiah, that I am simply a human being just like you. The only difference... which is not much of a difference, is: that I have opened my eyes and you are keeping them closed. And I am trying in every way to shake you, to hit you from this side, from that side, hoping that perhaps you may open"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"your eyes. And once you open your eyes you will see there has never been any difference. There is every hope of an en lightened humanity, but the work has to be on the lines I am saying, not on the lines Mohammedans, Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas, Christians, Jews have been following. On that way humanity is destined to remain in darkness. Just look Jesus' whole life. It is not lo ng, he was crucified when he was thirty- three and his life as a teacher was only th ree years. When he was thirty he started teaching. In three years he is teaching continuously only one thing: that he should be accepted as the only begotte n son of God, that a special messenger, that a prophet, that whatever he is saying he is not saying, it is God's word. Three years continuously his whole effort is to prove that he is special. He seems to be a megalomaniac. There are far more beautiful th ings to teach, and this way it is not going to help anybody... it did not help even him! It led him to the crucifixion. But these people were bound to be misunderstood because they created a distance between themselves and humanity -- too much. It s eems to be some kind of a spiritual ego. Destroy that distance. Let your Buddhas and your Mahaviras and your prophets and messiahs mix in the crowd, be part of ordinary humanity. And there is tremendous beauty in being just ordinary. It is so relaxing. Because to be special is a tension, a constant tension that you have to keep up to the standard you are proposing to the world. For example, Mahavira lived naked. Now this is stupid. Whole year round: it was hot and he was naked, it was cold an d he was naked... just to prove that he is special, that neither Krishna no r Ram nor Buddha nor anybody else has reached to the height that he has reached -- they are still dependent on clothes; he has attained absolute independence. He will not brush his teeth because that is an effort to beautify the body. He will not take a bath because that is you are still materialistic. He was stinking! In a part of India like Bihar, which is full of dust and he was perspiring and dust, no bath, no mouthwash... but he is provin g something. He must have lived in an immense tension. Not only that he was stinking to you, he must have been stinking to himself. Anybody who tries to be special has to ke ep certain tensions. Only an ordinary man can relax because there is nothing to fear. All these people who have founded your re ligions are not authentically spiritual. It is a new kind of politics, it is a n ew kind of power -- they have discovered how to rule over masses without being on the throne, without taking any responsibility for them. And small things.... I was passing through a village and people told me that, \"You must see a man in our town who attracts thousands of people every day because for twelve years he has been standing.\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"I said, \"But what spiritual quality one can attain by just standing? He should be mad, you should send him to some ment al asylum. And what is the need of thousands of people to come and worshi p him?\" But I was passing from the road anyway so I stopped and went to see the man and I had tears in my eyes. That man's legs have become what happens in a certain disease called elephantiasis -- when your legs become too fat and your whole body shrinks. (Tape side B) Even if he wanted to sit, he could no t. And for twelve years the methodology that he was using... because it is not easy to stand for twelve years... he was handing on a wooden rod with his hands so that he cannot fall, even if he falls asleep. And around him continuously peop le were chanting, supporting so that he does not fall. And I looked at the man's face -- no sign of intelligence. I looked at his eyes -- just empty, dead, they co uld have been of stones. What he has gained? He has gained tremendous po wer -- thousands of followers pouring their money in his feet every day from the morning till late in the night, the procession continued. This is a special politics, and this polit ics has created a gap -- I want to destroy the gap. I want you to walk hand in hand with Buddha and then there is no reason... because sometimes what cannot be said through words can be said just by holding your hand. Sometimes what cannot be said by any language can be just said sitting silently by your side, or by a hug. Language is not the only way of expression. For example, I was in the American jail and every jailer fell in love with me. The first jailer fell in love with me so much that he allowed a press conference in the jail which was never done. He risked... he said, \"Nothing to be worried. I am going to be retire in a year or two, at the most they can throw me out now. But I am going to make a precedent.\" A big press conference he arranged in the jail. He brought me there. I told him, that \"Now you will have to do one thing more. You will have to remove these handcuffs because with handcuffs I cannot speak because half of my speech is with my ge stures. I will not be able to find words.\" And he understood, he said, \"That is true. When we are listening to you we are also listening to your hands, they are also saying something, they are also indicating something, they are also emphasizing something.\" So they are substituting what is missing in language. What cannot be said by hands can be said by eyes. But keeping this distance is sheer egoistic. I know it is a difficult task but it is a great challenge too. And for my sannyasins, this is going to be the work. Never for a single moment think yourself special, extraordinary. The common masses and we, are not sepa rate. They may think we are separate but how can we think we are separate?"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"They may think to keep a distance bu t how can we allow the distance, we want to come closer to their heart. What has happened in the past has to be forgotten. And past is not all, there is eternity available. So everything impossible can be made possible. Okay. Q: BHAGWAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING TO THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN YOU ONLY THROUGH NEWSPAPERS AND NEVER CARE TO READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SAID. WHAT IS YOUR BASIC MESSAGE FOR THEM? My basic message to all the people is: al ways remember that if you are really a seeker of truth, then go to the source. It is not right just to depend on th e news media. The news media has its own limitations. First: it cannot give my whol e message, it has no space for it. Second: if it tries to give my whole message it will not find audience for it. The whole news media looks at the audi ence, follows the audience what you need, what you like... it is a very strange thing but one never thinks about it, that your leaders are followers of their own followers. They always look what the followers like -- that has to be said. Do whatever you want to do but say only that which your followers want to listen. And the same is the case with the newspapers, television, radio. Say what the people are asking for. And people are asking for wrong things. They are asking for sex, pornography. Th ey are asking for violence. They are asking for all kinds of sensations. They are not interested in the higher values of life for the simple reason because for centuries your religious people have repressed their lower instincts so much that now their lo wer instincts have immense power and those lower instinct s demand some kind of fulfillment. You have been told to murder is wrong, so naturally you cannot murder. But seeing in a film a murder scene you ca n see the change in yourself. You may have been sitting relaxedly with your back to the chair -- as the murder scene comes you become more alert, you leave the back of the chair, you come closer to the murder, you don't want to miss a single thing, you are identifying yourself in that scene. This is what your religious people have done to you. Your films are full of violence, full of sex, full of murder, rape, suicide... these are your demands. And the people who are producing those films or magazines or newspapers are just businessmen. I myse lf have been once a journalist but I could not go more than few weeks. The owner called me, he said, \"You should have born in SATYUG.\" I said, \"What has happened?\" He said, \"You will destroy my paper. You have already reduced my readership to half.\""},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"I said, \"It does not matter if your paper is finished, that is not the point. But right things should reach to people.\" But he said, \"They don't want the righ t thing, and I am not here for charity purposes. I am a businessman and I am in a trouble because we have made a contract for one year. In one year you will make me bankrupt!\" Because I changed all politicians to the last page, I reduced their speeche s to small articles not covering the whole first page, I remove d their pictures, there is no need for their pictures every day to be insisted on people's mind. Because there are so many beautiful people and the world knows nothing about them. I would like a big picture of Ravi Shanka r playing on his sit ar on the front page. People should know.... I would like some sculptor, some poet... the first page should be for the creators. And I reduced completely all news abou t suicide and murder, violence... and I said, that \"It helps nobody. It really crea tes an atmosphere th at violence is the way of life, everywhere it is happening , every newspaper is talking about it, everywhere there is rape. So why you are lagging behind, you also have a woman in your mind that you would like to rape. When everybody is doing it, then why not join?\" I told him a story: two men are going to th e market and one says, that \"There is a riot between Mohammedans and Hindus and the Hindus are destroying the mosque. And as Hindus we should go and help.\" The other man said, that \"That does not s eem to be a right thing. The mosque has done no harm to us and even Mohammedans who go to the mosque simply pray there. That is the only place where they are prayerful and you are destroying it! That is illogical.\" Next day the man who was persuading that \"We should go and destroy the mosque\" was surprised. The first man was destroying it. He asked, \"What has happened?\" He said, \"When I saw everybody is doing it then it must be right.\" When you read every day from every corne r: the radio is saying the same thing, the television is saying the same thing, the newspaper is saying the same thing, the films are saying the same thing... yo u are surrounded by a very subtle mind atmosphere in which you are going to be drowned. I told my owner, that \"I have been publis hing because there are good things also happening in the world. It is not that everybody is raping, it is not that everybody is committing suicide, there are people who are doing some good work, beautifying life, helping people and I am trying to find those people and their work.\" Just that day I had published an article on Baba Amtay(*). Very few people know about the man that he has devoted his whole life to the lepers, he has made a beautiful place fo r the lepers in Maharashtra. Thousands of lepers and he has proved it wrong that just by remaining in touch with lepers"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"you will be infected. He lives with them , his wife lives with them, his children live with them and they all serve them and he has made all those thousands of lepers again human beings because they are all producing something. If their hands cannot do, then their feet can do something. If their feet cannot do, their hands can do something. Not a single le per is unproductive. And he has given them dignity. Otherwise they were thro wn out of their towns, they were not allowed in the towns, nobody was ready ev en to talk to them, nobody was ready to give them any work. Now this man should be talked.... There may be many people who may be come Baba Amtay(*). There may be many people who may be lepers somewh ere suffering, may go to his beautiful place. He calls it `Anandvan'(*) -- the fore st of bliss. And it is a beautiful forest and something worth seeing, that how people which have been for centuries condemned can be raised back to dignity, to self-respect... now they are earning their own food, their own clothes and they are not dependent on anybody. You will be surprised that Baba Amtay's(*) colony donates to many charitable institutions. And when I used to go to his colony the people were so happy that we can help other people who are helpless just as we were helpless some day. \"So let your circulation drop. I know that Baba Amtay(*) will not increase your circulation... Ravi Shankar will not incr ease your circulation. But don't be worried, I will not be heavy on you. I ca n force to remain for one year here to finish your firm, but I will not be heavy on you, I can understand you. So I can withdraw myself. You raise your circulation.\" So they have limitations. So the people who are interested... at the most what news media can do is to create curiosity, interest. From there you have to go to the deeper sources: to my books, to my ta pes, to my videos. If you think that just the newspaper's information is enou gh then you will be misguided. So this is my message to the man aroun d: that from the newspapers and other news media take the hint.... Now almost all over the world every newspaper is talking about me, every radio, every te levision. There are few who have the intelligence and courage to represent me rightly, even risking their jobs. There are few who are intelligent enough but don' t have courage, they cannot risk their jobs but they can at least be factual. They need not distort. But the majority will be there which will tr y to distort everything so it becomes sensational. It will take things out of context to make it sensational. But there is no problem just the people ha ve to understand their limitations. And they have to take the hint that if the whole world media is interested in this man... they may be making famous or noto rious, they may be condemning me or praising me -- does not matter. What matte rs is that the whol e world news media is interested in this man, it is wo rth searching a little bit on your own. You will not be at a loss. Q: BHAGWAN, NEWSPAPERS ARE MISGUIDING THE LOCAL PEOPLE THAT PRESENCE OF YOUR SANNYAS INS WILL POLLUTE THE VALLEY OF"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"GODS. BHAGWAN, CAN WE, THE PE OPLE OF MADHYA PRADESH, BE HELPFUL IN YOUR WORK, AND HOW? PLEASE GUIDE US. A: First, what do you have to call it a valley of gods? It is one of the poorest part of the countr y. In fact, people are surprised that why you call it valley of gods. Once it was, once it can again be. And what those people are telling to the masses that my people will pollute it. Ask them \"What do they mean?\" Because my people are the cleanest people you can find. My people don't use any drugs. My people are vegetarian. My people are meditative, loving, rejoicing, singing, dancing -- they can make it really the valley of gods. I can accept the challenge because my experience of two communes: one I had made in Poona, ten thousand sannyasins were living there. And the trouble with the people surrounding the commune wa s jealousy, because they were really living like gods. I don't believe in poverty, I am absolute ly against it, it can be destroyed very easily. It is being protecte d by vested interests: the politicians and the religious leaders. Ten thousand people were living self-sufficiently, meditating, dancing, loving and rejoicing and that was creating in th e local population a tremendous jealousy that \"What is happening to these peop le, why it is not happening to us?\" That was the cause of their being against. The same happened in America. I was thin king India is a poor country, my commune is rich because richness is a ve ry simple thing: a little understanding and poverty disappears. But perhaps it is just an island and around is the ocean of poverty and naturally it creates jealousy that they are not being able to live a life of joy. It becomes anger, it becomes violence. I thought perhaps America will not react in the same way, but strange to say, the human mind is the same. It does not make any difference between the Indian or the American. In America in four years we changed a desert into an oasis, we made a dream come true. Perhaps that is the only time communism has existed in the world -- those four years. Because we stopped the circulation of money in the commune; money cannot be used inside the commune. So you may have millions of dollars and I may not have a single dollar but that does not make you rich, and that does not make me poor. Money cannot be used in side the commune. You can donate to the commune but you cannot purchase an ything inside the commune. Whatever you need, commune will supply. In four years' time there was no crime, no rape, no murder, no suicide, no violence and American politicians became afraid because news media started coming, that what we have done? That desert was lying there for fifty years. Nobody was buying it, what you will do with a desert? And it was not a small piece of land, it was eighty-four thousa nd acres. We purc hased the land, the politicians of Oregon laughed, the neig hbors laughed that we are fools, we don't"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"know anything... what we are going to do with this land, nothing can be produced in it. But we managed to make lakes, collect rainwater, big dams collect rainwater, made houses for five thousand sannyas ins; and we did everything by our own hand. We did not take any support from any American. Nobody from outside the commune was asked. We made our roads and we turned the valley in a beautiful oasis. The people who had known it before and came to see it could not believe. And our people were meditating in the mornin g then listening to me then going to work, then eating together because we had only one kitchen for five thousand people. And when there were festivals we had one kitchen for twenty thousand people. And it was a joy to eat with t wenty thousand people. And somebody is playing a guitar and somebody is dancing. And it was not an ordinary thing: that you are eating and people are dancing aro und you or somebody is playing. And people are so happy. In the evening when the work was finish ed they had still enough energy to sing and to dance, they have their singing and dancing places. It became a rumor that perhaps they are hypnotized, otherwise how people can be so happy?... continuously. You can be forgiven once in a while if you smile, but if you smile the whole day then you cannot be forgiven, something is wrong! To be healthy twenty-four hours is not acceptable. Sadness is acceptable, long faces are a cceptable. People annoyed with existence, complaining, grumpy -- they are acceptable. But people dancing are not acceptable. Something has gone wrong with these people. For the simple reason because they are in minority and you are in majority. The miserable majority de stroyed the blissful minority. These experiences help me to make it a point that the local people, wherever I make a commune, should be involved in it. The commune should not be anymore a separate thing, it should be part of the local people. It will be difficult because those local people will bring all their conditionings, they have to be cleansed of their conditionings, but that seems to be the only way. Otherwise sooner or later the distance will be so much that they will be angry, that it is their land and you are so happy and we are not! I would love local people to be involved. The problem is people who have nothing, even they are not ready to become part of a commune because the commune means a total change of your attitudes. For example, you have a family. Commune is not a family. Otherw ise for five thousand people we will have twenty-five hundred kitchens, twenty-five hundred women wasting their life in kitchens. This is sheer wastage of human energy! Just one kitchen with fifteen people managing it was enough; there was no need.... With the local people these are the pr oblems: they will cling to the family. A commune is a loosening that you lose th e grip of the family. The children were taken care of by the commune -- they ha ve their own hostel, and it was a great"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"experience to see because I had made it clear that bigger children should take care of small children. There will be a supervisor but children should be responsible, they should not be just irresp onsible, that they have to be taken care of, that's all. They have to take care of smaller children and they will be taken care of by bigger children. And it worked out... I was not thinking th at it will work out with children. They immensely enjoyed it, taking care of sm all children. Rather than playing with toys and marrying toys, they started dive rting their energy and taking care of small children. And because they were taking care of small children, they became responsible, mature, protective, and th e fights that are natural, disappeared. They were allowed to go to their parents. The parents were allowed to go there but the responsibility of the children was the commune. (Tape side C; no overlap) The responsibility of the children was not the parents. The parents are not going to decide that the child will become an engineer, it will be the psychological department of the commune which will de cide what are the potentials of the child and what he should be taught. The child may have a potential of becoming a great dancer and you are sending him to become an engineer. He will remain unhappy his whole life because he could not become what he was naturally meant to become, and what he has become will simply create misery. Any commune that I am going to start anywhere is now going to take local people in, whoever wants to come in just they have to be a little courageous to drop their clingings, to drop their old ha bits and ideas. For example, in America two hundred street people joined the co mmune. People think America is rich but there are thirty million beggars and it is absolute bogus publicity. And these beggars are starving on streets, they don't have any home, they don't have clothes, they don't have food. Two hu ndred beggars came, we accepted them, we made our conditions clear to them becaus e you have been brou ght up in crime -- they all have been to jails, they all ha ve committed all kinds of things, they all have been taking drugs, alcohol... it was made clear to them that there will be no need for alcohol, there will be no need for drugs. We have a better drug, just you have to give us a little time: just if you can control yourself for three weeks the medi tation will work and you will not need any drug. And they remained for four years and they were accustomed, confirmed criminals but they did not commit any cr ime; on the contrary, they were so happy because for the first time a commune, a community has accepted them as human beings. Otherwise they were simply thought to be dogs. Nobody cared about them that they are human beings. In fact, they used to commit crime just to go to jail because at least there is home, at least they provide you clothes, food, cigarettes, medicine, and no work. So wh y die starving on the street, just commit a small crime and go to the jail. When I was in jail I asked people, \"How many times you have been here?\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"They said, \"Who counts? Because each time we are released, within a week we are back. Because what we will do outside? We don't have a home, nobody to take care of, nobody who is waiting for us. And we are treated like inhuman beings. Here at least our necessities are gi ven to us, a doctor checks us, medicines are given to us, television is available to see, cards are allowed -- you can play, cigarettes are free -- you can smoke as many as you want, clothes are there... what else one needs? And a beautiful community of four or five hundred inmates who are old friends, meeting in one jail, in another jail.\" So, but I would like to start a commune this time with a new framework involving local people in it so that other local people can see a link and the commune does not become a separate island. And I love this place and I would like to ma ke it really a valley of gods but your local people are in absolute support with me. Your Panchayat(*) heads have come to me to invite that I should remain here, the bar association has come that I should remain here, other associations have invited me to remain here. But their invitation does not mean much, if the central government does not want me to be here... then I cannot do anything because the whole thing depends on the central government and they are under American pressure. I have in America... in America there are in ternational, private security agencies. I have the best international security agen cy working for me to inform me about all the secrets that is going on in gove rnments against me or for me. Now from America I have received the information that India is finished for you because Indian politicians are under too much pr essure by the American politicians. And if you don't believe us you can try to check their confidential file. And one of the friends who had the approa ch managed to check the file and they were right. The American government is tryi ng to tell them th at I should not be directly attacked because that becomes a difficult matter to arrange... they have seen, they attacked me directly and they have seen how they became a target of world news media and lost immense prestige . \"Don't attack me directly,\" that is their suggestion, \"but don't allow foreigners to be here...\" so that I cannot work. Because I have trained my four thousand, five thousand people for every work -- I will need them if I want to create a commune here because they will work without any pay and they will work twelve to fourteen hours; it will be their work of love. And they are geniuses in th eir work: engineers, doctors, professors, psychologists. We had our own hospital , we had our own university, we had our own psychological therapy department. We had everything that we needed. We had our farmers who know how to use mo dern technology -- latest. We had our own scientists -- if anything we want to create, they were ready to create. For example, we needed tents for winter becaus e for winter tents have never existed. They managed to make tents for winter. The American government, rather than rewarding them, imposed a fine on us and not a small fine -- one and half cror e rupees fine that we have made those tents without permission."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Now tents don't need any permission bu t they managed, manipulated the law and they said, that \"They are not tents be cause they can be used in winter, they are permanent structures.\" I asked the government, the attorney-gene ral, to \"Come before you declare your fine otherwise you will look a fool. Just come and see, they are tents, they are not permanent structures! Although our scien tists have made them in such a way they can be heated, they can be aircon ditioned, they have a separate bathroom; but they are not permanent structures.\" But without listening he imposed the fine. I told my people, \"Y ou just go to the court, no argument is needed, you simply take a tent... unfold the bag, put the tent inside the court -- because it take s only ten minutes to fix it. Tell the magistrate to come and have a look. And within ten minutes unfold it, put it back, bag, into the bag. And ask him, `C an a permanent structure be made in ten minutes? And can be packaged back in ten minutes?'\" The magistrate simply laughed. He said, \"There is no case, this is a tent.\" And I told publicly to the attorney-gene ral of Oregon, that \"You should jump into the ocean and commit suicide. Imposing such a big fine without even seeing the thing, only a very stupid person can do that.\" So now the American government pressure on Indian government is that `I should not be attacked directly but I shou ld not be allowed my trained people to live with me, so the whole work can be destroyed.' So the question is: if your state governme nt, particularly your chief minister as I understand him seems to be a man of co urage and intelligence, if he has really guts, then he should not bo ther about the central government because it is not against the security of the country. It is not a question of ce ntral government at all. He should not wait for their green signal. That's what he has said, and the message has come to me, that \"I am waiting for their green signal.\" That will never come because they are waiting for a green signal from Washington. It is not going to come. And I cannot wait too long. My people are looking around the world and we have found beautiful places, in fact tw o South American countries have invited me to make the commune in their countries. So I have sent my people to see what is the situation there and what w ill be there conditions because I will not work under any conditions. And we are trying to locate... there are islands, independent islands. Most probably that seems to be the best thing, not to be bothered with politicians or anybody. But I love this place and I wanted really to make it a valley of gods. It is upon the local people to press your chie f minister. I am his guest, he should come here, he is my host. And if So uth American governments can invite me with my whole commune, and they are read y to give land without any price and every support, then I can expect something better in my own country. So it is a question of the local people. They should give the green flag for which he is waiting. A green flag procession fo r the chief minister. Because it is not a"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"security question, it is not a defence question, the central government has nothing to do with it. He has to decide it and if he cannot decide it then he should drop the idea that he has guts and he should remember that type of people don't stay long in politics. He sh ould show his mettle. Why he should be afraid? And his people are with me. But th e central government is working in its own way. I was in jail. It was natural that the In dian governments should have asked the American government that without any arrest warrant they have arrested me. They arrested me at twelve points of loaded guns and I asked them, \"Where is the arrest warrant?\" They had none. I asked them, \"You can simply verbally say to me, `what is my crime.'\" They said, \"We don't know.\" I said, \"If you don't know then let me contact my attorney.\" They won't allow that eithe r. And in the middle of the night, on an empty airport there was no other way. They won't allo w even a phone call to the attorney which is a legal right of every person an d particularly in such a situation when you are not providing any arrest warrant and you are putting me in chains, handcuffs, my legs in chains, my waist in chains, and you have nothing, no reason. And you talk of democrac y and freedom and all nonsense. For three days it was in the court, Nort h Carolina. They could not prove a single point against me. They released the six people who were with me on the plane because they could not prove anything. The U.S. attorney-general himself said in his concluding remarks that \"We have no t been able to prove anything. Neither they have been able to prove anything.\" I simply laughed at the point because innocence needs nothing to be proved. \"You have arrested me, you have to prove on what guilt, on what crime you have arrested me. My attorneys have not to prove anything, they have simply to disprove you and they have disproved you. And the simple fact is that six people with me are released. But why you are no t releasing me? And you are saying that you have not been able to prove anything.\" Still they said that \"We cannot release yo u to the magistrate.\" The reason of not releasing me on bail was, not that I have committed any crime which is unbailable -- I am a dangerous man. I said, \"This is strange, you have not proved. I have never been dangerous to anybody. I have not harmed anybody, I have not killed anybody. I am a vegetarian, what do you mean by dang erous? I am a dangerous man and I have tremendous amount of money available to me so even if you put me on a bail like ten million dollars I will not bother and I can leave the country, and I have thousands of devoted lovers and friends who can do anything for me.\" \"That's why we cannot allow.\" I said to my attorneys, that \"This proves the impotency of the greatest power of the world against a single man that th ey cannot prevent me from leaving the country.\""},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"But their reasoning was just on the surfac e, that's how things, politicians work. The magistrate was a woman and she was go ing to be promoted as a judge and they threatened her. My own jailer told me , that \"She has been threatened that if you releases me on bail then she shou ld forget about being a federal judge forever.\" So that was the reason that I was not rele ased and why they wanted me not to be released because from Carolina to Oregon th ere is only eight hours flight. It took me twelve days to reach Oregon. They mo ved me from one jail to another jail to give me as much harassment as they coul d. And when I was wi th them for two, three days they became friendly and th ey understood that something political seems to be behind it. And ultimately, in one jail, they forced me, the U.S. marshall himself who is the highest author ity of law imposing, he asked me that \"My name should be David Washingto n.\" And I had to sign under it. And I will be called David Washington, I will not be called by my name. I asked him, \"What kind of law imposition is this? On your coat is written the department of Justice. Just at least remove the coat for the moment. What justice is this? And what is the purpose of thi s? Do you think me dumb, cannot I see the point that you want me to be in this jail and nobody should know that I am in this jail so you can do anything you want. You can kill me and there will be no record because I never entered in the jail. The question of my being killed in the jail does not arise.\" But I told him, \"Remember, tomorrow morning all TV. stations, radios, newspapers, will have the news that I have changed my name to David Washington under compulsion by U.S. m arshall. There is still time -- you can change your mind, otherwise tomorrow morning....\" He said, \"How you will manage that?\" I said, \"I have already managed it.\" Coming from the airport was a woman with me who was going to be released. I told her, that \"You be there and just listen to the whole conversation and the whole pre ss media is waiting outside. They will not allow me, they will take me from th e back. But when you are released... so whatsoever you hear and whatsoever you think is useful you just tell to the press.\" And the woman did good job. She was waiting far away in a corner, sitting for her release and tomorrow morning it was all over the world that they have forced me to sign under a false name. And immediately, earl y in the morning, they changed me from that jail because it became difficult. The whole media was around the jail. Thousands of cameras, newspaper people asking about David Washington. So they were afraid that either they have to produce David Washington, which they don't have.... And I have signed my own name, signature, in Hindi. So he looked at it and he said, \"Wha t it is? It must be David Washington.\""},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"So the news media was asking that \"We want to see the form of David Washington because Bhagwan's signature are world known. What signature are there?\" So before anything is inquired they re moved me to another jail, immediately. These politicians, bureaucracy, is not wo rking for humanity. They are just power greedy people. So if people of Himachal Pradesh want me to be here I am absolutely willing to be here. But alone I cannot do anything fo r Himachal. They will have to give me permission for at least five thousand people to transform the whole face of Himachal. And in five years time you will see Himachal becoming the topmost tourist attraction in the whole world. So the question is not me, the question is of your state government and its guts. So tell them that \"If you are man enough then I am ready to take the challenge, but then be supportive. If you cannot, then just tell that this is beyond us. So I should not waste my time here, I have other places which I should visit and finalize.\" Anything else? Q: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE MORE CRITICS THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS JOB (INAUDIBLE) MANKIND. WHY IS IT SO? A: Because I have more truths to say to the world than anybody else has ever said before. Socrates had critics but his truth was si mple and one dimensional. My truth is multi-dimensional and it attacks all the conditionings with which everybody has become so much attached. Although they are the causes of your misery, they are like cancer which needs to be operated. And operation is going to be painful but it is going to save your life. Buddha, Mahavir, Lao Tzu, Kabir, Nanak -- th ey all have said some truths, but those truths were not against your whole conditioning. They were simply talking about your spirituality. If I was also talking only about spirituali ty there would have been no criticism -- all praise. But that would not have helped anybody. I am not talking only of the flowers, whic h are beautiful. I am also talking of the roots, which are ugly. And unless you understand the roots you cannot understand the flowers. I am talking about the whole man. Nobody has talked about the whole man. They never talked about your body, they never talked about your mind, they never talked ab out your psychology, biology... they simply talked about devotion to God, faith in the VEDAS -- which was not hurting anybody. In fact they were supporting your conditionings. I cannot do that because in the VEDAS I see most of it is rubbish, not even literature. I cannot say that it is a word of God. I cannot say that Manu is an"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"enlightened man because it is Manu wh o has tortured this country for five thousand years and he is still torturing. I would like Manu Smriti to be burned an d utterly destroyed so no trace is left behind. That hurts. Nobody has talked about your marriage. They all supported it. I am against it because I see what marriage has done to man. It has made him as miserable as possible. It is a artificial institution, it is not natural. It is good if you love a person to live with the person as long as you love. You may love the person your whole life. But it is possible, today yo u feel tremendous love, tomorrow it may not be the same. Then you are stuck -- what you are going to do tomorrow? You are going to pretend that you still love your wife? You are going still to make love to your wife whom you don't love -- this is ugly, inhuman. These people have never talked to real human problems, they have never talked about how many children you should prod uce, they have never bothered about thousand and one things what kind of education should be given to you. Their whole idea was simply to remain a slave to a certain priesthood -- Hindu, Mohammedan, Jaina, Buddhist, and never to doubt anything. I emphasize it: that was their basic teaching, never to doubt anything. And for thousands of years you have not doubted things which are really ugly. For example, Krishna married sixteen thou sand wives. And they were not virgin girls, they were somebody else' wives; they had thei r children, they had their husbands and he simply took those wives away because he was powerful. This man destroyed sixteen thousand families and you never doubted. Mohammed had nine wives -- now this is ugly because men and women are of equal number. If a man has nine wives th en what about the eight men who will remain without wives? They will beco me homosexuals, they will become perverted, they will go to the prostitutes. And Mohammed allowed Mohammedans to have four wives. Now this is absolutely absurd. There are not that proportion. Women are not four times more than men. Just before freedom came to India, Nizam(*) of Hyderabad has five hundred wives, in this century. And nobody doubts. Naturally they were not criticized because you never doubted. My whole teaching is doubt everything unless you find something which is indubitable, which can be accepted as truth, which ca nnot be doubted even if you want to doubt there is no way to doubt it. Naturally I am vulnerable to thousands of criticisms but those criticisms are impotent. Not a single head of any religion ... I have challenged everybody, all the Shankaracharyas, the pope, the Imams, Ayatollah Khomeini, for a public exchange of views. (Tape side D) And I am not saying that it should be amongst my disciples, I am ready to come to Vatican, amongst the Christians. I want to raise questions because I trust that my questions are so clear that even Christians cannot deny it."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"But nobody seems to have guts. They go on criticizing but nobody is ready to confront me. That shows the impotency of their criticism. And I am available. If I have told to the pope publicly that \"If you can convince me, I am ready to become a Catholic. Bu t if I convince you then you have to become a sannyasin. With this condit ion I am ready to enter into any controversy.\" But these people I know that they do n't have anything of their own. All borrowed knowledge which can be criticized very easily. So it is true. Nobody has been criticized so much in the whole history of man as I am being criticized -- I take it as a compliment. That means nobody has said so many truths and so penetrating and so shattering to all hu man ignorance as I have done and I am going to do it my whole life to my last breath. But there are people of intelligence, th ere are one million sannyasins around the world and at least five million people wh o love me and there may be more who are sympathizers but are not courageous enough to declare even that they are sympathizers. So it is not only that I ha ve enemies, nature has a certain way of balancing things. If I have so many enem ies I must be having so many friends, whether they are known or not known does not matter. And if I can divide the whole world into two parts, my enemies and my friends, I will be tremendously happy. My work is done. Because even to change half of the humanity it has never happened. Okay. A JOURNALIST IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAS AN APPOINTMENT TO INTERVIEW BHAGWAN IN THE MORN ING AND EVENING OF THE NEXT DAY, 25TH, SAYS: SO YOU HAVE TWO FRIENDS HERE. A: I know, I know... one of them is a sannyasin. Q: WE ALL WOULD LIKE TO BECOME ONE SIR. A: Tomorrow morning. Q: TOMORROW MORNING. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Last Testament, Vol 5 Chapter #9 Chapter title: None 25 December 1985 am in Kulu/Manali, India [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH DILIP GANGULY, A.F.P. NEWS AGENCY, FRANCE QUESTION: BHAGWAN, YESTERDA Y EVENING YOU SPOKE ABOUT SETTING UP A COMMUNE EITHER IN A COUNTRY OR IN AN ISLAND. WHAT YOU WOULD PREFER, TO HAVE A COUNTRY OR AN ISLAND, AND WHAT IT WILL THE SET UP BE LIKE? A: My way of working is not accordin g to any principle, creed or dogma. I live moment to moment. And this is one of my basic standp oints: that life can be lived only spontaneously. Life cannot be like a railway trains running on the same track, always consistent. Life is bound to be like a mountainous river -- changing ever y moment according to the situation, in response to it. When I had come, at that moment I had no idea even to create a commune, I simply wanted a small group of people to live with me, so that my work can be continued. And I have communes in every country around the world so my word, my teachings, their questions and my answers can continue to reach to them. But being here for one month the situatio n has completely changed. I have never thought that the Indian government will be so much under American pressure. They are not allowing even a small group of people to be with me. They want me to live here but they don't want me to co ntinue my work. And to me my work is my life. Hence I have to change the idea of not having a commune. The second thing... there are countries which are inviting me to have my commune and they are ready to support bu t they don't know me much, neither I know them much. Their reason to invite me is not that they support my way of thinking. Their reason to invite me is because they are anti-American. Now this is not enough for me to create a commune in those countries. And my feeling in these thirty years cont inuously has been that wherever I am, whatever political ideology is followed there or whatever religion dominates there, I am going to be in conflict with the political ideology, with the religious ideology."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Hence my preference is an independent island. There are islands available which have no political domination in any way, from any country. That will be the ideal place for me, to work without being obstructed on each single step. And from that island I can manage all my communes around the world, because the island will not be under any government, we can also prove a very fundamental thing: that we can live without a government. Fundamentally I am an anarchist. Le sser the government the better. No government is the best situation. There have been great anarchist thinkers like Bakunin but they were all working throug h a wrong direction. They were simply thinking that removing the government w ill solve the problem, that is not true. So I don't agree on that point, that removing the government will solve the problem. It will increase the problems. My way to reach to an anarchist state is changing the people, their patterns of thinking, their ways of life -- making them so happy, blissful, silent that crime becomes an impossibility in their being. Th en there is no need for a government. You don't remove the government, the need for the government disappears. It is like you are sick, you need a doctor. Bakunin and other anarchists are saying, \"Remover the doctor and everythin g will be good.\" I cannot agree about that because what will happen to the patien t? Even with the doctor, he is sick; without the doctor he will be in a far worse condition. My approach is: make the sick person healthy so the need for the doctor disappears. In ancient China for thousa nds of years there has been a rule which I support wholeheartedly, that the patient does no t pay the doctor when the doctor cures him; the patient pays the doctor when the patient remains healthy and does not fall sick. If the patient falls sick, doctor loses money -- he will have to supply medicines, he will have to take care of the patient, and whatever he was getting from the patient will not be given to him. This is absolutely sane idea. Otherwise the whole world has lived in such a stupid situation that the doctor is taught to make the patient healthy but the doctor liv es on the patient being sick. This is a contradiction. The profession is basically contradictory. If nobody is sick, all the doctors will die. They need sick people, they need epidemics so that they can cure people and they can earn money. This is not only the situation about do ctor/patient relationship, this is the situation about so many things in our life. One of the great philosopher, Lao Tzu, was asked by the emperor of China to become his chief of the justice departme nt. Lao Tzu tried to persuade him that, \"It is better you leave me out.\" But he insisted, that \"You are the wisest man.\" Finally Lao Tzu accepted and the first ca se appeared. A man has stolen a large sum of money from the richest man of the capital. Lao Tzu gave both the people"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"six years of jail: the thief and the rich man. The rich man said, \"Are you mad? I have been robbed and now I am being punished! I have not done anything.\" Lao Tzu said, \"You have accumulated so much money that it is bound to be sooner or later robbed. You have created the situation, you are the source. This thief is just a by-product and I cannot pu nish the by-product when the source is present before me.\" The rich man immediately approached th e emperor and he said, \"What kind of man you have appointed? Soon you will be in jail because whatever you have, you have in the same way I have. It is better to dismiss this man, his idea is dangerous, although he is logical. I can understand what he is saying.\" Lao Tzu was dismissed. But this is the situation in the whole wo rld. On the one hand we create solutions and on the other hand those solutions de pend, exist, subsist, on the problems. So my idea of anarchism is totally different from Bakunin. I want to create a society which does not need a government. Bakunin says, \"Destroy the government and you will have a good society.\" I don't agree. But have a good society and there will be no need of a government. And this can be proved very easily because four years in America we had no government, there was no crime, nobody was punished, there was no fight, no rape, because we were trying to erase the problems from their very foundations. On an island it will be more easily po ssible because on any land belonging to a country we have to follow their laws. Most of them are illogical. We have to go through the bureaucracy which takes years, and then too the governments change -- one government may invite me , the other government, tomorrow, may throw me out. It is better now to ha ve an island where we don't have any government and we can create a model anarchist, superb quality communism, without any dictatorship, without destroying the rich, without creating a great concentration camp as Russia is; with full freedom. I trust in the individual so much and his in telligence that it is possible that it can become an ideal society. And it can become a model for other communes all over the world. Secondly, it will be easier for my sannyas ins to visit because they won't need any visa, they won't need any passport. I think that the world is crazy! We are living on a small planet where we have made so many political lines and divisi ons and you cannot cross those divisions and you need passports and you need vi sas and everywhere it seems we are not aware that the earth is one. So on the island at least we can drop all bureaucracy, nobody is going to ask you \"How long you are going to stay here? From what country you come? To what race you belong? Whether you have any passport or not?\" Your being human is enough that you are welcome. So rather than having the commune on ma inland of any country, my preference is for a island."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Because even being in my own country I fe el helpless. The people who have been taking care of me: my physician, my c aretaker, my washer woman, my cleaners, my typists, they all have been thrown out of the country. The president of the international sanny as movement had been given six month visa, just with one entry. She tried h ard, she is a woman of immense creative intelligence. Perhaps she has made the best film that has ever been made, \"Godfather.\" Her film has received more awards than any film ever. And these bureaucrats will not give her a second entry. She said, \"It is useless, because I am the president of the movement and I will have to come and go to talk to Bhagwan about problems,\" but they are not willing to give her a second entry. She is stuck in Nepal. She had sent a message that, \"They are not giving me a second entry.\" One man, for one month, the secretary of the sannyas movement has been waiting in Delhi to see the prime minister to make our situation clear to him, that \"You need not be afraid, we are not goin g to do anything that can harm your country. Whatever we propose will be beneficial. It cannot be in any way harmful.\" But for one month he has not been able to see the prime minister. He has been given at least twelve times appointm ents and at the exact moment the appointment is cancelled. Now how to work in such conditions? I have found a really beautiful island and soon we will be negotiating. Perhaps within two weeks it will be finalized and on ce it is finalized I will give you the first news. You can release it to the world. Q: DOES SUCH AN ISLAND EXIS T WHERE THERE WILL BE NO CONTROL OF A COUNTRY? A: Yes. There are few islands.... They are independent islands belonging to persons, individual properties. Not many are left now. Only three are there all around the world. So I had to send a pers on in deep search to find out. There used to be many but they all have by and by been taken over by governments, but three are still there. One is really beautiful. And the man is getti ng old and he wants to sell it. So it is his offer, we are not... we have been searching and he has been searching, because it is also difficult to find a bu yer for an whole island. But we have found each other and negotiations are on the way. Within two weeks we will be settling something. Q: THIS POINT HAS BEEN POSSIBLY IN THE MIND OF MANY PEOPLE, THAT WHY NOT GO TO AN ISLAND . EVEN WHEN YOU WENT TO OREGON, MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT... "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"A: In Oregon, that was the idea. The only problem was that we were not aware that there are still three islands in the wo rld which are owned by individuals. We inquired all the islands around America are in some way or other under the pressure of some government. Particularly in the last two years the American government has been trying to put as much pressure on those islands wh ich have been up to now independent, that now for me to go to those islands will be almost impossible because twice America has attacked those islands in these two years. So we don't want any island around America; we want some place where without any security, without any army, we cannot be attacked. And this island is in such a situation wh ere there is no possibility of any attack. Q: COULD IT BE ONE ISLAND NEAR FIJI? A: No. No, because Fiji islands are in dependent but they are too undeveloped and it will take real trouble to develop them to make houses, roads... water is a problem, electricity is a problem. So th ere are so many problems, before we can manage them it will take at least three/ four years. But this island is fully developed and for three hundred fifty people already accommodation exists. And it has a five mile strip. And on another side, another five mile strip which is under water -- just four/five feet under water. So my idea is these five miles over wate r should be left be cause they are lush green. They should not be disturbed an d the underwater line can be made like houseboats in Kashmir. So they can be atta ched with the land, which is only five feet underwater, so it can become really a beautiful place without destroying the greenery and the plants we can have the population. And in the middle of both you can have small boats moving. And the island already has an airport. Morning and evening airplanes pass through the airport. A twelve passenger airp ort, airplane is possible to land there and that's enough for us. We had in Or egon five airplanes of our own, we had our own airport, we have our own pilots, so we can use the airport. It has a beautiful hotel for eighty pers ons, eighty rooms for visitors and three hundred fifty persons can live immediately. So it is fully furnished. And as three hundred fifty people are there, we can start working on the underground, the underwater/ground, making houseboats where we can put thousands of people. It is a five mile long strip. So we can turn it really a paradise. So the moment it is settled I will give you the pictures, I will give you the whole news so you be the first one to release it to the world. "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Q: IF I WRITE ALL THIS INFORM ATION AND CAN'T NAME THE ISLAND, THEY WILL SACK ME. (INAUDIBLE) SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT IT. SO, HOW IS THE CLIMATE THERE? A: It is tropical. No, you just give the information. Let them wait, just two weeks and it will be finalized. Q: WHAT WILL BE THE FUTURE SE T UP OF A COMMUNE, LIKE THE FUTURE COMMUNE THAT YOU MAY SET UP YOU KNOW. WHAT WILL BE THE STRUCTURE LIKE? WILL BE THE SAME IN OREGON? A: It will be the same because it was perfect. Q: AND YOU WILL BE INCLUDING THE LOCAL POPULATION ALSO? A: In the island there is no local population. Q: ABOUT THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE MOVEMENT, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ITS VERY RICH. BUT AL SO THERE WERE DOUBTS WERE EXPRESSED AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN OREGON. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO TELL US ABOUT TH E FINANCIAL STRUCTURE? A: It is difficult to tell because when we went to America we had only fifty thousand rupees in the bank. If anybod y had asked about the financial status, fifty thousand rupees is nothing in America . It is just five thousand dollars. You cannot purchase a small house! So it is difficult for me to tell for the si mple reason because my financial status is not in the banks but in the hands of th e people who love me. And as we settled for the land we had no money. The land was purchased in six million dollars and we had fifty thousand, five thousand dollars. Six million dollars we settled, trusting that our people will manage. Even the man who was selling he was surprised, he said, \"But how you are going to manage?\" I said, \"You don't be worried about that .\" And we managed to put in Oregon two hundred million dollars. And we were neve r short of money because all around the world people were sending whatever they could manage and there has been no change. Those two hundred million dollars lost does not make any difference. In fact it has increased the number of my friends, sympathizers, and there will be no difficulty. I cannot give you the figures but I can guarantee you that there will be no financial difficulty at all."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The people who are interested in me are intelligent, educated, cultured, affluent people. And having one million sannyasin s around the world and at least three million almost sannyasins, there is no problem about money. Money has never been a problem in my life -- I don't have a single rupee. I am for thirty years bankrupt -- I don't have anything. Q: BUT SIR, YOUR MORALE BANK IS VERY HIGH. A: Yes, that is certainly very high. And we will manage, there is no problem. Q: BHAGWAN, THAT BEAUTIFUL ISLAND, MONEYWISE WILL IT BE HIGHER THAN OREGON? SIX MILLION DOLLARS? (Tape side B) A: No it will not be. Because it is difficult for the person to find a buyer and he is getting old and he wants cash. It is now a burden on him, the maintenance of the island, keeping servants there for these three hundred fifty cottages, a hotel, a resort beach... so it is becoming difficult for him. He wants to get rid of it so it won't be higher than Oregon, it will be far lower. It is his offer less than half and still he is ready to negotiate that means it can be cut still more. He is simply overburdened , it is unnecessary expense for him. And he is not in a position any more to enjoy the island that he had created in these twenty years, that's how it happens in many people's life. You try to create something you would like to en joy but by the time you create it you are not able to enjoy it. You earn money and you th ink one day you will relax and you will not do anything, but by the time the money is there you are unable to relax, you have become so tense earning the money that now that has become your second habit. It is a known fact that people after re tirement die ten years earlier than they would have died if they had continued to work. Because while they were working there was a hope of retirement, a hope of having a small villa somewhere in a beautiful place, resting and doing nothing. But when they get retired, for the first time they find that there is no future for them. And also they find that all their dignity was concerned with their work. If they were great doctors or surgeons th eir dignity was in being a great surgeon. Now nobody cares who you are because no w they are no more doing anything. They simply become a boredom unto themselves, twenty-four hours, doing nothing and their whole life they were continuously doing something. And because of their action they were getting respect, love, money, honor... now all that has disappeared. Soon they start feeling useless, worthless. The psychological understanding is that because of this feeling of being worthless, shrinks their life at least to ten years."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"So this man has developed that island for twenty years and he has made a beautiful place. But now he is old and he cannot enjoy there, he has to be mostly in a hospital, he wants to get rid of it. So there is no problem. It will be settled. Even at his offer we can accept it. But he is ready to negotiate. And it is in a place where all around are my communes. So my sannyasins can come easily, cheaply, without any troubl e and harassment of bureaucracy -- visit me, meet me, live there. So I have dropped the idea of being p art of any country. Why unnecessarily get.... I was going to purchase this pl ace. The price went immediately double. Before I had come the price was half crore. As I came in here it became immediately one crore. For seven acres and now even one crore is not enough. And it was going to be a deal that we will purchase this property only if the person manages at least fifty visas long-term so people can work here. Now he says he cannot manage that. And stupidity has no limits. You cannot think that now he is thinking that he ca n get six million for this place, six million dollars... that means six crore. More than six crore. He will not get even fifty lakhs. Just once I leave this place, who is going to give fifty lakhs -- what it has? Seven acres la nd and ordinary houses not something palatial. But now his mind is just getting greedy and greedier. So I told my man that \"Let him go mad because, and just tell him that that's good idea, we will think about it.\" Q: WE THOUGHT HE WAS IN A GOOD BOOK OF THE PRIME MINISTER. A: With politicians it is very difficult wh o is in a good book and who is in a bad book. And when you change your name fr om one book to another it is very difficult. In fact, this whole comple x was created by youth congress funds. Nobody's money is put in it. It is blackmail to the country. But because Karminath(*) was working clos e with Sanjiv Gandhi; after his death he became almost the owner of it. He has not put a single rup ee in it and now he is dreaming of six crore rupees. I have told my people that, \"Make him become more insane. Tell him that you can get ten crore, why you are selling six crore.\" And we are not going to purchase it anyway so there is no harm . But once we are gone he will be in a great loss. That's how people's mind work. I used to stay in a very ri ch man in Calcutta, Sohanlal Dugar. He was a all India fame, rich man and he was always sad. His wife told me that, \"He listens to you, he reads to you, you stay with us but he is always sad. And sad for strange reasons that I cannot understand.\" Sohanlal said that, \"You will never understand. I have lost five crore rupees and you want me to laugh?\" I said, \"If that is the situation, then let him be sad.\""},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"But the wife said, \"You don't understand th e full situation. In a deal in which he has not invested a single rupee, he was hoping to get ten crores and he has got only five crores. So he is sulking for those five crores that he has lost.\" I said, \"This is idiotic,\" but this is how human mind functions. Just in his imagination he has ten crores, now he has got only five crores, five crores are missing. But it is really amazing to watch peop le's mind how they work and how they make themselves miserable and they go on weaving their misery deeper and deeper and more complex and more complex, to a point from where they cannot get out. And it is all their imagination. If they can put it on a table, anybody can say that \"You are just being stupid. Those five crores were never yours, even these five crores are not yours. You should be enjoying that you have got five crores out of a deal in which you have not put a single rupee. This is a moment to rejoice and give a big party and you are becoming sad.\" But this is how people are. Q: BHAGWAN, ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP YOUR INDIAN PASSPORT? A: Yes. I will keep my Indian passport be cause no other country is going to give me a passport. But on the island I will no t need it. But I will keep it in case. Q: AS AN INDIAN, I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT, LOVE FOR YOU BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAS BEEN SOME ELEMENT OF MISUNDERS TANDING. IF IN INDIA IF YOU CAN ASK YOUR ORGANIZATION TO DO A SORT OF PUBLICITY (INAUDIBLE) TO EXACTLY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. A: Yes. It has to be done, something has to be done on.... Q: I WISH I WOULD HAVE WRITTE N FOR INDIAN PAPERS, YOU KNOW.... A: It is, it is important but I have been talking to Indian journalists. They are good people, intelligent people but for tw o thousand years Indi a has been a slave country. It has lost its courage. So here this understand me perfectly well, they feel love fo r me but when their article comes it does not show that, it is from the same man and it seems that their job is more important. So whatsoev er their owner wants them to write they will write. Or whatsoever the public want s to listen they will write. They will distort, they will misquote, they will take things out of context. In that way Western journalism has come of age. A... if you are against there is no problem, you write against. But sinc erely you are against and sincerely you write against. And if you are for, then si ncerely you write for. But this kind of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"thing that happens in India is very stran ge. They show one face to me and they show another face in their article. THAT'S CORRECT, SIR. BUT INDIA TODAY ARTICLE YOU KNOW... IT WAS BALANCED, BUT SOME WAY CERTAINLY IT WAS AGAINST (INAUDIBLE) A: Yes. Somehow they will make somethin g sarcastic, something they will leave, something they will add. And it makes im mense difference, just a sentence left and the whole meaning changes. But their whole effort is somehow to be in the market a se nsation. The whole Indian journalism is living on sensationalism. It has not yet become a category of literature. And government controls the radio, government controls the television and the Indian journalists are absolutely silent about it. This is absolutely wrong. In a democratic country at least all news media should be free from government control because news media is a big force for the individual, individual's freedom, and for the protection of the freedom against the government and against the bureaucracy. And that I felt in America, while I was in jail, every jailer told me, that \"We cannot even touch your body because the whole news media is focused on you. If anything happens to you we are condemned.\" And the news media made it such th at the whole America was concerned. Telephones were coming the whole day. Ev ery jailer was complaining to me that, \"You are the most troublesome prisoner who has come to the jail. So many phones and people are shouting at us! Our own people -- Americans, that `you are damaging the whole image of America .' They are crying on the phone. And thousands of flowers. And every jailer was asking me, \"What we have to do with these flowers. We don't have a place to keep them.\" I said, \"There is no need to keep them. Just send them to all schools, colleges, university, from me. A present.\" So when they took me from one jail to another jail, students of all categories were lined up by the sides throwing flowers and giving me the sign of victory. The news media in America created such a situation that the government felt very awkward and embarrassed and they wer e not thinking that just catching a single man is going to become such a tr ouble. From all over the world there were news reaching and telegrams reaching and protests and that all was possible because news media has an independence of its own. In India the government owns the late st media, television, because in India television is more important because the population is uneducated. Eighty percent people cannot read. But hundred percent people can see. Now this is absolutely ugly that government shou ld keep hold on television. Hundred percent people can hear -- radio is in government's hands."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The newspapers are in public hands, but a very small percentage can read. And all these newspapers belong to only few rich houses. They go according to the owner -- whatever his policy, that is their policy. Indian journalist has not yet come to have his own idea, to have his own eyes, to see things without any prejudices. But th e reason is that they have become accustomed of slavery. So anybody can.... I was a professor in the university. The fi rst day I entered the university I saw the girls sitting on one side and the boys sitti ng on one side and I said, \"This is not right. This looks bad. Almost obscene. Why you are not sitting mixed?\" They all were shocked because they were prevented. I said, \"Just get mixed otherwise get out, I am not going to teach. It is better to sit by the side of the girl you feel for rathe r than sit in a faraway corner and throw pieces of paper, and disturb my speech and disturb my.... I cannot tolerate that.\" Yes. It is bound to because they cannot li sten me... there the girl, because the girl is waiting for the chit. The boy is waitin g for the chit. And this whole thing is going on and the professor is talking abou t great things... nobody is interested. I mixed them and I told them, that \"Nobody needs to ask me. If he wants to leave the class with his girlfriend, he can go. Whenever he wants to come back, he can come back. Just don't disturb others. Silently....\" The news reached to the vice chancello r. He called me immediately and he asked, \"What are you doing?\" I asked him, \"You must have been youn g and you must have been a student. Have you thrown a piece of paper at a girl?\" He said, \"You are incurable! I have calle d you to ask questions to you and you are making me answer.\" He said, \"To be true perhaps you are right... you can go. Do whatever you want but don't create too much havoc because....\" And once I started it then students in other classes stood up and asked the professors, that \"This is happening, then why we should not be allowed to sit with our girlfriends?\" It is only a question of starting something and then everybody wants independence, freedom and everybody wants to be sincere. Just few journalists are needed. What happened with ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY of India, Pritish Nandy had come to take my interview in Oregon. He published the interview and he looked very nice and very friendly and very lo ving but the interview did not show any of those qualities. And then he went to Sheela who was in prison in Germany and managed to take her interview. The owners of TIMES of India and connect ed papers are interested in me. When they saw, before publication of Sheela's in terview that it is full of lies and full of absurd allegations, they told Pritish Nand y that, \"Before you publish it, it will be good that you take another interview of Bhagwan in conn ection with this interview and publish them toge ther and let people judge.\""},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"He wrote a letter to me that \"Bhagwan , it will not be good. You should not answer such rubbish, it is below you.\" That he writes to me, that it is below you, you should not answer such rubbish. Even to answer it is to give importance. But the owners informed me that the reality is that he does not want your answer to be published and we suspect that he ha s been bribed by American government. And this is from the owner of the TIMES of India, that he has been already bribed by American government. So these people and ILLUSTRATED WEEK LY or TIMES of India, these are big papers in India and if you can buy th e editor of ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY, who gets almost the biggest pay that any journa list may be getting in India, then it is very difficult. But something has to be done. And ther e are people but they are immediately thrown out. If they start saying thin gs which go against their owners, their political parties -- either they are aff iliated to political parties or they are affiliated to some capitalist group. In India there is not a single paper which can be said to be independent. And it needs a newspaper which is absolutely in dependent of any influence, either of government or of capitalist or of political parties. And it is just a question of beginning. If one begins, soon there will be others who will come out. But it is such a slave mentality that just to save some money, or just to save a job you can sell your soul. Q: BUT THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PICTURE ALSO. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CERTAINLY VERY SINCERE, VERY WILLING TO WORK, WHAT DO YOU THINK? BECAUSE MY FRIEND, SINGH VEDA(*) HE STARTED THIS MAGAZINE... AND PUT ON WHOLE LIFE AND THERE TODAY BANKRUPT.... A: That is true, that is possible, that is possible, and for that not to happen some more journalists should come to help. Rather than just to sympathize. Q: IT IS THE PROPRIETORS WHO TELL LIES, IT IS NOT THE JOURNALISTS, THOUGH IT IS HIS DUTY TO CHECK BUT HE IS AFRAID TO CHECK LEST HE LOSES HIS JOB. THEN THE GOVE RNMENT HAS A HAND IN OVER ALL THE NEWSPAPERS. NEWS PRINT QUOTA. A: I know. These problems are there. St ill some way has to be found and these problems will always remain there, in every field. From my own experience, because in th e university they were teaching Kant, Hegel, Hume, Berkeley, Bradley, Bosanquet. All who are out of date. I simply refused to teach. I started teaching Jean Paul Sartre, Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, Martin Buber, Bertrand Russell, and I told to the vice chancellor, \"At the most you can throw me out of the university. Bu t you will be playing with fire because"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"now I have students and not only my students, because philosophy does not have many students in India.\" I had only ten students but when I started teaching them modern... which are not in the syllabus, and the vice chancellor was in a difficulty that the examination is going to be according to the syllabus and `you are teaching people who are not in the syllabus.' I said, \"I am teaching people who are contemporaries. You have to bring your syllabus to be contemporary. Otherwise th ere is going to be trouble. And you should come to my class one day.\" There used to be ten students, now there are two hundred. Students from other courses dropped their period and come to my class. And I told them, that \"If the syllabus is not changed these two hundre d students will burn this building. Something has to be done.\" And I told him, that \"You either prove me wrong before those two hundred students or you change the syllabus, befo re it becomes a great trouble. Otherwise this university's building is going to be burnt, with all your libraries and with all your syllabuses and everything. Something has to be done. And when I di d this, other professors were in a very dilemma because their students are going to attend philosophy classes, they are supposed to be in the economic class or political class. I to ld them, that \"You should also bring your political science up to date. You should bring your economics up to date. And these people will be coming to you. Something has to be done, and somebody has to sacrifice himself.\" Q: MY REQUEST TO YOU IS TO CHAN GE THE TIMES OF INDIA. THEY ARE BECOMING THE BIGGEST LIARS. They are. I will do. Because.... Q: I'LL BE GRATEFUL. I WAS SINGLE MAN IN THE WHOLE TIMES OF INDIA WHO DISAGREED WITH THEM AND RESIGNED (INAUDIBLE). AND I DON'T REGRET. A: No, there is never need to regret. I will talk to them. Because they come to me. Ashok comes to me and Indu(*) comes to me, and Indu(*) has the whole power in her hands. Q: SHE IS THE ONE WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE AMENDED. I will see.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW BY INDIAN EXPRESS NEWSPAPER Q: SIR, YOUR TEN PERSONAL AIDES WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO STAY ON WITH YOU. NOW, HOW DO YOU REAC T TO THIS AND HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOU PERSONALLY? WHY DO YOU THINK THIS WAS DONE? A: I was expecting that it would be done. I have been born in this beautiful country but I have never been in tune wi th the vested interests, the people who hold power. My whole life I have criticized them and they have not been able to answer a single criticism. I knew it perfectly when I came that I th ink India is my home but the people who are in power they don't agree about it. Th ey would not like me to be in India. They cannot say directly that I should le ave India because they have no right to say but they can create situations in wh ich I am compelled to leave. And that's what they are doing. The people who have taken care of me fo r almost fifteen years they forced them to leave the country. It seems that their whole effort is that I should not be in contact with my sannyasins around the world. That my work should be destroyed, that is better than shooting me. Crucifying Jesus has not helped. Poison ing Socrates has not helped. In these twenty-five centuries people have learned perfectly that it is better to find indirect means to sabotage the work. Now the people who were living with me were taking my care, were my connections with other communes around th e world -- they were writing letters to them, answering to them. They were typ ing my lectures, my speeches, editing, publishing, tapes, videos -- they were doin g all kind of work and for fifteen years they have become perfectly professionals. Now to take them away from me, and in a very ugly and inhuman way, simply shows that they want me to be isolat ed here. Not to allow any sannyasins to come. They are refusing visas to sannyas ins. Sannyasins who are coming not in red clothes, even they have been refus ed because they were interviewed and if they were found somehow that they know me , that they are interested in me or that they will be going to meet me and see me then they have been refused."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"There are two things together. One is Indian government itself is afraid, because I am a potential critic and I will not tole rate any bullshit -- whether it comes from the prime minister of India or anybody else. I am not an active politician, but I am concerned with every human interest and everything that affects humanity. And politics is a major thing. And I cannot simply ignore it. They are also afraid that I have an in ternational image and whatever I say is going to have a worldwide publicity. There is their fear. Just a small thing I had told, it went around the world and I have heard Rajiv Gandhi was very much hurt. One Indian journalist was visiting me in America and he asked, \"Do yo u have any message to our new prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi?\" I said, \"Certainly. Tell Rajiv that you are selling wheat to other countries while your own people are starving, and you are selling wheat so that you can create a nuclear power station. This is ugly, you don't need a nuclear plant. And if this continues that you go on selling people 's food for nuclear weapons and India becomes poorer and poorer then you will be responsible for its poverty and all the deaths that will happen out of starv ation. And what do you need nuclear weapons for? Even if you put your whol e economy at the service of creating nuclear weapons, it will take three hundred years for you to become as great a nuclear power as Soviet Union or Americ a. In three hundred years your country will die. For whom those nuclear weapons you are going to use? \"Secondly, remember in three hundred ye ars America and Sovi et Union will not be standing still waiting for you to pick up speed. In three hundred years they will be three thousand years ahead of you. There is no possibility for you to become a big nuclear power. So drop that st upid idea. Better go to the reality that the population does not increase, that is decreases. For the first time we are coming close. By the end of this century, to be the first nation with the biggest population. \"Up to now, China has the privilege. Now we will be having the privilege. By the end of this century we will be one billio n people. So rather than wasting your energy into anything else, teach people for birth control, teach people for pills, teach people for abortion. And prevent all those religious leaders: pope, shankaracharya, Acharya Tulsi, Mother Tere sa and their whole clan that if they go on insisting and teaching people ag ainst birth control they are committing a crime and they should be behind the bars. \"These people also are doing another crime, that they are teaching people to live a celibate life -- which is unnatural. \"Nobody can live a celibate life unless he is impotent. And the most amazing thing is that not a single impotent pers on in the whole history of man has been creative in any dimension -- science, art, lit erature... not a single impotent person has been creative. It seems sexual energy is the only energy behind all creativity. Whether you reproduce children or you paint or you sculpt or you compose music, it does not matter... it is the same creative energy within you that is used."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"So the people who are teaching celibacy are making country uncreative, unproductive. Not only that, as a side effect, by making thousands of people celibate now there are thousands of sannyasins, Hindu, Jaina, Buddhist, Christians, who have taken the vow of celibacy. \"They are creating all kinds of sexual perversions. Homosexuality was born in monasteries. It is a religious disease. An d out of homosexuality now, the ultimate result is a very fatal disease AIDS whic h is spreading far and wide like wildfire. And it has no cure. And you can get that disease even by kissing a person, or even by wiping a tear of a person beca use the tears carry the virus, the saliva carries the virus. You may not have an y sexual contact with the person but anything and you are unconsciously a vict im and you have not more than two years to live. Celibacy should be made a crime. \"Do something for the country, you are young and you can understand me what I am saying which your grandfather may not have understood.\" But he was hurt. When I came here I wa s informed that he did not like the comment you had made. I said, \"I have already known the fact because when I was arrested without any warrant, withou t showing me any cause why they are arresting me and they kept me harassing for twelve days in different prisons, without proving me guilty, they did not allow bail and Rajiv and his government remained silent. At that very moment I knew that it is my message that Rajiv would be feeling happy that whatever is happening is perfectly right. The day I was released by the court, because they had no case against me, I received the phone of the Indian ambassa dor in Washington that, \"Can we help you? Indian government is very much concerned.\" I said to him, \"Don't be stupid. Twelve days I have been in prison, the whole world was concerned, all the news media was full of it, the Indian government has not taken a single step, it has not even asked the American government why I have been arrested, and what you have been doing for twelve days? And now when I am released you are asking `What help you can provide.' In fact I should ask you what help I can provide to you.\" So first thing is they are afraid of my presence and my presence becomes more and more powerful... if I have a commune here, if I have all my trained people here then we can not only criticize th e government, we can provoke the whole nation against it. And we can make it cl ear that what you cannot do, we can do. In four years in the commune in America not a single child was born. And there was no enforcement. Simple teaching to them that this is the situation of the world: if you have any sensitiveness and any humanity this is not the time to give birth to children. And that was en ough, for four years twenty-five hundred couples were living there, not a single child was born. We can show the country where yo u are being foolish and where the government is afraid even to say it to you because it depends on you. It depends on your votes. We don't depend on your votes."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"In five thousand people's commune we had only one kitchen and it was a joy to see five thousand people eating togeth er. Somebody dancing, somebody playing guitar and it was laughter and it was rejo icing and they were eating the best food possible because we had chos en the best cooks out of five thousand people. Every woman is not a good cook, and one should not expect. It is a science in itself, an art, a knack. And when fifteen people can take care of five thousand people it is sheer stupidity, uneconomic to make twenty-five hundred kitchens, block twenty-five hundred women into th e kitchens, waste their energy, cripple their life. We can show the ways how we changed the desert into an oasis. For fifty years that land in Oregon was lyin g dead. Nobody was ready to purchase it, because what you will do with a desert? We purchased a desert and within four years we made an oasis out of it. It si mply needs intelligence and labor and we never asked anybody from outside. All that we did, we did with the commune members. So the Indian government is afraid on the one hand that if I ha ve a commune here the whole country is going to become aware that if five or ten thousand people can manage to live so happily, so blissfully, so creatively, then why it cannot happen to the whole country. The second thing is a constant pressu re of American government on Indian government. We go on talking about the policy of neutrality that we are not part of any camp, Russian or American. The wh ole policy has been a tremendous loss to the country for forty years. It was though t that if you remain neutral then both the camps will be friendly to you, but what turned out to be the result was just the opposite. Both the camps remained suspicious of you. Nobody has relied on you. You are the most unreliable nation in the worl d. Still you have to depend on these powers for everything. If you want to make nuclear weapons you have to ask America and beg for know-how, for technicians, and for the esse ntial ingredients that are needed that are not available in this country. They will not be able to say to America if America dictates something to them. I am in perfect knowledge that Indian home ministry has received from American senate a letter dictating that th ey can allow me to live here but no foreigners should be allowed to live around me, and no commune should be allowed to be made. You think you are independent. You thin k that you are free but in this world where you have to beg and you already have loaned so much money from the world and every day you need more and more loans, you cannot deny America a small favor which costs you nothing. Even America says, \"Kill this man,\" and we give you one kilo of essential ingredie nts for the, for your nuclear weapons, I don't think they will hesitate. That one kilo will be far more important than a human being and particularly me, who ha s always been a critic and who has always touched their painful nerve. And th ey have not been able to answer me."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"So I was expecting all this to happen so I am not surprised. But I had come to the country to see perhaps a new generation of politicians will behave differently but I was wrong. Serpents are serpents, old generation or new generation makes no difference. Now you can ask your second question. Q: IN THE LIGHT OF THIS, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE? DO YOU STILL PLAN TO STAY ON, OR DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE? AND PERSONALLY YOU HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BECAUSE THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN VERY CLOSE TO YOU FOR VERY LONG SO A LOT HAS CHANGED. SO WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS NOW? HOW HAS THIS INFLUENCED THE DECISIONS YOU WILL TAKE IN THE DAYS TO COME? A: No, nothing changes me. As far as I am concerned personally nothing changes me. They are being just stupid thinking that they have changed ten persons who had come with me but another ten pers ons have arrived and they don't know that I have thousands of Indian sannyasin s also. If they prevent every foreigner to reach here they cannot prevent Indians. I have prepared Indians also to take care. So I am not personally affected in any way. Secondly, without even waiting them to become nasty with my people -- and they have been behaving nastily. Here were few sannyasins and the police comes and tells them, \"To leave the country immediately.\" And they say, that \"We have a visa still for two days more. You cannot tell us to leave the country immediately. What about our visa? We are entitled to be here for two days more.\" But no, the police officer says, \"You have to leave immediately.\" And he writes on their passports, `Leave India now.' And they have the visa. Even if you want th em to leave, first at least cancel their visa and then destroy their passports and th ere is no need to be so inhuman that they have to leave now. This very moment. Even before they had started all this I knew it was going to be. This property before I came was available for fifty lakhs. For me it was available for fifty lakhs. The moment I came to India the price wen t double, immediately, it became one crore. And the man who owns the property is in a very powerful situation in the Indian government. He does not hold a position but he is almost your second prime minister. I agreed for one crore. I told to my peop le that, \"It doesn't matter, that is Indian mind is so greedy and so materialistic. In spite of all their nonsense talk of being spiritual.\""},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Now the price has gone six crore. For seven acres of land. Have you ever heard one crore per acre in this part, which is one of the poorest part of the country? And the price will go on increasing. It may become ten crore. And I am playing with the game because I love to enjoy idio ts so I am sending messages that \"Don't sell it for six crore because they will give ten crore for it.\" From the very beginning I had sent peop le around the world to look for other places. I was not absolutely dependent on India. My whole life's experience is that you cannot be dependent on Indian po liticians. They are the worst creed in the whole world. There are politicians and politicians... they are all third rate. But nobody can beat the Indian politicians. I have received from two countries, invi tations on their own accord that they would like my commune to be in their country. Somebody seems to be somewhere very sensible. With the invita tion their idea is that your commune will help the country economically, tourism will increase. In one years fifty thousand people visited from outside the world to the commune in America. It was simply foo lish of them to destroy the commune. Now they have their desert, not a single to urist is going to come to that desert. If they love desert perhaps they will ha ve their whole Americ a a desert by the end of this century. But these two countries have been very sensible, unbelievable, because I had no contact wi th those two countries. They are ready to absorb my sannyasins, my commune. Th ey are ready to give me free land and every support that they can. So I am, I have sent my people to look at the places what is possible there but a government is a government... today one government is there, after two years an other government is there, and most probably if this government supports me , the next government is going to be against me. A natural attitude of the politicians. So I am not thinking to go to these countr ies but their invitation to a foreigner to bring five thousand foreigners in their country seems to be sensible. We have been looking for other lands. My interest is in an independent island and we have found three islands around the globe which are absolutely independent, under no government, person al properties. And my feeling is that within two weeks I will settle for one of those islands. Just my people have to look into those islands, all the possibilities of growth, communication, development, so that I am finished with governments and I am in a position to criticize anybody withou t thinking twice. I really never think twice. In fact, I never think even once, I simply say. Whatever comes to me I say it. So most probably we will be moving to an island and I invite you to come to the island. Pictures have come to me of the island. It is immensely beautiful. It has already facility for three hundred fifty peop le to live, a hotel for eighty people, a small sea beach, five miles long, thick fore st on one side and on another side five mile land, four/five feet under water.

(Tape side B begins) We should make those five miles underg round, underwater, and make boats like Kashmir, houseboats for five miles in a row attached with the underwater ground and on the other side five miles of beautiful lush greenery. And between both a beautiful patch of water. And for the present moment there is en ough accommodation for three hundred fifty people for the skeleton crew to st art working. Eighty persons for visitors. We can make a paradise. Why we should bother with governments and.... It has an airport -- every morning and ev ening one plane comes. A twelve seater plane can come. We can have our own planes. We had our own planes in Oregon, we had our own airport. In fact , because we had everything of our own became a problem to the American governme nt and they started thinking that as if we are making a state within a state. That was sheer nonsense. We are simply being self dependent, not creating a stat e within a state. We had our airplanes, we had our buses, we had five hundred c ars, we had our roads, we had our food, we were growing our fruits, our vegetables, we had our green houses, we had made lakes of our own and the land was so big, it is almost a small country -- one hundred twenty-six square miles. We had a forest which we were going to develop and make it bigger. Already the timber people were coming and asking for the forest and they were ready to give one million dollars just for the wood. But we refused becaus e those trees you grow in hundreds of years, and we were goin g to grow as many trees as possible. This year, before they started destroying us we had planned thousands of trees and we had planned to plant thirty thousand more. Their fear was that we are becoming a st ate within a state because we are not taking their support, we are not asking for anything because we had our own computer experts, we had our own el ectronic engineers, we had our own scientists, we had our own doctors, surgeons, professors, psychologists... we had every type of professional within the commune, why we should bother to go out? And these people certainly looked after the commune with more love, because money was no more the question . In the commune we has dissolved the money completely and this point you have to remember. Just by stopping that you cannot use mo ney in the commune we destroyed the division between the poor an d the rich, there was no n eed for a dictatorship of the proletariat. In seventy years in Russi a they have not been able to bring a classless society. We brought it in fo ur years and without harassing anybody, without taking anybody's money -- just st opping that in the commune money is a dirty word and we will not be using mone y. If you need anything you can get from the commune. You may have millions of dollars, I may not have a single"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"dollar but in the commune you are not rich and I am not poor because you cannot use your million dollars -- what use are they? These five thousand people without any idea simply lived for the first time in the history in a classless society. And there was no struggle... in Russia they had to kill one million people after revolution. An d still they are afraid if they withdraw their concentration camp methods, Russi a will immediately become a capitalist country. Because they have not destroyed the basic root. My whole approach is that equality is an unnatural idea. You cannot make everybody Albert Einstein. You cannot make everybody Rabindranath Tagore. The whole idea of equality is basically unpsychological. Th en what we can do? We can do something else: equal opportunit y for all. It will look a contradiction but this is how I put it. Equal opportunity for all to be unequal and unique. To me, the idea of equality is dangerous, very dangerous. It means you will have to cut people to the same size, you will ha ve to cut their talents, their intelligence to the same size. And that means you will have to listen to the lowest denominator. The idiot will become your ideal. You cannot make the idiot Albert Einstein, but you can change Albert Einstein into an idiot -- that possibility exists. So the lowest denominator is going to dominate all Communist societies and my idea is that the highest, which is alwa ys unique.... So instead of the idea of equality, I preach the idea of unique individuality. Yes, everybody should get equal opportunity. Somebody wants to become a scientist and somebody wants to become a carpenter, both should get the equal opportunity. And both should get the equal respect and both should get the same dign ity in the society. But that does not mean that the doctor has to become a c arpenter and the carpenter has to become a surgeon. That will destroy. And that's what has happened in Russia. Before nineteen-sev enteen, before the revolution, Russia created the greatest intellectuals in the world. Leo Tolstoy, Feodor Dostoevsky, Chekov, Turgenev, Gorky. All unparalleled. If you have to chose ten best novels you will have to choo se at least five Russian but they will be pre-revolution. After the revolution not a single Leo Tolstoy, not a single Gorky... in seventy years Russia has proved a desert, no genius has come up. For the simple reason because the idea of eq uality kills anything that is special in you. You have to be common and fitting with the crowd. So on this point American go vernment became angry with me that I have created without saying anything about communism a communist society. They have not said it clearly but that was their real prob lem, that was hurting, that it has to be erased, it is very dangerous... it is mo re dangerous than Soviet Russia. Because you can say against Soviet Russia that it is a dictatorship, you cannot say that against me. There is no barbed wire around the camp us, nobody is prevented, anybody can join. Two years before when they start ed becoming more and more angry was the time when we accepted two hundred American beggars. The world thinks"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"that beggars is something Eastern. Ame rica has thirty million beggars, with no food, with no clothes, with no houses, wi th no families. And they all turn out to be criminals, it is bound to be. Two hundred street people, as they are called in America... they don't call them beggars -- street people. Two hundred peop le came to us and we accepted them and that was the beginning of a rift between the commune and the American government. We accepted those two hundred people who have been brought up in crime, who have been many times into jail, who have committed all kinds of crimes, who had no education. We treated them just as we treated everybody else. They were having the same clothes, the same food, the same houses and they were immensely happy. I talked to these people that, \"Don't you think you would like to go back?\" They said, \"Where? This is our home, we have found our home. And we have found that we are also human beings , there we were treated as dogs.\" It became a problem to the American government that if this idea spreads and these two hundred people for two years did not commit a single crime, so crime was not nature it was just the situation th at they were forced to do it. It was the society who was responsible for it. For two years they forgot their drugs and their alcohol because it was not available and there was no need. They were so happy and the whole commune was so rejoicing, they were meditating, they were working, they were dancing... and the most amazing thing to them was they were all black people, that even white people are dancing with them and nobody even takes the note that they are black, that nobody even thinks that they are different. This was the point from where the government started putting cases against the commune and within two years, as the commune became more and more better, the government became more and more af raid. And now they are telling to the Indian government that \"You don't allow Bhagwan to create any commune in India.\" So I know that they will not allow me to create any commune in India. Then my being here is useless. I will create now a commune on an island which can become a model to all the communes around the world and to any in telligent person who wants to visit and see that life can be lived as an art, that it can be a beautiful experience, that it need not be miserable, that it can be a sheer joy, all the way paradise. But I don't think any government will tolerate it. Q: WHERE IS THIS ISLAND? A: Just wait before I decide, because ther e are three islands. Two are in the Fiji islands group and one is also close to the Fiji. Within two weeks it will be decided."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" Q: THE ISLAND YOU ARE DE SCRIBING IS THE THIRD....

Q: WOULD YOU SAY IN SO MANY WORDS THAT YOU ARE A LITTLE DISILLUSIONED WITH INDIA? OR JU ST WITH THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT AS WITH ANY GOVERNMENT? A: No. I am disillusioned with all th e governments and as far as Indian government is concerned I am less disillu sioned because I was expecting this. I know Indian government for thirty years that it consists of the most stupid people. I simply wonder how British government managed to create a bureaucracy of the most stupid people. In fact, they need it -- that kind of bureaucracy. Intelligent people cannot be slaves. They need stupid people. Their all examinations and things were really to so rt out the stupid people and the people who have a slave's mind. They could not -- Subash(*) Chandra was an I.C.S. student. In his verbal examination, the final... he has passed a ll the examinations. The last he had to meet the governor. He went there, just the way Bengalis always carry their umbrella, he was carrying his umbrella un der his arm with his hat. He did not remove his hat. The governor was anno yed. He said, \"You have not removed your hat.\" And Subash(*) took his umbrella, put the um brella's hook on the governor's neck and told him that, \"If you e xpect respect, then you shou ld show it too. You have not removed your hat, you have not stood up to receive me.\" The governor could not believe that a st udent can do that. Of course he was failed because this type of man is not needed in a bureaucracy which wants just slaves. Shri Aurobindo was one of the I.C.S. stud ents but failed. And failed in what? In everything he passed. He failed in horse-riding. Now I don't know what horse- riding has to do with an I.C.S. officer. Bu t just an excuse. They wanted to fail him"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"in any way but they could not manage to fail him in philosophy, in mathematics, in history. This was easier, that he faile d in horse-riding and he could not become an I.C.S. officer. They were choosing mo st stupid people and those people remained. The British government has go ne but they have left their legacy. And Indian politicians have no idea be cause for two thousand years they have been slaves so they don't have any idea what to do. They have simply borrowed the British legacy and they are simply c arrying it. And Britain left India at the right moment, it was not because of Indi an revolution because the revolution happened in nineteen forty-two and was finished in nine days. This was the poorest revolution that has happened in the whole history wh ich ends in nine days. And this is a miracle that the revolution happens in nineteen forty-two and the result of the revolution comes in nineteen forty-seven -- five years afterwards. It is disconnected, it has no connection with it. We have not won the fight for freedom. It is really British understanding that now the country, its population, its economy is going to deteriorate every day more and more and we will be responsible fo r it. It is the time to leave quickly. Mountbatten was sent to India with the message that \"Do the job as quick as possible.\" He was given the date nineteen forty-eight but he was an efficient man, he managed it ninety forty-seven. And he finished. And Britain got out of the mess and the Indian idiots entered with all the burden and no way, no understanding to get out. And a leader like Mahatma Gandhi who is telling to them that \"Spinning wheel will do.\" Or leaders like Morarji Desai that \"Just drinking your own urine\" will solve all the problems. So with Indian government I am not disillusioned. I was expecting they cannot do better what they have done, that's pe rfectly okay. But I am disillusioned with America because I thought it is a new coun try, just three hundred years old, well educated, economically sound, one of th e most powerful nation that has ever existed. And I hope that there is a po ssibility for democracy to exist. That possibility was the reason of my disillusionment -- it is not there, it is in the same boat with other countries, with a mask of democracy. But inside the same fascist attitude. The government was trying to destroy us. The Christianity was trying to destroy us and they both joined together. President Ronald Reagan is a fundamentalist Christian. Christianity is one of the worst religions in the world and the fundamentalist Christian is the worst Christian amongst other Christian sects. It is the most fanatic sect. The Christians were afraid because all the people that have gathered around me were Christians, Jews. I have never told anybody to drop his religion; there is no need. I simply explain to you how your mi nd can be more silent, more clear and automatically your conditionings go on disappearing. And with those conditionings your religion and your sect and your God and your heaven and hell, they all disappear."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Christians were afraid that I am chan ging Christians. They were forcing the government, the government was afraid that I am creating a kind of communism, now they are forcing Indian government... and Indian government don't have guts. If it has guts it should reply to the senate of America that \"We are going to give this man the opportun ity that you destroyed and we want to see what wrong he has done. We don't see.\" We have never harmed anybody. We wer e simply doing our own thing. But I don't think Indian government has any guts. And just such a weak government and so many big problems in the countr y makes one feel sad. These people will not be able to solve anything. We need stronger people, we need people with more clarity of vision, we need people who don't think in terms of spinning wheels. Otherwise, by the end of the ce ntury you will see a nightmare... on every street you will find corpses and nobody there even to arrange a funeral for them. Fifty percent of India is goin g to die by the end of this century if nothing is done and I don't think that anything is possibl e with these people who are in power. They don't have eyes, they don't have an y perspective. And they are not ready to listen to any perspective. Just somebody becomes a prime minister and he starts thinking that he has all the wisdom of the world. This is sheer no nsense. But I have the vision, I have the people to materialize it and we will make the last effort to create a society to show to the whole world. That without a government a commune can exist, that without money people can exist and not in poverty but with great inner richness, with joy. And I have chosen an island for many re asons. One of the most fundamental is that wherever I have tried, for example, I tried in Poona -- ten thousand sannyasins were living there. But they create jealousy in the local people because the local people cannot even laugh. An d they see these people, the whole day smiling, laughing, dancing, for no reason at all. Because I don't think singing needs any reason. I don't thin k dancing needs any reason. Just as health needs no reason -- you don't go to the doctor in great anxiety that \"Doctor for one month I have been having complete health, something must be wrong!\" No, you go to the doctor only when yo u are sick. Sickness is unnatural, sadness is unnatural, misery is unnatural -- there must be a cause to it, but just rejoicing in life, in the small things of life is a natu ral thing. There is no question of finding any cause. And people were coming there curious to know and they asked me again and again, \"Why your people are so happy?\" I said, \"This is strange. In fact I should ask why you are all so miserable. People should be happy. Happiness should be simply a natural phenomenon.\" Then they start projecting their own id eas that, \"These people are hypnotized, mesmerized, perhaps they are taking some drugs,\" and all kinds of rumors they will create. And people will believe those rumors because if they don't believe"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"those rumors then how to tolerate their own misery, how to tolerate their own tears. This gives a consolation that, \"These peop le are on drugs, that's why they are dancing. Otherwise there is no reason to dance. That's why they are singing and they are so joyful -- they are hypnotized. And we are not hypnotized.\" And I say that, even if hypnosis can de stroy misery from the world what is wrong? It is better than misery. And those people are not hypnotized, those people are not taking any drugs. But the local people surrounding create a trouble in every small way. So an island will be better. I hope that the ocean does not create any trouble. Okay.

It is for reference use only.] INTERVIEW WITH SWAMI JAY PRAKASH FOR DAINIK NAW PRABHAT, INDIA Q: BHAGWAN, AFTER THE FAILURE OF RAJNEESHPURAM COMMUNE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FUTURE OF THE COMMUNES? A: First, it was not a failure. Do you th ink murdering Socrates by poison was a failure of Socrates and his ph ilosophy. In fact, that was the ultimate victory of the man. He proved that a single man and hi s truth is more powerful than the whole society with all its powers, riches, popu lation, armies. They could do only one thing to this man: they could kill him. But by killing the man the truth is not killed. In fact, on the contrary, by killi ng Socrates they have made his truth immortal. Or do you think the crucifixion of Jesus was a failure of Jesus? If Jesus was not crucified perhaps there would ha ve been no Christianity. It is his crucifixion which brings his glory to the highest peak. So I do not consider that destroying the commune in America is a failure. It is a success. We have succeeded in doing many things, we have succeeded to prove that the biggest world power is also afraid of a small commune which has no power except love. It means love is more powerful than po wer itself. We have succeeded to prove that a small commune of five thousand people can destroy the sleep of the bureaucrats and the politicians, of the gr eatest power in the world in the whole history of man. What was their fear? Why our small commune became such a heart attack to them? The reason was that we were successful wi th our very limited means and they are unsuccessful with their unlimited sources. And to leave us alone was impossible for them because the comp arison between us and the American government was arising in the people's mi nd, that if these people can succeed in transforming a desert into an oasis, if these people don't have a single beggar, nobody unemployed, no crime committed in four years, no murder, no rape, no suicide, nobody has gone mad, then why it cannot happen on a larger scale. When you have all the powers to do? And these people have nothing except their intelligence and their labor."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Fourthly, it proved something of tremen dous importance, not only for America but for the whole history of man -- past and future too. We had no government, five thousand people have existed for th e first time for four years without any government. It is not a small phenom enon. This was the first anarchist commune. Anarchists have been talking ab out it but nobody has been able to materialize it into reality. And we wer e not consciously trying to make an anarchist society; it was simply a by-product, we had not thought about it, it was just a later recognition -- that we had no government and yet no crime, not a single baby was born in four years. With out forcing people to use birth control methods, just trusting their intelligence was enough. So we have proved if you trust the individual, his intelligence, his in tegrity, and if you respect him you can expect miracles from him. Secondly, which seems almost an impossi bility, communist and anarchists have never been able to agree on any point be cause anarchist says `no government, the government should be dissolved immediat ely, the government is the sole cause of all crime, all that is inhuman, all w ars, bloodshed, all kinds of dirty politics.' And the communists say `that we hope some time in future there will be a time when there will be no government, but fo r the time being to remove government will not improve things, things will go fr om bad to worse.' And perhaps they are right. Even with the governments the cr ime is there and it goes on growing. The human mind seems not to change at all. With all the control, all the courts, all the punishments, the human mind seem s to be very stubborn. If all these controls are removed the society will fall into a barbarious state. So communists say `somewhere far away in the future' -- which cannot be predicted unless the whole world become s communist and there is no fear of outside interference, the government cannot be dissolved. On the contrary, the government has to be made stronger to enforce equality amongst man because man has become accustomed of being unequal for so long that it is not easy for him to drop the habit. And nobody wants to be equal to anybody, everybody wants to be higher and superior. To dest roy this tendency of being superior and higher a very strict government is needed. That's why they say democracy cannot bring communism, it is a very loos e government. Only a dictatorship of the proletariat. So that is the first step for communists to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. How anarchists and communist s can meet? Their first step is no government, not even democratic govern ment; and communist's first step is a very strong, almost a military rule over the country so that we can destroy all the old habits which are clinging to human mind. Anarchists, like Bakunin, Tolstoy and co mmunists like Karl Marx and Lenin have been constantly arguing. They think themselves enemies. I went it into detail because what ha ppened in the commune was a miracle. There was no government and a very higher quality of communism became possible, without any dictatorship. There was no need to enforce anything. All"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"that we had done we have stopped using money inside commune. You can donate to the commune but you cannot use money for any exchange of goods inside the commune. So you maybe having millions of dollars and I may not be having a single dollar but you are not rich in the commune and I am not poor. Your millions of dollars are useless. Th eir use is if you can use them, if you cannot use them, whether they exist or no t makes no difference. So inside the commune, just stopping money to be used and commune taking over the responsibility to fulfill everybody's needs: medical, educational, nutritional, for clothes, for food, for housing, for vehicles, for everything. I was not aware that this is going to ha ppen and that's why I say life is such a mystery and so unpredictable and so wonderful that I saw communism and anarchism existing simultaneously. No go vernment, nobody is rich, nobody is poor. This is such a great phenomenon th at even if it happened only for four years and it was crucified but no crucifixion has every succeeded. You crucify someone only when you feel your impotence against it. The commune has been crucified in America, no w it will spread all over the world. Its crucifixion is not a failure; it is a su re sign of success. We have succeeded to prove that we can change every problem that humanity faces. All those problems are created by human beings. On the one hand they go on creating them and by the other hand they go on trying to find some solution for them. It is such a stupid way the world ha s lived that it has not even seen that who is creating the problem. Why not cut the roots? A woman last night was asking me, a ve ry intelligent woman and rare in the sense that she was Mohammedan. She was asking me, \"What to do with your mother-in-laws? It is such a conflict and there seems to be no way out.\" I said, \"First you create the problem and then you start looking for an answer. In the first place, marriage is unnecessary , with the disappearance of marriage all in-laws will disappear automatically -- cu t the root. Secondly, the moment a man is able to live with a woman he needs to be left alone with the woman -- it is something psychological... he has been in the mother's womb for nine months, she has brought up the boy, educated hi m, made him capable and up to now she has been the only woman in his life. An d remember, whether she is a mother or not, first she is a woman and it is in tolerable for her that in stranger woman comes in the home who has done noth ing for you and suddenly she becomes more important to you than your own mo ther. And for twenty-five years she has been taking care of you. You have forgo tten all. That for nights she was waking and sitting by your side because you wer e sick, that to make you educated she was working, she was trying somehow to provide all your necessities and never let you feel that you are poor. Suddenl y a strange woman comes in the home, and she is no more of any importance. And the wife cannot be made responsible for it because she has married you not your mother. She owes nothing to your mother. And she had her own dreams how to live. They do not coincide with your mother, the conflict starts and then"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"you try to somehow patch up... from one plac e it breaks up, at another place. If the man takes the side of the mother whic h he feels as a duty then his woman is going to make a hell for him for twenty-four hours, for a small thing -- that is too much, he cannot pay for duty that much hell. If he takes the side of the woman, the mo ther is simply anger which he has never seen. Now there is a great competition and between two women a poor unexperienced man is being crushed and you want a solution. There is no need -- why create the problem in the first place? The moment a person gets married he is now capable of having his own house, his own job, his own work... it should be seen that he is not to live with the old family. Now he has brought a new person into his life. That new person is not going to fit with the old structure. And this is so simple. But it is still not fundamental. The fundamental is why marriage should exist at all? Two person s are in love -- they can live together. Love is something, it may be there today, it may not be there tomorrow. What you are going to do when love is not there tomorrow? You will have to pretend. And the worst sin in the whole life of man is when he pretends love, because love is the highest quality of life and yo u are pretending it. And if you become accustomed of pretending love, perh aps you may forget how to find the authentic quality of love. The pretension may become your reality and that has become the reality of millions of people around the world. They never experience love, it is always pretension. Pretending to be loving to the mother because she is mother, pretending to be respectful to the father because he is the father, pretending to be loving to the wife be cause she is the wife, pretending to be loving to the children because they are your children -- all pretensions. Surrounded by pretensions you cannot have real growth, you cannot realize your potential. The experience of the commune in Ameri ca has been of immense importance. Time does not matter -- fo ur years are enough to prove. What can happen for four years can happen for four hundre d years. And what can happen for five thousand people can happen for fifty thousand people. All men are the same. So don't say that the experiment has failed. No... the experiment has succeeded, America has failed to recognize it. America has proved it is not intelligent enough, not sensitive enough to realize a tremendous phenomenon of anarchy and communism m eeting together without any conflict. As far as I am concerned we have succeed ed, we have made the mark and it will be repeated in many lands, in many time s, with different people. And it is going to spread. In other ways also it has been immens ely successful. For the first time my existence, my philosophy, my people became world famous. For the first time the world has to recognize that there exis ts a different kind of man of whom governments are afraid, religions are afraid. Sannyas has become now a household word."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"It does not matter that one commune is no more there. We have learned much from that commune. My second commune should be on an independent island so no question of any government interfering and no question of any government giving you visa or time how long you can stay or not. It will be our home and anybody can stay as long as he wants to stay. We are not go ing to be part of any country, we are going to be on our own. And we are go ing to make a far better and superior commune than they have destroyed. It will become a model for all other communes around the world. Now for the first time you have entered with this destruction of the commune into the eyes of the whole world. Up to now you were a sma ll movement, by the side of the way. Now we are in the middle of the road and everybody has to take a position about us, either for us or ag ainst us -- both are welcome. We are not going to leave a single person who is indifferent. Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE FOR YOUR INDIAN SANNYASIS AND LOVERS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT UNCERTAINTY OF YOUR STAYING IN THIS COUNTRY? WHAT THEY CAN DO OR THEY SHOULD DO? A: One thing: that life is always uncertain. The very idea of certainty creates trouble. Not only in this matter but about other matters also. My message to the sannyasins here and el sewhere is that we should learn to live with uncertainty because certainty does not exist, you cannot do about it anything. It is simply unnatural, non- existential. You are breathing today, tomorrow you may not be breathing. What certainty is there? I am here today, tomorrow I may not be here. Uncertainty is the principl e that life follows but we are cowardly and we want to make things certain. We are afraid of the unknown so we cling to anything that seems to be certain. And because of th is cowardliness, fear and clinging with anything that appears us to be certain, the whole humanity has got into immense trouble because only phoney things are certain. The plastic rose is certain: it is there, it will be there tomorrow too. In fact scientists say it will be very difficult to destroy plastic. All that bottles, containers, bags which are made of pl astic which we go on throwing to the earth... the earth is finding it difficult be cause it cannot absorb it. They become a blockage in its recycling. Plastic is more permanent than your God. The real flower is bound to be uncertai n. Now the choice is yours. The real flower will be alive, the real flower will have a joy, the real flower will have a fragrance, the real flower will dance in th e wind, in the rain, in the sun... but you have to remember that because it is real by the evening it will be gone. And there is nothing wrong in it. Why things go on remaining always? They should go on moving so new flowers, new things , new phenomena becomes possible."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Just think of one thing. If all your ance stors have not died and it will not be a small number and if Darwin is right then to live in that ho use with all your ancestors, which will be man and half-man and apes and all kinds of animals up to the fish. It will be a zoo and you will either go mad or you will commit suicide. It is good that they have died, it is good that life goes on changing, creating place for the new to arise. So my message to my sannyasins is: neve r be worried about uncertainty. Instead enjoy it, it is excitement, it is -- if you are alert -- can become ecstasy. My being here, if it is certain, you will st art me taking for granted. But if it is uncertain, tomorrow I may be gone. You ca nnot take me for granted. If you want to see me, today is the day. You cannot postpone it for tomorrow. If you want to live my philosophy, today is the day. You cannot deceive yourself that tomorro w I will live it... because tomorrow is not in your hands and it may never come. Uncertainty is beautiful, certainty is dead. Only corpses are certain, living people are bound to be uncertain. This has created a great trouble for my people because they can never be certain what I will say tomorrow, they would like me to stop somewhere and say to them that this is the full stop and no w you can quote me like a parrot, without any fear that I may contradict you. But this is not possible. You will be surprised that how things are. My enemies want that there should be a lock on my tongue, that my lips should be sewn together and they will be very happy with me. I won't be a trouble to them. But in a very subtle way the people who love me they also want the same, wi thout knowing that that's what they are wanting. They want me to say exactly what is my philosophy, like a Christian catechism, so you can believe in it. I don't allow you to believe in me because you always remain in a suspicion. Tomorrow I may say something which is not consistent with it. But my own approach is that life is never consistent with itself -- that's why it grows. (Tape side B) If a tree is consistent it may not grow be yond the roots, it will remain consistent with the roots... it is not consistent, it becomes something else which are not roots, it becomes a trunk. If it remains consistent with the trunk then it will not have any branches. They are not consistent with the trunk. If it remains consistent with the branches it may not have foliage because what relati onship is there between leafs and the branch? It may never grow flowers. What relationship is there between flowers and the leafs. It may not come to fruition because the fruits are as far away from the roots as you can conceive. You cannot say they are consistent. But deep inside the same juice is flowing which is in the roots, which is in the trunk, which in the leaves, which is in the flowers, which is in the fruit... it is the same juice. But to see that juice you n eed some insight. Otherwise you will see only inconsistencies everywhere."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"So let my people know that `learn to love uncertainty, learn to respect inconsistency' because that inconsistenc y is only in your eyes, because you cannot see deep enough. Deep enough there is a juice which is the same expressing itself in different forms. And I am not going to leave my friends ev er in a certainty, while I am alive at least. To the last breath of mine I will go on being inconsistent and I would like my people also to be the same. Because th e consistent people become fanatics. It is the consistent people who have been a curse to humanity. I want my people to be flexible, not consistent. Flowing with the life where it goes. Wherever I am, I am theirs. And why think only of Indi a because I don't believe in any political boundaries. This whole earth is ours, this whole univer se is ours. So wherever I am it does not matter. I am with you, my love is with you, my message will go on pouring on you.... You will not be missing anything whether I am here or far away. Perhaps if I am here you may miss, because this is my experience.... I was in Bombay for four years. A couple lived just upstairs on top of my head and four years they thought of coming to me and always postponed that `we can go anytime.' The day I left Bombay, you will be surpri sed, they left Bombay. They came to Poona to take sannyas the same evening. But I asked, that \"I recognize you, seeing in the lift, on the steps... you wer e living in the same place where I was living.\" The said, \"We were living but we went on po stponing that you are here any day. But now you are not there. Although we were not your sannyasins, although we were not even acquainted with you, your presence has beco me something that we cannot live there any more in the house. We have left, we have come to live here in Poona as your sannyasins.\" In Oregon, hundreds of Indians came who had never come to Poona and amongst these hundreds of Indians were people who were so poor that they could have never dreamt of travelling so far to America. It was beyond their conception. They sold their houses, they sold their land, risking their whole life because what they will do when they are back, but they said, \"Whatever... but at least -- we are old -- and one time we want to see Bhagwan. We missed in Poona, we missed in Bombay, when it wa s so easy. Now we cannot miss.\" Human mind functions in very bizarre ways. I am here; that is not nece ssarily a help to the sannyasins in this country. Just their mind will take it for granted. I am somewhere else then they cannot take me for granted. And it is good that they don't take me for granted, on any level. And this way I am teaching them how to live joyously with uncertainty, how to live joyously with an inconsistent existence."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Whatever I am doing or whatever is happe ning around me is part, essential part, of my teaching. Q: WHAT ARE THE MAJOR HINDRANCES IN INNER GROWTH OF A MEDITATOR, AND HOW HE OR SHE CAN OVERCOME THOSE OBSTACLES ON THE WAY? A: There are not many hindrances but only few. One is a repressed mind because whatever you have repressed, whenever you will sit silent to meditate, that repressed idea, the repressed energy will be the first to overflow you and your mind. If it is sex, meditation will be forgotten and you will be having a pornographic session. So first thing is: drop repressions -- whic h is very simple because they are not natural, they have been told to you... that sex is sin. It is not. Is is nature, and if nature is sin then I don't think what can be virtue. In fact, going against nature is sin. Just a simple understanding that whatever you are, existence has made you this way. You have to accept yourself in totality. This acceptance will remove the hindran ce that can come from repression. Second thing that comes as a hindrance to the meditator is the idea that have been impressed on his mind about god because that's how the moment you use the word meditation immediately a Chri stian asks, \"On what?\" A Hindu asks, \"On what?\" Meditation needs an object. All these re ligions have been teaching just sheer nonsense. Meditation simply means that th ere are no objects in the mind and you are simply left alone with your consci ousness, a mirror reflecting nothing. So if you are a Hindu you must be carryin g in the unconscious some idea of God, Krishna, Rama, or some other idea. So the moment you close your eyes meditation means to meditate upon something. Immediately you start meditating on Krishna or Christ and you have missed. Those Krishnas and those Christs are hindrances. So you have to remember that medita tion is not focusing your mind on something, it is emptying your mind of everything -- your Gods included. And coming to a state where you can say that both my hands are full of nothingness. That flowering of nothingness is the highest experience of life. The third thing that can be a hindrance and is a hindranc e is to think in terms of meditation as if you have to do meditati on in the morning, twenty minutes, half an hour in the afternoon or in the night ... just a small fraction of time and the remaining time you have to remain the wa y you are. That's what all the religions are doing. One hour meditation is enough."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"But one hour meditation and twenty-thr ee hours of non-meditation you cannot conceive how you will be able to win in entering into a medita tive consciousness. What you gain in one hour is wasted in twenty-three hours. Again you start from the scratch. Every day you will do it, every life you will do it, and you will remain the same. So to me, meditation has to be somethin g more like breathing. Not that you sit one hour.... I'm not against sitting -- what I am saying is: that meditation should be something that goes with you the whole day just like a shadow, a peace, a silence, a relaxedness, working you are tota lly into it. So totally that there is no energy left for mind to spin thoughts. An d you will be surprised that your work, whatever it is, digging the ground or carrying the water from the well, or anything, has turned into a meditation. Slowly slowly each act of your life should turn into a meditative act. Then there is a possibility to attain to enlightenment . Then you can sit also because that too is an act, but you are not specifically id entifying sitting with meditation -- that too is a part. Walking you meditate, wo rking you meditate, sometimes sitting silently you meditate, sometimes lying on your bed you meditate... meditation should become your constant companion. And this meditation that can become constant companion is a very simple thing, I call it witnessing. Just go on witnessing whatsoever is ha ppening. Walking you witness, sitting you witness, eating you witness yourself eating, and you will be surprised that the more you witness things the better you can do them because you are non-tense, their quality changes. You will also note that the more medita tive you become every gesture of yours becomes soft, non-violent, has a grace in it. And not only you will notice it, others will start noticing it. Somebody was asking me that, \"Now you have allowed even people who want to take sannyas, if they don't want to we ar red clothes, mala, it is perfectly okay. But how they will be recognized?\" I said, \"Now the recognition will be more subtler. Now they will be recognized by their meditation and if they are really meditating, they cannot deceive anybody.\" Even non-meditators in the marketpl ace who have nothing to do with meditation, who have never heard even the name meditation, will see that something has changed. The way they walk , the way they talk, there is a certain grace and a certain silence surrounding them and a certain peace. People will wait for you because you will become a nourishment. You must have known in your life ther e are people who are avoided because to be with them feels as if they are suckin g you, as if they are pulling your energy and leaving you empty. And after they have left you feel weak, you feel robbed."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Something just the opposite happens with the meditator. Being with the meditator you will feel nourished. You would like to meet the person. Once in a while just to be with him. One of my professors, Dr S.K. Saxena, he was the head of the department of Philosophy and I was his student. But he won't allow me to live in the hostels and it was a little embarrassing for me, fo r the simple reason because he was a drunkard, gambler, a very nice man and has never lived with his family... his family was living in Delhi, because he could not tolerate anybody. And I feel embarrassed because he will take me to his house and then he will not drink, just out of respect and love for me . And I knew that it will be too difficult for him, he is an old man and he is not just occasional drunkard, he is a drunkard, he needs every day otherwise he cannot live. So I told him that, \"I can come with the condition that you will not change anything in your life because of me. You will have to continue whatever you do... if you want to drink, you drink, just the way, as if I am not there.\" He said, \"That is the difficulty. I take you there because when you are there I don't need the drink. You are a nourishm ent to me. When you are in my house I feel my house has become your home otherwise I am just living in a house. I have never had a home. My wife is there, my children are there, but somehow that atmosphere never happened that be comes immediately possible the moment you enter into my house. \"You are sleeping into another room, I am sleeping into another room but I sleep so deeply when you are in my room, and without drinki ng. So don't think that I am making any obligation on you to take you from the hostel to my bungalow, which is more comfortable in every po ssible way... no. You are making an obligation on me. I feel so nourished.\" He said to me, that \"When you are there I don't eat so much as I eat every day and my doctor goes on telling me: `not to eat too much, you are old, you have diabetes, you are a drunkard. That drinki ng is killing you, that drinking is making your diabetes worse and you go on eating and you love sweets and you love delicious food.' But when you are ther e, simply my appetite is not there, I feel full. What the doctor has not been able to do in years, you have not even told me.\" In fact, I used to tell him, that \"Docto r you should eat something. Only I am eating and you are just sitting there.\" He said, \"I know, but there is no a ppetite and I am feeling very good.\" Not only you will start feeling changes, ot hers will start feeling changes. All that is to be remembered is a simple word: witnessing. Q: HOW TO BALANCE THE INNE R AND OUTER WORLDS? HOW TO BECOME A CHARVAKA? A: There is no need to balance, they are balanced."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Just the religions have created the split. Th ey have told you that your body is separate, your soul is separate, that th e world is matter, God is spirit.... All these ideas have created a schizophrenic state. Otherwise you are already functioning together. Your body, your mind, your soul -- all are functioning together, there is no problem in it. Just those ideas you have to get rid of, they are rubbish. Existence is one, the body is as much spir itual as the soul is material. The body is the visible soul and the soul is the invisible matter. Bu t it is the same energy. Condensed it becomes matter, and now modern physics has proved it beyond doubt that atoms can become energy, va st energy. In a small atom so much energy. So energy and matter are no more separate in physics. Now they are not talking of separation. Ma tter is simply very condensed energy, that's why it looks solid. And energy is... it is just like you see ice, a solid block of ice. It can melt and can become water, it is no more solid, it is the same thing, it can be heated up and it can become va pors. For a moment you will see them and then they become invisible. All these three states of ice, water and va por are not three different things; it is one thing, one energy mani festing in different ways. So it is not a question of how to try beca use if you are trying that means you have accepted the division already and now yo u who are the soul an d the body who is the CHARVAK, the Zorba, has to be forced . No, just drop the divisions. Live simply -- then eating is spiritual, then having a bath is spiritual, then making love is spiritual, then whatever you do your everything is involved in it: your body, your mind, your soul. The society will be creating disturbance because they cannot conceive that eating can be spiritual, but that's what ch arvaka said: `Eat, drink and be merry!' But nobody has understood the poor man. He is one of the most misunderstood men in India. He is saying \"make an or dinary thing like eating a spiritual rejoicing.\" And the same is true about every action that you are doing. Don't reject anything with condemnation; try to find out something good out of it. I was in jail in America... the first jail th ere were six inmates in my cell. They were very happy because they were seeing me on the television every day and they were just waiting... and the nurses told me, that \"They have went to the department to get good clothes and they had taken bath; and somehow they have heard that you have allergy so they have not used any soap that smells, and they have never been so clean and they have made everything as beautiful as possible in a jail and they are just waiting for you.\" And they were really happy people. Afte r one hour when we were introduced to each other and I said, that \"I have not slept the whole night so let me sleep.\" They said, \"You can sleep. We will not cr eate any disturbance.\" And for one hour they did not even talk to each other.

No wo rk... so we go on playing cards. And we were worried that would you like and allow us to play cards.\" I said, \"There is no harm. In fact, I will join. I don't know the rules. You will have to teach me. And I don't know how many days I have to lay here so this is good teaching, you can teach me.\" They said, \"Really? You mean it? A spiritual person can play cards?\" I said, \"Cards have nothing unspiritual in them and you can play so attentively, so meditatively, that playing cards can become a meditation.\" They said, \"We never thought about it.\" I joined them. They were very mu ch troubled that I am joining. They said, \"Just don't do it for our sake.\" I said, \"Not I, your sake... I am also he re. I don't know how many days these people are going to keep me and playin g cards will be beautiful and you teach me because they will change me from one jail to another jail, so I will know something.\" So they said, \"We will teach you all the tricks, the great tricks -- that will be good.\" They reported to the sheriff that, \"We ha d thought that spirituality is something in the clouds, that is not true. This man can play cards, can learn tricks and we are so happy that you have ch osen us to be with him.\" And when I left they were all crying and weeping. And I said, \"There is no need to cry and weep. If you want I may come again. Just a slight crime I can commit and they will put me back here, there is no problem in it, don't be worried.\" \"No,\" they said, \"no, we don't want you to be back here. Your people must be waiting there. We are thinking that just in three days you became so much part of us that we are crying for you, what will be happening to your people who have been living with you for years?\" And this is from criminals. And I came to know that those criminals are far more human than your politicians and your bu reaucrats and more truthful and more sincere -- to be with them was a joy.

News agency WHAT REALLY SURPRISES ME, SCARES ME, IS THE EXPRESSION OF DEVOTION, THE TREMENDOUS FEELING THAT YOU SEE WHEN YOUR DISCIPLES, FRIENDS AS YOU CALL THEM, COME TO SEE YOU. WHAT IS THE REASON BEHIND THAT? AND DO YOU HAVE THE SAME FEELING WHEN YOU ARE WITH THEM? I love them, but my love does not incl ude emotions or sentiments. In fact, emotions and sentiments bring the quality of love far lower, they are a sacrilege. But I can understand my people. For one thing, I never condemn anything. My acceptance of any person is total. I will explain to my people that love sh ould be far higher than emotions and sentiments, but if somebody starts crying, weeping, sobbing, there is no condemnation of it. It is how he is, it is where he is, it is the only way he can express his love. Perhaps some time he will learn to express better. But for the moment if he represses it that will be bad. I am all for expression. If you feel like crying, cry. The tears that you have been holding beco me heavy on your being. The laughter that you missed will be a weight on your soul. So whatever happens in the moment, give it total expression. This is the way to transcend all things that can pull you from your purity of love. For example, devotion is far lower than love, because devotion basically implies self-disrespect. I am against it becaus e at the cost of self-respect you are respecting somebody else. The cost is t oo much. My whole effort is to teach you to feel dignity as a human being, to feel self-respect as part of this beautiful existence. Love is a totally different phenomenon. It creates a spiritual equality. It does not mean ungratefulness, it does not mean ingratitude. In fact, the best way to express your gratitude, your gratefulness, is to rise to the level of the guide, of the master, of the friend, whatever name you give to him. I prefer the name `friend' because frie ndship is absolutely unmotivated and unending. There will be a time when the function of the guide will be finished"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"and the master will no longer be needed. There has to be a time when the master is not needed. If the master succeeds, he will not be needed. But the friend is not dependent on any such conditions because it is not a need. It is simply a love affair, unendi ng, unmotivated, unconditional. I would like them also to learn to express lo ve at its highest level, but of course it takes time. They are moving; a year ago you may have found a person crying and weeping; this year you may find him laughing and smiling; next year you may find him just expressing everything in pure silence, no gesture, no word. In fact, the higher a value the less is the possibility to express it by anything; it remains inexpressible. It is understood . It is a kind of transference, not a communication. You feel it, it is there lik e fragrance. Nothing is said, nothing is heard, but everything is understood. That's exactly the meaning of the anci ent word `satsanga.' The word is so beautiful; it simply means to be in the presence of the truth. IN THE EVENT OF THE GOVERNME NT TRYING TO DO ANYTHING WHICH IS EVEN A FRACTION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE COULD BE A REAL PROJECTION OF FEELING TOWARDS YOU IN THE STREETS. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? There are a few things to be understood. One: I like to fight alone because then I am stronger and I can fight with all my innocence and with all my purity. I do not want masses to be on the streets in favor of me. My whole approach is individualistic. I am born alone, I will die alone, and between these two alonenesses everything th at you do to deceive yourself that you are not alone is dangerous. Th ere is no way to be not alone. Aloneness has such beauty that the mob, the crowd, can destroy it.

AND WAS A COMMUNE OF THIS TYPE YOUR NECESSITY, OR THE NECESSITY OF YOUR DISCIPLES, OR THE NECESSITY OF THE SOCIETY AT LARGE? First, I was not participating at all. This will be a little difficult to understand -- that things are possible with out participating in them. For example, in the morning the sun rises and the birds start singing. The sun is not a participant: it is not in any way doing anything to the birds, it is not provoking them to sing. The flowers open up -- the sun is not a participant. Scientists had to find a new word for th is, and that word is synchronicity. It means that the very presence, not the part icipation, of the sun makes it possible for the birds to sing, for the flowers to blossom. So I will say I was not participating at all; it was a synchronicity. I was present in my silence -- more so -- and my presen ce helped my people to create the commune. I had discussed the commune for many years, I had given the whole vision, but when it was being built I did not take any active part in it. I was just a presence. So I cannot use the word participation, but I can use the word synchronicity. And that word is in many ways significan t, it opens many new doors, many new meanings. It is possible just to look in somebody 's eyes without saying anything -- he has not heard anything, and yet something has transpired. I have not said, he has not heard, but something has happened. In ancient India we used to call it satsang. The master would simply be present, - - people would sit by his side. Something out of his silence would start changing their hearts, opening their beings. We ha ve known it and we have used it in many ways. Just like satsang, is the wo rd darshan. Somebody goes to see a master.... Now, what is the point of seeing a master? The West up to now has been almost inca pable of understanding what it means, just to go and see Gautam Buddha. Unle ss he speaks, says something, does"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"something, unless there is some communicati on, it is pointless just to see him -- you can see his picture, you can see his statue. But now they are realizing their mistake. The picture is dead, the statue is dead. Gautam Buddha is a living presence of tremendous power, of great love, of immense silence, and the East was absolutely right that there is no need for any communication in words. Just to see this man is a transforming e xperience, as if you have taken a shower. You cannot see what is radiating from the man; it is not visible to the physical eyes. And you cannot hear the music of the ma n, because it is not available to the physical ears. But it is th ere and if you are receptive, open, available, humble enough, nonresistant, then miracles are possible. One man, a great philosopher, came to Bu ddha and asked a series of questions. All the questions were significant, and he wanted Buddha to answer them. He had been to many philosophers and he ha d argued, but nobody had been able to satisfy him. Buddha listened to his qu estions and instead of answering him, asked him, \"To how many people have you asked these questions?\" He said, \"To hundreds -- to anyone who is known as a master, as a saint, as a sage. I have traveled all over the country and no one has been able to satisfy me. My questions remain exactly the same as they were the day I started the journey.\" Buddha said, \"Then listen to me. If I answer them you will not be satisfied; I will also be added to those hundreds of people. But if you really want the answers then you will have to do one thing: for tw o years simply sit silently by my side and just be. After two ye ars I will ask you to repeat your questions.\" Before the man could say anything on e old disciple, Mahakashyapa, started laughing loudly. The stranger asked, \"Why is he laughing?\" Mahakashyapa said, \"I am laughing beca use the same thing happened with me. I had come with questions and he told me to sit silently for two years. I sat silently for two years by his side -- all my qu estions disappeared, all my thoughts disappeared. I became completely a n ew man. After two years he asked me about the questions and I said, 'Forgive me, I don't have any questions. Your silence has silenced them all. I don't ha ve any answer either, but I am immensely fulfilled.' I laughed because if you want to have the answers, this is the time; insist on them now. But if you want sati sfaction then wait for two years -- but you won't get any answers. The questions will disappear.\" And this was the usual practice of Budd ha, to tell people to sit silently. For thousands of years in the East people have been going to masters, to sages, just to see them. That is the meaning of darshan. Any materialist is bound to ask, \"What can you gain just by seeing a man?\" You can gain immensely. It depends on two things: whether the man has something that radiates, whether the center of his being is absolutely silent, whether he has achieved himself, whet her he has come home. And second, are you a little bit receptive to unknown, invisible radiations?"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"I was silent for three and a half years in the commune. I was emphatically silent at that time because I never wanted to interfere with what people were doing. I never wanted to actually participate. I had given the vision to them; now I wanted to give them my energy. Vision they had, energy they needed -- and that energy is not something visible, not something measurable. So I had no participation, but there was a synchronicity. They were joined with me in my silence. I was part of them in my silence. Whatever they were doing, in a very subtle way they were my hands, they were my eyes, and I was all over without ever being physically present anywhere. The second thing you ask: \"Was it your necessity?\" I don't have any need, any necessity. As fa r as I am concerned, I am fulfilled. If this moment I die, I will die with absolu te contentment. Nothing is incomplete. I will not ask even for a single second to complete something. It was certainly for my disciples, the pe ople who have loved me, who have gone a long way with me. They needed a plac e, an energy field rather; five thousand meditators together... it makes a difference. In science they have a parallel. They sa y that at a certain point quantitative change becomes qualitative change. For ex ample, up to ninety-nine degrees the water remains water. One degree more , one hundred degrees, and the water changes; it evaporates. The addition was a quantity, but the change is qualitative. One man can meditate, but if five people meditate together, there is a qualitative strength. And if five thousand people are meditating together, there is an aroma of energy. It is just like a great current which one alone may not be able to cross, but which five thousand people together can cross easily. It was for my sannyasins, and for th ose in the greater society who were interested. There are millions of people in the world who are frustrated, who are living in misery, who have everything th ey need and yet something is missing. Their misery is not of hunger, it is no t of poverty; their misery is something spiritual. So I wanted this commune to become a model -- and we have communes around the world in other countr ies on the same model, functioning in the same way. So for anybody who feels some spiritual thirst, there is a possibility for him to come to the commune. Just the way un iversities function they exist for everybody; but if you are not interested then they are not for you. If you are interested, if you have a thirst for knowledge, the university is available. These communes were spiritual universities for anybody who was feeling a gap in his life and was becoming aware that material things alone are not going to fill it; that something more, something from th e above, something higher is needed. These communes could become for him universities where he could learn meditation, learn how to uncondition his mind, learn how to make his love a purity and come to his own innermost center. So it was not my necessity, but it was certainly the necessity of my sannyasins and it was certainly an open door fo r anybody who was seeking, searching."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" MR. RAJIV GANDHI HAS INVITED THE WHOLE NATION TO CONSIDER AND MEDITATE UPON THE QUES TION OF REFORMS IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. DO YOU HA VE SOME SUGGESTIONS TO OFFER IN THIS REGARD, OR WILL YOU WAIT FOR A FORMAL INVITATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE YOU ANSWER? No formal invitation is needed. In fact I have already been speaking on it. The government has been deaf. It is just stupid of Rajiv Gandhi to as k the people of the country what reforms they think are needed in the educationa l system. In a country where more than eighty percent of the people are uneducat ed, and the ones who are educated are educated just to become clerks, the pe ople cannot suggest anything. If Rajiv Gandhi wants really to change the system then he should call a conference of the leading people who have been involved in education. This education system was started by the British government to create clerks; it was never established to create intelligent people. No government wants intelligent people. Every government want s people to remain retarded, because then it is easier to exploit them, easi er to rule them, easier to avoid any revolution, and easier for very ordinary people to become leaders. The British government managed very beautifully. For twenty-five years, almost one third of his life, a person is processed in such a wa y that he turns out either to be a station master, a head clerk, or a postmaster. These were the needs of the government. It is something to be understood: that a ll the gold medallists in the universities, the people who come first in their subj ects disappear in the world -- you never hear of them again. They should make so me mark. In the university they get the gold medals, but in life they become head clerks. The whole system is wrong. So it is not a question of reforming it, it is a question of revolutionizing it. A real educational system will take care of the whole man; this education system takes care only of the mind. The whole man means the body, the mind, the heart an d the soul. Unless education takes care of all these four in a balanced way, it cannot create an authentic man, a whole man. For example, the university does nothing ab out the body. Much needs to be done with the body because everything else is ba sed on it. It needs not only exercises, yoga, aikido and other systems of trai ning, but also a systematic, scientific approach about food -- because what you eat, you become. No vegetarian has been able to achieve a single Nobel prize. It is a clear-cut condemnation of vegetarianism. Why do all the Nobel prizes go to non- vegetarians? -- because vegetarian food does not contain those proteins which create intelligence. And unless we provide those proteins, intelligence cannot grow. The body is a very delicate phenom enon and it needs a very well balanced diet."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"In my commune, I have added non-fertilized eggs to the vegetarian food. I am a vegetarian and I would like the whole world to become vegetarian -- but not at the cost of risking your intelligence . Non-fertilized eggs fulfill the need completely; in fact, better than non-veget arian food. We should make it a point that non-vegetarian food is not allowed in the universities because to kill, to do violence just for food, is so ugly and so inhuman that you cannot expect these people to behave lovingly, sensitively, humanly. Non-vegetarian food is one of the basic causes of the whole society being almost in a continuo us fight. It makes you insensitive, it makes you hard, it make s you a stone. And it creates things in you -- anger, violence -- which can be easily avoided. Taking care of the body means the body should be given adequate exercise. Students are sitting in the universities the whole day and in the night they have to do their homework and they have to go to the movies. They become just sitting idiots. The body, by nature, is not created just to go on sitting. Students should be walking, running, swimming, c limbing trees, climbing mountains. The bodies should be given a chance to achi eve their natural potential. But the body is a neglected part; nobody is interested in it. We live in the body, but nobody thinks about what we are eating. Now scientists have discovered that ther e are people in th e Soviet Union who have passed the age of one hundred and fifty; there are a few who have reached the age of one hundred and eighty and ar e still working as young people -- old age has not come yet. They have studied wh at they are eating, what is the reason that they are living so long, and they ha ve found a few things which these people -- who are really poor people -- have in their diet. Yoghurt is one of the essential things. The other thing is something like what in Gujarat they call khakhra. These two things seem to be giving them longevity. Now it is such a simple thing to add khakhra and yoghurt to everybody's diet and give him a long life. Certainly when you are wasting twenty-fi ve years in education you should add at least twenty-five years to a person's life. He should live at least one hundred years. Scientists say that as far as the body is concerned it seems to have the capacity to go on renewing itself for three hundred ye ars. So if people are dying at seventy, something is wrong with us. Nothing is wrong with the body, we are just giving it the wrong food, no exerci se or the wrong exercise. So my first concern is the body. Experts in the body, in diet, should be consulted. Taste cannot be the decisive thing; taste can be added to anything. But the basic thing should be the science of the body. Secondly, don't ask the people! What can the people do? That's why I call these politicians cunning. They don't want to do anything about the educational system. Whenever you do not want to do anything, ask the people what reforms they want. What do they know about ed ucation, or the educational system, or about the body, or about the mind, or ab out the heart? What do they know? So nobody will be coming out with any suggestions. And the politician feels"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"perfectly good that he was ready to change, but nobody wants any change. It seems that people are perfectly satisfied. That is not right. The people are not satisfied, but they are not experts. I would like Rajiv Gandhi to ask the expert s. Call a conference first of the people who know about the body, people who ha ve been practicing yoga for years. Learn from their experience. Every university should have some yoga class which is required for everybody. Ask people in Japan who know about aikido -- a totally different kind of discipline concerned with the body -- or ju jitsu. Ask them, because they have managed to create a body as solid as st eel. Ask all over the world, because in every country there is a certain system which has been followed for centuries and has accumulated a wisdom. There is no need to remain confined to one country; wisdom from everywhere should be the base of the revolution in education. Ask people who have been wo rking with diets, who have found what kind of food makes people healthier. Ask why forty percent of Nobel prizes go to Jews. They are not that big a population in the world; it is absolutely out of proportion. Something is strange! The Jews say -- and now it is being accepted more and more even by Christians -- that it is because of their circumcisi on: circumcision helps the intelligence. The Jewish child is circumcised shortly after he is born. Medical science has accepted it as hygienic. It is less probab le for a circumcised man to have diseases of the genitalia. But Jews have been sa ying that when the child is born, to circumcise the child, to cut the thin small skin, hits his intelligence center. This is an ancient tradition with the Jews. There is a possibility, and it should be explored, because their intelligence proves that there is something different in Jews. It is possible -- I have been thinki ng about it -- because the centers of sex are not in the genitalia, they are in the head. There are seven hundred centers in the head. The sex center is just next to the intelligence center -- so close, almost touching. Naturally, when a small child's skin is cut he gets a shock. Perhaps that shock gives a certain strength to the intelligence center. This should be researched. If it is so, then it is no t a question of whether you are a Jew; everybody should be circumcised. No un iversity should accept anybody who is not circumcised. Just as we have to think about the body and its tremendous impact on the whole personality of man, we also have to th ink about mind. Why, after twenty-five years wasted in education, are you crea ting pygmies? Something is wrong, and my understanding is -- because I have been a teacher in the university -- that the whole teaching is based on belief. Belie f is a poison. It does not allow your intelligence to grow. Belief should be si mply removed and replaced by doubt, because it is doubt, it is skepticism, that sharpens your intelligence. I was expelled from many colleges simply because I was not ready to believe anything unless I was convinced intellectua lly. Just because you are saying it... You may be a great professor, you may be a very respected professor -- all that is"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"granted -- but anything you say you have to support by the best of argumentation. You should not ask that it be accepted on belief. I was expelled from one college because the professor threatened the principal that he would resign if I was not expelle d. He said that for eight months I had not allowed him to teach anything. The principal called me and asked, \"Why are you creating so much disturbance?\" I said, \"I have not created any disturbanc e. I am simply asking that he should give an argument for whatever he says; ot herwise he should not say it. He says that his concern is to finish the course. My concern is to sharpen my intelligence; I am not concerned with his course. What am I going to do with his course? And he has not been able to give any argumen t even for simple things that he says. For example, he says that Aristotle was th e father of logic in the West. It is an assumed fact, repeated at almost a ll the universities around the world. \"I asked him, `Do you know that Aristo tle wrote that women have fewer teeth than men? And are you aware that Aris totle had two wives? He could have asked either of his wives to just open her mouth and count her teeth. Men and women have the same number of teeth. I cannot accept as a man of logic a man who has two wives and writes that wome n have fewer teeth than men! I cannot accept him as the father of Western lo gic. He is simply superstitious -- the woman has to be less in everything.' So in Greece it was an accepted fact that women have fewer teeth. Neither any wo man nor any man ever counted. I asked him, `You have read Aristotle's life and it did not disturb you?' \"He said, `It did not. I simply read his statement and the fact that he had two wives.' \"I said, `Did you not bother to count yo ur wife's teeth? A wife is not such a difficult thing to find.' This man is not logical.\" I said to the principal, \"Tell me, who is creating trouble? He should accept that Aristotle is not logical, he is superstitious. Once it is agreed he can go on further. If he does not accept it, every day I am going to stand there and ask, `What about Aristotle?'\" And now science has proved that the whole Aristotelian logic is wrong. They have developed a new system of logic, th e same way as they have created a new system of geometry. For centuries they have been teaching and nobody has bothered to argue, for the simple reason that our whole approach is to believe. The professor knows and we do not know . Why waste time? -- he knows and we accept. The universities should be more inte lligent, professors should give more emphasis to discussion, to doubt, and they should destroy completely any textbook belief system. Those books should be removed; then you would see an explosion of intelligence. But to doubt seems to be doing somethin g evil, and to have faith seems to be very spiritual and very religious. Just the re verse is the case. To have faith is evil; to doubt is natural. Go on doubting un til you come to an indubitable fact."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"So universities have to change their wh ole attitude about doubt and belief. And it is not important that you pass the examination; those five examination questions can be answered by a person who knows nothing else. I am against examinations because they create a tota lly wrong approach. The student becomes only interested in passing the examinatio n. So rather than reading the book, he looks for a shorter version or a key. Th e professor has answered questions which are probable examination questions, so th e students read just these and nothing else. Their intelligence remains retarded. It is the examination system that creates a wrong attitude. My idea is that students should be given credit by each professor, every day, just the way they take attendance. And the cr edit should be given according to the intelligence shown by the student. Our whole system depends on how much you can memorize, not on intelligence. But memory is not something great; a computer can do it. And soon there will be no need of any memory; you can just have a small computer in your pocket and any answer you need will be immediately available. Why waste time and life and torture people about memory when memory has nothing to do with intelligence? Right now, our education system is based on memory. I would like it to be based on intelligence. Every professor should give credits every day, not just at the end of the year, because that creates trouble. Students don't take any interest for the whole year; just for one month at the end th ey are torturing themselves trying to learn everything at once. I would like th em to get credits every day, and if somebody is intelligent enough to get enough credit in six months to pass to another class, why make him waste six months more in the same class? The moment he gets the required credits he moves into the next class. So nobody passes, nobody fails; people simply move . Somebody may take more than twelve months before passing into the next class. Then the university becomes a movi ng phenomenon. People are moving according to their intelligence, and there are no fixed barriers. This is good because with barriers fixed, a very stran ge thing happens: th e most intelligent student has to keep pace with the idiot. The idiot and the intelligent person each have twelve months in the class; the lowest denominator in the class is determining the pace for everybody. It is not right; it is sheer violence against intelligence. If the idiot wants to stay in the class two or three years, it is up to him. But it is my experience that whatev er courses universities are teaching for one year are not worth more than two mo nths. Any intelligent person can pass them in two months. Those other ten months are sheer wastage. And in those ten months students will do all kinds of harm. Th ey will strike and they will rape and they will burn the co llege and they will beat the teachers, because they have energy and energy n eeds some expression. You are just keeping those people closed in small ce lls, in small classes. They don't have anything to do, because they know that if they study just one month or two months, at the end they will pass."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Instead of memory, intelligence. It is very significant that people of very good memory are not the people of very good intelligence. Memory functions mechanically and intelligence functions non-mechanically. People of great intelligence are not necessarily of very good memory. For example, Albert Einstein would -- forget to get out of hi s bathtub. Six hours he would remain in his bathtub, unless his wife created great trouble and knocked on the door: \"It is too much, six hours! What are you doing there?\" He said, \"Six hours have passed? I was thinki ng that it is my usual, normal bath.\" He was the greatest mathematician the world has known. But one day he got on a bus and gave some money. The co nductor gave him back the change. He counted the change and said to the conductor, \"This is not right. You are cheating me!\" The conductor counted again and said, \"It is perfectly right, I am not cheating you. It seems you don't know how to count.\" He remembers in his memoirs that, \"He wa s right. When I went home I told my wife, and she said, `He was right, yo u were wrong. But how did you miss?'\" He said, \"Because in my mind I was co ncerned with faraway stars and I was not there counting.\" So it is possible that memory and inte lligence are different phenomena. And it has always happened that people of gr eat memory have never been of great intelligence, and people of very great intelligence have not been of great memory. The mind should be moved from belief to doubt, to skepticism, to intelligence. So examinations should be removed and the students should be mobile, depending on credits the professors give every day. Nobody fails, nobody passes; it is only a question of time: two months sooner or two months later. This will also help to destroy the inferiority complex that yo u create in people who fail, and the superiority complex in the people who co me out on top. Both are dangerous, both are sicknesses. There is no question of anybody being superior or anybody being inferior. The heart is absolutely neglected just as the body is. No univer sity bothers that a man will be dry, juiceless if his heart is not functioning. They are just concerned with the mind. Students should be taug ht music, dance, painting, and these things should not be optional. What is necessary for the whole development of man should not be optional. They should be taught poetry -- whether they are students of science or commerce or art do es not matter. Poetry is not only for poets. Every scientist should know poetry, because poetry helps your heart to open to experiences which are not availa ble from mathematics. Music takes you to heights which geography cannot do. And finally the soul, which also is absolutely forgotten, should be taken care of. For the soul there is a simple thing: ever y student has to meditate one hour each day. There should be a professor of meditation teaching students how to meditate. And if a student goes to the un iversity six years, in six years, just one"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"hour every day devoted to meditation and he will become a man of immense silence and peace and beauty and love. I call this an absolute necessity. My final suggestion is that the government should call four conferences, one for each part of the human personality. E xperts should suggest what can be done; the masses cannot suggest. If you are sincere in a desire to change, then ask the experts. There are thousands of meditato rs in the world, there are one hundred and twelve methods of meditation. Let all those people be invited. Find out the most simple method of meditation and let it be introduced in all the universities. And do the same in the other areas. We ca n really make the university a place of immense spiritual revolution. And a new man can come out of the university. Right now, a man just comes out seeking employment. This is a condemnation of our whole system.   "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Last Testament, Vol 5 Chapter #14 Chapter title: None 28 December 1985 pm in Kulu/Manali, India [NOTE: This discourse will be in the book \"India Coming Back Home\", which has not been published, as of August 1992.] INTERVIEW BY THE DAILY (BOMBAY) THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT OF TAKING SANNYAS, BUT I AM AFRAID. WHY? It is not only your question; there are millions of people who are in the same position. The fear is very fundamental. To be init iated into sannyas means dropping so many things you have loved, liked, and become identified with. For example, a Mohammedan, a Hindu, a Christian -- the first fear is what will happen to their Christianity, to their Hinduism? My sannyas simply means that you drop all the conditionings that have been imposed upon you after you were born -- because nobody is born a Hindu, a Christian, a Buddhist. Every child is ju st a human being, but there are vested interests all around who impinge on th e child, trespass his privacy, start conditioning him, continually emphasize syst ems of belief. By the time he is able to think, those systems of belief have gone so deep that they have almost become his blood, his bones, his marrow. Now he cannot think about Christianity as an objective thing; he thinks as a Christian, as a Hindu, and that is not thinking. To think as a Christian means you have already accepted a certain prejudice. Your mind is not unprejudiced, not open, not av ailable to the new facts that may arise in the inquiry. Sannyas makes people afraid. Psychologically it will take away all their toys that they think are very valuable but which are simply rubbish. Unless a truth is known by you, experienced by you, unless you are an eye-witness, it is not a truth. It is only a toy, and it is better to destroy it because it is hindering the way to truth. So this psychological fear is there, and then there are social fears. You live in society, you work in society, and the people, the crowd, never want anybody to be different from them. The different person means a stranger; he does not belong to them. They will not accept him, they will try in every way to crush him, destroy him. So when you become a sannyasin in so ciety you are taking a risk, you are declaring, \"I am an individual, I am not on ly a cog in the wheel. I am not just part"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"of the crowd; I am myself.\" This create s the fear that you are alone in a vast crowd of people, and one starts wondering how so many people can be wrong. One Catholic leaves the Catholic fold. There are six hundred million Catholics in the world. How can six hundred million Catholics be wrong? And am I right against such a vast majority? We have been told, particularly by people with a very wrong idea of democracy, that wherever the majority is, truth is. The minority, just by being the minority, loses its truth. But in the real existential world truth is always individual, it has nothing to do with majority or minority. Those who have found, have found alone, not as a crowd, not as a company, not as a church. So these are the fears that go on deep into the unconscious, but the urge to become a sannyasin is far more import ant than all these fears. One thing is certain: wherever you are, you are not co ntent. Whatever you are, you cannot say that you have achieved the meaning of yo ur life. Whatever you are doing may be giving you a means of living but it is not giving you life itself. So there are fears and there is that cons tant urge to seek and to search. And I hope that the fears will not be the winners, because anybody who lives out of fears, lives not; he is already dead. Fear is part of death, not of life. Risk, adventure, going into the unknown, is what life means. So try to understand your fears. And re member one thing: don't support them, they are your enemies. Support the urge th at is still alive in you, make it aflame so that it can burn all those fears and you can move into seeking. Sannyas is nothing but a name for becomi ng an individual seeker -- declaring that Buddha may have attained the truth, but that is not my truth; Mahavira may have attained the truth, but that is not my truth. If somebody else has eaten the food that does not mean that I am nourished; I am still hungry. Millions of people have found the truth, but truth is something which remains individual and cannot be given as a thing to somebody else; you have to find it on your own. I think it is one of the most significant gifts of existence that it has not made truth a commodity. Otherwise, there would have been shops in the market where you could purchase truth. You cannot purchase truth at any price. You will have to seek it. And the sooner the fears are dropped the better, because as you go on growing you are growing closer to death. The fears will become more powerful every day and your life energy will become less strong every day. So the sooner you decide and get out of the imprisonment of fears, the better. I VISITED THE ASHRAM IN POONA AND OFTEN HEARD THE WORD 'ENERGY'. -- PLEASE EX PLAIN WHAT ENERGY IS? There are things which can only be e xperienced and cannot be explained. For example, electricity is energy, but nobody has seen electricity in its purity, as energy. You have seen it in a lamp, as light; you have seen it moving a machine,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"a train; you have seen many manifestatio ns of its work, but nobody has yet been able to see what it is that works. I am reminded of Thomas Alva Edison. He was the first man to make the electric bulb; it took him three years. He was vi siting a small village, and, just by coincidence, the village school was having an annual celebration and the school children had made many things to show the public. Having nothing else to do in that village, Edison went. One boy was explaining about electricity. He had made a small electric train running on a track on the table. Edison naturally went to the boy and asked, \"How does it work?\" The boy said, \"It is electricity. It is energy that is making the train move.\" Edison said, \"I understand, but what is electricity? What is energy?\" The boy said, \"This is too much, I don't know. Perhaps my teacher, who has a master's degree in Physical Science from a well-known university, may have the answer. I will fetch him, sir, you just wait a minute.\" He brought the teacher and the teacher said, \"We know how it functions, we don't know what it is. I am sorry to disappoint you that we cannot answer a simple question, but perhaps the principa l, who is a Doctor of Science from Harvard, perhaps he may. Just wait a minute.\" Edison said, \"I can wait as long as you want, but I want the answer.\" And the principal came and he said, \"T here is only one man, Thomas Alva Edison, who may perhaps know the answer. We don't know the answer.\" Edison said, \"That means nobody knows th e answer because I am Thomas Alva Edison. And you are right, I only know ho w it acts, I don't know what it is.\" And the same is true about the word 'energy'. You may have heard my sannyasins continuously talking about it, and naturally you must have thought at least 'Thomas Alva Edison' knows the answer. But I don't know! I can only say how it works. Man's body is an energy phenomenon. Ev erything is energy: matter exists no more. Friedrich Nietzsche declared in th e heyday of materialism that God is dead, but as we penetrated deeper and d eeper into the mysteries of matter the whole idea about matter has changed. Now modern physics says there is no thing such as matter. In Friedrich Nietzs che's terms it can be said \"matter is dead.\" Perhaps God may be alive; about that we are still undecided. But matter is certainly dead, because it has been foun d that the more you divide matter into molecules, atoms, electrons, it turns in to energy. And the ol d division between energy and matter has to be dropped. Matter is energy at such a tremendous speed that you cannot see it as en ergy, you see it as solid matter. It is just like a fan which has three wings to it. You can move the fan so fast that you may not be able to see those three wing s. It can become just a circle -- they are moving so fast that they are creating an illusion of solidity. So everything in existence today is en ergy. The human body has its own bio- energy. You may have experienced, wi thout paying much attention, that sometimes you shake hands with a person and you feel as if you are shaking"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"hands with a dead branch of a tree -- no life, no warmth. And you know others also, to shake hands with them is a joy -- so much love, so much energy radiating from the small handshake. It has been known experimentally that a child can be given food, comfort, everything after birth that he needs, but he will die within th ree months unless a woman's bio-energy is made available to him -- he shrinks. Now it cannot be said what this bio-en ergy is, but we can see from the results that the child is in constant need of a feminine body. Something transpires between these two bodies which is not visible to our eyes, just like x-rays. Many experiments have been done, and it has been found that without the mother's physical touch the child cannot survive. And even if he survives his survival will be only minimal. He will ne ver be able to laugh, he will never be able to enjoy, he will never be able to love, he will never be able to dance and sing -- that energy is missing. Something in him is hollow. He is just empty, he has nothing to give. There are children who are so much full of energy that they are a trouble in the family, they are always doing something or other -- running all over the place for no reason at all, just to throw off a load of energy. Energy is our basic constituent. Its expr essions may be different: it may express as love, it may express as laughter, it may express as silence. When sannyasins talk about energy they are talking about a special implication, implementation, of this energy. They are all meditating, and meditati on certainly gives the energy a new dimension. It immediately starts moving around the person, and if many persons are meditating it becomes an energy field. Those who are open can just enter into the group and, they will be surprised, just as you touch an open wire of electricity and it gives you a shock, in an energy field if you are open you can feel it immediately engulfing you, overpowering you. This makes many people afraid of coming to the communes, coming to the sannyasins -- they think it is something like mesmerism or hypnotis m. It is neither hypnotism nor mesmerism, it is simply that so many people have pooled their energy in their silence that when you enter into the gr oup you cannot remain unaffected by it. That's why I said, \"It can be experienced but it cannot be explained.\" And all these communes that I have been creati ng around the world are just for that single purpose. Anybody who wants what this energy is can be a guest in a commune for seven days, mix with the co mmune for seven days, and feel it. You will know what it is, but you will not be able to tell anybody else what it is. The ultimate always is beyond explanat ion. But it is not beyond experience. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LOCAL PEOPLE AND GETTING THE FEELING THAT THEY WANT YOU TO STAY HE RE FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST THEY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE A SPIR ITUAL MASTER, AND SECOND"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT HIMACH AL PRADESH WILL PROSPER IF YOU ARE HERE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT? They are absolutely right. Himachal Prad esh can become richer both spiritually and materially, but their politicians may not want it to happen. And those poor people of Himachal Pradesh have approached me. From Manali the Panchayat leaders, from Mandi the Bar Association, and from other sources representations have been made to the chief minister th at every facility should be given to me. The people of Himachal Pradesh are simp le-hearted, very loving, but immensely poor. Their lovingness and their simp leness and their innocence recognize something in me which they call a spir itual master. And they can understand without even knowing the ABC's of econom ics that if I am here, thousands of tourists will be coming here. In America in one year there were fifty thou sand tourists from all over the world. Here the number will be double becaus e America was too costly for people to visit. If one hundred thousand people come and stay in Himachal Pradesh for two or three months certainly the economy of Himachal Pradesh will have a tremendous upsurge. And if the governme nt is courageous enough to allow me to have a commune here, the people of Himachal Pradesh also can learn that poverty is not something destined by God, that it is our own creation. They can see that the commune can create wealth, ca n create richness. They can learn from the commune and they can apply what th ey learn to their own lives and their own economic endeavors. Within ten ye ars we can change the whole shape of Himachal Pradesh. It can rea lly become a valley of gods. But the crucial question is, will the politicia ns like it to become a valley of gods? I don't think so. They don't want it to happe n anywhere, because it is easy to rule over the poor, it is easy to purchase the vote of the poor. It will be more difficult if the people are richer and if the commu ne can become a university for the poor, teaching crafts. The politician will find that he has fallen by the wayside, somebody else has taken his place. So I don't think that the government w ill allow me to have a commune here. And I cannot do anything alone without a commune. I need my people who can do everything and change things. The local people have approached the chief minister and I have received the information that he has shown his willingn ess, but just in a political way. He said, \"It all depends on central governme nt. Unless I get a green signal from the center I cannot do anything.\" The American government is putting pressu re on the Indian government that I should not be allowed to make a commune. The American senate has sent a message to the Indian government that they can let me live here, but, \"don't allow foreigners to be there and don't allow the people who can create a commune to be there -- otherwise you w ill be in the same difficulty that we were in."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"So my feeling is that Indian politicians don't have the guts to allow me to stay. Otherwise I am ready and I am willing to change this whole valley and its shape. It is really a sad sight when you ente r and you see the poor houses, the poor shops, as if you are entering something fi ve thousand years old. It does not show any contemporariness. When you see the poor people they are nice, they are simple, but they are suffering. But the po litician wants things to remain exactly as they are; they want to maintain the status quo because that has given them power. If something changes in the country it is bound to be reflected sooner or later in their power. PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS YOUR TE ACHING. WHY DOES IT SEEM TO APPEAL MOST TO WESTERN PEOPLE AND HOW DO YOU ENVISAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR WORK IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS? It appeals to the Western people for the simple reason that I am not basing my teaching on faith, on any kind of belie f. It is a purely intelligent approach towards reality. The Eastern mind is accustomed to belief. Faith has been emphasized for centuries; to doubt is a sin and to believe is a virtue. To me the reverse is the case: to doubt is virtue and to believe is sin. It is appealing to the Western intelligen tsia, particularly the young generation which is completely fed up with all kinds of beliefs -- political, religious, social -- because they have seen that those beliefs are nothing but systems of exploitation, methods of creating spiritual slavery in man. Eastern intelligence is lagging far behind but those who are intelligent in the East are certainly influenced by them. Then th ere is no difference between the East and the West. The question is, are you in telligent enough to drop believing, are you intelligent enough to search on your own without any prejudice, without being a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian? I simply don't give them any catechism to cling to, I don't give them any discipline. I don't say to them, \"This has to be done and this has not to be done.\" My whole approach is different. I simply explain to them how you can be in a peaceful, non-tense, blissful state of mind and out of that state of mind it is impossible to do anything wrong. So you will be decisive in what you want to do. If this basic state of mind is create d in you then you will do only the right, then you will behave as a human being is expected to behave. Certainly people who have already accepted that there is a God have stopped searching. They are no more seekers; thei r seeking has stopped. They have come to a conclusion, and the conclusion is borrowed. I don't tell them there is a God or a heav en or hell, I simply tell them that they have a potential to be in a hell or to be in a heaven. These are not geographical places but psychological states. And if yo u are in heaven you cannot do anything"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"wrong, that is just impossible -- your very peace will become compassion, your very silence will become love, your actions will show your inner being. So my teaching is basically individual -- the transformation of individual consciousness to more silent, blissful spaces. Then whatever happens to you, through you, from that space is virtue, is religiousness. Surely these teachings need intelligent people to understand them. I cannot go to villagers and talk about these things; it will be simply wasting their time and my time. So whosoever is capable of understand ing things of the highest order of consciousness, whether Eastern or Western, is bound to be attracted. Of course, more Western people will be attracte d because more Western people are educated, know the taste of freedom, have a certain individuality, have a certain courage.... Everest is Indian, but it had to be co nquered by Edmund Hillary. Nine hundred million Indians, only one Everest, but a man had to come from the West to conquer it. And he was not the first West ern man; for fifty years continuously Western young people had been coming an d many, almost all of them, died in the effort. But that did not prevent them , they kept on coming, and finally one managed it. You don't ask why an Indian did not reach th e moon first, except in jokes. I have heard that when for the first time th e American landed on the moon he was surprised to see a few Indians sitting th ere, smoking beedies. He asked them, \"My God, how did you manage to get here?\" They said, \"It is a simple matter. One In dian stands on another Indian, then another Indian, and this way we reached here. The question is, \"How did you manage to get here?\" Except in jokes, you never ask why -- why not an Indian? It is simple. For two thousand years we have been slaves. We have learned the ways of slavery. We have been condit ioned to believe, and science starts with doubt; that is a gap which is unbridgeable -- you will have to drop believing and you will have to drop your slave mentality; you will have to come out of your past. Every Indian is carrying his load of past which is tremendous. He is dying under its weight but he thinks it is his tr easure. He may be killed by it but he will not drop it. The west for three hundred years has move d away into a totally new dimension. The day Gallileo declared that the earth is round and not flat as stated in the Holy Bible, was a turning point for the whole Western intelligence. Then Copernicus declared that the sun does no t go around the earth but the earth goes around the sun. Whatever your religious scriptures say it does not matter, we will have to change the scriptures accordin g to existence. We are going to listen to reality and not to all your old beliefs.

In a public meeting in Nagpur, I said th at I cannot accept Krishna as a perfect incarnation of God for the simple reason that he is a man who propagates a philosophy of violence. Th e whole GITA is a philosophy of violence. I am absolutely astounded that Gandhi went on reading Gita every morning, calling Gita his mother, and his philosophy was nonviolence. Gita is the purest philosophy of violence. If Gita has any connection it has connection with Friedrich Nietzsche and Adolf Hitler. Krishna, Friedrich Nietzsche, Adolf Hitler - - that is the trinity. Not a single Gandhian has answered it and not a single follower of Krishna has answered it. I said in the same talk that Krishna behaved very inhumanely. He had sixteen thousand wives and these were not virgin girls that he had married, these were married women who had husbands, children , families, and he simply snatched away any woman that he liked, any wo man that was beautiful -- he simply forced that woman to his palace withou t bothering what happened to her family.

DO YOU THINK THAT THE GOVERNMEN T OF INDIA IS CREATING A SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD BE FORC ED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY? IS THIS PART OF AN INTERNATI ONAL CONSPIRACY AGAINST YOUR ORGANIZATION, AND WHAT STEPS DO YOU PROPOSE TO TAKE TO MOBILIZE PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST IT? India is my mother country, and a mother may be bad or good, alive or dead, but she is still the mother. The Indian government should not force me to leave this country, for the simple reason that wherever I am in the world I am going to be a problem for the Indian government. The safest thing for the Indian government is that I should be here, and I have not seen any indications that they are trying to force me out. Yes, I have seen that there is an intern ational conspiracy to keep me as far away from my disciples as possible. For that, it 's a good idea to k eep me in India and refuse visas to all foreign disciples of mine. That's what is being done. An international conspiracy cannot destro y my organization because there is no such thing in existence. It is simply a movement. I am against organizations. But the conspiracy is there because my move ment of sannyas is for the freedom of the individual, freedom of expression, freedom of movement around the world, because it is one world and we should not be debarred by political lines. My movement is basically a process of deprogramming. Hence, all the religions are against it because the Christian or the Hindu or the Mohammedan entering my movement just becomes a human being. And as far as mobilizing the masses to fight against such a conspiracy, my movement is not a movement of the masses; it consists only of the intelligen tsia. Why should I drag the masses into it? And I don't want it to be in any way violent or political. If anything has to be done against this conspiracy, it is just to expose it, and the exposure will be the end of it. Conspiracies cannot live in the light; they need darkness WHAT SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT OF IN DIA DO SO THAT THE INDIAN PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT FROM YOUR TEACHINGS?."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" The first thing is that if the government of India really wants the people to be benefited by my teachings, they should make every effort that I should not have to leave the country. Secondly, in case I have to go out of the country, they should make me available on all the news media to reach the masses in India. Ri ght now it is not very democratic because eighty percent of the people cannot read. Only newspapers are in private hands, so that means that only twenty percent of the country has the benefit of freedom of expression. The radio is the government's, and one hundred percent of people can hear; the television is the government's, and one hu ndred percent of people can see. If the government thinks really democratically then television and radio should not be under government control. The news media are such a force to protect the rights of the people that the government should not keep it under its own control. It needs guts, but a government has enough control and enough power already, so why should it be afraid? In fact, it should learn to give freedom to all methods of news in the hands of the people. It will be benefited by how people are thinking, what they are thinking, how many viewpoi nts there can be about one thing. The government will be benefited and the people will be immensely protected. So I would like them to make the news media available to me as it is available throughout the world. COULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY FOR US YOUR CONCEPT OF NEO- SANNYAS, AS COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF SANNYAS WHICH IS PREVALENT IN THIS COUNTRY? The old sannyas means renunciation of life. It is anti-life. It is because of this anti- life attitude that India has remained a slave for two thousand years, has suffered all kinds of indignities, has remained the poorest nation in the world. I blame all your religions for keeping Indi a in such a miserable state because the moment you start thinking of renouncing life, you stop being creative. That's why, although we were the first in the world to invent mathematics, we could not produce an Albert Einstein. We shou ld have produced an Albert Einstein nearly three thousand years ago, but this anti-life attitude that all is illusory, matter is illusory, the world is illusory, naturally created a climate in the country that was very uncreative. We were the first in the whole world to discover the science of astronomy, but the \"anti\" attitude stopped it. What is the point of learning about the stars? -- it is all illusory. We were the first to develop surgery and invent surgical instruments, and yet we could not develop a medica l science. Naturally, the body is something you have to be against. So on the one hand it destroyed India's intelligence; on the other hand it created a false kind of contentment in every misery, every suffering, poverty, disease, sickness, old age, death. That's why we"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"have suffered so much but have not been able to go throug h a real authentic revolution. So I am absolutely against the old idea of sannyas. My vision of sannyas is just the opposite of the old. The old is renuncia tion of life; my sannyas is rejoicing in life, but rejoicing in such a way that yo u still remain aloof -- dancing, but deep down inside you there is a center, unmovi ng. In other words, you should be in the world but the world should not be in you. There is a certain relationship between the ancient tradition of tantra and my philosophy. Tantra is perhaps the only tradition in the wh ole universe which accepts man in his totality, which does not condemn anything but, on the contrary, tries to transform everythi ng to higher levels of being. Man is born of sex: his every cell is full of sexual energy. The more sexual a man, the greater the possibility of him being cr eative. For example, you cannot find in the whole history of man a single impo tent man becoming self-realized or becoming a great painter or musician or da ncer or scientist or poet. It is strange that we have ignored the question of why the impotent man has never been creative. Certainly he is missing crea tive energy. And th e whole credit for answering the question goes to tantra. Almost five thousand years ago it recognized sex as the basic energy of ma n and it discovered almost everything about sexual energy. If it moves downwards -- that is, if it is moving with instinct s and biology -- then it reproduces life. It is not committing a sin, it produces children. Otherwise we would not be here. It is good that our fo refathers did not listen to the idiots who were teaching against sex. Otherwise none of us would have had any possibility of being here. But they did not lis ten to them, so life continues. Those who have listened to them have become monks, nuns -- they have created all kinds of perversions. Homosexuality was born in monasteries -- Buddhist, Christian, Jaina, Hindu -- because you ca nnot change something natural just by taking a vow of celibacy. Your biology does not listen to your vow; it does not know that you have become a celibate. It goes on producing sexual energy and that sexual energy needs expression. And a ll the religions took people away from life, closed them in monasteries, se parated man from woman, and naturally created the situation where sooner or later women will become lesbians, men will become homosexuals. And now the ultimate result has come -- AIDS. I call all the religions responsible for it. And all the governments are resp onsible for it because they have not created a law against celibacy. Celibacy should be a crime! Anything against nature should be a crime. Tantra says that energy moving downwards is reproductive of children -- nothing is wrong in it; but the same energy can do much more, it can move upwards too. And there are simple medita tions in which the sexual energy starts turning upwards. There is recent research that our sexual center is not in the genitals, it is in the mind. So if the energy starts turning towards the mind it"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"again creates something, it creates a new man out of you, it makes you luminous, it makes you tremendously blissful and, ultimately, it brings you to the point where you can experience the meaning of life. I am simply astounded that five thousand years before there were people in this country of such tremendously revoluti onary minds. If I am condemned even now, what must have happened to those people? And tantra is not my only teaching, it is just a drop in the ocea n. Tantra was their whole teaching. But it seems that before Buddha and Mahavira, In dia had a respect for exploration, for the unknown, for people who bring new fa cts of life to light. Before Buddha and Mahavira sannyas was exactly what I am ma king it now, it was life affirmative. The seers and the rishis of the UPANISHADS were all married people, they had children, they were not celibates and they had not renounced life. They had all the comforts in the GURUKULAS fo r themselves, for their students. But Buddha and Mahavira created a tremendous calamity for the country. These two persons I respect in many ways but I cannot forgive them for giving the idea of a sannyas which is anti-life. And as these two people gave the anti-lif e idea of sannyas, Hindus followed suit because their sannyasins started lookin g poor. In comparison to a Buddhist monk or a Jaina monk, the Hindu sannyasins started questionning having a wife and children and a house -- so what is the difference between him and another ordinary household man? Those other people are real saints. So that gave a turn to the Hindu mind also, that the Hindu sannyasin had to become a celibate; and Shankaracharya is responsible for it. These three names I cannot forgive: Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, Shankaracharya. These three people, unknowingly, have proven the greatest enemies of this country. My whole effort is to restore a beautiful idea of sannyas that was alive in the days of Upanishads, in the days of VEDAS. But so much time has passed that whatever I say looks as if it is new. In fact, truth is never new, never old, it is always the same. It has to be discovered again and again -- if you lose track of it, it has to be discovered again.

GOD BECAME MEANINGLESS AND ONLY MEDITATION WAS IMPORTANT. NOW, TWENTY-FIVE CENTURIES AFTER BUDDHA, AGAIN RELIGION IS TAKING THE QUANTUM LEAP IN YO UR PRESENCE AND BECOMING RELIGIOUSNESS. PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON. The credit of bringing a quantum leap in religion goes back twenty-five centuries before Gautam Buddha to Adinatha, who for the first time preached a religion without God. It was a tremendous revo lution because nowh ere in the whole world had it ever been conceived that religion could exist without God. God has been an essential part -- the cent er -- of all the religions: Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism. But to make God the center of religion makes man just the periphery. To conceive of God as the creator of the world makes man only a puppet. That's why in Hebrew, which is the language of Judaism, man is called Adam. 'Adam' means mud. In Arabic man is call ed 'admi'; it is fr om Adam, again it means mud. In English, which has become the language of Christianity by and large, the word human comes from 'humus' and humus means mud. Naturally if God is the creator he has to create from something. He has to make man like a statue, so first he makes man with mud and then breathes life into him. But if this is so man loses all dign ity, and if God is the creator of man and everything else, the whole idea is whimsi cal because what has he been doing for eternity before he created man and the universe? According to Christianity he created man only four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ. So what was he doin g all along through eternity? So it seems whimsical. There cannot be any cause, because to have a cause for which God had to create existence means there are po wers higher than God, there are causes which can make him create. Or there is a possibility that suddenly desire arose in him. That too is not very philosophica lly sound, because for eternity he was desireless. And to be desireless is so blissf ul that it is impossible to conceive that out of an experience of eternal blissfulne ss a desire arises in him to create the world. Desire is desire, whether you want to make a house or become the prime"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"minister or create the world. And God cannot be conceived as having desires. So the only thing that remains is that he is whimsical, eccentric. Then there is no need for cause and no need for desire -- just a whim. But if this whole existence is just ou t of a whim it loses all meaning, all significance. And tomorrow another whim may arise in him to destroy, to dissolve the whole universe. So we are simply puppets in the hands of a dictatorial god who has all the powers but who has not a sane mind, who is whimsical. To conceive this five thousand years ag o Adinatha must have been a very deep meditator, contemplative, and he must ha ve come to the conclusion that with God there is no meaning in the world. If we want meaning in the world then God has to be disposed of. He must ha ve been a man of tremendous courage. People are still worshipping in the churches , in the synagogues, in the temples; yet that man Adinatha five thousand years before us came to a very clear-cut scientific conclusion that there is nothin g higher than man and any evolution that is going to happen is within man and in his consciousness. This was the first quantum leap -- God was disposed of. Adinatha is the first master of Jainism. The credit does not go to Buddha because Buddha comes twenty-five centuries later th an Adinatha. But another credit goes to Buddha. Adinatha disposed of God but could not manage to put meditation in its place. On the contrary, he created a sceticism, austerities, torturing the body, fasting, remaining naked, eating only once a day, not drinking in the night, not eating in the night, eating only cert ain foods. He had come to a beautiful philosophical conclusion but it seems th e conclusion was only philosophical, it was not meditational. When you depose God you cannot have any ritual, you cannot have worship, you cannot have prayer; something has to be substituted. He substituted austerities, because man became the center of his religion and man has to purify himself. Purity in his conception was that man has to detach himself from the world, has to detach himself from his ow n body. This distorted the whole thing. He had come to a very significant conclusion, but it remained only a philosophical concept. Adinatha disposed of God but left a vacuum, and Buddha filled it with meditation. Adinatha made a godless religion, Buddha made a meditative religion. Meditation is Buddha's contribution. The qu estion is not to torture the body; the question is to become more silent, to become more relaxed, to become more peaceful. It is an inward journey to reac h to one's own center of consciousness, and the center of one's own consciousness is the center of the whole existence. Twenty-five centuries have again passed. Just as Adinatha's revolutionary concept of godless religion got lost in a desert of austerities and self-torture, Buddha's idea of meditation -- something i nner, that nobody else can see ; only"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"you know where you are, only you know whether you are progressing or not -- got lost into another desert, and that was organized religion. Religion says that single individuals cannot be trusted, whether they are meditating or not. They need communiti es, masters, monasteries where they can live together. Those who are on a higher level of consciousness can watch over others and help them. It became essential that religions should not be left in the hands of individuals, they should be or ganized and should be in the hands of those who have arrived at a high point of meditation. In the beginning it was good; while Bu ddha was alive there were many people who reached self-realization, enlighten ment. But as Buddha died and these people died, the very organization that wa s supposed to help people to meditate fell in the hands of a priesthood, and rat her than helping you to meditate they started creating rituals around the image of Buddha. Buddha became another God. Adinatha disposed of God, Buddha ne ver accepted that God exists, but this priesthood cannot exist without a God. So there may not be a God who is a creator, but Buddha has reached godhood. For others the only thing is to worship Buddha, to have faith in Buddha, to follow the principles of Buddha, to liv e life according to his doctrine; and Buddha got lost in the organization, the imitation. But they all forgot the basic thing which was meditation. My whole effort is to create a religionless religion. We have seen what happened to religio ns which have God as the center. We have seen what happened to Adinatha's revolutionary concept, godless religion. We have seen what happened to Buddh a -- organized religion without God. Now my effort is: just as they dissolved God, dissolve religion also. Leave only meditation so it cannot be forgotten in any way. There is nothing else to replace it. There is no God and there is no religion. By religion I mean an organized doctrine, creed, ritual, priesthood. And fo r the first time I want religion to be absolutely individual, because all orga nized religions, whether with God or without God, have misled humanity. And the sole cause has been organization, because organization has its own ways which go against meditativeness. Organization is really a political phenomenon, it is not religious. It is another way of power and will to power. Now every Christian priest hopes some day to become a bishop at least, to become a cardinal, to become a po pe. This is a new hierarchy, a new bureaucracy, and because it is spiritua l nobody objects. You may be a bishop, you may be a pope, you may be anything. It is not objectionable because you are not going to obstruct anybody's life. It is just an abstract idea. My effort is to destroy the priesthood completely. It remained with God, it remained with godless religion, now the only way is that we should dispose of God and religion both so that there is no possibility of any priesthood. Then man is absolutely free, totally resp onsible for his own growth. My feeling is that the more a man is responsible for his own growth, the more difficult it is for him to postpone it for long. Because it means if you are miserable, you are"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"responsible. If you are tense, you are responsible. If you are not relaxed, you are responsible. If you are in suffering, you are the cause of it. There is no God, there is no priesthood that you can go to an d ask for some ritual. You are left alone with your misery, and nobo dy wants to be miserable. The priests go on giving you opium, they go on giving you hope, \"Don't be worried, it is just a test of your faith, of your trust; and if you can pass through this misery and suffering silently and pa tiently, in the other world beyond death you will be immensely rewarded.\" If there is no priesthood you have to understand that whatever you are, you are responsible for it, nobody else. And the feeling that \"I am responsible fo r my misery,\" opens the door. Then you start looking for methods and means to get out of this miserable state, and that's what meditation is. It is simply the oppo site state of misery, suffering, anguish, anxiety. It is a state of a peaceful, bliss ful flowering of being, so silent and so timeless that you cannot conceive that an ything better is possible. And there is nothing which is better than the state of a meditative mind. So you can say these are the three quantum leaps: Adinatha drops God because he finds God is becoming too heavy on man; rather than helping him in his growth he has become a burden -- but he forgets to replace him with something. Man will need something in his miserable moments, in his suffering. He used to pray to God. You have taken God away, you have taken his prayer away and now when he will be miserable, what will he do? In Jainism meditation has no place. It is Buddha's insight to see that God ha s been dropped; now the gap should be filled, otherwise the gap will destroy man. He puts in meditation -- something really authentic which can change the whole being. But he was not aware -- perhaps he could not be aware because th ere are things you cannot be aware of unless they happen -- that there should be no organization, that there should be no priesthood, that as God is gone religion should also be gone. But he can be forgiven because he had not thought about it and there was no past to help him to see it, it came after him. The real problem is the priest, and God is the invention of the priest. Unless you drop the priest, you can drop God, but the priest will always find new rituals, he will create new gods. My effort is to leave you alone with me ditation, with no mediator between you and existence. When you are not in medi tation you are separated from existence and that is your suffering. It's the same as when you take a fish out of the ocean and throw it on the bank -- the misery an d the suffering and the tortures he goes through, the hankering and the effort to reach back to the ocean because it is where he belongs, he is part of the ocean and he cannot remain apart. Any suffering is simply indicative that you are not in communi on with existence, that the fish is not in the ocean. Meditation is nothing but withdrawing all the barriers, thoughts, emotions, sentiments, which create a wall between you and existence. The moment they"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"drop you suddenly find yourself in tune with the whole; not only in tune, you really find you are the whole. When a dewdrop slips from a lotus leaf into the ocean it does not find that it is part of the ocean, it finds it is the ocean. And to find it is the ultimate goal, the ultimate realization, there is nothing beyond it. So Adinatha dropped God but did not dr op organization. And because there was no God, the organization created rituals. Buddha, seeing what had happened to Jainis m, that it had become a ritualism, dropped God. He dropped all rituals and single-pointedly insisted on meditation, but he forgot that the prie sts who had made rituals in Jainism are going to do the same with meditation . And they did it, they made Buddha himself a God. They talk about meditation but basically Buddhists are worshipers of Buddha -- they go to the te mple and instead of Krishna or Christ there is Buddha's statue. There was no st atue of Buddha for five hundred years after Buddha. In Buddhist temples they had just the tree under which Buddha became enlightened, engraved on marble , just a symbol. Buddha was not there, only the tree. You will be surprised that the statue of Buddha that we see today has no resemblance at all to Buddha's persona lity, it resembles the personality of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Grea t came to India three hundred years after Buddha. Till then there was no stat ue of Buddha. The priests were in search because there was no photograph, there was no painting, so how to make a statue of Buddha? And Alexander's face looked really superhuman, he had a beautiful personality, the Greek face and physiology; they picked up the idea of Buddha's face and body from Alexande r. So all the statues that are being worshipped in Buddhist temples are statue s of Alexander the Great, they have nothing to do with Buddha. But the priest s had to create the statue -- God was not there, ritual was difficult, around meditation ritual was difficult. They created a statue and they started saying -- in the same way all religions have been doing -- have faith in Buddha, have trust in Buddha, and you will be saved. Both the revolutions were lost. I would like that what I am doin g is not lost. So I am trying in every possible way to drop all those things which in the past have been barriers for the revolution to cont inue and grow. I don' t want anybody to stand between the individual and existenc e. No prayer, no priest, you alone are enough to face the sunrise, you don't n eed somebody to inte rpret for you what a beautiful sunrise it is. It is said that every morning Lao Tzu used to go for a walk in the hills. One friend asked him, \"Can I come with you one day? I would particularly like to come tomorrow, because I have a guest who is very much interested in you, and he will be immensely glad to have the o pportunity to be with you for two hours in the mountains.\""},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Lao Tzu said, \"I have no objection, just one simple thing has to be remembered. I don't want anything to be said because I have my eyes, you have your eyes, he has his eyes, we can see. There is no need to say anything.\" The friend agreed, but on the way when th e sun started rising the guest forgot. It was so beautiful by the side of the lake, the reflection of all the colors, the birds singing and the lotuses blossoming, openin g, he could not resist, he forgot. He said, \"What a beautiful sunrise.\" His host was shocked because he has brok en the condition. Lao Tzu did not say anything, nothing was said there. Back ho me he called his friend and told him, \"Don't bring your guest again. He is too talkative. The sunrise was there, I was there, he was there, you were there -- wh at is the need to say anything, any comment, any interpretation?\" And this is my attitude: you are here , every individual is here, the whole existence is available. All that you need is just to be silent and listen to existence. There is no need of any religion, there is no need of any God, there is no need of any priesthood, there is no need of any organization. I trust in the individual categorically. Nobody up to now has trusted in the individual in such a way. So all things can be removed. Now all th at has been left to you is a state of meditation which simply means a state of utter silence. The word meditation makes it look heavier. It is better to call it just a simple, innocent silence and existence opens all its beauties to you. And as it goes on growing you go on growing, and there comes a moment when you have reached the very peak of your potentiality -- you can call it Buddhahood, enlightenment, bhagwatta, god liness, whatever, it has no name, so any name will do. MILLIONS OF SANNYASINS ARE SHAR ING YOUR LOVE AND JOY. WHAT MAKES A PERSON GET INITIATED INTO SANNYAS? HOW DOES THIS MIRACLE HAPPEN? It is certainly a miracle, but its happening is very simple. In the past there was no exact word to explain it, but by a coincidence Carl Gustav Jung, one of the greatest psychologi sts of this age, coined a word because he came across an experience for which there was no word. He was staying in an old mansion which had two big wall clocks and it was known that they always showed the same time. It was also known that even if you changed one, soon they again got in tune with each other and started showing the same time. He tried twice, th rice to change one clock five minutes ahead and soon he found that both the cl ocks had managed somehow, and just at the middle -- two and a half minutes -- again to show the same time. He was puzzled about what was happening. Because he had a scientific mind he tried to figure it out. He listened to the wall, he went around the clocks and he found the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"reason -- both the clocks were very old and very heavy and very big and they created a certain sound and certain sound waves and those sound waves helped them to come to a similar time. Those sound waves could not remain discordant; they fell into accordance slowly. He ha d to discover, the wh ole night he could not sleep and he discovered some thing he called 'synchronicity.' It is non-causal. We know in the world only one thing; that something causes, then something happens. If there is no caus e then there is no effect. So the world knows only one way of things happening: a cause leads to an effect. This is the causal relationship. The whole scientific world is based on th e causal relationship. Synchronicity has no place in it. But in human life everybod y who is a little alert may have found it -- you were sad and just then came a friend laughing, joyous, hugging you, telling you a joke, and you forgot your sadness and you started laughing with him. It can happen the other way also: your sadness may be so heavy that the man who is coming laughing, seeing you may stop laughing. Your sadness may have such an impact that it will be impossible to tell a joke to you; it will look almost inhuman, out of context, because you are so sad and the person is telling a joke. The joke also needs a certai n context which is missing. You shake hands with a friend and you find he is almost dead, like a dead branch of a tree, that nothing flows -- no warmth, no love, just a ritual. But shaking hands with another friend yo u feel immensely enriched, something flows, some warmth, some love. After sh aking hands you can certainly say that you are not the same man as you were befo re shaking hands with the friend: you were dull, you were sad, but just a touch of his hand and his joy has triggered something in you. Now this cannot be explained by cause and effect; it can be explained only by a new law, the law of synchronicity. And that 's what initiation is. A man of silence, a man of joy, a man of bliss attracts you. Perhaps you may not even be aware that he attracts you, that somehow you want to be with him, that yo u want to sit with him, that you want to talk with him. His being is creating some synchronicity in you. Your heart starts beating with a different rhythm. These millions of sannyasins. I have nothing else to offer to them. If they become Catholics, Catholicism has much to offer them. If they are converted to another religion, that religion may offer them some thing. It is a known fact that anybody changing his religion always gets tremendo us respect in the new religion. He is condemned by the old religion that he has left behind, but he is respected very much by the new religion because he ha s proved that the new religion is better than the old. I used to know a very old Jaina monk. He was not a Jaina by birth, he was a carpenter by birth. The carpenter is a lower class in Hinduism but somehow because he was making some wooden stat ues of Mahavira in a temple he became interested in Jainism, and finally he became a Jaina. He was very much"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"condemned by the Hindus but it meant nothing because he was already a low- caste person, already condemned -- yo u cannot condemn him more. But in Jainism he was raised to a very high level of sainthood. Other Jaina saints became smaller. This carpenter became a very respected saint. And I was puzzled because he was no t a scholar the way other Jaina monks were. He was not so educated, not so cu ltured; after all he was a carpenter and you cannot expect much from him. But he was respected so much. Then I figured out the reason why he is being so much respected: because to the Jainas it has proved one thing, that Ja inism is a higher religion than Hinduism. This man is a proof. No Jaina has ever been converted to Hinduism, but many Hindus have been converted to Jainism and this is a proof. He did not speak much, he had nothing to say, but just because he had come from another religion, he had immense re spect. I told him one day, that \"You should not remain in the illusion that this respect is for you.\" He said, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"I mean this respect is simply because you were not born a Jaina. This respect is simply to show to the world th at Jainism is a far higher religion than Hinduism, otherwise why should a Hindu, on his own, get converted to Jainism?\" I said to him, \"You can try. You go back to Hinduism. All the condemnation that Hindus have for you will drop. They will respect you. They have never respected any carpenter, but th ey will respect you because they will say \"Now this proves certainly that Hind uism is a higher religion because a man has been in both the religions and finally he decides to be a Hindu and drops all saintliness and all great respect.\" And th en, you will see, these same Jainas will condemn you, will say lies against you, will create allegations against you.\" The man was simple. He said, \"Perhaps yo u are right. Perhaps I am living in an illusion.\" I said, \"If you understand that then your growth will not stop. It does not matter what you are -- Hindu or Jaina or Buddhis t -- that doesn't matter. Remember the basic work, just don't get lost into all kinds of illusions which happen in life.\" The sannyasins who are coming to me, I have nothing to offer to them. In fact, they will be condemned by their societ ies, by their religions. They will be condemned by their families, by their friends. They are not going to gain anything, they are going to lose much. But still something in their hearts starts moving -- it is beyond the control of th eir mind. In spite of themselves they become sannyasins. It takes time. For a time there is a conf lict between their hearts and their minds. The mind is trying to pull them back, telling them to remain where they were, giving all the arguments that they w ill be simply a loser and will not gain anything. But sooner or later the mind mu st lose. If there is something that is pulling your heart, mind can fight for a time but cannot win."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"So I say sannyas is just like falling in love . It is a synchronicity. You simply find that something indefinable, unnameable joins you with me and you want it to be declared to the world. That is initiation. Initiation is simply a declaration that I am not going to keep it to myself, that I have come in contact with a new force, with a new energy, with a new love, with a fresh world. I am going to declare it to the world whatsoever the cost. And although sannyasins will have to suffer, will be persecuted, will be condemned, still they will have a joy that their persecutors cannot have. They will have a silence which their condemners cannot have. And it is spreading like wildfire, with no organization, with no preachers, with no missionaries, with nobody continuously harassing you with the Bible. I have never converted anybody and I have insisted to my people that they never convert anybody. But if somebody wants to be a friend, our doors are open and he is welcome. Initiation is simply your gesture that yo u want to come in and our gesture that you are welcome. It is certainly a mirac le, and particularly with me, because neither can I give you anything in this life nor can I promise you anything in other lives. I don't have any opium for anybody. But I can make this very moment a tr emendously beautiful moment, without giving anything to you, without anything visible passing from my hands to you. But there are invisible things. We accept x-rays without any trouble, why can't we accept that love also has its own rays and silence has its own rays, its own radiation. And of course, enlightenment has a tremendous force to transform a person. It is a miracle.

The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH BBC & API INTRODUCER: Mr Benare(*) who Acharya (inaudible), and Mr Kedamasingh(*) from BBC and AFP, and Mr Lalit Josi(*) from France(*) PTI. Q: BHAGWAN, YOU WENT TO UNITED STATES WITH ALL THE DETERMINEDNESS TO SETTLE DOWN AND YOU HAVE COME BACK. DO YOU FIND THE (INAUDIBLE) SOME TIME IN FUTURE TO SEE SANNYASIS AND THE DISCIPLES? A: I have never gone there with a dete rmined or undetermined intention to settle. It was just a coincidence that American sannyasins were looking for a land to create a commune of their own and my health was not good, I had gone just for my health reasons. And my health problems are such they don't need any medical care, they need only controlled environment. For example, I have many allergies: perfume, smoke, dust. If th ey can be avoided then I am perfectly happy, there is no problem. If they ca nnot be avoided then my breathing is affected and I have asthma attacks. There is no cure for allergies. The same way humidity affects, if humidi ty is too much then again asthma starts and it is a very severe attack -- whole ni ght, then sleep is impossible. I am just coughing and tossing and turning. So I ne ed a certain climate which is cold, non- humid and by chance my people had fo und a place which suited to me very much. It was a desert, that's why they co uld get it. Otherwise to find such a big place was almost impossible. It was one hundred twenty-six square miles and because it was a desert, nobody was ready to purchase it. For fifty years it was on sale and not a single offer came. So it was very easy for them to get it. And to me it suited very much -- it was non-humid, it was cold, very small rain, very small smoke, that too dry and cold. Living ther e for one and half year my all symptoms disappeared. It was at that point that I asked the American government for permanent residence. But I have not gone with the intention to settle there. My people are all over the world and I have communes almost in every country. The Americans were trying to have their own commune; this was their commune, I was there simply guest."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"But the government and behind the govern ment, Christianity, both became very disturbed by my presence and the sanny asins. The government was disturbed because we created a certain kind of far higher communism than exists in Soviet Union by simply removing money from the commune. That in the commune nobody can purchase anything. All your needs will be fulfilled by the commune. You can donate to the commune but you cannot purchase anything in the commune. And we were an island far away. The clos est town was thirty miles. So once the exchange status of money was removed... you may have millions of dollars and I may not have a single dollar -- you are not rich and I am not poor. We are in the same space and in the same boat. You are unnecessarily loaded for your, with your money which cannot purchase any single thing and whatever you can get from the commune, I can get from the commune. So without bringing any dictatorship, without bringing any government, without bringing any revolution of any sort, ju st by removing the money inside the commune, suddenly there was nobody poor, nobody rich. This created certainly a trouble in the American politician's mi nd. People started coming to see the commune, how people are happy, how peop le are healthy, and how they have managed the desert to become an oasi s. We were creating our own food, our vegetables, our fruits, we had our gree nhouses, we had our own milk product. There were five thousand sannyasins, not a single beggar. In fact, two hundred American beggars had joined us and we had accepted them and they felt for the first time that they are being treated as human beings. Otherwise, they were treated as dogs. It is thought in the world America has cr eated an image that it is the richest country but there are thirty million begg ars in America who are on the streets without clothes, without food, without house. The American politician's fear was that slowly, slowly news media started coming: television, radio, newspapers and visitor started coming just to see that what has happened and why these peop le are so happy. Because my basic teaching is meditation so people started the day by meditation, then there was a talk by me -- any question anybody asked, then they go for their different works, then a single kitchen for five thousand people -- a scene worth seeing because just fifteen people can manage five thousand people's kitchen and we are wasting millions of women's energy and lif e just in kitchens. And these fifteen people were chosen as the best cooks, so our people were having the best food possible. One of the greatest problems for vegetari ans... because I am a vegetarian and my sannyasins are vegetarians. One of the problems has been, which vegetarians have no answers to the non-vegetarian, that \"Why not a single vegetarian has been able to achieve a Nobel prize? Why not a single vegetarian has been discovered something, invented something, why they are intellectually far behind than the non-vegetarian?\" And it is a truth. You cannot deny it. Forty"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"percent of the Nobel prizes go to the Jews , the three Nobel prizes that have come to India were not for people who were vegetarians. All the three persons were non-vegetarians. It is found that the vegetarian food lacks few proteins which are absolutely necessary for intelligence to grow. So I had added non-fertilized eggs in the vegetarian food as essential. The non-fe rtilized egg has no life so you are not killing, it is almost vegetable, but it fulfills all the needs. So I angered the vegetarians because to them just the name `egg' is enough to get angry with me. I angered the non-vegetarians because I de stroyed their basic argument that man has to remain non-vegetarian otherwise he will lose all intelligence. Now there is no need for man to remain non-vegetarian. If a non-fertilized egg can fulfill all the demands that the body and the mind n eeds then there is no need to kill any living being just for food. It is ugly, inhuman, anaesthetic, insensitive. So all kinds of people, for example, Christians were angry because I was turning their people into vegetarians. That I was teaching to my people that alcohol is also a drug, just as marijuana is or L. S.D. is. In Christian countries you make marijuana and L.S.D. illegal, crimes... thou sands of young people are suffering in jails, but alcohol is not crime because Jesu s was drinking alcoho l. That does not make it religious, it is as much a crim e as any other. Either make every drug available to people or stop alcohol al so. But Christian mind cannot conceive Christ committing a crime. And when I said it, that \"It is a crime, not only a crime, but Christians say that `Christ chan ged water into wine,' that is even more criminal. If somebody is changing water into wine, this man should be locked up.\" I was stating simple facts, nobody ans wered them but they became angry. The politicians were angry because in a co mmunist world I have created a small commune against capitalism. In a Christia n world I had created a small oasis of people who did not belong to any or ganized religion but who were simply religious. My approach is that a scientifi c man is simply scientific, he is not Hindu scientific, he is not Mohammedan scie ntific, he is simply scientific. And a religious man is also simply religious. Th e moment you put an adjective to it you destroy its beauty, its quality -- you br ing it down from its great heights. These things created in their minds and th ey could not find any logical or legal way to destroy the commune. They became so drastic that they arrested me without any arrest warrant, without even showing me a cause why they are arresting me. They are talking about a de mocratic, freedom of the individual, respect for the individual and this is th e respect for the indi vidual -- that you don't even show him the cause why he is being handcuffed, chained, taken into prison, and if I ask anything the answer is the gun. Twelve guns around me, no answer. And for twelve days they dragged me into, from one jail to another jail, constantly lying that they are taking me to the airport -- and they will take me to another jail."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"I asked them, that \"If you want to keep me in jail you can keep me in one jail, what is the need... because all your jails are similar. If you want to torture me you can torture anywhere, but I know your trouble because the whole world knows I am in the jail and if something happens to me here then you will be condemned. So you want to take me to so me place that nobody knows.\" But the press helped immensely and I came to understand for the first time that against the powers of undemocratic gove rnments the press is the only security for individuals who have no power. The whole press was surrounding their jails, twenty-four hours. In a jail they even trie d to force me to change my name. I said, \"For what? Because this is absolutely illegal.\" They wanted me to sign under David Washington. I said, \"This is absolu tely absurd and you are U.S. marshall. On your coat is written Department of Jus tice but I don't see what justice is this and under what law it comes that I should sign under a name which is not mine and I can see your point that you are putting in jail David Washington and you can kill me and nobody will be able to find out what happened to me, where I disappeared, because there will be no record at all. In your files there will be David Washington. I cannot write it. But if you want, you write in your own handwriting.\" He had to write because he had to go, ot herwise he had to sit with me the whole night. So he had to write. I said, \"You write in your own handwriting, David Washington, and everything fill it.... I will simply sign it.\" I sign ed it and I always sign in Hindi. He looked at it, he could not understand, he said, \"What it is?\" I said, \"It must be David Was hington. I don't know. But this is my sign and you should remember that if anything happens to me this sign will prove that David Washington was not David Washington.\" Within three hours they changed my jail again because their policy went wrong. Immediately the press came to know that they have forced me to sign under a false name. They knew it perfectly that they have no thing against me so they tried to reach the court which was only eight hours from the place where they had arrested me. It took twelve days, that eight hour jour ney... took twelve days, five jails and all kinds of harassment because they knew all my allergies, so they will create every possibility for me to be affected. They kept me with people who were ha ving dangerous diseases so I can get infected. People who have been living al one for six months and the doctor has not allowed anybody else to be their inma tes... they forced me to live with those people. Those people themselves told me that, \"Bhagwan, this is absolutely unjust and we are suffering from a certain disease....\" One man was suffering from confirmed herpes and he was dying and he said to me, that \"I have been living here alone and without telling you anything they have... and the doctor was present here and the jailer was present and the marshall was present here and they all kn ow it. And you had, they have forced"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"you to live here and this is very infect ious disease. And once you get it, you cannot get rid of it.\" They knew that it was difficult to prove but how long you can keep me from the whole world news media. They were pressu rized that I should be brought to court immediately, as quickly as possible. Finally they had to bring me to the court and in the court they knew that they have nothin g to prove against me. So they played a very fascist strategy. They asked my attorneys for negotiation. My attorney said, that \"There is no question of negotiations. The man is absolutely innocent. Why we should be negotiating? We should go for a trial, let the judge decide.\" But they said, \"It will be easier for yo u and easier for us without trial, we can negotiate.\" And the negotiation was tricky. The negotiation was: \"that if Bhagwan accepts that he is guilty, then we will drop the case, and the court will give him a nominal punishment that for five years you cannot enter America. If he does not accept guilt and he says, `I am not guilty,' then we are not going to give bail on any account. The whole go vernment is determined, five million dollars, ten million dollars, fifteen millio n dollars -- no amount of money... we are not going to give a bail. Bhagwan will remain in jail as long as the trial continues and the trial can continue for fi ve years, for ten years, for fifteen years, because it is in our hands -- how to go on postponing, changing courts.\" They made it clear that they have no case . My attorneys came to me with tears in their eyes, the best attorneys of America, and they said, that \"We have never been in such a dilemma. They have proposed a negotiation which is absolutely illegal, ugly, inhuman. And they have made it clear that they don't have any case but they want to punish you. At least they wa nt you to accept that you are guilty, so nobody can say that they arrested you and you were an innocent person. And the problem is: if you don't accept it they may prolong the case as long as they want. If eight hours' journey can be prolonged to twelve days, how long they can prolong the case, we don't know and how mu ch strategy they can play into it -- difficult to say. They will torture you. They can kill you in these ten years. Your whole commune will be in torture, in me ntal anguish. Your all the sannyasins around the world will be suffering, so we pray you that you simply accept that you are guilty and let this be finished because the government seems to be adamant.\" I accepted in the court that I am guilty. And without saying to me, they imposed a fine of four hundred thousand million dollars. That was not part of the negotiations at all. And five years I ca nnot enter America. I told the judge that, \"You need not be so lenient with me. You can make it that in my whole life, at least in this life, I cannot enter America because even if you want, I will not enter America.\" And I told the U.S. attorney before I left the court, that \"The way you have behaved you have forced me, under oath of speaking only truth and nothing but truth, you have forced me to lie. And then upon that lie you have imposed half a"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"million dollars punishment and five ye ars' punishment to remain outside America. But I am going outside America; I am not going to be silent, I am going to say to the whole world that this is the way your so-called democracies work. Their faces are just masks, inside they are all fascist. And whenever they come against a person whom they cannot answe r, then they start in a desperate way to destroy him.\" And I was warned by my attorneys that \"Be careful when you go to jail.\" I said, \"What is the problem? Just to take my clothes...\" when I was released by the court. And it was true, what they have heard was found true. When I went into jail the whole ground floor was empty which had never been. There were so many people working, the whole sta ff. There were not a single person. I inquired the man who was taking me in, \"What is the reason why everybody is absent?\" He said, \"Perhaps shifts are changing.\" But I said, \"I have been in twelve days, shifts have been changed all the twelve days. First the person comes, then the older person leaves. The whole shift has gone, the new shift is not here? It is little suspicious.\" He said, \"Nothing, there is nothing suspicious.\" But he was nervous, he was perspiring. And I said, \"Why you are nervous and why you are perspiring?\" He left me in a room with a man who was also alone, to give me my clothes and things. That man was shaking and tremblin g. I said, \"What is the matter? What has happened to the jail today?\" He said, \"I have to take the signature of my boss so I will have to go out.\" This was for the first time in twelve days they have left me alone. Otherwise always two persons with guns were with me. I wa s chained, my legs were chained, my waist was chained, still there were two people with loaded guns. This was the only time... he left me alone. After fifteen minutes he came back, gave me the packet, took my signature. I found out that there was no question of anybody's answer, anybody's question or anybody's signature -- only your signat ure that you have received your things, that was all. There was no question of any boss to signing it. And no boss has signed it. But the reality is they had put a bomb in that room but it was a timebomb and they were not certain when the court is go ing to finish. Otherwise their final aim was that if the court leaves me, then the bomb can finish me. And who can put the bomb in a jail inside in a room, except the authorities, except people who are in power, no ordinary pers on can even reach there! And these people go on talking about re spect for the individual and freedom of the individual. American experience has been of tremendous value to me that we have yet to be civilized, that civilization and democracy have not yet happened. They have to happen, they are still dreams."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" Q: WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM NEW DELHI SAYING, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF YOUR NOT RETURNING TO INDIA.

That pr ivilege and prestige belongs to Nepal. And `buddha' simply means the awakened one. It is not a personal name. I am not anybody's incarnatio n. I am myself.

Q: BHAGWAN, IS IT CORRECT THAT YOU OWE THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA SOME TAXES? A: No. Because I don't have any income, how can I have any taxation? I don't have any belongings, no property, no bank account. I am the poorest man in the world. Of course, with richest friends! So everything that I have belongs to my friends, nothing belongs to me.

Q: YOU WERE DESCRIBED IN A PHRA SE AS BEING VERY ANGRY ABOUT AMERICA. IS IT TRUE? A: For thirty years I have never been angry about anything or anybody. But people may have felt that I am angry, because whatever I have said about America goes against the common illusion about America, that it is a democracy.

Every belief makes you blind. So my whole effort is to de stroy all your beliefs , to deprogram you, and to leave you alone to be yourself. If one can manage to be oneself then ther e is nothing else to be done. That very phenomenon to be oneself is the beginning of a transf ormation that makes you a new man; blissful, fulfilled, full of contentment. Now there is nowhere to go; you have arrived. Just to be oneself is to be at home. Q: THIS IS MY FINAL QUESTION.

A: It is true that I am the most controvers ial man in the world, and it is one of the controversies that nobody knows what is the controversy. I myself don't know. Q: WHAT PART DOES SEX PLAY IN YOUR PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE? A: Nothing. I have spoken on sex because it plays so much significant role in all the religions of the world. They are all ag ainst sex. They are all repressive. They teach people to be against sex, against life, to renounce life, to renounce the pleasures of life. Because of them I had to speak that it is all nonsense and it is against nature. Their whole teaching makes people perver ted. A repressed sexually person is a perverted person and ninety percent of psychological insanity is created by sexual perversions. And they have made the whole humanity perverted. Homosexuals they have created. Th e homosexuals were created in the monasteries because you forced men to live separately from women, and women to live separately from men. Naturally the women became lesbians, men became homosexuals. All the religions of the world are resp onsible for homosexuality and the other perversions. Even because of a repressed mind people have made love to animals. And now the homosexuality has brought the world to the ultimate destructive disease AIDS. And all the religions are responsible for it. I have spoken against repression because I want sex to be accepted, just as you accept everything else in life naturally -- sleep, eating, clothing, you don't make any fuss about it. But there are religions, for example Jainism believes that clothing is unspiritual. Now if you make clothing unspiritual then you will create"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"trouble for many people. Even the Jainas themselves have never been able to go out of India, for the simple reason that the climate will not allow them to remain naked. And it is stupid, because their five thousand years of teaching and there are only twenty two naked monks in India. It cannot be called a great achievement, in five thousand years only twenty two people; and one dies and is never replaced because even in India in cold climate you need clothes. Perhaps in summer you may be able to live without cl othes, but this is stupid. Why torture your body? All the religions have been teaching about fasting. I am against. Either there are people who are teaching 'Eat, drink and be merry.' There are thirty million Americans who are dying because of over-eating. Now these are idiots. And there are people who are teaching for fasting, 'Don't eat. The longer you fast the more spiritual you are.' I cannot conceive that to be hungry can in any way be synonymous with spirituality. If this is so then the whole world should be hungry. And it is good to be poor, and there is no need to destroy poverty, it is a spiritual phenomenon. I have spoken against these things becaus e all these religions have been teaching unnatural, inhuman, unpsychological principl es to be lived by people. But as far as my philosophy is concerned, there is no question to be specially concerned with sex. It is a simple fact of life; there is nothing special in it . At the most it is fun. And after the pill it is nothing but fun. Before the pill it was a dangerous game because you may have produced children and those children will prove a burden to you because they will make you poor. Now after the pill even that burden is removed. Before the pill th e woman was a loser, because the women around the world were living simply as reproductive factories continuously producing children. Their whole life was wa sted in producing children, bringing them up. They could not get educated, they could not get cultured, they could not understand literature, they could not understand great music or great philosophies. Nothing was available to them . Their only work was just to go on producing children. The pill has changed the whole thing. It is the greatest revolution that has happened in the world. Now the woman is equal to man. What no other revolution could do the pill has done; it has made the woman equal to man. Now she is not in the danger of being pregnant unless she wants it. So sex is no more just a biological thing for reproducing ch ildren. It is simply a beautiful, loving game. If you don't like it, don't play it, but don't try to teach people that it is something unspiritual. It is neither spirit ual nor unspiritual. It is just like any other game -- football or volley ball, or play ing cards. It is ju st like that, nothing of any importance. So in my philosophy of life I do not give any importance to such things. Q: (INAUDIBLE) "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"A: I will get negative response everywhere . Even I go to another planet, so what is the reason, what is the point. Coming to Nepal I will get the negative response. So it makes no difference to me whether I am in America, or in India or in Nepal. Wherever I am, I am going to get the ne gative response because I am going to speak against people's traditions, agai nst their superstitions, against their religions, against their philosophies, agai nst their whole past. So they are not responsible for being negative. I am resp onsible, because I have decided to say the truth, whatsoever the cost. And I am ready to pay the cost, and I am paying it. So there is no problem. Wherever I want to make people negative, I go there. I have come to Nepal, now I will make people negative here. Then I will go somewhere else, where people are still no t negative. Unless I have made the whole world negative, I cannot go to an other planet, that's the difficulty. Q: (INAUDIBLE) SEE THE POINT THAT CONTROVERSY (INAUDIBLE) A: It is nothing new. Ever ything that I say is going to be controversial. For the simple reason, because unless I see that something is wrong, I will not speak. There is no reason. If everything is righ t I will remain silent. I will speak only when I see something is wrong. And the moment I see that something is wrong in your tradition, in your belief system, immediately there is controversy. Because you cling to your conditioning, you think it is your ego. It is not your ego. And because you cannot contradict my argument, otherwise there will be no controversy, either convince me when I am with you there is no controversy, or be convinced by me and be with me, and then there is no controversy. You cannot contradict my argument, hence the controversy remains. No religion has dared on any point which I have criticized to give the counter argument. I am willing. If you say is reasonable, unde rstandable, I am ready to be convinced, and accept it... (gap in tape to a259) ... as the mother. Otherwise the bull should be the father. And on what grounds you accept the cow as your mother beca use it gives the m ilk? Then there are camels who give milk, goats who give milk, in different countries different animals are used for milk, so they all shou ld be mothers. This is simply stupid. And in fact calling the cow your mother, an d then exploiting it in every possible way; the milk is not for you, it is for th e kids of the cow. And you are not giving that milk to the kids of th e cow. The milk goes to yo u. You are exploiting your own mother, depriving your own brothers and sisters. And then the cow becomes old, it automatically reaches to the butcher. Who sells it to the butcher? All the cows that are owned by Hindus when they become old how they reach to the butcher? You sell them. You sell your own mothers. And to the butcher. And then you go on making movements that cow slaughter should be stopped."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Every slaughter should be stopped, wh y only cow slaughter. Why there should be this preference? Life should be resp ected, not only in the cow but in every animal, in everywhere. Reverence for life I accept; but when you start choosing just one certain animal, then you yourse lf create a controversy, and you don't have any argument for it. Otherwise there is no controversy. I am willing to accept any reasonable arg ument, but you are not willing to accept any reasonable arguments, so the contro versy remains. You have made me a controversial figure, and I enjoy it. I don't see there is any harm in it. I am doing something that I love, to de stroy in every way anything that is ugly, irrational, insane, insensitive. Perhaps you may not accept it today, but tomorrow or day after tomorrow. You will have to accept it. No truth can remain unaccepted forever, and no lie can remain accepted forever. The BIBLE says that the sun goes round the earth. It is a lie. Galileos proved that the earth goes around the sun. It is a truth. But Galileo was controversial, because the whole Christianity was against him. He was dragged to the court of the Pope and Pope told him that either you will be killed because you are destroying the faith of our people; and Galileo was simply amazed. He said, \"In what way? If the earth goes around the sun, why it should affect your faith, your religion? Just because it is written in the BIBLE and you are afraid that if one statement is proved wrong in the BIBLE, then you cannot say it that it is the word of God. God cannot commit a mistake. Just because this statement proves wrong, there arises the suspicion, what about other statements? Perhaps they are also wrong? And they are wrong. But Galileo was an old man, almost on the death be d, and he was forced, and he was a man very sensible, and had an immense sens e of humor. When the Pope asked him that \"You will have to change the statemen t in your book,\" he said, \"I will change it. But just remember, my changing the statement will not make any difference. The earth will still go around the sun.\" And he changed the statement, and in the footnote he wrote that \"My changing th e statement makes no difference, because the earth does not listen, does not read, neither the sun bothers about Galileo.\" But sooner or later the whole Christianity has to accept it. Nobody talks about it, no priest has the courage to say that the BIBLE is right. It is ignored. It is not talked about. But the sentence is there, it is not removed yet. If the Christians had courage, they should have removed it. After each new invention, new discovery, new revelation of truth, all religions should go for new editions of their religio us books. They should keep them up to date. They are not keeping, they are five thousand years old, two thousand years old; and naturally they are carrying thousa nds of mistakes, for the simple reason because five thousand years before it was not known. Whatever was known was collected. But now we know so much. In five thousand years man has discovered so many things, that every religion has become absolutely irrelevant and I am simply bringing whatever the latest truths and the latest story, either by science"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"or by people who are deep meditators. My own experience I trust more than anybody else. Q: (INAUDIBLE) THE COW GETS OLD, SHE DIES IN THE HOME (INAUDIBLE) HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY IT? A: That simply means why you are poor. You will remain poor. It is uneconomical. To keep a cow that is no more giving milk, no more giving goods for your fields. It is uneconomical, it is (inaudible) poor. Q: AREN'T YOU CUTTING THE WHOLE POINT?(*) A: No. Q: YOU SAID THAT 'WHY DO YOU SAVE THE COW AFTER IT STOPS TO GIVE MILK TO THE PERSON,' AND NOW YOU SAY, 'WHY DON'T YOU SELL, IT IS UNECONOMICAL'? A: Yes, I say it because both the points are true. I would like the cow to be still used for some economic purpose. Just keeping it in a home, feeding it, and letting it die, and you are starving yourse lf. You cannot feed your cow well, there should be something better which can be managed. For example, there can be a government production where you give your cow. And the government takes care of all cows. When you take thousand s of cows together it will be far more economical, and less a burden on the poor people. Rather than the king having so many palaces, it is better to have a great field where old cows can be kept if you want to preserve them and not to kill them. And I love to respect life but you should see that it does not make you so poor that you yourself start dying in the name of religion. That's what is happening in India. And Nepal is even more poorer than India and it will become more and more poo r. You should use machines for milking the cow; you should use more scientific methods for keeping the cow healthy. In the developed countries of the west one co w gives as much milk as forty cows give in Nepal. And you call the cow yo ur mother? And they don't call the cow their mother, but they take care scientifi cally, and they make it a point that cow helps you economy. Not that it becomes a bu rden on you. It is just a superstition that you are keeping the old cow. It is not reverence for life. Because as far as reverence for life is concerned, there is nothing -- what about other animals? What about a dog that is old and is of no use? In India or in Nepal only you will find dogs on the streets, not in develo ped countries. We don't have any respect for life. You are keeping simply a su perstition and sacrificing for it. And man comes first. Man cannot be sa crificed for anything else. If we can preserve life without harming man and hi s life, good. But man should not suffer"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"for any superstition. Now this is simply making humanity suffer for superstitions. In India I am more acquainted. For exampl e it happened that th ere is a temple in Lucknow, it is Rama's temple, and many monkeys are being fed there; that is thought to be religious ju st because monkeys are Hanuman. Rama's devotees. So Hindus go to the temple, give food to the monkeys. So many monkeys have gathered near the temple, on the trees, and suddenly one monkey must have got mad, and he started attacking people; and when he started attacking people -- all are not Hindus, and particularly in Lucknow there are many Mohammedans who would not tolerate it. They started hitting those monkeys with stones and sticks, and other monkeys started getting mad, and then it became a great problem. That the road had to be blocke d, because nobody could pass from that road. Nobody could reach to the te mple. The monkeys will kill him. The parliament has to think, what to do. You cannot kill because the Hindus will be angry, and you cannot leave the situation as it is because it is dangerous to humanity. Now just a superstition -- monkeys are no t gods; and when they start destruction towards human beings then certainly some thing has to be done. Even if human beings become destructive towards other human beings, you put them in jail. But these monkeys cannot be put in jail becaus e the whole India will go mad. Their gods are being put in jail. There was a situation that in some part s, of Himalayas perhaps in Nepal also, you have that animal neel gai. It is not a cow, but it looks like a cow. It is bluish, so it is called neel gai. But just because it is called cow.... It's populati on became too much, it started coming down to the plains and destroying crop s. And the government was worried what to do, because Hindus were absolutely agai nst to kill, because it is a cow. The name is cow only. (Long gap between Tape sides A and B) A: Be scientific in your reasoning and your behavior. Don't be dominated by your superstitions. That is my basic point. Whatever you do, do it with intelligence, not because your forefathers we re doing it. Whether it is intelligent or not does not matter. No, you have to decide that it should be rational and reasonable and you should go with time . So naturally I come in conflict with every kind of people, whether they are Christians, or Hindus or Mohammedans, because my basic point is not to oppose any religion, my basic point is to pull out people from their superstitious backgrou nd into the light of intelligence and reason. Only then we can live more comf ortably, more happily, more naturally, and this earth can become a paradise. But it cannot, because of our superstitions are such."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"In America, I was presented by the U.S. marshall himself, a BIBLE telling me that \"This is the word of God.\" I asked him, \"Have you ever read it, from the beginning to the end?\" He was a little hesitant. He said, \"No, I have not read it completely. Just few portions which our priest speaks on, then I read it.\" Then I said, \"You don't know, and you don't have any authority to say that it is the word of God. Five hundred pages in your BIBLE are pornographic, and I don't think God will write pornography.\" He was shocked. I said , \"You can just open any page and I will show you the pieces which are pornographic. And just now a group of atheists have published all those five hundred pages together... Q: IS IT ILLUSTRATED? A: No it is not illustrated. But I am going to publish it illustrated. Because pornography has to be seen, then only you can understand it. Reading you cannot understand it. The president of that atheist group has written to me that we are making an effort, perhaps it will be banned, but we ho pe that we have your blessings. I said, I send my blessings. I would love that it is illustrated. They said it will be too costly and beyond our capacity, 500 page s with so much pornography the book will become ten thousand pages if we illustrate it. But I am thinking to make it the illustrated real holy Bible. But then it hurts. But I am not responsible, you are responsible. You should have taken those pages long before. Why you are keeping those pages? Still there is time. You should take those pages out. The reasonable thing is that those pages are ugly, and because those of pages, I appeal to all the go vernments of the world to ban the holy BIBLE of the Christians. It should not be allowed in public to be sold, or in a public library, or in any church. But nobo dy looks into it, even the priests. I had asked one bishop that can you deliver a sermon on any of the pages out of these five hundred in the church. Yo u have been delivering sermons every Sunday and you choose certain passages. These are BIBLE passages. You can choose, and I am giving you five hundre d pages to choose any page. He looked for one week and he said, \"I cannot speak on these pages. Those people will kill me, and at least I will lose my bishophood.\" But I said, \"These are biblical passages.\" He said, \"I understand that they are biblic al passages, but they are so ugly and so obscene that how I will make them spiritua l? I cannot, there seems to be no way. I have thought every possible way somehow to rationalize, but I don't see any way, so please forgive me.\" Then I said, \"Then it should be rational that you should appeal to your pope, to your high priests, and you have a confer ence to remove these five hundred pages and make BIBLE pure. And if you cannot do it, then naturally the controversy"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"will remain, I will go on saying it and you cannot defend yourself. Otherwise I am simply stating whatsoever is reas onable.\" But it becomes controversial because the other party is not ready even to listen. And they don't have any argument. They have forgotten even to argue. Q: JUST YOU SAID ABOUT ECONOMIC: ALL THE THINGS OF LIFE SHOULD BE SEEN ECONOMICALLY (INAUDIBLE)? A: They can be. Just you have to be alert, aware of all the findings. For example, we have disturbed the ecology of the e arth, and because we have disturbed the ecology of the earth, everything has beco me disturbing. The earth cannot yield as much as it was possible, the rivers ha ve become dangerous. Bangladesh is flooded just because in Nepal and in India we have cut so many trees that the rivers are reaching to Bangladesh with such a speed in that the ocean cannot absorb with water with such speed. With the trees, the water was slowed down and it was coming with a speed that the ocean was ab sorbing it. Now it comes with such speed that the ocean throws it back. Bangladesh has been suffering every year with floods. Poverty has been increasing with every flood, their crops are destroyed. Now it is simple and human that in Nepa l and in India trees should not be cut. You are killing a whole country, their cr ops you are destroying. It does not matter that it is not your country. Yesterday it was your country, it was part of India, but now you are no more concerne d with those people. They were always poor, now they are more poor than eve r. Just simple methods that we can plant trees which is not a big thing. If you cannot plant trees, at least you can put rocks in the river, so that their flow is slowed down and the current is not so great that the ocean cannot absorb. Perhaps trees will take a little time to grow, but rocks are available around every river. You have just to put them in the river and you can save millions of people from poverty and you can show a great respect and love for humanity. It is not your country so it is not an urgent concern for you. And it will be economical in the sense th at if you can help Bangladesh for its crops, that no floods come there, that wa ter reaches only as much as Bangladesh needs, not less not more, Bangladesh will be ready and certainly willing to help you in some way or other. And they can help. The whole world is living unnecessarily divided into nations. We should start thinking more of the whole globe as one. For example, I just told you that thirty million people in America are dying becaus e of over-eating, and exactly thirty million people in America are dying beca use they have no food. Now what a simple solution. These thirty million people should be just a little bit human and reasonable. If they are not compassionat e on themselves at least they should think that they are killing thirty million people without food, and they are killing themselves also by eating those th irty million people's food. Just a small understanding, just a little reasoning, and sixty million people are saved."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Otherwise sixty million people are going to die. And this seems to be absolutely stupid. I don't see any reason there that it should happen. But it is happening. And if you say, as I was saying to Americans, they are hurt. It seems strange. You suggest anything reasonable and people are hurt, because they think they are rational , very rational, very intelligent, nothing more can be rational and nothing more can be intelligen t, and if you suggest them something which is more intelligent, they feel hurt. Their egos are hurt. We should think about everything on a global scale, and now that science has given us so much energy that if we can avoid a third world war, which is in our hands, which is absolutely meaningless; a war is meaningful if somebody wins, somebody is defeated. In a third world war, nobody will be the winner and nobody will be defeated. All will be dest royed, equally destroyed. It has lost meaning, it is no more a game. So if we can simply make them understand that the third world war is the end of wars, now there is no possibility of war. If you have a little bit of intelligence, and they all have gathered so much nuclear energy that they can destroy humanity seven hundred times, all that en ergy can be used for creative purposes. If all that energy is released for creati ve purposes there will be nobody poor. There is no need for anybody to be poo r, uncomfortable, sick, without medicine, without hospital. So much energy is ready, but it is kept ready for war, to kill; not to help people to live longer, to live better, to live more comfortably. Scientists have come to a conclusion that every human being can live at least three hundred years. The body has the potentiality to renew itself for three hundred years. And we have been dying so early just because we don't know how to provide the right food for the body so that it can continue for th ree hundred years, and just think, if an Albert Einstein can live for three hundred years, how much he can contribute to human progress. Because his intelligence will go on growing. If in seventy or eighty years time a scientist can give you so much, in three hundred years it is almost incalculable what will be his cont ribution. And not only one scientist; all the scientists can live that long. Old age is not necessary. It is just because of our ways of eating are not scientific. We have not chosen them according to any science. For example, no vegetarian has yet received a single Nobel prize. And I have asked the vegetarians that \"Have you any answer? Only non-vegetarians are receiving Nobel prizes. In fact, vegetari ans should be receiving more because they are eating purer food, an d they are more spiritual as they say. But the reality is that their food lacks certain proteins which make your intelligence. Their food is not sufficient for mind. It is suffici ent for the body, so vegetarians remain vegetable. And a simple thing, a non-fertilized egg has to be added to the vegetarian food. And it has all the protei ns which the non-vegetarian is getting from meat and other ugly things."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"But just the word 'egg' is enough to make them angry with me. All the vegetarians in India are angr y with me because I am teac hing people to eat eggs; and I am telling them that I am teaching non-fertilized eggs, which are not life, they don't have any life, th ey are just pure protein. My feeling is that we are living according to the past, without thinking of all the present discoveries, the present know ledge, and that's why we are poor, unnecessarily live in sickness, in old age, die so soon. Now in Soviet Russia there are people who have reached one hundred eighty years of age; and not one person, hundreds. There are more people who have reached one hundred fifty, and just it is a question of their food, wh at they are eating. And for centuries they have lived like that, and they have lived long. It is not a new thing, it has nothing to do with communism or Soviet Russia. Just it is a small part where people have always lived long, and they have never had old age. And nobody bothers to look at those people, what they eat, how they exercise, what is the reason that they can live one hundred eighty years, and the man is still young, and still working in the fields like any young man? And you cannot believe that he is one hundred eighty years old. It has been found that their main diet is yoghurt and it is now a proved fact that yoghurt can give a longer life span. And yoghurt is a simple food. It can be made available to whole humanity, there is no question. Now the fact is known for ten years, but no effort is being made in any country to promote yoghurt. It is just a different kind of curd, which can be available to everybody -- cheap, simple, but it seems we just go on living the way we have become accustomed. Any change seems to be difficult. And my whole effort is that every change should be the easiest thing in life. We should be ready to change as quickly as knowledge changes. We should keep pace with knowledge; we should not lag behind, and we are really lagging far behind, so I cannot say that every man is contemporary. They are only few men, perhaps a dozen men in the whole worl d, who can be called contemporaries. Others, somebody is living five thousand years back, somebody is living two thousand years back, without even both ering that where you have stopped. And the gap can be filled so quickly, just the young generation has to understand. So my whole approach is to the young generation, and my whole hope is with the young generation. The old are too old to change. Okay.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH ENZO BIAGI, AKA SARJANO, ITALIAN TV Q: THE FIRST QUESTION IS, WHAT IS YOUR TEACHING? (INAUDIBLE) A: I do not have any teaching at all. I am not a teacher in the sense that I don't give any philosophy of life, any discipline to live, and programs to follow. I have a certain approach to life which I share with my friends, my approach begins with de-programming. That is a key word as far as I am concerned. Initiation into my friendship means in itiation into de-programming. Everybody is programmed by birth -- either as Christ ian, or Hindu, or Jew or Mohammedan. The child is born innocent, but he is burdened very soon with hundreds concepts, and he lives with those conc epts his whole life. This is living a borrowed life; it is not authentic, it is not sincere, because it is not yours. You have not discovered any of those things that you are trying to live. So my first thing is to help you get rid of all your conditions. Those who come to me, if they are Christians, will no more be Chri stians; if they are Hindus will no more be Hindus; if they are Mohammedans will no more be Mohammedans. I simply give them back their innocence, their hu manity, their purity, their individuality. So my basic work is destroying their cond itionings. And it is a very simple work, because none of their conditioning is based on logic, intelligence. It is all superstitious. They have been provided with certain logical structures, but those logical structures are all phony. They are not authentic. For example, all the religions are based on the greatest lie in the world -- God. No religion has been able to prove logically, scientifically, has not been able to give any evidence, and yet they go on burdening every child that comes on the earth with the idea of God. It is very simple to take away the id ea; just I have to show to the person that your idea is enforced upon you. It is no t your intelligence that has accepted it; it is your innocence which has been corrupted by your parents, by your teachers, by your priests, and all logic that they have given to you is phony. For example, all the religions say that the God is needed, otherwise who will create existence. Existence is there, and there must be a creator. Without a creator, how can there be creation? But they stop there. An intelligent person will go a little more further, he will ask, \"If this is the case, then who created God?\""},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"God is there, and he has no creator. Then where your logic has gone? Existence needed a creator, and the creator himself n eeds no creator. This is not logic, this is just fallacious exploitation of human innocence; a child cannot argue. He simply accepts it. I am reminded of a beautiful anecdo te. A professor of philosophy in the University of Paris was a little eccentric, which is not rare. The professors of philosophy are rarely not eccentric. And he was the head of the department and he used to make statements which were absurd, and one day he went a little too far. He began his lecture with the statemen t that, \"I am the greatest man in the whole world.\" This was too much. One student stood up, he said, \"You are a great philosopher, a great logician, hence we ask you to prove this statement. Give us the logical background.\" The professor was absolutely ready, willingly, happily. He spread the map of the world on the board, and he asked the students, \"What country do you think is the greatest in the world?\" Obviously they all said, \"France.\" And th e professor laughed. The students could not understand why he is laughing. And then he asked, \"What do you think about the greatest, the most sacred place, the city, in France?\" And they all said, \"Paris. The most beautiful.\" And he laughed again. The students were feeling a little uncomfortable. Perhaps he is leading into some unknown logi cal conclusion. But still they were not aware where he is leading. And then he asked, \"What is the greatest thing, the greatest place in the greatest city of the greatest land in the world?\" And they all said, \"Of course, the un iversity. The temple of wisdom.\" The students said, \"Of course the greate st place in Paris is the University.\" And the professor laughed again, and asked, \"Which department is the greatest in the university?\" Now the students were caught. They knew that he has managed a phony argument. Looks like logic. But it is not logi c. They had to say, \"Of course it is the philosophy department.\" And the professor had a hearty laugh and he said, \"Now do you understand why I said 'I am the greatest man in the worl d'? I am the head of the department of philosophy.\" All arguments about God, about heaven, abou t hell, are just like that. My work is to destroy the phony structure of logic and simply your rock s start disappearing, your mythologies start disappearing, leaving you a pure space. And from that pure space arises your individuality. You are no more part of the crowd. That's my basic work -- to make you an individual, not just a cog in the wheel, not just a part of the crowd. To give yo u an integrity and to give you a freedom of the soul, that you are no more bound into any slavery called Christianity, or Hinduism, or Judaism; for the first time yo u are just yourself.

A: Why Socrates was poisoned? Why Jesu s was crucified? Why many attempts were made on the life of Buddha? They ha ve not done much to me. They have simply arrested me without any arrest warrant, without show ing any cause, why they are arresting me, without allowing me my birthright to call my attorneys. They did not answer me; their only ans wer was twelve loaded guns around me. But I enjoyed the whole experience. They were far more kind to me than people were to Socrates. They did not poison me . They were far more kind to me than people were to Jesus; they did not crucify me. They simply harassed me for twelve days, from one jail to another jail. And it does not matter at all to me. In fact, it was a great experience. I always wanted to visit hell, but hell does not exist. America provided me the opportun ity to visit it. And after twelve days, because there was no case against me, I had not done any harm to anybody; I had not committed any crime against anybody; my only crime was that I had created a commune of five thousand people, who were so happy and so rejoicing that their joy and their blissfulness became a jealousy in the neighbors, to the politicians, and particularly to the Christians. Christians have been coming to the Ea st converting millions of people to Christianity. This was for the first time somebody there who had taken thousands of Christians out of their fold, and they were absolutely helpless. And the people that they have converted in the East are not educated, are not cultured, are not of the higher strata of society. The people that Christians have converted in the East are beggars, aborigin als, primitives, orphans, people dying on the streets. They have not been able to convert a single intellectual, a single intelligent person in the whole East. Naturally they were very much offended , because I was not converting beggars, I was not converting orphans, I had conv erted their best minds; I had converted only the intelligentsia. And I was not conv erting the intelligentsia into another religion either, which is easier to take one toy from you and give you a new toy. Everybody is happy with something new. The old was rotten, getting dirty, was almost dilapidated, has been used for many centuries by many people, and it is beautiful to get a fresh, new toy.

A: Are you a Christian? My being sent out of America is simply an indication of the poverty of Christian theologians. If they had guts they wo uld have invited me to have an open encounter. But they knew that they don't ha ve any logic to support them. So they tried a criminal way to throw me out of th e country. But that is not going to stop me. Wherever I am, I will be doing the sa me. They cannot throw me out of this planet. So it is simply the defeat of Christiani ty and defeat of the great powers and the great nation, United States of America, that they could not manage a single individual who was standing against th em, not by any armed force, but by simply proposing a new way of looking at things. They wanted to remain blind, and this is my whole life's experience; th at I am selling candles in the city of the blind. It is not their fault that they get angry with me.

A: It did not manage to become rich. On ly the rich are attracted to me; because only the intelligent are attracted to me. You have to understand a certain hierarchy of values. You never ask, \"Why a poor man is not attracted to the paintings of Picasso?\" You never ask, \"Why a poor hungry beggar is not interested in the music of Mozart.\" Bu t you continuously ask why only rich people, cultured people, intelligent pe ople, educated people are attracted towards me. Religion is the ultimate luxury. And of course those who can afford it will be attracted towards it. It is not for the poo r. The poor does not need religion.

That's why he comes to me. Religion starts only when you are bored with your richness, when you have everything that money can provide and still you find you are empty. You ha ve everything that you can possess. And still you find that something is missing which money cannot give to you, and you have to find some other way. When money comes to the end of its capaci ties it gives you everything; and soon you start getting fed up and bored. That is the point where either you commit suicide, or you start a search that can bring you to a man like me. So I simply attract the rich. And I don't provide any op ium; so my way of life is not for the poor. Q: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN YOUR CHARISMATIC EFFECT ON PEOPLE? A: It's very simple; because I am not a politician. The politician speaks whatever the people want to hear. I speak whatever is my experience. I don' t care whether you like it or you don't like it. When I am speaking, I am speaking with my whole heart, irrespective of your reaction. My simplicity, my honesty. I am not in any way trying to influence you. There is no desire to convert you. All th at I am doing is, I am enjoying to share my experience. You will find in the world people who are all interested in you to convert. You will not find people who are not interested in converting you, who are simply interested in sharing th eir heart and their soul with you. So I don't know what charisma is, be cause I have never come across any charismatic personality in the whole world. I am not interested in influencing anybod y. I am tremendously happy simply to share my vision with you. Perhaps my si ncerity, my truth, my authority behind it, becomes a charismatic influence on you; and when I say my authority, I do not mean that I am an authoritative man. Th ere is a vast difference which has to be remembered. A authoritative man has always a borrowed authority. When people say, \"Listen to me, because my word is God's word,\" this is the voice of the authoritative man. He is using God's name to enforce his authority. When the Pope speaks, he is speaking in the name of Jesu s Christ. He is authoritative. I am not authoritative, because I am not speaking in anybody's name. No God to support me, no holy Bible to support me. It is simply my own experience. That gives tremendous authority to me. Perhaps all these qualities together -- the authority behind my word, my own experi ence, no desire to influence you, my sincerity to expose the truth, and my oblig ation to you, that you listen to me. You are not obliged by me. I am obliged by you, that you gave me a chance to"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"unburden my heart; it is something like a ra incloud when it is full of rainwater. It want to shower somewhere. It is just like when a rose opens its petals it wants the breeze to come and take its flavor, its fragrance, to far away places. I am obliged to you. Perhaps that's what is impresses you as charismatic. Otherwise I am a very simple man. I don't do miracles, I don't make wine out of water because I am not a criminal. That is a crime; to create drugs out of water. I don't pretend to be the only begotten son of God. I don't say th at you have to believe in me; on the contrary I say that I provoke you to think, to doubt, to be sceptical. Because I know that if you doubt, if you inquire, you are bound to find truth, that I have found. (Tape side B) It is only the people who are afraid of th eir truth that force you to believe, that say \"Have faith.\" Because they are af raid if you inquire you may not find anything what they are saying. Their insist ence on faith simply proves that they themselves don't know. Otherwise, wh y be afraid of doubt and inquiry? My invitation is to inquire; because I kn ow whatever I am saying is there within you, just as it is within me. Q: IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT IN YOUR COMMUNES THERE IS LIMITLESS SEXUAL ACTIVITY. IS THAT TRUE, AND WHAT IS SEX, AND WHAT IS LOVE? A: In the first place, there can never be limitless sexual activity. Biology prevents it. It is not within your hands. How many times you can make love in one night? And you will know that it cannot be limit less. There is a limit. And it comes very soon. It is absolutely absurd that in my commu nity there is limitless sexual activity. In fact, there are so many activities goin g on that nobody ha s time for sexual activity. And I am not for repression; that does not mean that I am telling you to be licentious. When I say, \"Don't repress\" I simply mean, \"Listen to the body. It has a wisdom of its own.\" When you are eating, can you eat limitlessly? You know perfectly well that your body gives you clear cut indications when to stop. And if you listen to the body, you will be healthier. There are two kinds of extremists: one wh o will fast, will not listen to the body that 'I am hungry', and the other will go on eating when the body is crying that 'I am overloaded. Stop.' In America I came to know there are thirty million people who are dying because they have no food, no clothes, no shelter. And thirty million exact number, thirty m illion other people who are dying because they are eating too much. Now we must be living in an insane world. Ju st a simple thing has to be decided. Sixty million people are dying for a simple misunderstanding. Thirty million starving and thirty million ov ereating. Sixty million people can be saved within a minute."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Just what you do with your food, what yo u do with your thirst? You don't go on drinking. You know when your thirst is gone. You stop. Then why sex has become a problem? In my commune, sex is a natural thing as everything else. Neither too much nor the other extreme. Just the middl e way, the golden middle(*). And you asking me about \"What is sex, and what is love?\" Sex is something biological. All animal s are sexual beings. Only man has the privilege to have something higher than sex. Not just the meeting of the bodies but the meeting of two souls. That's what love is. Love can contain sex. Sex cannot contain love. Sex is a small thing. Love is vast and trem endous. It can be without sex too; it is not necessary that a love relationship shou ld have sex. In fact, my experience, is the more you go higher than sex, and you start enjoying a spiritual communion with a friend, with a woman, with a ma n; from that state of communion sex seems to be so far away, so much in the hands of blind biolo gy, love seems such a freedom, and such a growth that it go es on growing; that you may not like even to get down to the dark valleys of sexuality. But I am not preventing. I am simply sa ying that as love grows deeper, sex becomes shallower. When love reaches to its optimum, sex disappears. It seems so childish; just think of yourse lf, just putting yourself a little far away, and looking yourself making love. And you will be surprised -- is it you doing all these gymnastics -- stupid, idiotic. The real transformation of sexual energy is love. But it happens only if you allow sex a natural acceptance. It does not happen to the monks of all the religions. They are the loveless people. They cannot love, because they have not even gone into sex. They have avoided the basic en ergy which can be transformed into love, so they may talk about love but their talk is just bullshit. They don't understand anything about love and they cannot understand. You have to go step by step; and your body is your first step. You cannot ignore it; it is so basic, so mu ch rooted in existence. Ignoring it is simply committing suicide. Ignoring it me ans perversion. So all the monks of all the religions, all the nuns of all the re ligions are perverted as far as sex is concerned. They will have to find some way. They will become homosexuals, they will become lesbians. And that is an ugly state. And religions have forced people to beco me homosexuals, lesbians, making love to animals; and we still go on respecting celibacy. It should be declared a crime. Nobody can be celibate, because that is against nature. You have to learn acceptance of natu re, and through that acceptance is transcendence. By being in a sexual rela tionship, perhaps the relationship and the intimacy will create something new, which is love. And as love grows, sex starts sinking, because it is the same energy that is changing, it is moving into a higher form. When love comes to its maturity, sex disappears. That is true"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"celibacy. But you have not done anything for it. It has come to you as a gift from nature. When celibacy comes as a gift from existe nce, it is tremendously beautiful; but when you impose it upon yourself you create homosexuality, and then you will create one day AIDS. Just the other day so mebody was saying to me that Mother Theresa is opening a hospice in New York for AIDS pati ents. And the person told me, \"She is doing great service to humanity.\" I said, \"This is nonsense. These people are the people who created AIDS. So if they are opening hospitals, nursing homes, it is simply repentance. It is not service. The whole vatican should be co nverted into a hospice for all the AIDS patients; because these are the people who ha ve created it. And it is not service; it is simply repentance.\" I simply teach acceptance of your na ture; and through acceptance, immense transformations happen. But they come on their own accord. You don't have to force them. Love has a beauty. Sex is ugly. Sex is something like the root s of a rose bush. Those roots are going to be ugly. Love is like the roses; although those roots are continuously sending energy to the roses, it is the roots and their energy that is becoming roses, so I will not say to you, \"Cut your roots because they are ugly.\" Do not cut the roots, help them to be strong, nourish them; and you will have thousands of roses blossoming. And that will be what I call love. Q: WHAT IS YOUR RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS? A: Every child is born happy. Every child is born innocent and beautiful. And then something happens; all those beautiful children get lost; all their innocence is destroyed. All their joy is turned into misery. Just look at a child, collecting seashells on the beach. And he is more happy than the richest man in the worl d. What is his secret? That is my secret too. The child is in the moment, enjoying the sunshine, the salty air of the beach, the beautiful expanse of the sands. He is here now. He is not thinking of the past; he is not thinking of the future. And whatev er he is doing, he is doing totally, intensely; he is so absorbed within it he has forgotten everything. And that is the simple secret of happiness. Whatever you are doing, don't let past move(*) your mind; don't let future disturb you. Because the past is no more, and the future is not yet. To live in the memories, to live in the imagination, is to live in the non- existential. And when you are living in th e non-existential, you are missing that which is existential. Naturally you will be miserable, because you will miss your whole life."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"All the time you are simply missing, and you are never given by existence two moments together; it gives you only one moment at a time. And that one moment either can be lived, or can be mi ssed. There are two ways to miss it -- let past burden you, let future attract you, an d it is gone. You are losing the real for the unreal. And this is the whole misery of humanity. All that I try to help my friends to understand is, to live in the present. Just now, there is no misery, no suffering, no angu ish. Just move away from the present, and you have gone into something unre al; and the unreal is bound to be miserable. Reality is ecstatic; and to join with rea lity the only way is not to miss the present moment. And if you know just the taste, on ce, how it feels to be in the present -- looking at the sunrise or the sunset, just be there, so that you can have a little taste of the present -- and you will be surp rised that you have the key all the time with you. The master key, that can open all the doors of the mysteries of life; its ecstasies, its beauties. You don't need a Jesus Christ to lead you into paradise; you are capable to be in paradise right now. Because paradise is not somewhere above. It is somewhere here. I am reminded; there was a great atheist and he had written in his sitting room the motto of his whole philosophy -- God is nowhere. So anybod y coming to visit him was bound to see it in gold letters on the wall that it was impossible to miss it. And then, naturally, the discussion will start. And then a child was born to the atheist, and the child was growing up. He was learning alphabet and he was learning slowly to make words. And one day he was sitting in the lap of his father, the great atheist, and he started reading the sentence on the wall. He could read 'God is' but 'nowhere' was too big a word. He could not make it. So he cut it in two pieces. He read \"God is now here.\" The father was shocked. He had never thought about it, that 'nowhere' ca n be also read as 'now here.' And it is said that disturbed his whole atheist philosophy. He started thinking of 'now here' and the implications of it. Not that you will find God if you are now here.... Not that you will find god now, here; but you will find something more than god. You will find godliness. That is my word for the ultimate experience of bliss. Remember these two words, now here; and you know the secret of the ultimate happiness. There has never been any other secret, and there will never be another secret. This is it. And it is so simple, and so easily possible for every human being. You need not be part of any church, any organization. You need not carry a holy Bible , or the Vedas or the Gita or Koran. All that you ha ve to do is just a little understanding of your own mind, its function, how it functions. Your mind is never in the present, and time is always in the present; so time and mind never meet.

It is for reference use only.] INTERVIEW WITH KATHY GANNON, FOTO PRESS Q: BHAGWAN, THERE SEEMS TO BE A RESURGENCE OF CONSERVATISM, NOT ONLY IN POLITICS BUT IN PEOPLE'S SEARCH FOR INNER- STRENGTH, FOR TRUTH, PEACE. GROUPS SUCH AS THE MORAL MAJORITY APPEAR TO BE GAININ G GROUND, STRENGTHENING THEIR INFLUENCE. WHAT IS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS RESURGENCE? HOW DOES IT CONFLICT OR DIFFER FROM YOUR TEACHINGS? A: It always happens, whenever socie ty comes to a point of revolution, the conservative forces have resurgence; fo r the simple reason -- to prevent the revolution that is oncoming. It is a de fence measure. But in fact, it is an acceptance of defeat. Conservative forces either in politics or in religion remain silent when they are certain that nothing is going to overth row them. But when they see the danger, they collect all their energies to prevent any rebellion, any change, any transformation; so it is a good sign. It is just like, at the time of death it happens always that the person simply becomes pe rfectly healthy. All diseases disappear. It is the last effort of his life energy. He risks everything becaus e death is so close. Now he cannot be moderate. Before a candle dies, the flame of the candle burns the brightest. It is a natural phenomenon. You are asking me, \"Why it is happening?\" It is happening because man is at the very door where either he has to die or to transform. You will see this resurgence all over the world. But this is a resurg ence that certifies the victory of the revolution. The old society is at the point of death. Before dying it will make its last effort to survive. But a last effort is a last effort. It cannot survive. And you are asking me how I see it in refe rence to my ideology. I rejoice, because I can see the death, and I can see the conservative forces resurging with great energy. To me, it is a rejoicing, a moment of celebration. The new is going to happen very soon; the old is having its last breath. Q: BHAGWAN, THERE ARE THE FEW THAT ARE VERY RI CH, AND THOSE THAT ARE POOR; BUT IN THE MIDDLE SITS THE GREAT MAJORITY WHO ARE AVERAGE IN INCOME AND IN TELLECT. DO THEY POSSESS THE"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR TEACHINGS? OR MUST SOME MATERIAL SELF-SUFFICIENCY BE ATTAINED BEFORE ACCEPTANCE CAN BE ACHIEVED? A: The basic question is not to achieve material sufficiency; because there have been even poor people who have attained to the ultimate. When I say that the poor cannot understand the highest flights of consciousness, I am simply talking about the rule, not about the exceptions. Kabir was a poor man; so was Farid a poor man. And there have been others too who achieved to the ultimate. But they wer e not of average intellect; they had as superior an intelligence as any Albert Einstein, perhaps better. So the real thing is, the av erage intellect is a barrier. The average intellect cannot understand me, for the simple reason be cause when you talk about the higher realms of being the average intellect is left far behind. It is inconceivable to it; so the question is not material sufficiency. Even if somebody has all the worldly riches with him, but has an average intelligence, all his possessions are not going to help as far as religious growth is concerned. Then too he needs a sharper intelligence, a keener insight; otherwise there are so many rich people in the world. But you don't see so many enlightened people. I have known richest people; but their riches are only of th e world; not of co nsciousness. Their consciousness is poor. I used to stay in a palace of a very rich man. He was thought to be the silver king of India because he has the hold of the whole market of silver; it was in his hands to bring the prices down or up. But he was a man of average intelligence. I asked him, \"You have everything conceivable. \" He was the only man in the whole world who had a Rolls Royce made specia lly with solid gold. Even the engine was solid gold, nothing but gold was used. I asked him, \"You have beautiful palaces; you have everything that one can think of, but I feel sorry for you because you are not yet bored. You are still thinking of having more and more. That shows the average intelligence. A higher intelligence gets bored very soon, because it can see that you can have everything of the world, but still inside you remain empty. In fact, when you have all the things in contrast you see your emptiness more clearly. And you see that death is approaching, and you are still collecting seashells on the seashore. And death will snatch away everything from you, and you will be dying just like any beggar. There will not be any difference in your death and in the death of a beggar. And unless you can make a difference in the quality of your death, it indicates that you have not been able to make a qualitative difference in your life either. Death is only a conclusion; it conc ludes your whole life, and if you have to die like a beggar then I can say to you th at you have lived like a beggar. You may have lived in the palaces; but th at does not make any difference.\" He said, \"I have never thought about it. I am so busy, there is so much to do. In fact, I am surprised when I hear that somebody is bored.\""},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"I told him, \"You should remember, buffa loes are never bored; donkeys are never bored; dogs are so busy without any bu siness, they are never bored. Except human beings, no other entity, no other living being in existence experiences boredom; and all human beings also don't ex perience it. It is experienced only by the highest intelligent people. A Jean-Pau l Sartre experiences boredom; a Jaspers experiences boredom; a Marcel experiences boredom. That's where in this century French philosophy defeated the whole British domination over philosophy for centur ies, the German domination over philosophy for centuries. One is surpri sed, what happened suddenly? Because you don't come across a single great ph ilosopher in France in the past. Since Aristotle to Bertrand Russell you will fi nd great Greek philosophers, great German thinkers, great British philosoph ers; but you will not find a single French name. But something changed sudde nly. With Jean-Paul Sartre, French philosophy proved far higher. Bertrand Russell became a pigmy for the simple reason because Jean-Paul Sartre brought words like boredom, anguish, despair, meaninglessness for the first time into th e world of philosophy. He proved to be the keenest intellect. Bertrand Russell is not bored. He has written much, but it is all average. Jean- Paul Sartre has not written much, but wh atever he has written is not average; each single statement has come out of trem endous agony of the soul. He sees that life has no meaning, that it is an accident, that there is no way to make any meaning out of it, that you can go on play ing with things just to avoid boredom. Otherwise you are going to commit suicide. Because there is nothing else to do. It is all repetition. The same thing you ha ve been doing your whole life. And you will continue to do it till you die. And stran ge that even people don't want to die. I knew one great dramatist. He was dying, he was seventy five, he had asked me to come immediately. I rushed to his house and I said, \"What is the urgency?\" He said, \"Urgency? I am dying. Try to save me.\" I said, \"But for what; because I have kn own you for twenty years. It is the same routine. You have lived for seventy five years, and you are still not bored? Be thankful that death has come and you ne ed not commit suicide, that death is a deliverance. I don't see any point. What you will do?\" He was angry at me. He said, \"I have aske d you to do something, to meditate for me. I am dying, and you are talking strange things.\" I said, \"I am not going to meditate for your life; because what you will do tomorrow? You will repeat your yesterday. But you have done it, and what have you gained? You just tell me, can you do anything new? Are you capable of thinking anything new. In twenty years I have never seen. I have looked into your dramas -- it is the same story, it is the same triangle. Just the names are different; but it can be reduced to the same plot. And you think you have created one hundred dramas? They are all carbon copies of each other. And you are still not bored? That shows average intelligen ce. And religion begins when you start"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"feeling bored with your ordinary life, with the mundane life; when you are fed up with it all.\" Naturally the poor man will need a tremendously powerful intelligence to be fed up of things which he had not got; that needs great intelligence. But the average man, wherever he is, whether poor, whet her middle class, whether rich, does not matter. His average intelligence cannot get fed up with the world. And religion begins with the boredom, with the anguis h, with the meaninglessness of all that you have been doing, of all that you ha ve been. It is radical transformation. I am reminded of a beautiful story. A ki ng used to go in the night around the capital to see that everything is alright or not; is there some dissatisfaction? In disguise, he will go on the horse. He was puzzled about one thing only. The whole city was sound asleep, just a mystic was always awake, sitting under his tree, immensely joyous, enjoying the silenc e that has descended over the capital, enjoying the coolness of the night, the beauty of the stars. The king started becoming interested in the man. He seem ed to be a rare man. He had nothing and he was so joyous; his eyes were sp arkling with some unknown bliss; his whole being was radiating a certain energy field. Even the king, passing by his tree, had felt a certain breeze of silence, of joy, of bliss, of peace. One day he could not contain his temptati on. He touched the feet of the mystic and asked him, \"Would you accept my invitation. I would love you to be in my place.\" And naturally, just like the average mind, although he was inviting the mystic, deep down he was hoping that he will reject. An ascetic, one who has renounced the world, can not come to the palace. But that was unconscious. But the mystic was really a great master. He said, \"Okay, so I am ready. Should I come right now, or tomorrow morning. Because tomorrow is not certain.\" The king was shocked. This is not expected of mystics. This is the working of the average mind. Because he has invited himself, now he cannot withdraw. But his respect for the mystic disappeared. They reached the palace; the king gave him his best chambers, he gave him his best clothes, and each thing he accepted the respect in his eyes was going down. Next day they were eating together, the mo st delicious food the king has ordered for the guest. But deep down the king wa s thinking, \"I have been cheated. This man was pretending. He befooled me, he exploited me, he managed to impress me.\" And the mystic was enjoying the delic ious food, and it was hurting hard in the king's heart; this is not the way of a my stic. It is all against the expectations of the average mind. Luxury is not for the mystical people. Everyday the respect was turning sour. With in six months he had almost come to a point of hatred. The mystic said to the ki ng that \"I think it is time you should ask me a question. Why you go on carryin g things within you? You could have asked any time. And I think now th e moment has come. The love has disappeared, the respect has disappeared, and I have been watching all these things going away; and now hatred, anger, fr ustration has entered in you. This is the time you should put it out. Be straightforward.\""},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The king said, \"Yes, there has been a ques tion that has been haunting me since you have come into the palace. It has be come more and more clear. The question is, I want to ask you now what is the difference between me and you? You are living in luxury, you are living in the pa lace, you are enjoying all the riches possible. Now what is the difference between me and you? Why I am still a worldly man and you are a mystic, a master? I don't see the difference.\" The mystic laughed. He said, \"It is a beautiful morning. Can we go for a walk? And perhaps, walking, I may be able to answer the question .\" They went for a walk. The king again and again said, \"What about the question?\" And the mystic said, \"Wait just a little more. A little patience.\" Then they reached the river, the boundary of the king's kingdom. And the mystic said, \"I am going, leaving your empire to you. Are you coming with me or not?\" The king said, \"How I can come with you? I have a kingdom, and I have thousand and one problems to solve.\" And the mystic said, \"Have you received the answer? I am going because I don't have a kingdom, and I do n't have any problems.\" Suddenly the king saw the difference, felt deep remorse, fell into the feet of the mystic that, \"Forgive me. I had been st upid, but please come back. Don't go away. Otherwise my whole life I will c arry this wound that there was a great master so closely available, and I missed in my stupidity.\" The mystic said, \"I have no difficulty to come back, but the problem is the same thing will happen again. Your respect, your love that has arisen back will disappear. I have no problem, I can come back. It makes no difference to me whether I go ahead or I go back, but it makes much difference to you. And I would like to leave you in a state of love, respect, gratitude rather than in a state of hatred, frustration. It is not basically a question of what you have, the question is are you contented with it? And you have a very average mind. If you are discontented with it, then there is a po ssibility of growing into the world of religion; moving higher into consciousn ess; a tremendous discontent with the world, a tremendous discontent with yourself as you are, that needs intelligence.\" What can I do? I can simply explain to yo u for the average mind the priests have created a bogus religion, which changes nothing in them. The whole world is full of Mohammedans, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Jews, but nothing has changed in them. The priests exist for the averag e mind, the poor mind. He gives you a substitute, not the real thing. He cannot gi ve you the real thing. Nobody can give you the real thing. It is your own discontent which can bring you to the brink of revolution. So the question is, not whether you are poor, whether you are middle class or super-rich. Condensed into a simple maxi m, the question is, whether you have intelligence enough to feel the frustratio n of the ordinary life. Once you start feeling the frustration of the ordinary lif e, you are bound to go into search for"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"something else, something different, so mething qualitatively different. The average mind goes on into the world of quantity; you have a house, you want a better house; you have so much money, yo u want more money. This is the world of quantity. The intelligent mind moves in a new direct ion, a new dimension of quality. It is not a question of more money, more houses, more prestige, more power. It is a question of deep understanding, of imme nse insight, of coming to terms with existence, of having a communion with the whole, so that you can start feeling an explosion of meaning, and music and poetry. But for the change from quantity to quali ty, you need an intelligence so sharp as a sword. And that's my whole work here; to go on shining your sword, giving it more sharpness. Your average mind is created by your society, because it needs only average mind, because it needs clerks; it does not need the mystics. It needs school teachers, it needs station masters, it needs business men. For that, the average mind is the right mind. The mystic is dangerous. You cannot make a mystic a station master. You cannot make a mystic a clerk. The difficulty is that the mystic cannot deal with quantity. (Tape side B) The story is about Nanak that his family was in great trouble. They were poor people, and they wanted him, now he was young, they wanted him to be employed somewhere; but wherever they managed to employ him, within a week or two he was sent back. Because the people said that this man is utterly useless. Finally, the father went to the king and said his misery; he has been an old employee of the king and he has served him his whole life, he was retired. He said, \"I am in great difficulty. This is my only son and you have retired me. Now we have to depend on his earnings, but wherever we find somehow some employment he is turned back.\" The king said, \"There is no problem. Yo u have served me with such honesty and such loyalty, I will put him into some de partment and something that he can do, something very easy. You send your so n.\" And he was put in the ration shop where his work was only to measure wh eat, rice, and other food stuff for different regiments of the king; and just give it to the responsible person who had come. The very first day the trouble started. He was weighing and he started putting things into the bag the regiment officer had brought. It was going good up to twelve; from one, two up to twelve everything went well. But at the point thirteen -- the Hindi word for thirteen is tera; it also means dying, yours. It also means thirteen, but it also means -- mera means mine, te ra means dying; so when he came to tera he stopped. He went on fourteen, fifteen, but he went on saying \"tera\"; he forgot the first meaning, th irteen; he remembered only the second meaning, that everything is yours. So the number went on from thirteen,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. But to him, it st opped at tera; and the officer looked at him, is he mad or something? He reported to the king, that what kind of man you have chosen? He does not know more digits than thirteen. He stops at thirteen, and then goes on counting thirteen, thirteen, thirteen. Now that officer is the world of quantity. He could not even think that tera also means dying; tera simply means 'thirt een'. Now, on that simple word, two separate paths. One of quantity, one of quality. The king himself came to see what ha d happened. Tears were flowing from Nanak. He was in a ecstat ic mood, continuously pouring to everybody who was coming; beggars started coming, other people from the streets saw that he is just not taking any note who is taking. He is simply giving and shouting \"Tera.\" The king looked at him. He was a man of certain understanding. He said, \"He may be wrong for you all. But he is a man of rare quality. I will remove him from here, otherwise he will destroy my palace . But this man is worth not to be a servant, but to be a king.\" And the king touched his feet; and that was the day that he was recognized by others , when the king touched his feet. A certain intelligence that can change you from any moment of life into the qualitative realm; and the average mind is not born average. It is kept average by your belief systems, by your religions, by your politicians, by your education. He is kept average. The family appreciates the average child; not the very intelligent child. Because the very intelligent child is continuous ly a trouble, a problem. He raises questions which the parents cannot ans wer; and they feel embarrassed. The average child never raises any questions. So there is no problem for gaining material satisfaction. If you remain average, you can have the whole world. Nothing w ill happen to you. But you can sharpen your mind. And the method is simple: just what has been done to you, do the opposite. They have told you to have fait h; don't have faith. They have told you to believe; don't believe. Doubt. They have told you to be with the crowd. I say to you, be an individual. And you will drop yo ur averageness. It is just forced on you. Each child is born with tremendous pote ntiality. But nobody wants him to have that become actual. He is prevented e arly, because the society needs retarded people. Otherwise, who is going to be a soldier; who is going to be a policeman; who is going to be a priest? Who is goin g to be a Christian, or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan? Only retarded people are needed. The vested interests are immensely afraid of intelligence. And that's why they are all against me. This is my crime. I am corrupting people, because I am taking away people from the crowd, and I am taking away their averageness, their retardedness. This they call corruption. But this is not new. They poisoned Soc rates for the same re ason. The same was the crime against him in the court, that he corrupts the youth. That authentically"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"sincere man was simply telling people how not to believe. How to gather courage to doubt, inquire, so that you can come to know the truth by yourself, because all borrowed truths are not truths, but lies. Q: BHAGWAN, IS THE INCREASING INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE ON GOVERNMENT DIRECTING POLICY? WHERE WILL THE INCREASING INFLUENCE OF RELIGION ON STATE, LEAD? A: It will lead even to a worse kind of world than we have got. It is the influence of the religious leaders, religious doctrine s, that has created the hell of the earth. And now, it is certainly increasing. The reason again has to be understood, is that the politicians are also afraid of the rebellious youth. The wings of the youth have to be cut. It cannot be allowed freedom. You can talk as much as you lik e about freedom, but don't act it. And to be on the safer side, it is better to cut your wings, so you can talk about freedom. But you cannot open your wings and fly into the sky, and have a taste of freedom. The politicians are worried, because the yout h is slipping out of their hands. And the only way they can find is, to have th e support of the religious establishments. Together with political power and religio us tradition, perhaps they hope they can prevent the changing consciousness of the new age. So they are in a conspiracy against the future of humani ty; a conspiracy against the new man. And both are afraid of the same thing, so naturally there is an affinity. Religion can influence people, through parents, through education systems, through churches, from the very childho od. Politics comes later. Religion comes very early in your life. It makes the foun dation of your life. And they both are together. Again I say, this is a good si gn; because they can see that separately they cannot stand the upheav al that is going to come. They have to join hands. Otherwise there is nothing common between politics and religio n. The only thing common is the vested interest in keeping people retarded. You are asking me what will be the influe nce, what will be the impact of it? It will be a calamity if they ever succeed. It will be an abortion of the new man. And that is the only hope, because the ol d man is finished; it is just a dead corpse, that is somehow just dragging itself just out of old habit. There is a story in India; a great w arrior Ramasangha(*) was fighting the Mohammedans invaders, and he was a furious warrior. In the war, his head was cut. Naturally, when your head is cut you have to fall down, lie down dead. But Ramasangha was such a furious warrior, he forgot. He went on cutting people's heads without head. In fact, he created a havoc. The enemies started escaping. They had never seen such a scene -- a ma n without head cutting people this way and that way. Perhaps that story is not true. I don't thin k it is possible without a head. But, it has a symbolic meaning. Just out of old habits, the old man goes on dragging"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"himself. He has died long before, but he has forgotten to lie down; he goes on continuing. Not only that, he is conspiri ng that the new man should not arise, for the simple reason because the new man w ill be so alive, that perhaps it may remind the old man that \"You are dead; th at it is time you should be in your grave.\" All your politicians and all your religious leaders should be in their graves. But for that the new man is needed to give them the idea that they have been dead long before. They have not s een the living being, with all its joy and dance and song and love. It is good. Let them join -- let all the dead people of the world join together. They are not more powerful than a single living new man. It is a crowd of corpses. And they are making their last effort. They will do everything nasty that they can do, because when it is a question of survival you forget all courtesies, mannerisms; you put them everything aside, your animal comes out. So the coming days are going to be very decisive; whether the animal, the barbarious, who has been doing nothin g but fighting, killing, burning alive people for centuries, is to remain our future too? Or we are going to have a new future, a clean slate, to write our history from the very scratch. It is tremendously decisive and I don't see that the old order can win against the rising sun. It has to give way. That is the nature of things. The old has to die for the young to live; they have to vacate the place, howsoever resistant they may be and however long th ey may have occupied it, it does not matter. When the new man knocks on the d oor, they have to vacate the place, and simply go into their graves, silent ly and gracefully. Otherwise we will have to force them. We don't want to do that.I am reminded again; an old man, a Jew, was dying. All his four sons had gathered . The man was lying there, just in front of them, on his bed, just the last mome nts. But the sons were puzzled. The first son said, \"What we are going to do, to carry his body in the casket to the graveyard? I think he should have a Rolls Royce, a limousine. The old man always wanted a limousine, but could not manage because of his miserliness. At least let him have it now, although he will be dead, and it is going to be only one way journey; he will not come back again.\" The second son said, \"You are always wa sting money. What does it matter to a dead man, whether it is Rolls Royce or an ordinary car? I don't agree; a dead man knows nothing, and anyway he is not accustomed with Rolls Royces. He could not manage his whole life, why we should waste our money when he is dead?\" The third boy said, \"In fact, what is the need of a car? We can arrange just a truck from the municipal committee. A dead ma n cannot make any distinctions. It is free of charge.\" Listening to all this, the old man managed somehow to sit in his bed, afraid that what the fourth is going to suggest. He said, \"Wait, where are my shoes? They were all shocked. They said, \"What you are going to do with your shoes?\" He said, \"I am still alive, I can walk to the graveyard. Gracefully, let me reach to the graveyard and don't waste anything, an d don't do such an ugly thing calling"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"a municipal corporation truck. And the fourth has not still spoken. Perhaps he may like to drag me just down the road ? Just find out the shoes because I am finishing every moment. Let me die gracefully.\" The only man has only one choice; either he dies gracefully or he will force the new man to drag him to the graveyard. No politicians and no religious leaders can save that is dead. No politicians, no religious leaders can prevent what existence wants to produce. It is going to come. Existence is far infinitely more powerful than all your tiny politicians and your stupid Popes and Ayatollah Khomeiniacs, and Shankaracharyas. If existence has a desire to create a n ew humanity because the old has failed, then no matter what these people try to prevent it, they are not going to succeed. Their very efforts show that deep down they know they are losing power. People are slipping out of their hands. So it is a desperate last effort. But absolutely meaningless and absurd. (Tape side C; seems to be a gap) There were few more questions I had reject ed. But I don't want the journalist to go with the idea that I rejected them be cause I don't have the answers. I rejected them because they were not worth answerin g. But not to give him the idea that I don't have the answers for them, I will answer shortly and quickly. First, he had asked that from America to India, from India to Nepal, now what am I going to do? Now I am going to do a world tour. Because I don't believe in politician boundaries, and I conceive th e whole earth as mine; and I have my people all around the world, many of whom I have not seen for years. And I would like to see all of them. So rather than calling all of them in one place, which will be impossible, because now th ere must be at least three to four million people, the only way is that I should move, go around the world, have a look at my people, give them a little more fire; because they will need fire to burn many things. Second, he had asked that \"Bhagwan, yo u live in luxury, your life style is luxurious. What about your sannyasins?\" In the first place, I am the poorest man in the whole world because I don't possess anything. And whatever I use belongs to my sannyasins, not to me. They have si mply borrowed it for a time being to be used by me. And what gives you the idea of luxury? Perhaps you see the diamonds on my cap, you see the diamon ds on my watch. Don't be befooled. They are not diamonds, they are absolute ly proletarian authentic stones. Just my people have cut them in such a way that they can defeat diamonds; even my watch is made by my own people, and it is studded with stones, not with diamonds. It has no value as far as cost is concerned; otherwise it is invaluable because it is a gift of love. If you want to know about my food you can ask Devaraj, my personal physician. He does not allow me more than two thousand calories per day. Do you think it is luxury? He is sitting in the kitchen weighing everything -- it should not be"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"more than two thousand calories in the whole day, twenty four hours. Two thousand calories are given to really sick people who are eating in the hospital. Would you like to change places? I am ready. You can have my robes, but you will have to eat my food too. And it looks apparently that I am using a very costly robe. But it is all synthetic. In th e long run, it is the cheapest material possible. If I am using cotton, I will be using ten robes in the same time. Just one robe will do. It is the cheapest and the most beautiful. And everything from my shoes to my head is made by my sannyasins. And what do you consider my life style? How can you manage to think it is luxurious? I don't drink alcohol, I don't go to dances, I have not seen a movie, I simply come two times out of the house to see only my people. I don't read anything -- books, magazines, newspapers , radio, television. I am not a member of any luxurious club. My life style is ve ry simple. Mostly I am asleep. I love sleeping; because to me sleep is synonymo us to meditation and in sleep there are nobody who is a beggar, nobody who is an emperor. Sleep is very communist. What has given you the idea that I am living luxuriously? And whatever way I am living, it is my people who want me to be as comfortable as possible. It is their love. I have not asked it. As far as my sannyasins are concerned, I am their luxury. They are the richest people in the world because they have me. There is no group compared to them. Catholics have that idiot pope. There is not a single group of seeker s in the whole worl d who has a mystic amongst them, as a friend, who is not creati ng any kind of slavery; who is trying to give them their individuality, their freedom, their original face. They are the richest people in the world. So never say again that my people are poor. Third, you had asked that \"Your sannyasin s need you, although you insist for independence. Can your sannyasins exist without you?\" You have to understand three words. One is dependence, which has been the law down the ages. To destroy dependence I have to talk about independence. But the reality is neither dependence nor independence. Independence is only an antidote for dependence. It is like you ha ve a thorn in your feet, then you take another thorn to take it out. The second th orn is as much a thorn as the first. But it helps you to take out the first. That does not mean that you should start worshipping the second thorn. You have to throw them both. Dependence has been the law through the ages. That is one thorn. I give you another thorn -- independence, so that you can destroy dependence. Then what is left is tremendously beautiful and unknown experience -- that is interdependence. The whole existence is interdependent. You cannot exist for a single moment absolutely independent. You are breathing. You are dependent on the air surrounding you. If oxygen is removed from the air you will die immediately, with all your in dependence in your pocket. You are thirsty, you have to drink. Yo u cannot say that I am an independent man; I cannot drink water; I will remain, I will exist without water. Life is"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"interdependent. We are all joined togeth er; we are not island s. We are a whole continent. I teach independence just as an arbitrary device to destroy dependence, so that you can become available to a new phenom enon -- interdependence. We all need each other. The farthest star is also feedin g you; the sun is far away. It takes for its rays to reach to you almost ten minu tes. And for the light, ten minutes is a very long journey. To you ten minutes seems to be a very small fragment of time. But not to the light. Because light travel s one hundred eighty six thousand miles per second; multiplied by sixty, that will be one minute travel; multiplied by ten that will be ten minutes' distance. So many miles! But we live on it; our bodies are warm because of the sun. Ot herwise you will simply go cold. Scientists are worried that one day the su n is going to die, because it is for millions of years radiating heat. It does not have an inexhaustible source. Its source is limited. One day, suddenly, th e fuse will go off. One night you will see the sunset, and there is not going to be any morning again. But you will not survive either to see, that there is no more any morning. You will all become cold turkeys. Life is one, an organic unity. Yes, my people have a certai n communion with me, the same way I have a certain communion with them. There is no question of dependence, no question of independence . It is a question of becoming one. Your fourth and last question was, \"What happened to you in America?\" Now the story is so old, it seems older than Adam and Eve. So please forgive me! I don't deal in junk. Okay.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] PRESS INTERVIEWS Q: BHAGWAN, WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU I FEEL I AM FLOATING IN THE OCEAN AND I AM FILLED (INAUDIBLE) DIVINE, BUT YOU DO NOT SPEAK ABOUT THE ZERO. IS IT BECAUSE THAT WE ALL COME FROM THE ZERO AND WE WILL VANISH IN THE ZERO? A: This is one of the most familiar perenni al questions man has ever asked. It is immensely significant to understand few im plications of it, before I answer the question directly. First, the way it is presented it is not a question. It is a statement. You are saying, from the zero we all come, and into zero we all dissolve. Where is the question? You are speaking as if you know. A question comes as an inquiry. This is not an inquiry. You are stating something out of your knowledgeability. Please forgive me if it hurts you. I am helpless, becaus e I can say only what is true. And truth always hurts. You do not know that you come from th e zero, do you? You do not know that you disappear into the zero, do you? You are simply covering your ignorance. It would be better to say that \"I don't kn ow from where I come, and I don't know where I go.\" Anything that you accept without questioning is dangerous, because you start believing in it. I say to you, you don't come from zero; because out of zero nothing can come. That is the exact meaning of zero. It is empty, it is nothingness. Out of nothingness, something is not possible. And something cannot dissolve into nothingness again. There is no way. The sc ientists are aware of the fact that in existence you cannot destroy anything; you can change its forms. Even a small piece of rock, you cannot destroy it. You ca n crack it into pieces, but the rock is still there, in pieces. You can make it into powder, but the rock is still there. You can throw it into the ocean, it may disa ppear from your eyes, but it is still there you know. Nothing that exists can go into non-existence. And vice versa. That is non-existence cannot come into existence. From where you got the idea that we come from zero? You don't know anything from before your birth, where you were. You don't know when a person dies"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"where he goes. Your ignorance you are covering in a word, zero. Don't be satisfied so soon. I would like you to cut a seed and look into it. You will not find any flowers, you will not find any fragrance, you will not find any leaves, branches. But they are all there; just you don't have the eyes to see. They are potentially there, and you can see only the actual. The potential eludes you. Sow the seed in the garden, and one day suddenly you see green spro uts coming out of nothingness. You know they were not in the seed. From wh ere they are coming? And then a great foliage, a whole bush, and hundreds of flowers, and that beautiful perfume. It was not in the seed. You had looked into it. But I say to you, it was in the seed. Otherwise it cannot come. From where it can come? It was potentially in the seed, and we don't have the eyes to see th e potential; we can see only the actual. In Soviet Russia there is a scientist and a great photographer, Kirlian. He has developed a special kind of camera, very sensitive lenses, very sensitive films. And he takes the film of a rosebud, an d when he shows you the picture you are simply amazed. The rosebud is not in th e picture, but a fully grown up flower. After seven days the rose becomes the fl ower and the strangest thing is, it is exactly as the picture was. Kirlian has developed a more sensitive eye than we have. In can take the pictures of the potential. Now Kirlian is working on diseases. You bring a perfectly healthy person to him. He takes the picture and says that \"Within six months this man is going to have tuberc ulosis,\" because it shows in his picture. And within six mont hs that healthy person falls sick, has tuberculosis. It was in the seed, in th e potential. Our eyes are very limited. So I would like to remind you, you don't come from a seed. You come from a fullness of existence, from perfection; fr om a fulfilled existence. You were in the seed, and perhaps one day you will go back into that silence of the organic whole. But don't call it zero. It is not empty, it is full. It is full of everything that you see in the universe. It is full of all the stars, all the suns, all the planets, all the people, all the flowers; and much more. Becaus e every day, new stars are being born. There is no zero anywhere. It is only an abstract concept in mathematics. It is non-existential. In reality, there is no zero. Have you met zero in reality anywhere? In reality you always meet some thing, never nothing. Nothing is only a concept, and don't be deluded by the concept. I am reminded of a beautiful story. A sma ll girl, Alexis, has reached into the land of the fairies. She is presented to the king, and the king asks little Alexis, \"Have you met any postman coming towards me ?\" He was waiting for some urgent message, and it was getting late. Alexis said, \"Nobody, sir.\" And the king misunderstood the word nobody. He thought \"nobody\" is \"somebody\". So he said, \"But if you had met nobody on the way towards me, nobody must have reached before you. Where is he?\" Alexis was puzzled. She simply sa id, \"Sir, nobody is nobody.\""},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"But the king said, \"I know nobody is nobody, but where he is?\" Zero is only a mathematical concept, man-made, it has no existential status. We come from a divine fullness, and we are carrying that fullne ss within us, with each beat of our heart, our life belongs to that divine fullness. Even in death; you don't disappear into a zero. Only the body, your house, which has become old and dilapidated, disappears into its elementary forces. But you, as a consciousness, as a being, go on mo ving into new forms, until that ultimate moment when you realize your divinene ss, when you realize that you are not just a man, but something more; that you ar e not just a part of time, but part of eternity. After that realization, you don't go into another form. You have come to the end of a long pilgrimage, you have co me to the goal, you have reached home. You enter into the divine fullness consciously. You have come out of divine fullness un consciously. That's why you don't know from where you are coming. But when you enter consciously, with full awareness, you know that the circle is complete. That's why we have called the world samsara. `Samsara' simply means th e circle. Whenever the circle is complete, you consciously enter into the sa me space, into the same blissfulness, from where you had come, but unconsciou sly. And the world is nothing but a school, to change your unconsci ousness into consciousness. Please don't use negative words like zero . They are dangerous. If you put two zeros on both the extremes of your life your birth is out of zero, your death is into a zero, between these two zeros wh at you can be, except a zero? Between two zeros, what meaning you can have? What fullness you can experience? Your life will be just a desert. A long series of empty moments with no significance. Avoid negative words! Use positive words; because existence is positive. There is nothing negative in existence, and if you become accustomed to negative words, you lose contact with existence. It will be a great blessing to you if you can drop that word zero, and start thinking of a divine, overflowing energy that has created you. Just a small word can change your whole flavor of life. It can give you a new song and a new dance, because on both the sides there is a divine fullness. Your life is no more empty. You can see yourself as part of a vast organic unity that this universe is. And to me this is what religiousness mean s -- to be positive, to approach life positively. Learn to say \"Yes ,\" and drop to say \"No.\" And you will be surprised, that what a revolution co mes by a simple change. Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT ARE YOUR SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD, SO AS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND ABIDING? A: I would like to start from a small story. It happened twenty five centuries before in China. There was a wise ma n, Lao Tzu. The emperor of China appointed him as supreme-most judge of the whole empire. And Lao Tzu tried"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"to persuade the emperor that he will repent : \"Don't do this; I am not going to fit with your legal systems, because it is basically wrong. It does not need reformation; it needs revolution.\" But the king was stubborn, and he insi sted that \"You become my supreme judge.\" The first case appeared before him in th e court -- a thief ha s stolen from the richest man of the capital almost half of his treasures. It was a great crime. The legal system that was prevailing in the country would have given him death. But Lao Tzu called the rich man also to the co urt and said that \"Both these people are criminals. And they both should be sentenced to jail for six months.\" The rich man said, \"What kind of justice is this? I have been robbed. My half treasure has been stolen by this man, and you are punishing me; for what?\" Lao Tzu said, \"Because you have accumulate d so much money that it is bound to create thieves in the country. You are a criminal first. This man comes in a secondary category.\" The rich man rushed to the king and said that \"What kind of man you have chosen to be your supreme judge? He is dangerous. Today I am going to jail, tomorrow you will go to jail!\" Of course, immediately Lao Tzu was removed. You are asking me what improvements, wh at changes, are needed in the legal system. As I see it, it is basically wrong. It needs nothing less than a revolution; because down the centuries you have been increasing your courts, judges, legal experts, and laws have become everyday more and more complicated. And the criminals are growing tremendously. By all this legal system on one hand increasing, on the other hand the crime go es on increasing, ten times more than your legal system. You have not been able to cope with it. There is something very fundamentally wrong. As I see it, first the whole legal system is based on social revenge, not on social compassion. Sometimes it goes to stupid extremes; for example, suicide is a crime, and if a man is caught committing suicide, he has not yet committed. He has been simply caught making an effo rt to commit. Then your legal system, sentencing him to death, is strange. That 's what he was going to do. So why all this fuss? Years of arguments, courts, ju dges, wastage of time and money, and finally you sentence the man to death. And that's what he was going to do, on his own, without your support. Your whole legal system is a revenge system. The society punishes a person because he was disobedient, because he did not follow the crowd, because he was not part of the mob. He tried to be an individual on his own. He was playing his game according to his own rules. Re venge is not going to help, because you are doing the same crime that the crimin al has committed. Of course, you have the support of the whole society; so nobo dy calls your punishment a crime. But any unprejudiced mind can see what you are doing."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"A man commits rape. A man commits robbery. A man commits murder. Certainly something has to be done. Bu t not punishment. Because the man who commits rape simply means he is sexually unsatisfied. And your society has not given him a chance to be sexually satisfied. Mohammedans are allowed to marry four wives. In the world there is an equal proportion of men and women. Now if me n are going to marry four wives, then what about those three men who will rema in without wives? And if they start committing rape, is it a crime? Nizam of Hyderabad just forty years before had five hundred wives. And you want to prevent rape? Maharaja Patyallah(*), he was a beautiful man; in Patyallah(*) an y beautiful woman was in danger. She was going to be taken sooner or later, on ce the Maharaja looks at her, the next day she will disappear. He must have been a really courageous man. He could not manage to take away the daughter of the Viceroy of India. So he raped. Now, this man seems to be psychologica lly sick. He had hundreds of wives, concubines, and still he rapes. He does not need punishment. He needs treatment. He should be sent to a psychi atric hospital where his mind can be put right. Something is wrong with his mind. The punishment cannot change him, because the punishment has nothing to do with psychology. In fact, once a person goes to jail, jail becomes his home . He goes again and again. Jail is a kind of university, because there are master criminals. When you send somebody for the first time in jail, he is an amateur. In the jail he finds great masters of crime, experts. He learns the art, he learns that it is not the crime that has brought him to the jail. It is being caught that has brought him to the jail. You can go on committing as many crim es as you want. Just don't be caught. Because crime is not punished; being ca ught is punished. This is a strange situation. Those who are caught are in jail. Those who are not caught may be very respectable citizens, powerful people in the society. (Tape side B) I am against all kinds of punishment. The whole idea of punishment is inhuman. Anybody committing a crime simply show s that he needs psychiatric help. Instead of jails, we need psychiatric hospit als, where the person can be taken care of respectfully, with dignity, because on ce a person's dignity is destroyed you have reduced him into a permanent criminal. In a psychiatric hospital, he should be re spected, he should be treated just like any patient. You will be surprised to know that in the past many patients were punished for the simple reason because th ey were not thought to be patients. For example, somebody was mad. He was puni shed, he was sent to a jail. Now we can see the stupidity of it all. A madman, you are sending him to jail? It is very difficult to decide whether you are mad or he is mad. What the jail can do to a madman? He needs a dignified respectful treatment. And that's what we are doing now. About other crimes, the same is the situation. Crime does not happen out of nowhere; it is something in your mind. Something is wrong, which can be put"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"right. And we have enough development of psychological sciences that the mind can be changed completely. One thing is certain, that the criminal has a very powerful personality. His personality, his power, if diverted towards creativity, may bring great blessings to the society. Right now they become a burden on the society. Thousands of people in jail are living on your labor, on your taxes, on your work. And when they will come out of the jail, they will come more with great expertise, and you will not be able to catch hold of them so easily. The whole idea of punishment is barbariou s. The legal system should change its foundations. Every crime should be treate d as a mental disease. And then things will be totally different; then society is showing compassion, not revenge. And you are helping people to become more human, more integrated. And while they are being treated, you can teach them, yo u can allow them to learn some skill, some craft, so when they come out of the psychiatric hospital they are not dependent on the society. They can crea te their living by their own effort, and you have given them so much respect, so much dignity, that it will be impossible for them to commit again a crime. I am reminded of a mystic who had only on e blanket. In the day he used to cover his body with the blanket. In the night he used to cover itself to protect him from the cold. One cold night, a full moon night, a thief by accident entered his cottage. I say by accident, because otherwise who goes to a mystic's hut to steal what you can get there? In fact, the myst ic was awake. He went behind the thief. The thief was shocked, embarrassed. The mystic said, \"Don't be worried. I have just come because I have been living in th is place for thirty or more years, I have not found anything. Perhaps you can find. We can divide it. I will join in the search!\" The thief could not believe this man. He said, \"I am a thief.\" The mystic said, \"Forget all about these ad jectives. Who is not a thief? Everybody is stealing something or other. People are stealing knowledge through books, people are stealing every kind of thing; so don't be worried. And I am a holy man, and I am joining with you. It is a search. I have been here for thirty years looking for something. There is nothing in th is house. Perhaps it is not in my fate; maybe you have a better fate. Something may be found. And I don't ask much. Just half of the share.\" The thief was very much puzzled. He had never come acro ss such a man. He said, \"Thirty years you have been here and you have not found anything. There is no possibility. Just let me go. It is so cold, but seeing you I am perspiring. You have made me so nervous, and it is just by accident that I have entered. Just forgive me.\" The mystic said, \"Only on one condition, th at you will have to take this blanket; because this is the only thing I have got. And you have honored me so much. Because thieves enter into kings' palace s; who comes to a poor man's hut. You have honored me. For a moment I feel like a king. So just don't refuse. Take this blanket.\""},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The thief could not say anything, but when he saw that the mystic was naked, he had only the blanket, he felt really so rry that he has done for the first time something wrong. In his whole life he ha s never felt that he has done anything wrong. But to face this man was so diffi cult, to refuse this man was so difficult, he escaped with the blanket out of the door. The man shouted, \"Stop!\" And the thief stopped and looked back and he said, \"Have I done anything wrong?\" He said, \"Yes, at least close the doors. An d you have forgotten to give me at least just a thank you. It may help you in the future some time. So say thank you, close the door. And then you can go away wherever you want.\" He said, \"Thank you,\" closed the door and ran away. Naked, the saint was sitting near the wi ndow, looking at the full moon. And he heard a song. The meaning of the song is , \"I am so poor, I could not give him anything more. He must be in desperat e need. Otherwise who comes five miles out of the city to a lonely isolated hut of a mystic. If it was in my power, I would have given him the full moon. Not less than that. But I am a poor man. I cannot do anything else than give my blanket.\" Later on the thief in another case was caug ht by the police, brought to the court, was asked \"Do you know anybody who can identify you?\" He said, I don't know anybody, except a mystic who lives outs ide the city. Perhaps he can recognize me.\" The saint was called to the court, he reco gnized the thief, but he said to the magistrate that \"Don't punish this poor man. I had given him my blanket, he has not stolen. And he is a very graceful gentleman. He has not only not stolen my blanket, he said `Thank you, sir,' and when I said to him, `Close the doors' he is so obedient. He closed the doors. He is a very humble man. Forgive him. The mystic was very much respected in the surrounding s. The magistrate himself was a follower of the mystic. When he said, forgive him, he forgave him. As the mystic was leaving the court he found the thief following him. He said, \"Why you are following me?\" He said, \"Now I am going to be with you forever. I have never come a man who has ever respected me as a human being. You have given me dignity. Others have treated me like a dog, a thief; and the more they have mistreated me, the more I have done the same things, out of revenge. You are the only man who has not bothered about my actions. But you ha ve looked directly into my eyes, and into my being. I am not going to leave you.\" The thief became a saint in his own way. He became the successor of the old saint. The whole legal system needs to drop revengefulness. It has to become compassionate; it has to treat human bein gs with respect. Actions don't count. What counts is the whole personality, whic h is a vast thing. An action is a small thing. Don't make it too big. And we are making it too big. Somebody does something wrong -- and remember it is human to err; everybody commits"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"mistakes. But the mistakes should not be take n as equivalent to hi s life. It is only a small fragment in a long series. Don't give it too much importance. Don't make it the focus of light. Don't throw that man into a jail, undignified, unhonored, all his humanity taken away. Don't behave with that man as if he is an animal. Society needs to be more compassionate. Law needs to be more compassionate. Remember, man is not for law; law is for man. And if law is not helping man, then it has to be changed. It has not helped. There is no doubt about it. And I am not saying that \"Withdraw all laws, and dissolve all co urts.\" I am saying that your courts and your laws and your legal experts should make the whole phenomenon based on compassion, not on revenge. And compassion is the essence of all re ligions. And if we cannot create our legal system based on the essential, fundamental religious experience of the ages, then future will condemn us; then future will think about us as barbarious, then future is not going to accept as civilized people, cultured. I am reminded of H. G. Wells. One man said to him, \"What do you think about civilization?\" And H G Wells said, \"It is a good idea, but it has yet to happen.\" Civilization has not happened? And a man of the calibre and intelligence like H G Wells thinks so. It has not happened yet. We are still living in a barbarious age. Perhaps we have better clothes, better houses, polite nice manners; beautiful masks to hide our faces; but deep down , there is the animal who hankers for revenge. It is strange to see that still there are coun tries where death sentence is legal. If a man has murdered someone, and you think it is a crime; certainly it is a crime. Nobody has the right to destroy somebody else' life. But what you are doing? You destroy that man's life. And I don't see the logic, because if this man's murder, crucifixion, was going to revive the other man, then too there was some logic in it. Instead of one man dead, now there will be two men dead. And you think law is satisfied, the society is sa tisfied; but this satisfaction is ugly. So I will not go into the details of law, because that is not my function. My function is to change the foundation. Then details will change automatically. Up to now revenge has been the foundation; let compassion be the foundation in the future. It is a very strange experience. I have been visiting jails, teaching prisoners meditation, and I was surprised that they are more innocent than your magistrates, than your advocates, than yo ur law makers. They are more innocent people. I have been in jail in America fo r twelve days, and that gave me a great experience, from the inside. I have been to jails before, but I was an outsider. This time I was an insider, and inmate. And I was surprised to know, utterly surprised, that the people you have condemned as criminals, condemned for their whole life to live in darkness and dismal cells, wh ich is worse than death, are far more innocent, loving, understanding."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"In twelve days I was in five jails, because they were afraid to keep me in one jail. It was surrounded by news media, by sa nnyasins, by people who love me; and they were afraid that something may go wrong. So they went on changing me from one jail to another. It was good fo r me, because I came to know thousands of criminals -- and not a single person in those five jails, and each jail had five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred peop le -- not a single criminal was against me. They were all in favor of me, becaus e they were looking on the television continuously, my statements; and wh en I passed through the cells, every criminal was showing me the sign of victory. And they were shouting in different languages that \"Bhagwan, don' t be worried. Final victory is yours!\" I will ask the jail authorities for small thin gs -- a toothbrush, toothpaste, a soap, a towel, a comb, and it will take twelve ho urs for the toothbrush to appear, but the toothpaste is not there! And if toothp aste will appear, then toothbrush is not there. If the soap will appear, the towel is not there. I cannot take a shower. But I was amazed that these criminals will go on throwing things into my cell; and they will say, \"Bhagwan, this is absolu tely new, we have not used it. This toothbrush, you can see it is still sealed, we have been keeping it, we had never known that this will be our blessing, to give it to you.\" I will ask for milk and the answer was, no. And some criminal will bring his own milk, and he said that \"These people are simply harassing you.\" Every criminal is getting milk, and to you they say there is no milk, no fruits, knowing perfectly well that I am vegetarian, and I will not be eating anything else than fruits and vegetables, milk. You will be surprised that in twelve days whatsoever I have eaten has been given to me by the crimin als, not by the jail authorities. Out of their own -- because they used to get one apple every day, and if I was in a cell where there were six people, they all bring their apples. I had six apples. I will say, \"I cannot eat six apples. And it is, you know, you are all Christians, just one apple Adam and Eve had eaten, and humanity is suffering still. And you are giving me six! Do you want me to get out of jail or not?\" I came to see that we are not doing justic e to these people. Their small act, maybe in a fit of anger, they did something. And it has become their whole life. You have not given them a chance to change. You have finished them. You have put a full stop. Just a small fit of anger, and th e man may have done something. What he needs is, to be taught how anger ca n be dispersed, how one can come above anger; but this you are not doing. By fo rcing him into jails, you are making him more angry. You are creating more criminals. Your whole legal system is a criminal system. Q: I AM A LAWYER. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MEDITATE, AND WHEN, WHEN I AM OCCUPIED ALL OF THE TIME. SO PLEASE SUGGEST.(*) A: It is important to understand becaus e all the teachers of meditation in the world have been telling you that you have to keep a separate time for"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"meditation. Mohammedans have to meditate five times in the day. Five times they have to close their shops, their businesses if they are real Mohammedans. But this is absolutely impractical. If the man is driving a railway train, or flying an aeroplane, and he has to st op five times, this is not going to be meditation, this is going to be a massacre! My approach about meditation is totally different. I do not say to you that you have to have a separate time for medita tion. Meditation has to be just like breathing -- you don't have a separate time for it, that in the morning you breathe and then you go to your business and fo rget breathing. You go on doing your things, and breathing continues. Meditation has to be something like that, that it runs like an undercurrent in your all activities of the day. I will suggest you a very simple meditation. Whatever you are doing -- you may be digg ing a hole in the earth, planting new rosebushes in your garden, wo rking in your shop, or fighting a case in the court - - it does not matter what you are doing. Do it consciously, do it with full awareness. I will tell you what I mean by it. Once Buddha was passing in Shrivasti with his dearest disciple, Ananda. A fly came and sat on his forehead. Just as we will do, he simply waved his hand and the fly was gone. Then he stopped, and took his hand very carefully, very consciously. Th e fly was no more there, and he waved his hand with great grace. Ananda could not understand what is happening. He said, \"You have the fly few minutes befo re, and it is gone. Now what are you doing?\" And Buddha said, \"That time I did it wrong. I did it without awareness. I continued to talk to you, and mechanic ally I simply waved my hand without being conscious of what I am doing. Now I am doing it as I should have done in the first place, to remind me that it does not happen again.\" Any action done with awareness becomes meditation. (Tape side C) In the beginning it will be difficult, you will go on forgetting again and again. But don't be discouraged. Even if in twenty four hours you can manage for twenty four seconds, that is more than en ough. Because the secret is the same. If you can manage it for one second, you kn ow the key. You know the knack. Then it is only a question of time. Slowly, sl owly, you will be having bigger gaps when you are aware. The action continues; not on ly it continues, it becomes better than ever before; because now you are doing with such consciousness. Its quality changes, because you are conscious, you are totally there. Your intensity changes, your insight, your understanding; and the action that you are doing starts having a grace of its own. Meditation should be slowly spread all ov er your life. Even while going to sleep, lying down on your bed, it will take few minutes for you to go to sleep. Those few minutes be alert, of the silence, of the darkness, of the relaxed body. Remain alert as sleep starts descending on you, till you are completely overwhelmed by"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"the sleep, and you will be surprised that if you had continued to the very last moment when sleep took over you, in th e morning the first thought will be again of awareness; because whatever is the la st thought before you go to sleep is always the first thought in the morning when you wake up. Because it continues as an undercurrent in your sleep. You cannot find time, nobody has time. The day is so full. But six or eight hours in the night can be transformed into me ditation. Even a Buddha will feel jealous of you. Even he cannot meditate eight hours. It is simply an intelligent effort to transform your sleep. You are taking a sh ower. Why not take it with awareness. Why take it mechanically? Just doing like a robot, because you have been doing it every day, so you go on doing it and it becomes mechan ical. Do everything non-mechanically, and slowly, slowly medita tion will not be a question that it needs separate time. It becomes spread a ll over your day, twenty four hours. Then only you are on the right track. The people who meditate ten minutes in the morning, are not going to gain much. Because ten minutes of meditation , and twenty four hours against it, how you are going to win? You have to put twenty four hours of meditation against twenty four hours of ordinary life. Then there is absolute guarantee that success is going to be yours. Q: BHAGWAN, WHY ONE NEEDS A MASTER? A: Nobody needs a master. But then, the journey will be very long. It may take many lives for you to discover the truth. So this is the first thin g to remember, that the master is not an absolute need. You can go on your own alone, because truth is nobody's monopoly. You can seek and search and find it. The only thing is, how long it will take for you, because there are thou sands of ways which lead nowhere. And there is only one way that leads to truth. How you are going to find that one wa y amongst thousands of ways? The only logical method will be, move on every way and find out that this is not the right way. Eliminate it. Move on another way, and find out this is not the right way; eliminate it. Elimination is the only way for the person who has no master. But how long it will take for you to eliminate thousands of ways? Perhaps thousands of lives. And who knows, yo u may get discouraged. Most probably you will get discouraged. You may start thinking, perhaps there is no road, no way. Just to console yourself you may start thinking, there is no truth. I am simply wasting my time, my energy, my life. So remember it. As far as I am concerned, the master is not an absolute need. But, without a master it is almost impossible to find the right path, and the most shortest path that leads to the ultimate truth. The master cannot give you the truth. But the master can show you that you need not go on wrong paths. He can eliminate those paths. Without him, you"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"will have to go through those paths an d eliminate yourself. The master can eliminate them for you. He cannot show you the right path. Let me insist it. He cannot show you the right path, he cannot show you the truth. But he can show you what is false, what is wrong. And if you know what is false, what is wrong, then you can discover the truth more easily. The master's function is to eliminate the false and leave you al one with the truth and the right path. Ordinarily people th ink that the master gives you the path. No, he does not give you the path. He si mply takes away all wrong paths. Then whatever is left is for you to travel. It is up to you. If you choose a long journey, which will be spread over many lives, yo u are free to do it. But if you want, if truth is a thirst and an urgency, then the master is the greatest friend in this world. And remember, I don't want to ca ll the master the master. Because that gives an impression as if you are a slave. And that's what your so-called masters have been doing. They are masters, and you are spiritual slaves. The real master is only a friend, noth ing more, nothing less. He can share his experience with you, he can show you how he has been failing, how he has been going on wrong ways, how he has faltered, fallen, how many lives he has been searching. And help you to avoid all that. If you understand the master as a grea t friend, you will not unnecessarily waste your life searching for truth. What is the harm, to give your hand in the hand of a friend? Why are you so afraid? I can see, the fear is because your so-called masters have created slaves around themse lves. The real master does not create slaves. He creates independent people, individuals. And he takes your hand only to the point where wrong paths are eliminated, and only the right one is left. That is the moment he will pull his hand away from you; in spite of you; even if you want, the master will say, \"You have to go alone from here. Nobody can accompany you to the ultimate shrine of tr uth. Everybody has to go alone, totally alone. Up to here it was okay. I was eliminating the false, but now you are standing facing the right path, so I have to say goodbye to you.\" A friend knows when to help and when not to help. A fr iend knows when to hold your hand and when to leave you alone. Find a master who can be a friend, and does not enslave you. He can be of tremendous help. Okay.

It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] PRESS INTERVIEWS Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, CAN A BUDDHA LIKE YOU BE IN PRISON? I AM NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. A: I can understand your difficulty. But it seems you are not aware of the history of human consciousness. Socrates is poisoned, and he is a Buddha. Gautam Buddha himself died out of food pois oning. Al-Hillaj-Mansoor, one of the greatest Sufi mystics, is killed by the fanatic Mohammedans. Sarmad, another man of immense experience of the ultimate truth, is killed again by the fanatic people, the orthodox, the traditional. Many attempts were made on the life of Buddh a to kill him. It is not a new thing. It is as old as man himself. You have always treated your highest expressions with inhumanity. While they are alive, you try to kill them, and when you have killed them, then you start worshipping them. Your worship is nothing but to cover your guilt. Many attempts have been made on my life; just seven years before in a morning discourse, ten thousand sannyasins were present, and the police was informed by some anonymous person that a group of fanatics is going to make an effort to kill Bhagwan. So twenty top police officers rushed to the place where I was speaking. In their presence, and in the presence of ten thousand sannyasins, a knife was thrown at me. The man missed the target. But the police caught him red-handed. Ten thousand eye witnesses, it is almost impossible to find for any attempt on life, and twenty police officers. They got hold of the knife, and it was a police case. Still the man was set free, and the magistrate gave the judgment that no attempt on life is being made. But he must have felt guilty, because through a common friend, a doctor, he informed me that please forgive me. I am a poor magistrate. The pressure of political parties over me is too much. They want the man to be freed. I know the attempt has been made, and there cannot be more solid evidence -- ten thousand eye witnesses, and twenty top police office rs also witnesses. But the politicians will destroy me. I have to listen to them. So just please forgive me."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"What happened in America with me is nothing new. It has always been happening. You have to understand one thing, that whenever there is somebody who has a message for you, which goes against your traditional ways, your orthodoxy, your conditioning, then your whole priesthood, your politicians, the status quo, all the vested interests are ag ainst such a man. For the simple reason because he is a disturbance. If people listen to him there is going to be a revolution. And that revolution will chan ge everything. It will throw those who are in power. It will throw those priests who are dominating you. Naturally those who are in power would not like it. It is better to finish one man rather than to loose all their vested inte rests. Why they crucified Jesus? He has not committed any crime. He was a simp le man. He has not done anything illegal. But why they insisted to kill him? For the simple reason he was upsetting the whole society. He was saying things which go against the past, which go against the old, which bring some new light, which take you into the unknown. He is opening doors for progress. And there are people who don't want any progress. They want a static society, a dead society. And these people are in power. Naturally, every Buddha has to go to jail, and every Buddha has to be killed or crucified. Twenty five centuries have pa ssed since Socrates was poisoned, but nothing has changed. Against Socrates, there was no crime. They invented a bogus thing against him; that was that he corrupts the minds of young people. He was giving the new people new insigh ts. He was giving more intelligence to people. He was making them aware what is wrong in the old, rotten society, and how it can be changed. But the old soci ety thinks this is corruption. He is dangerous. He should be removed, before it is too late. I had not done any crime; my only cr ime in America was, what Christian missionaries have been doing for centuries all over the world. They have been converting people into Christianity. But the people they convert into Christianity are the orphans, the beggars, the poor, th e starving, the aboriginals. They have not been successful to convert a single cultured, educated, high-class individual anywhere in the whole world. Their problem was that I was attracting the cream of the society; the people who had become part of my commune were doct ors, engineers, electronic engineers, scientists, professors, legal experts, surg eons, educationists. That was the shock to the fanatic Christians. They have not been successful in the world to change a single educated man to Christianity. And I have taken their best people out of their fold. This was my crime. Ronald Reagan, the President of Americ a, is a fanatic Christian. He is a fundamentalist Christian. And he wants America to be a Christian country, and the pressure of him and the Christia n priests was that a man like me is dangerous; because I am influencing the highest intelligentsia of the country. And if it goes on, it is going to destroy the very roots of Christian religion. That was the reason why they arrested me wi thout any warrant. They could not show"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"even what is the cause for which they are arresting me. It was simply a joint effort of the Christianity and the politic ians to destroy a commune which was the first effort ever made, and it was so su ccessful that anybody who had come to the commune was immediately convinced of it s potentiality, of its power, of its future. It was almost a dream come true . The Christian priest was afraid about his Christianity, and the politician was af raid because I am not a politician. And the people who have joined me are not political. I want human beings to be absolutely free of politics, and free of orthodox, traditional, dead religions. Each individual should find his own truth. There is no need for any priest to become a mediator between him and truth. But they cannot prevent me. I am going on a world tour. In fact, they have allowed me more scope. I was working in America; they should have remained silent. That would have been more favo rable to them. Now the whole world is available to me. I am going on a world to ur to every country of the world. And the people in America who are interested in me can meet me anywhere. I will be around America, on every island. I cann ot enter America, but Americans can come out. I have my own ways. It is not easy to defeat me. But I can see your question has a point; the point is that you expect that a Buddha should be something superhuman. He cannot be jailed. He cannot be killed. He cannot be poisoned. These are your superstitions. No buddha is superhuman. Every buddha is as much huma n as you are. It is your potentiality. You can become a Buddha any moment you de cide. It is a question of decision. But we have been told, and we have accepted it because it is very consoling, if somebody says to you, \"You can become a buddha,\" you say, \"How I can become a buddha. A buddha is a special superhum an being. I am an ordinary human being.\" And to create this idea, stupid stories have been invented. I will tell you few stories that can make it clear. Buddha is born when his mother is stan ding; no mother gives birth to a child standing. Have you seen any woman givi ng birth to a child standing? And the story does not stop there. Buddha is born from the mother's womb, himself standing on the floor. And the story still do es not end. He walks seven feet; just born baby walks seven feet, and declare s to the whole world that I am the greatest buddha, the suprememost that has ev er been or that will ever be. Now, this is all nonsense. No gynecologist w ill support this. And how a just-born baby can walk, and can talk. But this is just to create the idea in your mind that Buddha is special. Mahavira does not perspire. He is a specia l human being. He is not just like you. Now this is impossible unless, instead of skin he has plastic. Perspiration is an absolute necessity. You can ask any phys iologist, that without perspiration you cannot live. It is a protection against de ath, because for life your temperature has to remain exactly the same. When it is t oo hot, and you don't perspire, your inner temperature will go on higher and hi gher; and your life span as far as temperature is concerned is not very big. From ninety-eight to one hundred ten,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"only twelve degrees; that is your life span , twelve degrees. And if the heat is too much, and you don't perspire, you w ill die out of your own inner heat. Perspiration is a tremendous strategy of na ture. It releases water from every pore of your body, so the heat of outsid e becomes involved in evaporating the perspiration. It does not reach to you. Perspiration prevents the heat from reaching to you. It keeps your temperatur e exactly the same -- whether it is cold or hot outside, your inner temperature has to remain the same. Now Mahavira does not perspire. Why such stories are invented? Just to ma ke you feel inferior, and to make these people feel superior; to create a gap. That gap is not helpful, that gap is dangerous, because that gap makes you re main what you are. You start thinking, what can I do? Mahavira is a special person, Buddha is a special person. Jesus is the only begotten son of God. You are not son of God. You are son of a poor man, just ordinary like you. Jesus is the son of a virgin woman. Now that is absolutely idiotic. Virgin girls don't give birth to people. But Jesus has to be separated from the ordinary humanity. This keeps him above, and it has kept humanity crawling on the ground, feeling that this is our faith, our destiny. We cannot go above where we are. We are not born of a virg in mother, we are not the only begotten son of God. We perspire, we need deodorant. We are ordinary human beings, mortals. We cannot become the awakened ones, the buddhas. But I say to you, all these stories are fa lse, they are invented. And they have cheated you for centuries, and you have to destroy all these stories. And remember one fact: that everybody was a human being just like you, so that you can also aspire to reach to the stars. Th ere is no need for you to remain crawling on the earth. You can also become a buddha. You can also become a Socrates. You can also become a Mohammed. Nobody is preventing you except your own ideas that you have collected from the so ciety, from the priests; and all those ideas are poisonous. They are killing yo u, and they are preventing you from growing, expanding, attaining to higher states of consciousness. I say unto you that to be a buddha is your potentiality. If you don't claim it, except you nobody else is responsible. And no special quality is needed to become a buddha. All that is needed is to be more alert, to be more conscious, to be more calm, to be more silent, to be more peaceful, to be more compassionate; and all these things are possible for you. Not to perspire is not possible for you, but to be compassionate is possible for you. To be kind and to be loving is possible for you. I am bringing Buddha within your reach, and that hurts. That hurts every priest of every religion. Because he has made Krishna, Rama, Mahavira, Buddha, Christ, Mohammed, so special and so far aw ay from you, so superhuman, it is a need for the priest to make the ideals far away from you, so he can settle in between you and the buddha; he can become the mediator, the agent. If there is no difference between yo u and buddha, then the priest and his profession is finished. Then there is no need for popes, bishops, ministers,"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Shankaracharyas. What is the need? You can manage it yourself. And they have not been of any help. Twenty five cent uries have passed since Buddha and there have been almost half of the humanity buddhist. How many buddhas they have created? Now half the humanity is Chri stian. How many Christs they have created in two thousand years? Can't you see the failure of your priesthood, your churches, your temples, your mosques? Th ey have utterly failed. Five thousand years have passed since Krishna; and all the Hindu priests and all their rituals have been gone down the drain. They have not been able to produce another Krishna. So what is the point? This pr iesthood is an unnecessary load. These people are exploiting your blood. They are parasites, not priests. But when you say any truth like that, you endanger yourself. As I entered Nepal, my friends told me immediately, \"D on't say anything against Hinduism.\" I said, \"Why?\" They said, \"This is a Hindu kingdom.\" To them I said, \"Okay.\" But to myself I said, if this is a Hindu kingdom then I have to say something against Hindu priest s. Because what is the point of saying something against the Christian priests. Fo r that I am going to Italy from here directly, to encounter the Pope in his ow n land. I have been challenging him for a public debate, and he has been like a coward, remained silent. Now I am going exactly to Rome, and challenge him there in his own country. These people are all around, in different names, and whenever there will be someone who can create a rebellion, and change the deadness in which the society has fallen, and make people alive ag ain, they are bound to be angry. They would like such a man to be jailed, to be poisoned, to be killed, to be removed. His presence is too dangerous. But I want these people to remember th at you can kill me. But you cannot kill my spirit. Jesus is crucified, but his spirit became more solid a phenomenon through crucifixion, crucifixion has not finished Jesus. In fact, crucifixion made Jesus a historical event, a milestone. So I am not worried about when I am going on a world tour, it can turn out to be a world tour in different jails. I would love it. It will be a great experience to see different countries, their different ways of harassment, cruelties, inhumanities. I will be enriched by it. Your question is simply because you e xpect something from people like Buddha, something superhuman. For example, the story is if Buddha sits under a tree, and it is not the season for the tree to blossom in flowers, but when Buddha sits under the tree, the tree blossoms immediatel y into flowers. I don't believe. I have tried sitting under trees. They don't bl ossom. Do you think trees are more intelligent than man? It is said that a serpent bites on Mahavi ra's feet, and instead of blood milk flows out. I was speaking with a Jaina monk, who spoke before me, and he prays that Mahavira was a superhuman being. Even when a snake bites him, blood does not come out of his feet, but milk. After him I had to speak. I said this is possible only in two ways: one that in Mahavira's bo dy there is no blood, it is filled with"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"milk. But that milk would have turned into curd long before. He will be stinking of curd. Second possibility is that Mahavira's feet has the same kind of mechanism that a mother's breast has. Then it is possible that milk can come out. But to think that his feet has a breast in it does not make Mahavira special. It makes the snake very intelligent. He finds the right place. (Tape side B) Just your expectations. Otherwise, they are all human beings. Just like me and you. The only difference is, they are aw akened and you are asleep. But you can become awakened any moment. Q: BHAGWAN, DO YOU TAKE A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN BEING MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE UNTHINKI NG CROWD OF JOURNALISTS, POLITICIANS, AND THE LIKE? DO YOU MIND YOU ARE THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD PERSON IN THE HISTORY OF A SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION? FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THAT YOU ARE AN INFINITE SOURCE OF INTELLECTUAL DEPTH. YOU HAVE BEEN USING LOGIC, TO DEMASTER LOGIC, USING INTELLECT TO GO BEYOND INTELLECT, IS NOT IT AN UNACCEPTABLE PARROT? YOUR FR IENDS ARE LESS ATTRACTED BY YOUR BOOKS THAN YOUR ENEMIES; YOUR ENEMIES OPPOSE YOU IN PUBLIC BUT THEY BECOME LEARNED PEOPLE BY STEALING YOU, AND MAKE A DECENT A BUSINESS OUT OF THEIR OUTFIT. THAT IS, THE RADIO IN NEPAL DEPENDS SIXTY PERCENTS ON YOU ON ITS RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS, AND YET THE PEOPLE DON'T HESITATE TO SAY THAT RAJNEESH IS A DANGER TO SANATHAN(*). NUMBER THREE, WHY BHAGWAN, W HY IS IT THAT PEOPLE KNOW YOU ONLY AS A SEX GURU TO THE EX CLUSION OF OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE EXPRESSED IN ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BOOKS? A: I certainly enjoy to disturb people, beca use there is no other way to help them. When somebody is asleep, the only way to wake him up is to disturb him, shake him, throw cold water into his eyes. Of course, he will be angry, he may be seeing a beautiful dream, and you are disturbing him. I enjoy disturbing people for the simple reas on if they are distur bed, then there is a possibility of changing their minds. Th ey have started thinking. It does not matter, they may start thinking against me. But if they start thinking, sooner or later, they will have to come closer to me . The danger is the non-thinking person. To think against me is not a problem. I am reminded of a beautiful anecdote. In Judaism there is a revolutionary t radition called Hassidism. The founder of Hassidism, Baal Shemtov, wrote a beautiful book and sent the first copy of the book to the chief priest of the Jews, as a present. One of his disciples carried the book. He told the disciple that \"You have to give the book in the hands of the rabbi himself. Don't give it to anyone else. And remember whatever is the"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"response of the rabbi, what he says, what he does, what shows in his eyes, on his face, everything you have to note it. And you have to report me immediately, so that you don't forget.\" The disciple went to the chief rabbi. He wa s sitting in the gard en with his wife, taking his morning breakfast. The discipl e presented the book. He took the book in his hands and he said, \"What it is? Who has written it?\" And he said, \"It is my master, Baal Shemtov, it is his first book, and he wanted it to be presented to you.\" And the rabbi became mad. He threw the b ook out of the garden into the street. And he said, \"Never dare again to bring that man's books in my house.\" He was just furious. The wife said to him, \"This is not righ t. You could have thrown the book when the person had gone. Or you could have put it in your library where there are thousands of books. You need not read it. You have not read many of those books. This also can be put there. But ther e was no need to become so furious, so angry; this is below you. You are the chie f rabbi of the Jews. This does not suit you.\" The disciple went to his master, Baal Shem , and told him that \"The rabbi is a dangerous fellow. He threw the book ou t in the street. He was furious with anger. He hates you. But his wife is very nice. She told that it was not right of him. He could have kept the book in the li brary, or even if he wanted to throw it he should have thrown it when I had left.\" You will be surprised to know what was the response of Baal Shem, and Baal Shem is one of the buddhas of a very unique quality. Baal Shem said to the disciple, \"You don't understand. That rab bi will read the book, that rabbi will become one day my disciple. But that woman which you think is nice will never read the book, will never be interested in me.\" And that's what happened finally. The chief rabbi turned a disciple to B aal Shem, but his wife remained an orthodox Jew. The disciple said, \"But how you figured it out? The situation was just the opposite.\" Baal Shem said, \"You don't understand human psychology. I had touched the emotions of the rabbi, and when you touc h the emotions of somebody, you have disturbed his heart. He will cool down, he cannot remain disturbed forever. He will start thinking that he has done wr ong. He will go out and take the book back, and would like to see what this ma n has written, but the woman will never look in the book. She was suggesting a ni cer, mannerly way to dispose it of. She was not touched. The rabbi was disturbed, she was not disturbed. And this is my experience. If I can disturb you, there is a chance to find a friend in you. I have touched your emotions. If I cannot disturb you, there is no chance. You have remained a stone statue. I have not been able to reach to your heart. The enemy and the friend are not very different people."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"One of the great political thinkers of the West, Machiavelli, has written in his masterpiece book \"Prince\", that you should not say anything to your friend which you would not like to say to your enemy. Because who is your friend today may become your enemy tomorrow. And you should not say anything against your enemy, because today he is your enemy; tomorrow he may be your friend. Then it will be very embarrassing. Keep balanced. And he is right, deeply right about human psychology. I have seen people disturbed, I have seen people angry, and I have seen those same people changing. They have beco me my friends, because they started thinking about it. They could not sleep unless they had found some solution. Certainly they could not go back, they coul d not settle back into their old mind. It has been disturbed. They have to find something new. So I certainly enjoy. You have said th at perhaps I am the most misunderstood man in the whole history of consciousness. That is true, for the simple reason because Gautam Buddha never left Bih ar. The name Bihar comes from Gautam Buddha, because he was travelling in this province; Bihar means travel. Because he travelled continuously in the same province, it became Buddha's bihar, his travelling space. Naturally, he could not reach the vast humanity when he was alive. Jesus lived in Judea, an unknown countr y, a small country; nobody has heard about it; not a single reference about Jesu s is found in any contemporary book of any other country. Naturally he could no t disturb anybody else than Jews. The same is true about all the old spiritual masters. Now, the world has shrunken very small. Even sitting in one place, I can disturb the whole world. Science and technology has made it possible. Jesus has no idea that there are other people than Jews. He was born a Jew, he lived as a Jew. He died as a Jew. He had never heard even the name Christian. The Christian came three hundred years afterwards; when his statements were translated into Greek, then the Jewish word Messi ah became Christ, and the followers of Christ became Christians. Poor Jesus never knew that his followers will be called Christians. The world was big, approach was impossible. Now it is different; the world is small, a pproach is very simple. I can disturb the whole world without any difficulty. And I am going to do it, because I am a very fair person. I cannot disturb only you. I will disturb everybody equally. And I don't feel worried about being misund erstood. That is the beginning of understanding. First you have to misu nderstand. The misunderstanding comes because you have a certain prejudice, you have a certain mind, a certain ideology. And when I say someth ing, it conflicts with it. Naturally, you favor with your own conditio ning. Whether it is right or wrong is not the question. It is your conditioning, it is your religion. It is your holy book. In America the first day when I was in jail, the sheriff of the jail was a very gentle man; and seeing me that I have nothing to do there, he brought a BIBLE and he said, \"This is my present to you.\""},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"I said, \"Have you read it yourself, from th e first page to the last?\" And I said, \"Be honest, you are keeping holy BIBLE in your hands. Don't lie!\" He became a little nervous, then he said, \"You are right. I have not read it from the first page to the last.\" I said, \"That's why you have brought it to me. Because in this BIBLE there are five hundred pages which are nothing bu t rotten pornography. I have read it from the first page to the last. This book should be banned. This book should not be in any church, in any library, in any university. Because it is sheer pornography, and not one or two pages, five hundred pages.\" He said, \"My God, I had never thought about it.\" And I showed him few pages, and I told him, \"Read it. Can you read this page before your daughter?\" And he had to confess, \"I cannot. This is ugly.\" But this is holy BIBLE. He said no mo re. \"You have disturbed me. Now I cannot sleep. My whole life's idea was that this is God's word. But how can God write such pornographic passages?\" Naturally, first one gets a shock, first one tries to defend, tries in every way to find that \"I am not right, he is right.\" That is what creates misunderstanding. But truth has always been misunderstood, because the whole majority of humanity lives in lies. So whenever a truth is said, it hurts. And there is a misunderstanding. But truth has a quality. You cannot deny it. You can try denying, but sooner or later you will have to accept it. So every confusion, every misunderstanding, is ju st temporary. It cannot remain forever. If I am saying something which is true , then your misunderstanding will be dispelled. So I am not wo rried about misunderstandi ng. Please misunderstand me as much as you can, because that is the only way that you will come to some understanding. You have also asked that there are people who go on stealing from my statements, my books. This is happening al l over the world, not only in Nepal. It is happening in the films, it is happening in televisions, it is happening on radio, it is happening in newspapers, magazines, all kinds of people are trying to steal. But, I am not worried about it. Truth is truth. It need not be necessarily concerned with my name. Let them steal. They are stealing truth. Let them present it in their own name. No harm. Be cause I am not interested in my name; I am interested in my truth. If the truth reaches to the people, just as you said in your question that sixty percent of the radio in Nepal is stealin g from my books, help them to steal hundred percent. My name is irrelevant. What is relevant is truth. And truth is nobody's property -- neither mine nor your s. So why think in terms of stealing? Perhaps they are not stealing; they are impressed but they are cowards, they cannot say my name. But still they are doing my work. So far so good. Help them. Find out more passages for them to steal. Anyway, the message has to"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"reach to the people. In whose name it re aches is not my concern at all. Just it should reach. Truth is universal. It is not mine, it is not yours. So the question of stealing does not arise. You have also asked, that I have four hundred books in my name. Still people only read one book, which is about sex. That too they don't read the way I have written it. The name of the book will ma ke it clear. The name of the book is \"From Sex to Superconsciousness.\" It is a book of a scientific methodology, how you can transform your sex energy into consciousness, superconsciousness. How your sex energy can become your samadhi. But nobody talks about samadhi or superconsciousness. They think the book is about sex. The book is not about sex. The book is against sex. It is anti sex. Because it is an effort to show you the technique, how sexual energy can be purified. How it can start not going downwards, and taking you downwards, but can start moving upwards, uplifting you higher. When sex moves down, it creates children, it becomes a biological force. When it moves upwards, it does not create children; it is no more biological. It moves into a different realm. It becomes a spiritual force. It recreates you. It gives you a rebirth. It creates a new man in you. It makes a child of you, so innocent, so utterly pure; it is a spiritual rebirth. But people are sexually repressed, so much so that anything, just the word sex, immediately triggers their repressions. I have heard about a psychoanalyst. A man was brought to him by his family, and they said, \"Something has to be done. This man is going mad.\" The psychoanalyst said, \"Wait, let me examine him.\" He drew a line on a paper and asked th e man, \"Do you see what this line reminds you?\" He said, \"What? It reminds me of sex.\" The psychoanalyst was a little shocked. Just a line, reminds him of sex? So he made a triangle. Seeing the triangle, th e man simply closed his eyes. He said, \"Don't make that. You are so filthy. Just st op! Sex, sex. Are you a psychologist, or what?\" The psychologist tried one more effort. He drew a circle. And the man hit the psychologist and he said, \"You idiot. You are not a psychologist. You are a sex maniac. This is all pornography.\" The psychoanalyst said, \"Cool down, sit down. Just I have one question to ask you. Does anything remind you of anything else?\" He said, \"No. Everything reminds me of sex.\" Repression is one of the greatest problems for man to face. All the religions have repressed sex. They have told you, it is sin. They have told you it is against religion. It is against God. Celibacy is sp iritual. Now all these things are absurd. Sex is a natural phenomenon. It is not ag ainst nature, not against life, not against God. Because if it is against God, then why he goes on creating people with"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"sexual energy? On the one hand you sa y God creates everything. Then who has created sex? It must have been God. And if God is not against sex, then how it can be sin. And if it is sin, then God is the greatest sinner in the world because he has given sex to millions of people, milli ons of animals, millions of insects, millions of birds, millions of trees. Th is whole existence has sexual energy, because that is the only reproductive energy. This whole creation is full of sexuality. God cannot be against it. The priest is against it, and why the priest is against it? He is against it because he wants to create guilt in you. That is the secret of torturing you, of enslaving you. If you feel guilty, you are bound to go to the priest, to confess, to ask for a prayer, to ask for some repentance, to ask how to get rid of this guilt -- fasting, austerities. And the priest goes on telling you how you can get rid of it. You are in the grip of the priest because he has made sex a sin. But this is not true religion. In the VEDA S the seers were all married people; they were not celibate. The Rishis, the poetry of the VEDAS is written not be celibate people. It is written by people who were married, they had children, they lived a normal life. The UPANISHADS were written by married people, not by celibates. (Tape side C) Up to the time of Buddha and Mahavira, there was a very life affirmative religion in this country. There was no denial of any life energy. There was total acceptance, and how to transform it. It was those days when Vatsyayana wrote his KAMASUTRAS; and have you forgotten that we have called Vatsyayana one of the greatest rishis of this country? A man who writes a book on sex, the first book in the whole history of man, has been called by us one of our greatest seers. Now those were the days of life affirmat ion. With Buddha and Mahavira, things changed. They were both from the warrior race. And their rebellion was against the brahmins. So whatever brahmins have been doing up to that time, they reversed the whole thing; because b rahmins were allowing marriage, sex, children, even to the seers, Jainas and Buddhists denied it to their monks. It is a very strange thing that because Jainas de nied sex to their monks, people started feeling that Jaina and Buddhist monks are higher, more spiritual, than Hindu seers. Shankaracharya had to follow Buddha and Mahavir, and made celibacy the central point of all people who renoun ce life, who want to grow spiritually. I am simply trying to bring you the original religion back. I want you to understand that the true religion cannot be against life, it can be only against death. The true religion is for more life, fo r eternal life; it is an alchemical process -- how to transcend death. And that's what I have written in that book. But just the title has attracted people. An d you will be surprised, the people who have been reading it are the monks, and the nuns; it has gone into many editions in almost all the languages of the world. You will find it in every monastery. Strange! Three hundred and ninety nine books, nobody bothers, which are purely spiritual. This book attracts th em because of their own repression. It shows something about them. It is not a healthy thing. It is very sick."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, HOW CAN AN INTELLECTUAL UNDERSTANDING BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN EXPERIENCE OF HEART(*)? A: The intellectual understanding cannot be changed, cannot be transformed, into a spiritual experience. In fact, the intellect has to be put aside if you want a spiritual experience. Intellect is a barrier, not a bridge. Intellect can think, but it cannot see. I am reminded of a small story. Gautam Buddha is staying in a village. In that village there was a blind man, who was a great intellectual, a giant. He has defeated the whole village, on the point that light does not exist. The whole village tried to convince him that light ex ists, you are blind. But the man said, \"If lights exists, then let me touch it. I want to touch it and feel it.\" They said, \"Light cannot be touched.\" He said, \"Then I can hear it. You can hit it by something, so I can hear the sound.\" They said, \"That is not possible.\" He said, \"Then it bring it close to my nose, I can smell it.\" That too was not possible. He said, \"I can taste it. These are the four possibilities with me, and you go on saying 'No, no' to every possibility. You simply want me to condemn as a blind man. When I am ready to explore the experience of light with all the senses that I have got, you deny it. I say to you that light does not exist.\" When Buddha came to the town, the people brought the blind man to Gautam Buddha, and they said, \"We have tried h ard, but he does not listen. On the contrary we feel defeated; we know light is . But how to convince this man who is blind? But he is a great logician. He gives great argumen ts. He is a very intellectual man.\" Buddha said, \"You have brought him to a wrong person. He does not need a philosopher. He needs a physician. I have a physician, my own personal physician. You take him to my physician. His eyes perhaps can be treated. You cannot convince him about light, but you can treat his eyes. And the day he will open his eyes, there will be no need to convince him intellectually. He will see the light himself.\" It took six months to treat his eyes. Buddha moved to another place. He came running the day he could see light, he fell into the feet of Buddha crying out of joy, and he said, \"Forgive me. All my inte llectuality was absolutely useless. It is an experience for which eyes are needed, not argument, not logic, not intellect.\" Spirituality needs eyes. It does not need intellectuality. And you are asking how to transform intellectuality, to have th e transformation. It cannot be done. You will have to put your intellectuality aside; you will have to become as innocent as a child, with no argument, with no intellect, with no reasoning. Just a simplicity, a silence, and you will attain to those eyes I am talking about. You will be able to see the transformation happening."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Through intellect, you can gather knowledge, but you cannot become a seer. And all knowledge that is gathered, is borro wed, is meaningless. Unless the truth is discovered by you, it is not truth. Others may have discovered, you cannot just go on repeating their words. It will be simply like a parrot. That's what people are doing all around the world. Like parrots they go on repeating the VEDAS, the UPANISHADS, the BIBLE, the KORAN. They don't understand what they are doing. They do n't have any experience of their own. And it is a question of individual expe rience; and the basic necessity is to put aside everything that you have borrowed fr om others, all your scholarship, all your knowledge. Can't you drop that which is not your s? And you will be surprised that when you start dropping that which is not yours, you will be left with nothing. And in that purity, in that silence, when there is nothing borrowed, burdening you, when you are unburdened, you can open yo ur wings and fly to the highest star. That is the only tran sformation possible. Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, CAN LIFE BE HELPFUL IN FINDING THE WAY TO TRUTH? A: Only life can be helpful in finding the truth. Those who have been teaching to you, \"Renounce life\", are taking you away from truth. Life contains truth as its center. You have to live life with totali ty, with intensity, with awareness, with gratitude to existence; and life itself will take you to the innermost shrine of the ultimate. I am not against life. All the religions have been teaching you life- negative things, renounce this, renoun ce that, renounce your family, your children, your wife. Renounce everything, and escape to the mountains. It is fortunate that you have not listened to them, otherwise there would be no life left. All people would have escaped to the mountains. Who will feed them? It is a very strange thing. The people renounce life, but they depend on the people whom they have renounced. Th ey give them food, they give them clothes, they give them shelter. It is st range. They should not accept these things. If you have renounced life, then you should not have any concern with people who have not renounced. Millions of people have renounced lif e under the impact of life negative religions. And do you know what has been the effect of it? Millions of women have become widows, and their husbands are alive; millions of children have become orphans, and their fathers are al ive; millions of people have become poor, because there is nobody to help th em to earn livelihood for them. And we have worshipped these people. These people to me are criminals. They have hurt so many people; they are violent. And what they have gained. They have not made life more beautiful, they have not made life more loveable, they have not made life any contribution. They have not created anything. They have been just"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"a burden to other people. And if you look into their eyes, you will not find any spirituality. I have been wandering and looking into the eyes of different religions, monks and nuns, and I simply see a kind of deadness, not intelligence, not sharpness, not aliveness. They have forgotten to sing, they have forgotten to dance. They are living corpses. I don't see it as spiritua lity. Spirituality should be richer, multi- dimensionally richer. Wherever you are, yo u can start growing spiritually there. Your wife is not a hindrance, your child ren are not a hindrance. Your business is not a hindrance; in fact these are all o pportunities for you. These are tests for you. If you can remain silent, loving , compassionate, joyful, in all these situations; if you can manage a tranquility, an equilibrium, in failure, in success, in sickness, in health, in richness, in poverty. If you can remain the same, undisturbed, this is spirituality. To become the center of the cyclone is spirituality. Don't escape from the cyclone, otherwise you will miss the center. This whole life is a cyclone; and you have to become the center of the cyclone. Th e whole cyclone moves. But the center remains unmoving. It remains sile nt, undisturbed, undistracted. Yes, life is the only way to tr uth. There is no other way. Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, WHY IS IT THAT A SANDALWOOD TREE IS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY SNAKES? A: First, literally, the sandalwood tree is an unique tree. Its fragrance is a magnetic force, and the snake -- you have always thought that the snake listens to music, and you have seen it, that th e snake dances, sways with the music. But you will be surprised to know that the snakes don't have ears. It is now an established scientific fact that snakes don't have ears. Even the scientists were very much puzzled, because they can see that snakes are affected by music; but they don't have ears. They have dissected their whole body, th ere is nothing like ears in their whole body. And finally th ey have found recently that, although they don't have any ears, their whole skin is sensitive to sounds. That's why they sway. Without ears, their whole body listens. And because they don't have ears, the energy that goes to ears is available to their nose. There is a certain division. You may have observed that blind people are very clear about sounds. Blind people are be autiful musicians, blind people can remember sounds very easily than people who have eyes, for the simple reason because the energy that is involved in th e eyes moves to the ears. Now the snake has no ears, its energy moves to the nose. It has a tremendously sensitive nose. And the sandalwood tree attracts it. Th is is the literally meaning of your question. But I understand that you are not asking the literal meaning. You are asking the symbolic meaning. And there is a great symbolic meaning."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"In the biblical story, Eve and Adam are seduced by the snake, who tells to Eve that if you eat from the tree of knowle dge you will become like gods. That's why God has prevented you from eating the frui t of the tree of knowledge. Now this is a great temptation. She persuades Adam and they both eat from the tree of knowledge. Who is this snake? Snake don't speak. This snake is symbolic, and the tree of knowledge is symbolic. The tree of knowledge is not the tree of wisdom. Re member the distinction. Wisdom comes out of your own innocence. Wisdom me ans your innocence becoming mature, your innocence coming of age, your innocence flowering, releasing its fragrance. It comes from within you. Knowledge co mes from somewhere else, from a tree. This is symbolic. It is borrowed knowledg e. Then the snake is the priest, who is telling you to read the GITA, read the KORAN, read the holy BIBLE, because this will make you knowledgeable. But no book can make you knowledgeable. It will burden you with information. But it will be always borrowed, not authenti c, not yours. The snake in the biblical story is the first priest of the world. There is a story that one day a newly recruited devil came running to the old devil, the master devil and said to him, \"Do something immediately, because one man on the earth has found the truth. And if he spreads the truth into peop le, what will happen to our business?\" The old devil said, \"You are a new recruit. Don't be worried. My people have already reached there.\" But he said, \"I am coming from there, I have not seen any of your people.\" He said, \"You cannot see that way. All th ose priests, pundits, scholars who are surrounding the man who has found the tr uth are my people. They won't let the masses reach the man of truth. They won't let the man of truth reach the masses. They will become the mediators. They w ill represent the master to the masses. They will become the interpreters, and th at's how we manage to distort every truth. It has been found many times before, you don't be worried. We have experts, how to distort it, interpretation. We have scholars, we have pundits, we have rabbis, we have popes, we have all kinds of snakes. They will do the job.\" And this has been happening. This is not only a story. You will be surprised to know that Mahavira rebelled against Brah mins. But his chief disciples, eleven disciples, were all Brahmins. That is strange. He was fighting against Brahminism, and his chief disciples are all Brahmins. Mahavira has not written a single word. All that is written is writte n by those eleven Brahmins. Naturally it is distorted. It is not what he has said. It cannot be what he has said. The same happened with Gautam Buddha. He was also from the race of the warriors, Kshatriyas; and he was also rebelling against the priesthood of Brahmins. But his most closest disciples are all Brahmins. He has not written a single word. When he died, all the Brah mins gathered togeth er and they wrote all Buddhist scriptures. Now they don't represent the reality. They represent the Brahmin interpretation. Naturally, it is very protective of Brahminism against which Buddha was fighting his whole life."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"These are the snakes.

It is for reference use only.] PRESS INTERVIEWS Q: WHY THOUSANDS OF DEAD RELIGIONS HAVE WEAK PREMISES, ETC. PLEASE COMMENT. A: It is not a tragedy. It is something of a fundamental, existential truth. The living Buddha is always going to be home less, for the simple reason that it is very difficult to accept a contemporary human being as someone who is awakened. It goes against your ego, that you are asleep, and somebody else is awakened. It hurts you. Hence the living, awakened person is always condemned, poisoned, crucified. But when he is dead, then things change completely. You can worship a dead Buddha, because he is not your contemporary. He is not your competitor. You can give him qualities which he neve r possessed. You can make him a god, which he never was. Now it is in your hands, whatever you want to make out of it. And then it is easy to worship him. The dead is acceptable. The living is dangerous; because the dead in your hands can be changed according to your expectat ions, but not the living. With the living the situation is just the opposite. You are in his hands; he will change you. The dead cannot change you. You can chan ge the dead. You are powerful over the dead saints, but over the living you ha ve no power. Naturally you love your power. When Gautam Buddha was alive, dozens of attempts were made on his life. And finally he died with food poisoning. He was condemned as much that you may not believe. He was passing through a village, the whole village gathered together; they abused him. They said ug ly things, they used vulgar words. And he remained silent, listening to them . His disciples were getting furious; but because the master was present, they had to remain silent. When the people of the village had ended insulting him, he asked them politely, lovingly, compassionately, \"Have you said everything that you wanted to say, because I have to reach the other village . People must be waiting there, and I don't want anybody to be waiting for me unnecessarily. If you have to say something more, I will be coming back again from the same route, and I will have enough time for you. Then you can say whatsoever you want to say."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"One of the men from the crowd said, \"We were not saying things. We were condemning you. We were insulting you.

In the other village before your village, people had come with sweets and flowers to present to me, and I said, `I don't need.' They had to take them back. I as k you, what they will do with those sweets and flowers?\" Somebody in the crowd said, \"Of course they will distribute in the village.\" Buddha laughed and said, \"What you will do? I refuse to take all your abuses. Now go and distribute in the village. Give it to your children, to your parents, or whomsoever you want. Or keep yourself. I refuse to take. And you cannot give me anything which I refuse to take.\" A living enlightened being is no t in your hands. If you wa nt to be related to him, you have to be in his hands. That needs guts. That needs courage. That needs intelligence. That needs capacity to risk all and everything. Naturally, the living enlightened being is not worshipped. He is condemned, he is refused, he is not accepted. The same person, when he is dead, creates a great change in your mind. First, because you have condemned him while he was alive, you start feeling guilty. Whatever you have done was ugly, inhuman. To compensate, you start worshipping. You move to the other extreme. You make statues of the same person; but now it is wi thin your hands, what to make of that man. Do you know the statue of Buddha differs in different countries? In Nepal, it has a different shape, different face. It is Ne palese. In Japan it is certainly different. The Japanese buddha has a big belly. The Chinese buddha is different. It is exactly like a Chinese, with the cheek bones protruding. The Indian buddha is totally different. And you will be surprise d to know that none of these statues have any similarity to the real man, be cause for three hundred years no statue was made of Buddha. After his death th ere were no pictures, no cameras, no photographs, no paintings. After three hundred years Alexander the Great came to India. He was a beautiful man. He impressed the imagination of th e Indian artist. And the Buddha carries the face of Alexander the Great. A dead saint is in your hands. Whatever you want to do you can do with him. You try with living, enlightened beings also to impose your ideas. Those who listen to you are not authentically enlight ened, because they are being instructed by the unenlightened; they are following their own followers; they are being dominated by the ignorant. Your so-ca lled saints, respectable, are not truly arrived to truth yet. They have simply fulfilled your expectations. Whatever your idea is how a saint should be, they are behaving in the same way. You will respect them, but they are false. A real buddha is going to be condemned. He cannot be respectable in his contemporary world, because he will not li sten to your suggestions. People go on"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"giving me suggestions. They say to me, \"B hagwan, don't say this, this will create trouble.\" They don't understand that if I listen to them, then I am not the man to be a master. I will do what I feel spontaneously to do. If it creates trouble, then perhaps existence needs trouble at this moment. If I have to remain homeless, no harm. Because anyway, every home is just a house. You have only an illusion that it is a home. Many people have lived before you in that house, and are gone. You will be gone soon. Somebody else will be living there -- your children. There is only stable home, that is in the graveyard. There you go with a one-way ticket; you never return back. That is permanent abode. That is the only home. These ho mes that you think are your homes are just caravanserais. So when my people as k me, \"Bhagwan is it okay if we arrange a hotel for you to stay, I say `Everything is a hotel;' and I have told my secretary, Prem Hasya, just today that Buddha remained without a home for forty two years, walking, moving from one village to another. You arrange one aeroplane for me, so I can go on moving around th e world all the year ro und; no need for a house, no need for a home.\" Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, THANK YOU VE RY MUCH FOR VISITING NEPAL. QUESTION: YOU ARE THE MOST SUCC ESSFUL SPIRITUAL BUSINESSMAN. WHAT IS THE SECRET OF YOUR SUCCESS? A: It is a very pertinent question; in th e meeting of the top businessmen of Nepal. First I would like to remind you, I am no t a businessman. For the simple reason, I don't have even a bank account anywhere in the world. I don't have even pockets in my robe. I have not touched money fo r fifteen years. I remained in America for five years, but I have not seen a dollar bill. How can you call me a businessman? Perha ps you may have heard that I have ninety-three Rolls Royces. In fact, I don' t have even a Honda. Those ninety-three Rolls Royces belonged to the commune of the sannyasins in America. Not only they had those, they had three hundred other cars. They had one hundred buses, they had five aeroplanes. It was one of the richest communes that has ever existed in the world. And that's what pushed the American politicians to insanity. They could not tolerate that even their president cannot afford to have ninety-three Rolls Royces. But those Rolls Royces don't belong to me. I am not the owner of those Rolls Royces. I don' t own anything; not a single rupee. Just the other day, few American idiots mu st be staying in the hotel. When I passed by their side one ugly and fat an d retarded woman said to the others, \"This is the man who has ninety-three Rolls Royces.\" Strange, that people are not interested in my teaching, in me, in my way of life. They are interested in the Rolls Royces. It shows their mind. I have been receiving thousands of le tters from people around the world. Everybody condemning me for having ni nety-three Rolls Royces; yet thousands of letters reaching to me that Bhagwan, if you can give one Rolls Royce to me it"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"won't make any difference to you. Ninety- three or ninety-two, what difference it will make to you? But to me it will be my lifelong dream ful filled. And you will be surprised to know that I receiv ed a letter from a Bishop, who was continuously talking against me, and agai nst the Rolls Royces. That's why I had come to know his name. And finally I receiv ed his letter, asking me that if I can donate one of the Rolls Royces to his church, it is a tax exempt charitable religious body, and he will be very glad. I told to one of my secretaries to write to the Bishop, that I am absolutely willing. Do you want a regular Rolls Royce, or wo uld you prefer a long-stretch big Rolls Royce, a limousine. And immediately came the reply, if you are so compassionate, then a limousine will do. But unfortunately I had to inform him that I can give you anything, but they do n't belong to me. You will be caught by the police. My situation is like this: two beggars sitti ng under a tree, under the influence of opium, looking of the moon, full moon night, were talking business. One beggar said, \"Tell me exactly how much you will take for the moon?\" The other beggar said, \"Who told you that I am thinking to sell it?\" And you call me the most successful spiritual businessman? Spirituality and being a businessman is a contradiction in terms. Either you can be spiritual, or you can be a businessman. Because the whol e art of business is, to give you less and take you more from you. That is th e profit. In spirituality, there is only giving and no taking. I have not taken an ything from anybody. I have given my love, I have given my understanding, I have given my experience, without any condition, to anybody who was thirsty, and ready, and open and receptive. But I have not put any condition on him, that he will have to pay for it. Spirituality is just sharing something that you have got. And there is no need to take anything from the person you share, because the very nature of spiritual experience is such, the more you give it, the more it grows within you. There is no need to take it from anybody else. Just go on sharing, and you will be surprised that it functions against the ordi nary laws of economics. In economics, if you go on giving things, soon you will be a beggar. But, in the spiritual economics, if you don't give, then whatever you have got, that will also die. To keep it living you have to keep it flowing. Don't make a pond of your spiritual experience. Let it be a river. Soon the ri ver will reach to the ocean, and the whole ocean will be yours. And you need not ask for anything. One thing I have to remind you in this reference; in Russia my sannyasins are being persecuted, just as they are persecut ed in America, or in other countries. In Russia they think that my sannyasins are working for Am erica, that I am representing capitalism; and in America they think that I am the greatest communist on the earth. It is a very stran ge situation. All kinds of labels have been given to me which are contradictory. They all cannot be true together. Hindus think I am converting people perhaps to Christianity. Christians are against me because they think I am taking away their cream, their youth, out of"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"the Christian fold. Naturally I am converti ng them into Hinduism. Looking at all these labels and condemnations, I thought I should have a look actually who am I? An agent of FBI, or an agent of KGB? And then I remembered a small story. An old man, very simple, found by the side of the road a small mirror. He had never seen such a thing in his whole life. He looked into the mirror. He said, \"My God, this seems to be the picture of my father. I had never thought that that old man was so romantic; that he will have his picture to be taken. But it is good that I have found it. I will keep it as a memory. But I will have to hide it from my wife, because if she comes to know that this is my father's picture, she is going to destroy it immediately.\" So he went in the house, very silently. The wife was surprised. He never comes so silently. There must be something go ing on. He went upstairs. The wife went on watching him. She also went upstairs slowly, without making any noise. She saw him hiding the mirror in a suitcase. Sh e could not figure it out -- what can it be? But she said, how long he will be here. Soon he will have to go to work again. And he had to go to work. The moment he had to go to work the wife went up, opened the suitcase, found the mirror, looked into the mirror and said, \"My God. Fifty years I have lived with this man, and this sonofabitch is running after this rotten woman. I will kill her.\" Looking into myself I found that I am a mirror. Whoever looks into me finds his own face reflected. You are a businessman, what can I do? Wh en a monkey looks into the mirror, he finds another monkey there. I am not a businessman at all. This is not the way of a businessman. I am certainly trying to persuade you to grow, to bring your potential to its ultimate height. I am not going to give you anything. I don't have any commodity to sell. I am simply trying to provoke in you a challenge. (Tape side B) You have the real thing, but you are not looking at it. You have ignored it. You have the seed, which can become a beautiful flower and fill your life with fragrance. I will take away things from you which in fact you don't have. And I will give you only those things to you which you already have. Now what kind of business is this? Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, WHY PEOPLE CALL RAJNEESHEES MAD PEOPLE? A: They are mad. If you are sane, then my people are certainly mad. If you have eyes, then my people are blind; if you ha ve found the truth, then my people are lost. It is all a question of relativity."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"If you look at my people, you will find a totally different experience. First, there is no Rajneeshee in the world because th ey are not my followers. They are not Hindus, they are not Buddhists, they are not Christians, they are not Mohammedans, because all those people are followers. My people are my friends, they are not my followers. So there is not a single Rajneeshee in the whole world. They love me. So first you will have to drop the id ea of somebody being a Rajneeshee. Secondly, have you loved somebody, ev er? If you have not loved somebody ever, you will not understand that love is mad. Because love is not of the mind, it is of the heart. Love is not logic, it is not reason. That's why all lovers look mad. But unfortunate are those people who have never tasted such madness. There are other dimensions also. Perhaps you may have some creativity in you. Have you loved music? Have you loved da ncing? Have you loved painting, or sculpture; anything creative? And you will know that while you create the mind stops, and something bigger than the mind takes over. One of the greatest painters, Vincent Va n Gogh, was asked once that when you are painting you look like a madman. Vinc ent Van Gogh said, \"I don't look, I am. Because while painting I forget all reason ing. I forget my mind, my intellect. I forget myself. The painter disappears. Only there is a creativity. The painting is there, but the painter is not.\" Naturally this will look mad. How painting can be there without the painter? Because we are accustomed of logical thinking, of dividing things. One of the greatest dancers of this age was Nijinsky. Perhaps he was the greatest dancer of all the ages, because he had something which has never been seen in any dancer. He used to take jumps while dancing, so high that scientists said it is impossible, it is against the law of grav itation. You cannot jump that high. But what to do with this man? He jumps, he goes beyond the law of gravitation. And even more strange was the phenomenon when he had jumped high, gone beyond the limit of gravitation, he will start falling back. The ordinary way is, you fall fast with a thump on the gr ound. But that was not the way with Nijinsky. He will fall like a feather, very slowly, coming with ease, as if it is within his power, as if gravitation has no power over him. He was asked by the scientists, \"How you do it?\" Nijinsky said, \"Don't ask me that, because I have tried it. Whenever I try, I cannot do it. I have failed always, whenever I have tried. It happens only when I forget completely, and there is only dance and the dancer disappears. Then it happens. I am amazed as much as you are amazed. I don't know how it happens. I must be mad.\" The people who are with me are in deep love, in deep friendship. They are in great creativity, far greater than any painting, and far greater than any music, and far greater than any dancing. Becaus e they are creating their own being. They are creating their own soul. Yes, they are mad people. And they are fortunate that they have the guts to go out of your so-called sane intelligent,"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"mundane world. Whoever has courage amon gst you would also like to be mad, like my people. This madness is not the ordinary madness when a man falls below his mind. It is an extraordinary madness, when a man ri ses above his mind. Both go out of the mind, but the ordinary madman goes down; the spiritual madman goes up, higher than the ordinary logic, reasonin g, thinking. Just look at my people. You will not find more intelligent people anywhere. Their madness has a method in it. Just look at me! Do you think I am mad? If I am mad, then I hope that you all should be mad. That will be the greatest blessing in your life. Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, WHAT IS THE MIND? HAD IT A BEGINNING OR AN END. AND A RELATED QUESTION: FINDING OUT ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE OF THE MIND, IS IT ENOUGH TO FREE US FROM THE CYCLE OF DEATH AND REBIRTH? A: Mind has no beginning, but mind has an end. Meditation has a beginning, but meditation has no end. This is the whol e circle of life. Have you understood? Mind has a(*) beginning. Then all the religions had been looking for that beginning. Christians say that the world was created by God four thousand four years before Jesus Christ; that is six thou sand years before today. Then certainly mind has a beginning. But it is strange . The great Christian theologians have never asked a simple question, that what God was doing for eternity, before six thousand years. Secondly, why suddenly one day, it must have been January, Monday, why he began the creation? Why he created the wh ole world? What caused him to create it? Is there some bigger power than him, who ordered him to create it? Is there some desire hidden in his being, that he wanted to create it? But God is desireless, and there is nobody above him. So why, at a certain point, suddenly, he started creating? He seems to be whimsical. And you cannot depend on such a God, because tomorrow he may start thinking to destroy. If he can create without any valid reason, he can destroy without any valid reason. All the religions will say mind has a beginning, because the world has a beginning, because God created it. I say to you, mind has no beginning, because existence has never been created. It has always been here. And it is very simple. Why make it complex? God created th e world -- why? Because the world is there, a creator is needed, somebody shou ld create it. But the question arises, who created the God? And then you say, God is never created. He has always been here. If God can be here, without be ing created, then why bother with God. This existence is perfectly beautiful. It has always been here. Do not accept any unnecessary hypothesis."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"That's why I say, mind has no beginning. Because existence has no beginning. But mind has an end. It ends into medita tion. You can call it, it gets transformed into meditation. Meditation has a beginning, but no end. Then it goes on and on, for infinity, for eternity. Mind is a small thing. Meditation makes you part of existence. It allows you the freedom of becoming one with the whole. And to me that is the only way of being holy -- to be one with the whole. You are asking, if we can understand th e workings of the mind, will they disappear? Certainly, absolutely. The only way for the activities of the mind to disappear is to be a witness to them . Just see them, clearly. Without any judgment. Just be a watcher, uninvolved, unattached. And those activities start disappearing, like shadows. And when mind is no more in action, that is what we call meditation. When mind is not functioning, you have arrived at the beginning of meditation. And you are asking, will it deliver us from death? Will it deliver us from being born again and again? Certainly, because it is only ignorance that keeps you being born again and again. Because you are always dying with a desire unfulfilled. That unfulfilled desire takes you into a new form. Existence is very compassionate. It does not want you to be discontented. It does not want you to be unfulfilled in any desire. When you are dying, if you are hanker ing for something, something that you always wanted but you could not get, something that was always in your mind, haunting you, and you were not able to fi nd it, existence will give you the right form in which your desire can be fulf illed. Existence is ve ry favorable, very friendly. You are children of it. It has to be friendly to you. And if you are crying for toys, teddy bears, it will provide you with teddy bears. I am reminded of an old Jewish man wh o was on his deathbed, a very miserly man. His four sons had gathered and th ey were worried, when the old man dies, what arrangements have to be done; how they should be done? The man has not died yet. He is listening to their talk. They are whispering. The first son said that, \"Our father always wanted a Rolls Royce, but being a miser he could not manage. At least when he dies we should bring a Rolls Royce to carry his dead body to the cemetery.\" The second son said, \"You are just bein g stupid. For a dead man what difference does it make whether you are carrying hi m in a Rolls Royce, or in a Ford? It doesn't matter. The dead man is dead. He will never know the difference. Why waste money?\" The third man said, \"Even Ford will cost money. My suggestion is, we should phone to the municipal corporation, and th ey can bring their truck in which they go on throwing beggars and others into the cemetery. A dead man is dead, whether he is your father or your mother, it does not matter.\" Before the fourth was going to speak, the old man somehow managed to sit up in the bed and said, \"Wait! Just find out where my shoes are.\""},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"They said, \"But what you are going to do with shoes. You were going to die.\" The man said, \"I am still alive. Just give me my shoes. I will walk to the cemetery. You are all for wasting money.\" Now this man, what do you think? If he dies he is going to be born, his whole life he must have repressed thousands of desi res, even at the point of death he is concerned about money. A man of meditation dies without any desires. He dies in silence. Hence there is no question of his being born in anot her form. And a man of meditation knows that death is a lie, that death has neve r happened; it only appears from the outside. You see somebody dying, from th e outside, but you don't know that is happening inside the man. His inner bein g never dies. But most of the people live unconsciously. Naturally they die un consciously, unaware that death has not happened. Death has never happened in the whole et ernity. Death is just an outsider's observation. The meditator observes from within. He sees himself, his body dying, his mind dying, his heart drowning. The beats are going farther and farther away, and the breathing is drowning . He goes on seeing all this, and he also goes on seeing that it is not affecting him at all. It is only the body and its components which are decomposing, fallin g apart. But his own being is intact. This experience of immortality takes hi m to the universal shore. This whole existence is full of consciousness. When I said, there is no God who created the world, please don't misunderstand me. When I am denying a God outside existence, there is a purpose. The purpose is, I want God to be inside existence. An outsider God is not of much value. A God inside everything, in the stones, in the stars; all that exists is overflowing with divineness. The moment you understand your own immo rtality, now there is no rebirth for you. You have become part of the universal godliness, you have become one with the whole. Just like in the early morning sun, a dewdrop slips from the lotus leaf into the ocean, and disappears. On the one hand it disappears in the ocean. On the other hand, it becomes the ocean. Both the things happen simultaneously. Be ready to disappear. That is the only wa y to become all. Lose small boundaries, so then you can become one with the unbounded. It is your birthright. Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, THE WESTERN MIND SEEMS TO WANT TO REDUCE EVERYTHING, NO MATTER HOW SUBTLE, TO THE KNOWN. THE EASTERN MIND SEEMS TO WANT TO REDUCE EVERYTHING, NO MATTER HOW CONCRETE, TO THE UNKNOWN. CAN WE HELP EACH OTHER? A: The existence can be divided in thr ee categories: the known, the unknown, and the unknowable. What is known to day was unknown yesterday; what is unknown today may become known tomorr ow. So there is not much difference between known and unknown. It is only a question of time."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Science, that means the West, believes on ly in two categories -- the known and the unknown. And as a corollary, scientific mind of the West believes that there will come a day when we will have redu ced everything into the known, and there will not be left anything unknown. That is one of the basic assumptions of scientific inquiry. We are everyday discovering more and more, and the unknown is shrinking, becoming smaller and the known is becoming bigger. Naturally one can conceive somewhere in the future a time is bound to come when everything will be know n. But if it is true, then that will be the death of humanity. If all is known, then there is no adventure left. If all is known then there is no more any challenge. Then lif e will be very empty. If everything is explained, there will not be anything my sterious. And to lose the miraculous, you will lose something tremendously valuable. It is the unknown, undiscovered, that go es on challenging you to progress, to evolution, to reach new heights, new peak s of consciousness. But if a day comes that all is known, everything is reduced in to simple formulas, then there will be no romance, there will be no poetry, there will be no beauty, there will be no joy. There will be nothing left which is valuable. But fortunately the West is not right. The division between the known and the unknown is not complete. The East has a threefold division -- known, unknown, unknowable. It agrees with the West th at the unknown can become known, but the unknowable will always remain unknowable. There will always be mystery around human consciousness. There will be always mystery around love, friendship, meditation, consciousness. We may be able to know all that is objective. But the subjectivity, the inne rmost core of human consciousness, will remain always a mystery. And this has been the persistent effort of the East, to make it clear to the whole world that the unknowable should not be denied, otherwise you will take all juice out of hu man life. You will create robots out of human beings, you will destroy them, an d they will be just machines and nothing more. And modern science, for the first time in th e history, has started to agree with the East. As modern physics has entered deeper into matter, into electrons, neutrons, protons, the physicist has become pu zzled. Things seem to be becoming mysterious. Up to now he was thinking the unknown is turning into known. Now he is not of the same opinion. Now he is saying that we are entering into something of which we have never thought about, the unknowable. (Tape side C) So there is not much difficult of bringing East and West closer. They are already coming closer. Just the Eastern meditators have to understand the latest scientific researches, and the scientists of the We st have to understand the deepest explorations of meditation. And this is not difficult. And they will come to a synthesis which will not be just forced . It will come out of the experience, naturally, spontaneously."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"I am educated in the ways of the West. I have been a professor of philosophy and logic, teaching Western philosophy and We stern logic. From Socrates, Plato and Aristotle to Bertrand Russell and Jean-Paul S artre. But, in my own individual life, I have been working deeper and deeper into meditation, reaching farther and farther into my own inner space. And I have found the center of the cyclone. I can see it absolutely clearly that the time has come when East and West can join together in a combined effort, because th e search has led both to the same point, the unknowable. The unknowable can be called the truth, can be called the nirvana, can be called liberation. These are different words. I am reminded of Albert Einstein's last words. Before he died, he said to his friends that \"If I am born again, I would not like to be a physicist. I would rather like to be a plumber.\" They were surpri sed, a man of the calibre of Albert Einstein wants to be a plumber? For what? Einstein died, he could not answer them, but I can answer them. He had expl ored the objective world, the outside world, as much as any man in the wh ole history. He has found the atomic energy. But he himself remained unknown to himself. He knows so much about the matter, and he knows nothing about his consciousness. This is the reason he wants in his next life some simple job like a plumber, which does not need any intellectual effort, so that he can devo te his energies for inner exploration. In my vision, in the future, there will be only science; no religions. And the science will have two wings, just like a bird; one wing for objective inquiry about the matter, about the outside, about the other. And the second wing for inner inquiry, to find out what it is which is living in me, wh ich is conscious in me; to discover the interiority of my own being, my subjectivity. Science will have two aspects, just like every coin has two aspects. There is no need for any religion -- Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, Buddhist, Jaina, Jew; there is no need. Science is enough. And it can do both the work. One side for the outside, and the other side for the inward pilgrimage. That is going to be the meeting point between East and West. And sooner it happens, the better. "},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" The Last Testament, Vol 5 Chapter #25 Chapter title: None 19 January 1986 pm in Kathmandu, Nepal [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only.] PRESS INTERVIEWS Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT DO YOU THI NK ABOUT THE ATTITUDE OF THE BUDDHA, MESSIAHS, AVATARAS, TIRTHANKARAS, TOWARDS WOMEN? A: Just disgusting! All these people have insulted woman-kind down the ages as much as it is possible. None of them can be forgiven. None of them can be forgotten. Christians have a trinity of God, the holy ghost, and the son, Jesus Christ. But in the trinity there is not a woman. A very strange family. The father is there, the son is there, but where is the mother? And what purpose has this holy ghost? Why keep this idiot there? A woman would have been perfectly human and understandable. But in the highest trinit y of Christianity they cannot accept a woman. Jesus was teaching in the village of his birth, and a crowd was listening to him. His mother, Mary, came running because her son has come to the village; and she was waiting long, for years he had not been there. She is standing outside the crowd and somebody shouts to Jesus, \"Your mother is standing outside the crowd.\" And do you know what Jesus says? He says , \"Tell that woman\" -- he does not use the word mother -- he says, \"Tell that woman that I don't have any mother. I have only my father who is above in heaven.\" And these people you have worshipped. You have never asked about their behavior. He had twelve apostles, his chief disciples. But amongst them there was not a single woman, although there were women far more devoted than those apostles. One of the most beautiful women of Jud ea, Mary Magdalene, was a prostitute, but listening to Jesus she went throug h a transformation. She dropped her profession and devoted her whole life to Jesus, but she was not accepted as one of the apostles. You will be surprised to know that when Jesus was crucified all those twelve male apostles escaped, af raid that they may be caught with the same result. What happene d to Jesus may happen to them. They were afraid of crucifixion, they had seen the misery, the anguish of Jesus. They all escaped. But three women -- Jesus' mother, about whom he said, \"Tell that woman she is not"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"my mother,\" was still there, unafraid. Everybody knew she was the mother of Jesus. Nobody knew those apostles. Mary Magdalene, a prostitute, had more courage and more guts than those so- called holy men. And another woman of the same name, Mary was also there. These three women brought Jesus' body from the cross. Not a single man was there. But the Christian church has not accepted those three women as saints. Those twelve cowards who escaped, they are great saints. The woman has been condemned by all the religions. Mahavira says that no woman can go to the ultimate liberation directly from the woman's body. Strange, because the same person continuously teaches people that you are not the body, you are the soul . If you are the soul, then the question arises, is the soul of a woman also femi nine? Is the soul of man also masculine? The soul cannot be feminine and cannot be masculine. Consciousness is simply consci ousness, it has no sexuality, it has no genitals. But he forgets when it comes to woman. He says, \"A woman has to do austerities, practice virtue; all that will help her to be born as a man in the next life. And then she can make efforts for ultimate enlightenment. Only man can become enlightened. No woman can become enlightened.\" You will be surprised to know that in spit e of all these teachings, one courageous woman became enlightened. Her name was Mallibai. She lived a few hundred years earlier than Mahavir. The woman had re ally attained to all the qualities of the enlightened person. She has the tran quillity, the silence, the unconditional love, fearlessness, absolute freedom. They had to accept her, but they played a trick. In my childhood I used to go to a Jain a temple which was just near my house. There are twenty-four statues of the Jaina tirthankaras. Th ey are all alike. I never discovered that there is one woman, for th e simple reason that the Jainas have changed her name. From Mallibai they ha ve changed her name to Mallinath. Do you see the disgusting, ugly, male ch auvinist mind? Mallinath one thinks naturally must have been a man. The na me is of a man, but she was a woman. It took years for me to discover that Mallinath was not Mallinath; it was a woman. But why did they change th e name? Because they were feeling embarrassed. It goes against their whol e teaching and their whole philosophy. No person can become enlightened from a woman's body. What is wrong in a woman's body? It is more beautiful than a man's body; it is more strong than a man's body. Perhaps you will be surprise d when I say that, because you have been carrying the idea that man is strong er, but only muscularly he is stronger. But that is not the only strength in the world, there are far more superior strengths. For example, the woman has more resistance to diseases than man. That is her real strength. More men fall sick than wo men. To keep the balance nature has to produce ten boys more if it produces on e hundred girls, it has to produce one hundred ten boys. Because by the time they become mature enough to get"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"married, ten boys would have gone down the drain. But those hundred girls will be still around. They have a far stronger grip on life. Women live five years longer than men all over the world. If man's age is seventy, then woman's age is seven ty five. Women talk about committing suicide, but they don't commit. And whenever you find that a woman has committed suicide, be very careful; in most of the cases it will be a murder. Either the husband has murdered her, or the mother-in-law has murdered her, it is not a suicide. Women simply talk, it is the man who commits murder, commits suicide. Twice as many men go mad as women. One thinks this is strange, because women act crazier. They throw thin gs, they break plates, they hit with pillows, and they are always ready to throw a tantrum, weeping, screaming. They know the whole paraphernalia of how to torture the husband. But they don't go mad. Perhaps they don't go mad because every day they have a release, they don't accumulate. Man cannot cry, it is unmanly. He cannot throw things, it doesn't suit him. He cannot break plates or scream. He accumulates, and one day he explodes, wholesale. What is wrong with a woman's body? Why she cannot become enlightened? I have been working with millions of people, men and women. I don't see any difference as far as enlightenment is concerned. But even a man like Buddha, who is the best of his kind, was afraid to initiate women into his commune. For fourteen years continuously he refused women, he would not initiate them. What is the problem? Perhaps it is not the woman that is the problem, it is repression that is the problem. All those monks are repressed pe ople, their sexuality is boiling within. To allow women into the commune is da ngerous, because these people who are carrying a repressed sexuality, finding wo men close enough, may not be able to control themselves. But this is somethin g wrong with your methodology, your discipline. For your wrong disciplin e, why you should insult women? In my commune, women and men have lived together with no question of fear, because basically I am against repression. In fact, you will be surprised to know that my swamis, the male sannyasins, wer e afraid of women. They were trying to escape from women, not vice versa, beca use while making love man loses some energy. The woman does not lose anythin g. Seeing the fact, the man becomes aware that, \"I am being stupid. This is no t a bargain, I am simply losing, and the woman is enjoying. I am being befooled.\" It was continuously reported to me by women sannyasins, \"What has happened to your sannyasins? They find excuses to escape.\" I said, \"Nothing has happened. I have allowed you both total freedom, and freedom brings understanding. They have seen that in sexual relationship they are the losers, they are the fools. Next day, they have the hang-over. Naturally, everybody wants to protect himself, an d everybody has the right to protect himself.\""},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"But Buddha was afraid, because he would not allow a man even to see women. He would not allow a man to touch a woman, he will not allow a man to talk with a woman. Now if this is the situation, then naturally women have to be kept out of the sangha, of the initiated commune . But finally he reluctantly agreed, he had to agree. His mother died when he was born, and he was brought up by his mother's sister from the very first day. She was the woman he had known as his mother. He knew she was not his mother, his mother had died, but she had given him more than any mother. She did not get married, just because of him, because if she got married perhaps sh e would have her own children and she may not be so careful of Gautam Buddha. She loved the boy, and the boy had as much potential that it looked like he was going to become a milestone in the history of man. She sacrificed her whole life. And when this woman came to her own son and asked to be initiated, Buddha could not refuse. Reluctantly he initiate d her; but then the door was opened. If you initiate one woman, you cannot refuse another woman. And what he said at that moment is worth remembering. He said, \"My religion was going to last for twenty-five centuries. Now it will last only five centuries, because the women will corrupt everything.\" This is strange. Why should women corru pt? It can happen only if your male sannyasins are corruptible, if they are re ady to be corrupted. And if they are ready to be corrupted, I don't think his religion was going to last for twenty- five centuries. People who want to be corru pted have thousands of ways to be corrupted. Woman is not an absolute nece ssity. They can become homosexuals, in all the monasteries they have become homosexuals. But all these prophets have misbehaved wi th woman. It is time that the woman should assert her individuality, should assert her spirituality, and should condemn all those people who have been against women, who have reduced her into a sub- human species. A totally n ew quality of religious consciousness is needed, which accepts men and women equally. There is nothing to be afraid of. And if sp iritual beings are so much afraid, then who will be fearless? I am reminded of a small story. Two Buddhist monks are coming from the village back to their monastery. Before th e monastery they have to cross a small, mountainous river. The current is very strong. The old monk is ahead, and he finds a beautiful young woman standing on the bank of the river, and she says, \"Reverend, night is coming. I am alone, my house is on the other side, and I am afraid to enter this mountainous river. The current is so strong. I am afraid, I may be taken by the current and drowned. Won't you help me?\" The old man remembered Buddha's sayings, \"Don't talk to a woman.\" He didn't say anything, he simply lowered his ey es because he had seen her. She was beautiful. Already his heart was beating fa ster, she had already affected him. It was dangerous. He simply jumped into th e river to get back to the monastery as quickly as possible. When he reached the other side he remembered that his"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"young sannyasin, a young bhikku is also coming just behind him. And he is too young. If my heart started beating faste r, if I started thinking of things which cannot be said, what about the young man? At that time he saw the young man carrying the girl on his shoulders. The ol d man was furious, and also jealous. The young man put the girl back on the grou nd. The girl thanked him. But the old man did not speak to him. He was really an gry, he was not in a state to talk. But before they were entering the monaster y, on the steps before the door, he stopped and said to the young man, \"I am going to report it to the master. You have committed a grave sin.\" The young man said, \"What sin, what are you talking about?\" The old man said, \"Ah ha. Are you trying to befool me? What about that beautiful girl that you were carrying on your shoulders?\" The young man simply said, \"I have left he r on the bank of the river, but it seems you are still carrying her.\" Man and woman are part of one humanity. They should not be thought of as separate. Religion is for both, and together they can grow better than in separation. We just have to drop all ki nds of sexual obsession, repression, which are ugly inheritance from ignorant, pr imitive days. We are living in a more sophisticated, more intelligent century. We should behave according to the contemporary times. Q: BHAGWAN, RIGHT NOW I AM FEELING YOU, TASTING YOU, DRINKING YOU LIKE A DRUNKARD. AS WITHOUT BOTTLES THERE WILL BE NO DRUNKARD, WITHOUT YOUR P HYSICAL PRESENCE, HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO FEEL YOU, TO TASTE YOU, TO DRINK YOU? AND THE QUESTION IS: WHY IS THE WORLD SO SICK TODAY? A: Love knows no distance, love knows only closeness. You may be miles away; just close your eyes and let your heart take possession of you. You will find me sitting by your side; you will find your hand in my hand. This is my promise. The world is miserable because the world has forgotten how to be. The world is in suffering because people have listened to all kinds of superstitions, followed all kinds of wrong thoughts, and are lost in a jungle. Naturally there is great anxiety. Time is slipping out of your hands, death is coming closer every moment, and you have not even known about life. And life is fleeting by. As you grow older you will find yourself in more anguish, because the life that was an opportunity to find the truth, to find meaning, to find some eternal nourishment, you have wasted in colle cting seashells on the beach, colored stones, and death will take everything away . Hence the tension goes on growing, and the whole world is becoming tense, particularly at these times, because the third world war is hanging just on the horizon. That is the death of all."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"For the first time humanity is feeling the fear of a universal death. Before, individuals have felt it, it was a small th ing. Now it has become total and global. Any moment any computer in the Soviet Union or America can go wrong. It is not even in human hands, now everything is being controlled by the computers. And you know, you cannot depend on machines, you cannot depend even on men. Just a small accident and the whole world will be just going up in smoke, hence the tension is tremendous. But you can make it a great opportunity too, because death is so close and life is more unreliable than it has ever been. You can change your life into deep silence, into meditation; you can realize, under this pressure it is easier to realize, yo ur innermost center, which is immortal. No nuclear weapons can destroy it. And once yo u have felt it, all tension, all misery, all anguish, will simply disappear as if it was never there before. This is the time for everybody to medita te. This is the time that, except for meditation, nothing can help you to get ou t of your misery. And meditation is a simple phenomenon. Just whenever you ha ve time, sit silently, doing nothing. Relax, close your eyes, watch your thoughts as if you are watching a movie on the screen. You are just a watcher. And yo u are in for a great surprise, perhaps the greatest surprise of life. If you can watch your thoughts just as if they are moving there on the screen, and you ar e not involved in them, they start dispersing. It is your involvement th at gives them life energy. When you withdraw yourself and become just a witn ess, thoughts start falling, like leaves which are dead start falling from the trees . Soon you will be surprised, the screen is empty. The moment the screen of the mind is empty, a miracle happens. Your consciousness, which was focused on th e screen of the mind, finding nothing there, turns upon itself. The circle is co mplete. It went from you up to the screen, but there is nothing there to stop it, an d it comes back to the original source. Consciousness coming back to the original source is what I call enlightenment. You have become awakened, you have open ed your eyes for the first time. Now for you there is no death, no misery, no pain; for you there is only blissfulness. And this blissfulness is not something th at you will attain after death. This blissfulness is something that happens here and now. I teach the religion of here and now. All the religions have been teaching yo u postponement. That is a very cunning trick. They have been telling you, \"After death you will get the results.\" Nobody comes back after death so you don't know whether any result happens or not. I teach you immediate experience. And if you are doing it, wherever you are doing it, I am going to be with you. "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"The Last Testament, Vol 5 Chapter #26 Chapter title: None 20 January 1986 pm in Kathmandu, Nepal [NOTE: This discourse will be in the book \"India Coming Back Home\", which has not been published, as of August 1992.] PRESS INTERVIEWS Q: ARE YOU THE BEGINNING OF A NEW RELIGION? A: I am certainly the beginning of someth ing which is far more precious than any religion can be. I am also the end of all the old religions. The old religions have not helped huma nity to progress in consciousness, in being. On the contrary they have hinder ed man's growth, his spirituality, in every possible way. The old religions became simply a facade of politics. In the name of religion, politics has reigned all over the world. One thing that is most impo rtant to understand is that truth cannot be organized. The moment you organize it, you kill it. Truth is an individual experience, and it can never become a collective phenomenon. Those who have attained the experience of it were individuals, not crowds, not mobs, not Hindus, not Mohammedans, not Christians, not Jews; but just individuals. Moses is an individual , just as Mahavira is; Gautam Buddha is an individual just as Jesus Christ is . They experience something in their aloneness, in their silence, in their inne rmost shrine of being. The church is not outside, it is within you. But the Christians are looking for the truth in a church which is outside. They are looking for truth in a collectivity, in a crowd, and it is clear to anybody who has a little bit of intelligence that in two thousand years they have not produced a single Jesus Christ again; neither have the Buddhists been able to produce in twenty-five centuries another Gautam Buddha. And it is not that people have not worked hard. People have worked tremendously hard; down the centuries millions of people have sacrificed themselves and everything they had to become enlightened. But nothing has happened; there seems to be something fundamental missing. They forgot one thing: that Gautam Buddha was not follo wing anybody, and they are following Gautam Buddha; that Jesus Christ was not following anybody, and they are following Jesus Christ. That is the point where they missed. You have to be just yourself, individual , not a carbon copy of anybody else. You have to assert your original face. Existence believes in originality, not in imitation. There are millions of Ch ristians, but not a single Christ."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"I am reminded of Friedrich Nietzsche' s statement -- he said that the first Christian and the last Christian died on the cross two thousand years ago, the first and the last. Then what are these cr owds doing? Almost half of humanity is Christian. What is this half of humanity doing if the first and the last Christian has already died two thousand years ago? They are simply deceiving themselves. The days of organized religion are finished. I declare a totally different conception. I wi ll not even call it religion because that word is associated with the old religions; I will call it only religiousness. I am the beginning of religiousness. Religion is bound to be Hindu, bound to be Mohammedan, bound to be Christian. Religiousness need not be Hindu, how can it be Hindu? How can it be Mohammedan? If love cannot be Hindu, cannot be Christ ian, if silence cannot be Jewish, then why should religiousness -- a quality, a fragrance -- have any adjective to it? Yes, I am the beginning of something new, but not the beginning of a new religion. I am the beginning of a new kind of religiousness which knows no adjectives, no boundaries; which knows on ly freedom of the spirit, silence of your being, growth of your potential; and finally the experience of godliness within yourself -- not of a God outsid e you, but a godliness overflowing from you. The old religions are just corpses, st inking; still they are immensely powerful, because the whole past has given them pr estige, authority. And nobody wants to leave power and authority. They go on manipulating humanity, exploiting human beings; they go on keeping you retarded. They don't want you to evolve, because the moment you evolve and yo u become intelligent, you will be free from the bondage which is their vested interest. Anybody who is intelligent cannot be a Hindu, cannot be a Mohammedan, cannot be a Christian, -- because all thes e religions have done so many ugly actions in the past, they have killed millions of people, burned people alive in the name of God, in the name of love. They have been simply destructive; they have not enhanced beauty, they have not cont ributed to humanity in any way. They are parasites. They have sucked you for ce nturies, they have been living on your blood. It is time that churches should be t ransformed into schools, into hospitals. Temples and mosques, synagogues and gurudwaras should be used for art galleries, music schools, for teaching pa inting and sculpture. And the priests should cease to exist. It is ugly; the pr iesthood should simply disappear from the earth, because man does not need an ybody to mediate between himself and existence. I am reminded of a great master, Lao Tzu. He used to go every day for a morning walk. One of his neighbors asked him, \"A friend has come to visit me. He is a poet, a lover of beauty, and he is also ve ry much interested in you. He wants to accompany you tomorrow morning on your morning walk.\""},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Lao Tzu said, \"I have no objection, except a simple condition: that he should not speak while we are walking in the mountains.\" The friend said, \"That's acceptable.\" All three started the next day before sunr ise. It was a beautiful calm and quiet early morning; and then the sun started ri sing above the hills, and with it the flowers started opening and the birds started singing. The poet forgot about the condition. He said, \"How beautiful!\" Jus t two words, and then he remembered. He didn't say anything more. Back home, Lao Tzu called the neighbor and said, \"Your friend is too talkative; I cannot afford to have him again. And he is stupid too. I was there, listening to the songs of the birds, seeing the sun rising, listening to the wind passing through the trees, hearing the sound of running water. No mediator is needed. What can he add by saying, 'How beautiful!'? He simply disturbed.\" Existence and you are enough. There is no need for any agent between you and existence to interpret, to say, \"How beautiful!\", to take messages from you to existence and bring messages from existence to you. That's what the priests have been doing down the ages; they have ke pt you away from reality. They have been standing between you and reality. A truly religious person does not need anybody between himself and the sunrise, between himself and the stars in the sky, between himself and the fragrance of the flower. It is all divine, you just have to be open to it. When the priesthood is dissolved, orga nized religions finished, then humanity will be one. Otherwise, they have created so many barriers between man and man. Every evening since I came here I have gone for a walk. The first day one man said, \"Osho, this is not pranam that I am doing to you; this is salaam.\" Pranam is Hindu, salaam is Mohammedan. I said to him, \"To me, both mean the same.\" The second day he said, \"I have come again.\" I said, \"That's good, but don't say what you said on the first day.\" Why create barriers? It is the same experience. A loving welcome... whether you call it pranam or whether you call it salaam, does it make any difference? But in his mind there must be great difference, that he wanted to indicate to me that he is a Mohammedan. Just to be human is enough. To be Mohammedan, to be Hindu, to be Christian is to be below yo ur humanity, is to fall from your height, is to lose your dignity. Yes, I am the beginning of something new. You can call it religiousness, but don't call it religion. Q: YOU SAY YOU ARE A BUDDHA, AND HIS TEACHING WAS BASED ON SIMPLICITY, A SIMPLE LIFE. YOURS IS BASED ON COMFORT AND LUXURY. WILL YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON THAT? "},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"A: It is a significant question, with tr emendous implications to be understood; one is that there is no difference. You will be surprised to hear it, because you don't understand the inner mechanism of transformation. Buddha was born a king. He got fed up with his palaces, with his richness, with his luxury; he became a beggar. In the middle of one night, he renounced his kingdom and went into the forest as a beggar. I was born as a poor man. I got fed up with up poverty. In the middle of one night I renounced poverty, and since then I have been living like an emperor. What is the difference? Just one differenc e is there: Buddha's renunciation was simple, my renunciation is very difficult . To renounce a kingdom luxury and is a very simple phenomenon; you just get out of the palace and into the mountains. But to renounce poverty is not so easy, otherwise you would have all renounced it. I have done the more difficult task. But the inner mechanism is the same -- a drastic change in your lifestyle helps you to become enlightened. It doesn't ma tter whether from the palace you move to the hut, or from the hut you move to the palace. A drasti c change in your lifestyle brings the revelation easily, because it uproots you from your ground, it brings you to a totally new territory. You cannot remain the same, you have to change. Obviously it seems Buddha did a great thin g, but it only seems so. I have done the greater thing. You try! -- and you will know immediately that to renounce empires is the easiest thing in the worl d. To renounce poverty is the most arduous phenomenon. But there are other aspects of it too; I am not in favor of poverty, and neither are you. It is natural that nobody should be in favor of poverty, because to be in favor of poverty means to be in favor of hunger, to be in favor of being without clothes, to be in favor of being without sh elter, to be in favor of sickness, old age, and no medicine. Nobody is in favor of poverty. But Gautam Buddha and the twenty-four Tirthankaras of the Jainas, all these twenty-five people who have impressed th is country immensely, have impressed the whole East, were born as kings. You have to understand it: Buddha was born as a king. The incarnations of Hindus, Rama and Krishna, were born as kings. You have not accepted a single poor ma n as a buddha, as a tirthankara, as an incarnation of God -- that shows your mind. You respect luxury, you respect kings. In fact, you have respected Gautam Buddha not because he was a beggar, but because he renounced his empire. Just think, if Gautam Buddha was born a poor man, and one night he had renounced his poor man's house, with no clothes, no food, the father dying without medicine. I don't think you would have ev er accepted him as a great master; you have never accepted anybody like that. Why were the twenty-four tirthankaras all kings? Is not anybody else intelligent enough to be spiritual? Is the whole world empty, with nobody to give it challenge? Do only kings have a prerogative, a monopoly?"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The reason is that these kings renounce d their kingdom, and became beggars. In your eyes, the kingdom is so valuable that it is amazing that a man would renounce something for which you have been hankering your whole life. The man is not respected for himself or his sp irituality, he is respected for the money that he has left behind. You are still coun ting money, you are still looking at the bank balance. I used to know a postmaster, a poor ma n, the only earning member of a big family. When his wife died and his childre n got married he asked me, \"I am tired and all my duties are fulfilled. I can renounce the world.\" I said, \"What have you got to renounce? How much is your bank balance?\" He said, \"Bank balance? I don't have a ba nk balance, just three hundred and sixty rupees in the post office.\" I said, \"You can renounce, but don't tell anyone that you had only three hundred and sixty rupees when you renounced; otherwise nobody is going to pay any attention to your renunciation. People will simply laugh.\" After ten years I met the man in New Delhi. He had gathered a good following. One of his disciples told me, \"My master was a great rich man; he renounced everything.\" I went to see the master. Looking at me, he felt a little nervous. I said, \"Don't be worried. I will not tell anybody that you renounced only three hundred and sixty rupees.\" But they all heard it. Since then he has lost all his following. He is very angry with me. I want to emphasize the fact that, alth ough you think that you respect Buddha because he renounced, deep down you st ill respect the empire, the kingdom, the riches -- not Buddha himself. With me the situation is totally different. I have renounced poverty. You have to look eye to eye with me. Either you re spect me, or you don't respect me. But money does not come in between. The people who have respected me are far more religious than you who have respected kings because they renounced their kingdoms. The people who have respected me, have respected me, not th e kingdom that I had renounced. I had no kingdom; their respect is direct, immedi ate. It concerns me, it has nothing to do with anything else. And moreover, I am against this whole idea of Gautam Buddha, Mahavira and other tirthankaras renouncing their king doms. Because they not only renounced their kingdoms, they raised the value of poverty, which you have never thought about -- they made poverty something spiritual, which it is not. Poverty is the source of all crime, all sick ness, all that is ugly in life. They made poverty something spiritual, and thousa nds of people became beggars with Buddha. But have you looked into the whole situation? The people who followed Buddha left be hind them crying and weeping wives, crying and weeping children, old parents. What happened to those people? The wives became prostitutes, the children became orphans, the old parents died"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"without any care and without any medicine, because the man who was the earning member had become spiritual. An d this happened to m illions of people. Who is responsible for this? I cannot forgive Buddha, or Mahavira, or other tirthankaras. They raised poverty to spirituality, convinced people, and de stroyed thousands of families, millions of people. And the people who became be ggars became a burden on the society. Because if you have renounced the world, then you don't have any right to ask for food from that same world; you don' t have any right to ask for clothes, for shelter, from that same world. This is a strange thing: you condemn the world, and the world feeds you. You renounce the world, and the world supports you. You live on it. These are the people who have reduced the East to poverty, to slavery. No, I am not in favor of poverty. And finally, I have also renounced. Bu ddha renounced this world, because this world's pleasures are momentary. Try to un derstand the subtlety of the logic: he renounced the world, this world, becaus e its pleasures are momentary. But he is renouncing it to gain another world be yond death, the pleasures of which are permanent and eternal. Look around the world into different relig ions' idea of the other world. I will give you a few instances to understand their psychology. In the heaven of Mohammedans there are rivers of wine. Here, on the earth wine has to be renounced. In paradise, where rivers of wine are available, you can drink as much as you want, swim in it, ge t drowned in it. But it's very strange: in this world wine is a sin, and in that world it is a reward. I can't see the connection. In this world the woman has to be condemne d. She is the source of sin, she is the door to hell. If you can manage to reno unce the woman you become a saint, and the saints are rewarded with beauti ful women in paradise. Not ordinary beauties, those women never grow to be more than sixteen years old. They are stuck for millions of years at the age of sixteen. They don't perspire, they are always young. In Arabian countries homosexuality has been prevalent for centuries. It is a very shocking thing that in paradise, for sain ts, young boys are also made available. Buddha, Mahavira, Mohammed, Jesus... they all renounced this world because its pleasures are momentary for a world wh ere pleasures are eternal. I renounce the world of eternal pleasures for this world, where pleasures are momentary. Who is renouncing more? I would hate a girl who has remained for millions of years stuck at age sixteen. She is a prostitute and she has been used by millions of saints. I have heard about a disciple whose mast er, whose whole teaching was celibacy, had died. After a few days the disciple al so died. Of course the first thing he looked for in paradise was his master, an d he soon found him under a beautiful tree -- which remains eternally green! He saw the master, but he was very much"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"shocked because in his lap was sitting an American Hollywood actress, Marilyn Monroe. She was very beautiful, but with out any brains, just flesh without any soul. The disciple was very shocked. The master has been teaching celibacy and here he is hugging a naked f ilm actress! But then he thou ght, \"Perhaps this is his reward! He deserves it. His whole life he was celibate; he would not allow any woman even to touch his feet; he would not see any woman. Certainly he deserves it.\" He came close, fell at the feet of the master, and said, \"My great master. You certainly deserve such a beautiful woman.\" Before the master could reply Marilyn Monroe said, \"You idiot. I am not his reward. He is my punishment.\" I have renounced that world. To me each moment is paradise, and I don't have any desire for eternal pleasure. In fact the very idea is sick. Just think, if you have anything forever you are going to get bo red -- if you have any intelligence. The woman may be very beautiful, but to have the woman eternally... just think of eternity, forever and forever, the same woma n. In no religious scripture is there any mention of divorce in paradise. Once you are caught by the woman you are caught forever. Whenever I think about the paradise that all the religions have created I simply freak out. I don't want to go to paradise. Absolutely no! It is only for idiots. I would rather go to hell, because the best and the most colorful people, the most creative people, all the great poets, all the great painters, all the great dancers, all the great sculptors, you will find there. In heaven you will find only dried up saints with no juice. It will be utte r boredom; you cannot even have a good conversation. You cannot find Byron in heaven, you cannot find Shelley, you cannot find Bertrand Russell, you cannot find Jawa harlal, you cannot find Rabindranath Tagore, you cannot find Maupassant, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Leonardo da Vinci, Dante, Socrates. You cannot find the cream of humanity there. You will find only dull, unintelligent, retarded pe ople. Their qualities are that they can fast for twenty-one days, but that does no t give intelligence. Somebody can stand for twelve years and will not sit down, but that is not a quality. Somebody lives naked, but that is nothing creative; every child is born naked, every animal lives naked. If nakedness is spiritual, then all animals will be ahead of you. I have also renounced, and my renunciation is far greater. I have renounced the world of eternal pleasures for this beau tiful world of momentary pleasures. I have renounced eternity for the moment; to me it is enough. And I call this contentment. All your saints are full of desire, whatever they say. They go on saying to you, \"Be desireless.\" But why? -- so that in p aradise all your desires can be fulfilled. But this is not desirelessness; it is motivate d. I say to you, ther e is no need to be desireless. Live each desire with as mu ch awareness as possible, and you will feel a tremendous contentment arising in you. Each moment it goes on growing --"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"you feel fulfilled, here and now. I do not promise you anything after death, because that is a very cunning device of your priests, your prophets, your messiahs. I want you to experience something here. I am a realist, I am not a dreamer. And my experience is that if you can live each moment with contentment, awareness, s ilence, joyfulness, this very earth becomes paradise; there is no other p aradise anywhere. All those paradises are invented only for idiots to be exploited. I have renounced everything hocus pocus. Q: NO GOVERNMENT CAN TOLERATE YOU, NO POLITICIAN WILL ALLOW YOU TO ENTER, NO PERSON ON A CHAIR WILL ALLOW YOU TO MAKE A DENT INTO THEIR POSITI ON. NO CHURCH, NO RELIGION, WILL FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO THEM AND NINETY- EIGHT PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION CANNOT ACCEPT YOU. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DEPROGRAM THIS GREAT HUMANITY AND CHANGE THE FACE OF THIS EARTH? A: It is true, no government will allow me to do what I want to do. No religion will ever come to support me. Nobody who has a vested interest is going to be friendly towards me. Nobody who is in po wer has the guts even to listen to me. I count this as a great victory, because nobody before me has threatened so many people around the world. Their very fear is a proof of my truth. If I were false there would be no need for them to be afraid of me. They could have exposed, they could have argued, they have all th e means. They could have told the whole world that I am wrong. Their fear is th at I am not wrong. And truth knows no defeat; it can be delayed, but it cannot be defeated. You say ninety-eight percent of the people are in the grip of politicians, of priests, how are you going to deprogram and change the whole humanity? You have forgotten the remaining two perc ent. You have forgotten yourself. When Karl Marx started thinking of communism, he was alone; now half the world is communist. Two percent of the people is enough. The ninety-eight percent look like a big majority, but the qu estion is not going to be decided by a majority. The question is to be decided by who is true. Truth has its own ways, very subtle ways. Two percent of the people is a big phenomenon. If I can get to two percent of the people's hearts it is enough. Because those ninety-eight percent of peop le who are not standing with truth, they are standing with something which is already dead. They are standing with things which are lies, they are standing with things which are superstitious. Just two percent of the intelligent youth around the world is enough, and we can make the whole world aflame. I don' t see that there is any problem. I have been talking to all the races, to a ll the nations, to different cultures, and I have always found a tremendous rapport between me and the intelligent people -- a deep synchronicity everywhere aroun d the earth. Only the stupid are not"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"with me, I don't want them to be with me . I want only the intelligent people; and they are with me. They can understand, and they are the people who change the world. The vast majority is never active, it is dormant. Only the small minority, the arrowhead... once the small, intelligent minority gets the idea and starts moving, the majo rity follows automatically. The majority has always followed; if it has followed people who have no truth in them, why cannot it follow people who have some vision of truth? But don't be worried about that. I am not interested in governments, I am not interested in popes and Shankaracharyas and -- Ayatollah Khomeiniacs. I am interested in the young people. Their age does not matter, maybe they are sixty or seventy. All that is needed is a fres h intelligence. And if they are with me, we are going to change this world. Nobody can prevent us. I have not come across a single argument against me. Against me there are only gossips, and gossips cannot do anything, they are simply indica tions of failure. The majority is having a nervous breakdown. Just the other day, while I was coming ba ck from my walk one man shouted very angrily, \"What is the purpose of your coming to Nepal?\" I looked at the man. I wanted to ask him, \"What is the purpose of your being in Nepal? What is the purpose of your bein g born?\" My purpose is clear -- I corrupt people. Whosoever has guts, I corrupt him. That has always been the purpose of the category of people I belong to. Socrates was corrupting people, Heraclitus was corrupting people, Pythagoras was co rrupting people. I am simply doing the same. But it is good to be corrupted in the hands of Socrates because that will bring a rebellion in you, a revolution in you. I don't want to have anything from you. I simply want to give you something that I have got. Q: WHAT IS WOMAN? AND FINALLY, A JOKE FOR NEPALESE PEOPLE. A: Before I answer you, there have been a few more questions which I rejected because they were very simple. But I don't want anybody to feel that his question is rejected. I am very sensitive about it; so first I will give the answer to those questions which I have rejected. One was, that I am a self-appointed bu ddha but still I could not see what was going on behind my back in the co mmune, and the commune was destroyed. The question arises in many people's minds, because you have a certain expectation of a buddha, of an awakened man. You think that an awakened man has to know everything that goes on arou nd him. If you think that then you are not aware of the history of the awakened people. Gautam Buddha was betrayed by his ow n cousin-brother, Devadatta. He was preparing to betray him for years, and he convinced five hundred people to go with him and leave Buddha, becaus e Buddha was not really awakened;"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Devadatta was the real awakened one. What do you say? Gautam Buddha was not aware of this, therefore he was not enlightened? But your expectations are without fo undation. Gautam Buddha was given poison in food, and he ate it. Is that not enough for you to deny that Gautam Buddha was enlightened? He could not see th at the food just in front of him is poisoned. Mahavira is described by the Jainas as ha ving all the qualities of God. He is omnipotent, all-powerful; omniscient, all-seeing, past, present, and future; omnipresent, past, present, future. Bu t his own son-in-law betrayed him and prepared the ground to take thousands of his followers away with him, convincing them that he was the righ t tirthankara, Mahavira was not. What do you say about it? Mahavira is omniscient, that's what Jaina scriptures say; because of these scriptures you go on carry ing absurd expectations that he sees everything, not only in the present, bu t the whole eternal past and the whole eternal future. But it has been known th at one day he was standing before a house begging for his food and the house wa s empty. The people had left just the day before. Now this man cannot know whet her the house is occupied or empty? He knows all past, present, and future, and he does not know that the house in front of him is empty? In fact your definitions are false. En lightenment simply means that one knows oneself. It does not mean that he becomes omnipotent, that he becomes omniscient, that he starts seeing past, pr esent and future. It simply means that he is no more ignorant of his own self; nothing else. So please drop unnecessary expectations . I am a simple human being, who has come to know himself and is totally blissful, immensely contented, with his knowing. There is no question left. You ar e all full of questions, I am just empty of any questions. I am not even full of an swers. It is your question that creates my answer, otherwise I am empty. And I don't claim any miraculous powers. But you go on projecting ideas of your own which have nothing to do with me. Now you say that I am a self-appointed buddha, as if you know what you are writing. Let us go into it a little deeper. Do you want a buddha to be appointed by a committee? Naturally the committee will be of unenlightened people. The blin d people will be appointing a man who has eyes. They will certify that, yes, he has eyes. Do you want a buddha to be chosen by a majority? Is it a political thin g? The majority is blind, the minority is blind. How can they choose, how can they select? Do you want a buddha to be nominated by some king or some queen ? But what do they understand about enlightenment? The `awakened one' is not a title that can be conferred by a government, it is not an award like the Nobel prize that a committee can decide. It is not a degree that a university can gi ve. Then how does it happen? It is not self-appointment either, it is self-revelation. In your experience there are things whic h may help you to understand. You have a headache; now only you know it, even your doctor cannot know whether you"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"have it or not. Is it a self-appointed he adache, or has a committee decided, or has there been an election? You know when you have a headache. The moment one becomes full of light and full of blissfulness one knows -- it is self-revelation. So please don't use ugly words, because you are not using ugly words only to me. You are using those ug ly words to all the awakened ones of the whole history. Q: WHY DO YOU NOT LAUGH HERE WI TH US? YOU USED TO LAUGH IN YOUR COMMUNE IN AMERICA. A: It is relevant. The commune in America consisted only of my sannyasins, who were deep in meditation, who had no ques tions to ask, who simply enjoyed my being with them. There was a certain harmony between my heart and their hearts. So it used to happen that when they would laugh, I would laugh; when they would dance, I would dance. You are still a little distant. If you want me to laugh with you, you will have to come a little closer, become a little more open, a little more receptive. If you want me to dance with you, you will have to start dancing. I am available, it all depends on you. It is a question of communion. Right now I can only talk to you intellectually, not he art-to-heart, not being to being. It takes time to attain to that growth. It took four years of five thousand sannyasins living with me for all distance to disa ppear, for me to become completely one with them. Then their laughter was my laughter, and their dance was my dance. Don't feel sad; you can manage it. Now, the question that has been waitin g: what is a woman? It is a simple question, yet great implications are in it . A woman is a man with a womb. That's exactly the meaning of the word woman: womb plus man. She has more than man has, she is richer than man is. She can produce life; man cannot. And because of this, because she is capable of producing the greatest thing, life, man has always felt an inferiority complex. To avoid that inferiority complex he has tried in every way to destroy the dignity of woman, to cut her wings, to engage her in the house, not to give her an education, not to allow her financial independence, not to let her move in the society freely, not to allow her to have friends of her own. These were the strategie s to reduce her into a slave so that man can forget his inferiority complex. He has done a few more things with himsel f. He has tried to create paintings, he has tried to create literature, he has tried to create great pieces of art, dances, poetry, just in order to feel that he is a creator. At the same time he reduced the woma n's freedom, destroyed her humanity in every possible way, in smaller ways. I was a professor in a university. One of my friends, a professor in the same department, said to me, \"I am in trouble. I had never thought about it before, but now it has become tremendously importan t. I have fallen in love with a woman"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"who is taller than me. Now she insists on marriage, and I don't want to become a laughing stock, because she is really too tall, almost one foot taller than me.\" The man was very short, and he said, \"Even now when we are not married, whenever we go anywhere together somebody asks her, `Is he your son?' And that hurts me very much.\" No man wants his wife to be taller than him. It is time to understand clearly that ther e is no question of inferiority. Man is man, woman is woman; man has immense capacities which woman does not have. The woman's interest is very local, limited. Even the wife of Albert Einstein is not interested in his far away galaxies and stars. She gets fed up with him. She said, \"Sometimes you should forget all about these stars. What have we to do with them? The real thing is that our neighbor's wife is having an affair with somebody else, and you are talking all ki nds of nonsense. Talk something juicy.\" The woman is very earthbound, man ha s strange interests, adventures. The woman is not interested in that. So th ere is no question of comparison. The woman creates life. But just life is not the real thing. Man can create consciousness. Very few women have been interested in creating consciousness. Life is a lower thing. Consciousness is a higher thing. The woman is capable of creating consciousness, but very few women seem to be interested. All the meditation techniques have been discovered by men, all the religious experiences have been discovered by men. All the art, all science, all poetry, even books on cookery are written by men. The best cooks in the greatest hotels of the world are men. Don't feel inferior; and neither does the woman have to feel inferior. She creates life; without her there would be no life and without life there is no possibility of awakenin g, of superconsciousness, of the ultimate experience of life. All the buddhas are born of a wo man, they are indebted to the woman. Both have their own uniqueness, there is no need to compare. If we accept each other in our uniqueness, men and women can become friends. Up to now they have been intimate enemies. I would like them to be intimate friends.

The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW BY ENZO BIAGI, AKA SARJANO, CORRIERE DELLA SERA, ITALY Q: BHAGWAN, YOU NEVER STOP SURPRISING US. HOW COME YOU DECIDE TO GO FOR A WORLD TOUR? A: It is very simple. People don't live in the moment. They pl an for the future. Hence they are surprised. I live in the moment. I don't know about the next moment. So it is not only I surprise others; I surprise myself t oo. I keep the coming moment open, unplanned. I don't know what is going to happen. This way, life is more juicier, more adventurous, more spontaneous. This way one is always young, never gets old. This way even death is a surprise, not a shock. One enters into death too with great joy, to discover something; and if the whole life has been a moment to moment journey, discovery, the death cannot be otherwise. Because the death is not the end of life, it is the very culmination, the very peak, the height. Q: WHEN CAN WE EXPECT YOU IN ITALY? A: Any time. Perhaps I may start my world tour from Italy. Q: DO YOU EXPECT TO BE WELCOME IN ITALY (INAUDIBLE) THE POPE AND THE VATICAN? A: Certainly. In fact because of them, I am going to be welcome in Italy. The Pope and his company have exploited Italy for centuries and I don't think Italians are dumb or retarded. They can see the parasite in the Pope. I am going to be welcomed by the intelligentsia of Italy, by the youth of Italy, and by all those who are bored and fed up with the rotten Christianity that the Pope represents. I have always felt Italy to be my country, more than any other country. It does not belong to the Pope. It belongs to me. In fact, Jesus Christ was crucified by the Italians. They should do the same with the Pope."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"It is not a coincidence that Italy became the citadel and the center of Christianity, because Jesus Christ was crucified by the Italian governor general, Pontius Pilate in Judea. It created guilt in Italy. And ou t of the guilt, Christians have exploited Italy. They destroyed the Roman empire, they destroyed the whole glory of the country. They destroyed its fundamental s of philosophy. The Roman philosophy of life is very close to me, because it was the philosophy of a pagan. It was not devoted to a god, a fiction. It was not de voted to the other worl d, another fiction. It was basically devoted to man, his lif e, his joys. It was a very earthly and pragmatic world view. That's why I say, Italy belongs to me, not to the Pope. Q: THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY STATED THAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU IN THEIR COUNTR Y. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SO AFRAID OF A MAN THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE? A: Every government is afraid. And every organized religion is afraid, for the simple reason that I am against all ki nds of establishments. I am against the whole past of humanity. I want to begi n the history anew, fresh. The past has been ugly, and the responsibility goes to the politicians and the priests. And I don't want it to be repeated in the future again. Naturally, I am the greatest enemy of esta blishment today in the world. They are afraid because they don't have any argum ent against me. Whatever I am saying is so true that they cannot deny it. They are aware that their intelligentsia, their young people, are going to understand. Germany particularly is afraid. The reason is Adolf Hitler, and what he has done to the world. He is the politician par excellence. With Adolf Hitler, the Ge rmany is completely disappointed in the politicians, and the politicians know it perfectly well, that the German youth is seeking and searching some substitute fo r them. They know also that even far away countries, wherever I have been, the German youth has been reaching to me. Their concern is that if I come to their country, I can change the whole mind of the youth, which is the future. I can manage very easily to put their youth against themselves. They can see that even withou t going to Germany, I have the largest number of sannyasins in Germ any, and I have not gone there. Once I am there, it will be difficult to find a young man who is not a sannyasin. So those cowards politicians are trying to prevent me from entering Germany. They don't understand me. This helps my work. This makes their weakness clear, and brings it in the open and loudly. As I have reached Europe, my sannyasins in Germany are going to sue the government in the courts because it is absolutely illegal to prevent me. I have never been in the country. Naturally I have not committed any crime in the country. They don't have anything agains t me. And to prevent a person who has not done anything in your country, he ha s not even entered in your country, is simply absurd."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The reason that they have given why they don't want me to enter in the country is so lousy, that is makes one laugh. They have said that they don't want me to enter Germany because I am not going to be a help to their country. Then they should make a general law that only people who are certain to be a help to their country can enter Germany. And before I have entered, how they have managed to find it, that I cannot be a help to their country. I have thousands of sannyasins there, I am a help to them, they are a part of their country, they want me to be in the country. They cannot be deprived. They have been asking me, should they go into the courts against the government? I have been telling, \"Just wa it, let me be in Europe; then sue the government. With me in the Europe it wi ll be a totally different scene, then all the sannyasins of the Europe will be of trem endous help to you; and you will feel stronger, and the government will feel weaker. \"We are going to defeat them, and I am going to enter Germany. Whether they change their law or not, it does not matter.\" Q: SEVERAL OF YOUR SANNYASIN FRIENDS; AND THEY SUGGEST THAT YOU COME TO THE BORDER OF GERMAN AND AUSTRIA, AND THEY WILL COME IN THEIR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS TO VISIT YOU AND DANCE ON THE BORDER, SO THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE EXPOSED ALL OVER THE WORLD. WOULD YOU LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN? A: I am going to do many things. That is one of the things. I am going to call them to the border, be with me, declare to the world news media that if our master cannot to Germany, Germany can come to our master. And I have seen the American jails. I would love to see the German jails too. If they don't change the law, still I am going to enter Germany and show to the world that how your so-called democratic governments are beha ving with absolutely innocent people. Q: YOU HAVE ATTACKED ALL TH E RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD, POLITICIANS, THE PHILOSOPHERS, THE SCIENTISTS, THE GURUS, INTELLECTUALS, THE POPE, MOTHER TERESA, EVEN GANDHI, THE MEDIA, THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, AND THE WHOLE WORLD AS SUCH. IS THERE EVERYTHING WRONG IN THIS WORLD? IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN SAVE? A: It looks a little bit strange, when I say everything in one stroke. It looks strange because you don't understand that all things in the wo rld are part in an organic unity. They are not separate things , so it may be possible that if you take a fragment, it will look good and worth sa ving. But it is dangerous. It has been part of a poisonous unity. To save it can pollute your future."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"For example, if the politicians have been corrupt, if the priests have been corrupt, if the educationists have been corrupt , who creates your intellectuals? The educational system, the theologians, the philosophers, the political ideologies, they are all part of your intellectuals. Their minds are conditioned by them. You cannot save the intellectuals. Saving them you will be saving much of the priests, much of the politicians, much of the educationists. Even your paintings, howsoever beauti ful, are influenced. Your sculpture is influenced. You can see in the middle ages even your greatest artists, people like Michaelangelo have worked their whole life in the churches and cathedrals, just painting the stories which are all fictitious about Jesus. Your sculptors have been in the hands of the priests, making st atues of Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira to be worshipped. Your musicians have been p art of the course(*) of the universe. Your philosophers have been part of theology, part of the courts; none of your philosophers have the guts to expose the religions and their patent lies. Even men like Kant, Hegel, giants in the world of philosophy are completely silent about Christianity. Whom they are cheating? They are showing their cowardliness, and they are trying to propound a philosophy that somehow supports the religion, the vested intere sts, the establishments. They are not revolutionaries. Everything is entangled with everything el se. Society is an organic unity. And when you want to clean the whole huma n race, the whole human consciousness it is better to drop it all and begin abso lutely fresh, rather than choosing pieces, which may look good as pieces, but they have been part of a poisonous system for centuries, and they carry the poison. They may destroy your whole project for the future. And what is the need? We can create a new man, we can create a new art, and we can create new architecture. If we can create a n ew religiousness, we can create new philosophical understanding of life, we can create new art, new poetry, new paintings. Why not get rid of the old, so that you are not chained with the dead. It is something like your father dies, yo ur mother dies. Your father had beautiful eyes. They were real, alive, in the organic unity of your father's body. But if you dig those eyes out, and save them... (Tape side B, no overlap) ... that they were rebels, revolutionaries, that they were against the past. No. They were trying to take help from the past so that they can have the authority of the past. They wanted to be authoritative. The desire to belong to the past is the desire to be authoritative. I don't want to be authoritative. And there is a difference to be remembered between these two words, authoritative and authority. The authoritative person is al ways deriving his authority from ancient scriptures, traditions, prophets, and all that. He is not certain about his own experience to be enough of an auth ority. He needs props and supports. My experience is enough unto itself. It is a authority in itse lf, without anybody's support. In fact, their desire to belong to a tradition, their effort, the way Jesus is"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"trying continuously to persuade that \"I am your messiah.\" The way Buddha is trying to persuade the Jainas that I am your twenty-fourth Tirthankara is pitiable. That simply shows these people , don't rely on their own experience; their experience is not authoritative. They need some extra authority, some certificates from tradition, some sanctions from holy scriptures. It happened, one of very impressive man in this century in India was Ramateertha. He impressed America immensely, Europe and other countries. Naturally he thought, that when he co mes to India he is bound to influence millions of people. When he could influe nce people of other traditions, other religions, it is a natural corollary that he is going to influence the Hindus to whom he belongs. So he reached first to Varanasi, which is the center of Hindu wisdom, and thought to be the oldest city in the worl d. Perhaps it is. There is not a single scripture in India which does not mentio n Varanasi; the oldest of the scriptures still mentions Varanasi. Many cities have arisen and disappeared; Varanasi has a certain permanency. And it is the most sa cred city in India, the citadel of Hindus; Hindu scholars, pundits, priests. So Ramateertha reached Varanasi, because if Varanasi recognizes him as a saint, then the whole India is bound to recognize him. But to me, this is the poverty of the man; to seek recognition from others. You don't have your own experience certainly. Otherwise that experience authenticates you. There is nothing else that you need. It is enough, more than enough. It is only one who is empty within who wants some sanction from outside. He called the meeting of the wise of Varanasi. He stood up to speak. He had not spoken more than few minutes, and a Hindu scholar, a Brahmin pundit, stood up. And he said, \"Stop all this nonsense. First answer me one question: Do you know Sanskrit? Because listening these f ew minutes to you, it seems you don't know it. You are quoting from Persian, fr om Urdu, but you are not quoting from Sanskrit. And your pronunciation is not that of a Sanskrit scholar.\" And it was true; he was born in Punjab, near Lahore, which is now in Pakistan. His mother tongue was Urdu, not Hindi. He was educated through the medium of Urdu, and he was a scholar of Persi an, Arabic. That was the atmosphere around Rapal(*). It was a Mohammedan area. He has read even VEDAS and UPANISHADS through the translations in Per sian. He had no idea of Sanskrit or Hindi. He had to accept it. And the Brah min pundit said, \"Then first go and learn Sanskrit; and don't destroy our time and don't waste our energy. Without knowing Sanskrit, you cannot be accepted by the Council of the Wise as a saint.\" This was very shattering experience, very shocking, but it can be shattering and shocking only to a person who has no in ner light of his own. And, you will be surprised, he started learning Sanskrit. Wh at a poverty! It is shameful. And he was so much shattered that the Council of the Wise, wh ich is the topmost council of the Hindus, has rejected him that he dr op his orange clothes. He has no right."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"He started using white clothes 'til he be comes a scholar in Sanskrit as if to become wise, to become enlightened, Sanskr it is a necessity. That is absolutely stupid. Buddha never knew any Sanskrit. He never spoke Sanskrit. Mahavira never knew Sanskrit, he never spoke Sanskrit. He went to the Himalayas, learning Sanskrit, and one day he saw his wife coming up the hill. He was married befo re he renounced the world and became a sannyasin. The poor woman had accepted, as it has been the case for millions of women in India, with grace and gratitude, with joy although it is going to be a very difficult life for her because he had no t left anything, he was not a rich man. He was just a lecturer in a college. He came from a poor family, he was a very intelligent boy, so he was getting sch olarships, and that's how he finally managed to top the university in math ematics, and became a lecturer of mathematics. But he had not much to leave behind. The poor woman was happy that her husband has become a holy man. In pain, in anguish, but still she was not angry. Hearing that he has come back after years of traveling, she sold the few ornaments that she had for the ticket from Punjab to the Himalayas, just to see him. There was no other expectation. One of his disciples, Sadha(*) Bonsingh(*), was sitting with Ramateertha as he saw the wife coming. Ramateertha told the Bonsingh(*) that \"Close the doors, and don't allow that woman in.\" Bonsingh(*) was a very intelligent man, and he had written few very beautiful articles, poetry. He said, \"This is strange, because I have seen you meeting hundreds of women in the West. I have seen you shaking hands with people, which is against Hindu spirituality. This act seems to be ugly. The poor woman you have left. Somehow she is managing by cleaning people's houses, their toilets. And she has come to see you; and you are closing the doors. What is the fear? Do you still believe that she is yo ur wife? Then you have not renounced. What is the distinction between another woman and this woman? So either you allow her, and let her see you; or I am goin g to leave you. It has been difficult for me to accept that you are learning Sans krit just to get a sanction from those idiots, none of whom is enlightened. But I have been keeping silent. But this is too much.\" (GAP IN THE TAPE) ... being a holy man by the Pope. Now th e Pope himself has no enlightenment. He is not an awakened being. What meaning his sanction carries? And the person who starts believing himself as sain t because a sanction has been given by the Pope is also not self-realized. Othe rwise he will not wait for the sanction. I don't have any sanction; I am nobody's saint. No tradition supports me. No orthodoxy stands behind me, no holy scr ipture can certify me. But I don't need. Even if they want to, I will reject.

SO IF YOU CAN BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT IS YOUR VISION OF THIS SYNCHRONICITY, THIS UNITY THAT WE TRYING TO CREATE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT WE CALL HUMAN. A: The old man was schizophrenic. He wa s split between the body and the soul, between matter and spirit, between this world and that world. And he was told by the old religions, the old prophets, the messiahs, the saviours, to choose. If he chooses the body, he chooses the matter, he chooses this world, he is a materialist, he is a Zorba; and the Zo rba was condemned by all the religions around the world, without exception. If he chooses the spirit, he chooses the other world, he chooses God. Then he is a spiritual being. Then he is a saint. But in either case, he will be in anguish, he will be in suffering, because both are intrinsic parts of his being, and he is being cut into two. So whatever he chooses, Zorba or Buddha, he will remain half. And the half can never be totally fulfilled. The half will remain always a wound because the other half is missing. So the Zorba is missing ; he becomes almost an animal, loses all dignity. And that hurts. The buddha is missing; he becomes almost a god, but he loses contact with reality. He starts living in a dream, in fantasies. He has lost his roots. Now his flowers cannot be real on es; they can only be plastic. So all buddhas have plastic flowers, and certai nly plastic flowers can't have fragrance and can't have life. The Zorba remains only the roots; and the roots are ugly, and the roots live underground in the darkness of the soil. Th ey can't even see the light of the sun, the stars of the night. They live like th ieves in darkness, hiding themselves, hiding their ugliness. This has been the history of the past men. I can say with absolute certainty that the past histor y of man is hysterical; it is sick. (Tape side C) The new man accepts the whole man. It do es not divide. It teaches an organic unity. Its fundamental philosophy is that you are one whole, not body and soul, not this world and that world. Your body is only the visible part of your soul. Your soul is only the invisible part of your body. This world contains that world within it. Just you have to go deep into it. In each experience, if you are intense and total, you will find within this world that world too. This contains that. They are not separate. There is no guilt, there is no sin. Yes, you can commit mistakes, which is absolutely human. And you commit mistakes because you are not aware. I say to you, you are allowed to commit mistakes, but don't repeat the same mistake again and again. That means unawareness. When you commit a mistake for the first time, it is perfectly okay,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"because you have never committed it before, so how you can be aware of it. So it is a good learning. Learn something out of the mistake. And be aware that it is not repeated. So commit as many mistakes as you can. But they have to be always new, so you go on learning and you go on growing in awareness. So all the rituals of religions, and all their prayers and all their mantras and chantings, are reduced to a simple meth od: awareness. All their sins are reduced only to mistakes. The original meaning of the word sin is good. It means forgetfulness. So don't commit the same mistake again, otherwise it becomes a sin; it becomes a forgetfulness. But I woul d not like to use the word sin, because it has become so much associated with gu ilt, and guilt is the heaviest load on humanity. To take it away, we can make peop le so light that they can almost fly. The new man will not have any guilt. The new man will not have any split. The new man will have only one religion; th at is awareness. The new man will have only one world, this world. Because that world is hidden behind it. This world is like a circumference, and that world is the center. And I call the whole man the holy man; then he becomes Zorba the Buddha. Then the whole life, with its whole spectrum, all the colors of the rainbow, you can live without any fear, without any guil t. You can dance like a Zorba, you can meditate like a Buddha, and I don't see th ere is any contradiction. In fact, if you have danced totally, deeply, so deeply that the dancer disa ppears in the dance, that is the time to start meditation. And when you have meditated, and yo u are full of silence and peace and blissfulness, so much so that not that you are blissfulness, but you can bless the whole world, that is the moment to danc e. Your dance then will be a showering of blessings to the whole world. I don't see any contradiction. That's why I say, drop the old completely. It was sick, it was schizophrenic. And let us have a new man; organic, healthy, whole. And with the new man comes a new worl d into existence, which will not be divided by politics into nations; which will not be divided by religions into different sections, fighting, murderin g, killing, burning living people. We can make this earth a paradise, if we are together. If ther e are no nations and no churches, no religions, nothing dividi ng man from man. Then we will have so much energy available which is being invo lved into wars, into fighting, into organizing; that this whole earth can blo ssom into new flowers of consciousness. Okay, Sarjano.

It is for reference use only.] INTERVIEW WITH AMAREESH, \"PSYCHOLOGY TODAY\" Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT CAN YOU RECOMMEND TO WESTERN PSYCHOLOGISTS, WHO WANTS TO BE MORE THAN AN AGENT OF EGOIST IDEOLOGIES? A: They will have to find a totally new or ientation. As the We stern psychology is, it is based on the ego. The whole effo rt is how to enhance the ego of the individual, how to make it more solid, mo re assertive, more ***, more ambitious. And the whole problem is that the Wester n psychology does not accept anything beyond mind. It divides man into body and mind. Body is mortal, so is mind. Between these two there is nothing which is eternal and can be made a base for a new psychology. Western psychology goes on sharpening th e mind, making it more efficient, more successful, but that means you have to depend on a certain kind of self, otherwise there is no binding between th is mind and the body. They will fall apart. They need to be glued together an d that glue is the ego. Unless Western psychology rises above the mind and finds a self which is not an invention, but it is ***. It is difficult for it to get rid of the eg o; something is needed as a center. Either you have a real center or you have to create a substitute center which will be false, but for the moment it will do. An d once you have accepted a false center that is the ego, you are solving one pr oblem, giving man a center, giving his body and soul a bridge. But you are on th e other hand creating thousand and one problems. Then you have to go on hiding th e fact that the ego is false, because if the man comes to know that the ego is false, he will simply fall apart. He won't have a center, he won't have any roots, he won't have any being. To keep the ego continuously alive, apparently at least, real, a strange mechanism has to be used. It is just like paddling a bicycle. If you want to bicycle to remain mobile, you have to continuously go on peddling. If you stop peddling, it is not only going to stop the bicycle from moving, it will make the bicycle fall immediately because it has on ly two wheels. Moving, it is possible that they can support you. The whole tric k is then the movement. It is a subtle trick. By the time the cycle is at the po int A and is going to fall, you have moved"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"it to the point B. By the time it is going to fall at the point B you have moved it at the point C. By the time it is going to fa ll at the point C you have pedaled it at the point D. This is the strategy; otherwise it will fall at any point, A,B,C, just a slow down. Just don't pedal. Let it remain at one point just for f ew seconds and it will fall. The same strategy is needed for the ego. You have to go on and on towards new ambitions, from A to B, from B to C, from C to D. You cannot stop being ambitious. The moment you stop bein g ambitious, suddenly your whole structure will fall apart. You won't have any center, you won't have anything that you can call \"I\". And in that state, except madness, nothing else is possible. So the Western psychology has to teach ambition, make the ambition the very nourishment of your I, your ego and the ambition has to be a constant process which stops nowhere till you die. It starts by the moment the child starts understanding language and it goes on and on up to the last breath. It is a very strange game. To keep anything false, gi ving you the appearance of the real, you cannot stop the process and ha ve a look at it. You can look at it only in the process. Then, it looks perfectly there. Gautam Buddha has an analogy. He coul d not have used bicycle because there were no bicycles. He uses the analogy that you are having a lighted torch in your hand and you move your hand round an d round. That gives an illusion of a round circle of fire which does not exist, but it appears to exist. But you have to move fast. You can't give gaps. You can't move from a to b so slowly that the person can see that there is only a lighted torch, there is no circle. He should not see the gaps. There are gaps: when yo u are moving, howsoever fast you are moving, there are gap. But our eyes have a certain capacity; they cannot see the gaps if it is moving fast enough. The fire circle is the ego according to Gautam Buddha. You can watch it only in movement. In movement it exists, that's why we have to goad the child, \"Come first into the class. Be at the top of yo ur university.\" We have to goad everybody from every side -- the father, the mother, the relatives, and th en one day the wife and the children. Even children are goad ing their father that,\"Neighbors are having new cars and you are still having five year old model. It is shameful. We feel embarrassed. You are not a successful man. What are you doing? Can't you earn enough to have a new model every ye ar?\" The wife is continuously goading; she needs new clothes, new diamonds, new ornaments, because neighbors are having it, and it is a question of prestige -- your prestige! I used to stay with one of my friends in Calcutta. He was a simple man, using very simple clothes, simple life, but his wife was loaded with all kinds of precious stones. And they both used to go with me to the meetings where I was speaking. I asked him that \"This is strange: you live like a poor man, your wife is carrying so much load....\" He said, \"She is my showcase. She is my prestige. I don't need to carry that load: she carries it for me. It is enough that people know she is my wife. All those diamonds and all those rubies and emeralds she cannot"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"earn. They are my gifts. I can afford to be simple without being poor; just I have to keep my wife loaded continuously. She is the most loaded woman in the whole Calcutta and everybody knows she is my wife -- that's enough. She is my showcase, my advertisement, my success, my bank account -- everything she is. I need not.\" From the childhood to the old age you are being continuous ly harassed that \"Keep on moving, more and more.\" The reas on is very basic. The people may not know why it is happening. The reason is very basic, because your ego will fall at any moment if you stop. You cannot stop until your last breath. Then nobody cares: you are dead! If your ego falls it is not a problem. But while you are alive if your ego falls, it is going to create problems. When a person goes bankrupt, why he commits suicide? Was his life only his bank account? If he has gone bankrupt that do es not mean that life has to be finished. Any failure and you immediately think of committing suicide. Students fail in examinations and immediate idea is to commit suicide. Why? Because the ego has fallen; now they don't have anything to support them, anything to call their center. They have lost their center, now th ey are an empty circumference. It is so empty that it is better to end the life rather than to carry this emptiness. This is a known fact that people at the peak of their success feel utterly bored, utterly deceived by life itself. They ha d never thought that on the way. On the way everything looked beautiful, but by the time they have reached the end of the ladder suddenly they have to stop because there is nowhere else to go. They have reached to the end of the ladder befo re their death. The ego disappears. It is only in the process. While they were goin g from one rung to another rung, it was there. But when they have reached to th e last rung, it is just not there, and suddenly a realization: that their whole life they had been working for something which has never existed in the first plac e, that they had been deceived by everyone, that the whole educational system has been a deception, that even the parents who pretended to love them did not love enough. Nobody was there in their life who coul d have told them the truth and now wasting their whole life, rising on this ladder, they find at a point from where there is nowhere to go. Suddenly, the wh eel of fire has disappeared, they are disillusioned. All successful people if they are intelligent, di e disillusioned. Only mediocre people can avoid disillusionme nt, for two reasons: because they are mediocre they cannot reach to the very end of the ladder -- the competition is tough and they don't have the intelligence to make it. Secondly , even if they can make it, they are not intelligent enough to see that they have lost their center. The western psychology had to fall upon the ego. In fact, whenever they feel that somebody is psychologically sick, their di agnosis is that his ego is not strong, that he needs some more strengthening of the ego, more assertiveness, more aggressiveness, that he is too humble, that he is too simple, that he is not making his way enough competitively, that he allo ws others to pass ahead of him, that he"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"does not prevent him, that he does not pu ll the legs of others and reach ahead of them. That his ego is weak, hi s ego should be strengthened. Because of the woman's liberation move ment, the women started going to the psychoanalysts and they had more time al so to afford. The husbands had to do their job, earn the money; the wife had all the time in the world. And psychoanalysis is in the fashion.... As the women in the West started going to psychoanalysts, the liberation movement has taken a very egoistic turn. It had to, because psychoanalysis goes on teaching to them that \"You have been exploited down the ages because you have weak eg os. Man has never allowed you to have a strong will, strong ego, aggressive, asse rtive. You have been told that to be aggressive and assertive is unwomanly. To be humble is to be graceful. You have been told things which go against st rengthening the ego and that is your downfall, down the ages. And that is yo ur basic sickness. The only way to get out of this sickness is to assert. Do whatever the man is doing. If the man are smoking cigarettes, you have to smoke cigarettes. Don't think that it is unwomanly.\" Now in the East, no woman of higher clas ses can even think of smoking. It just looks ugly. It just does not fit. And ce rtainly the eastern woman has more grace. And grace has a beauty of its own. The western woman may have a beautiful face, but it is harsh. It is not graceful. It is hard. And this has been continuously hammered into her mind that \"This is the way to fight. She has to be just like the man: she has to learn Aikido and she has to learn Judo, she has to learn Jujitsu , she has to learn Yoga. She has to be capable of fighting on the same ground as man. She should not be befooled by man's teachings of humbleness and grac e and beauty and calmness, equilibrium, tolerance, patience. She should forget all th ose words; they are the causes of their slavery. And the woman has agreed. That has not made her free. That has simple made her unwomanly. That has turned her natural sexuality into a perversion, because if man is the enemy, then how yo u can fall in love with man? That is going to be a contradiction. It is better to be lesbians; you love another woman of your own kind. And that's what the wo man's liberation movement has turned into: lesbianism. And the whole thing is that western psychology has chosen -- rather than discovering the real center -- a cheaper su bstitute: a false ego. It has destroyed man, because it has went into man's mind as ambition. There is no other way for the ego to keep alive. It has destroyed man, because it has went into man's mind as ambition. There is no other way for the ego to keep alive. It has destroyed the woman of all her beauties, of all her unique qualities. In the name of freedom it has not given freedom. It has simply degraded her whole being. It has not raised her consciousness. It is really a laughi ng thing that the wo men who are in the liberation movement have conscious-raising sessions. They don't know anything about consciousness and their consci ousness-raising sessions are really consciousness-degrading sessions."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Their consciousness means how to be ag ainst men, how to be equal in every field. If man uses dirty words, vulgar words, then women have to use the same dirty and vulgar words -- that is equality. I wonder, sooner or later, they are going to pissing standing, because con sciousness-raising the cost. Their whole movement has turned into utter stupid ity and the reason is psychoanalysis. You are asking me how the psychoanalysts in the West can find a better framework than ego supplies to it. The on ly, without exception, the only way is meditation -- which western psychology ha s been avoiding. It has been avoiding to protect its whole structure, its wh ole literature. Its founders, its great psychoanalysts, they all will be drowned, forgotten if meditation enters into the area. Because meditation can help you to discover something beyond your mind. The ego exists between the mind and the body. It is a false creation. The self exists not between body and mind, but be yond mind. And to reach to the self you have to learn the ways how the mind can be silenced, so its constant chattering is not there. Because the real self is absolute silence. Unless western psychology incorporates meditation, it is going to remain attached with the ego. It cannot leave the ego, becaus e without ego then there is no center to man. At least there is something -- it may be false -- but something to hang around... but it destroys the whole lif e of man. It drives him into more and more, it makes him speedier without know ing where he is going, why he is going, without even inquiring who he is. Western psychology has not asked a basic question -- who am I? -- because that question will destroy the false ego. An d to ask that question means you are entering into the world of meditation, and meditation in other words is a state of no-mind. And western psychology has been at great pains to deny any such state as no-mind -- mind is the end of yo ur being -- and without exploring and without even looking at the whole long history of the ea stern mystics -- this is a very unscientific attitude. The western ps ychology is not only a... one century old science. It is just born. The eastern mysticism is almost ten thousand years old. And it is not a question of one man saying it or one country saying it; different countries, different races, different times, and they had no exchange of ideas, have reached to the same conclusion. You can not simply go on ig noring it. Half of the humanity -- and perhaps the best half becaus e it became civilized long before the West, it became cultured long before the West, it has lived all the glories that West thinks he is attaining now.... Looking at its literature, looking at its sculpture, looking at its music, its poetry, you have to think abou t that the people who have created such sculpture, the people who have created su ch great poetry, such great painting, such great music, should not be ignore d out of hand. They should be listened carefully and whatever they are sayi ng should be explored without any prejudice. They are saying that mind is not the end of man; no-mind is his basic reality."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The mind is a changing phenomenon, it is a flux -- and we kn ow it! Each moment it is changing. The thoughts are continuo usly in a traffic. You cannot keep one thought in your mind more than for few se conds. It is unstable flux. It cannot constitute man's basic reality. Something mo re solid is needed. And it is there, it has been discovered. People have lived it. And you can see the difference: the greatest psychoanalyst in the West is still prone to the same kind of sicknesses as any ordinary man, to the same madness, to the same schizophrenia. As far as his expertise is concerned he is well- trained, but as far as his humanity is concerned, he is just as ordinary as anybody else . There is no transformation in him. Psychologists have been known to rape their patients -- now how these people are going to help? Psychologists go mad more than any other profession, twice than any other profession. They commit su icide twice than any other profession. They are not joyful people, they are no t calm and quiet, they don't show the mystics' silence, the mystics' joys, the myst ics' certainty, authority. It is all mind work. The mystic seems to be far above than the psychoanalyst. In fact they are afraid to encounter the mystic, because in fron t of the mystic they are in the same position as when a camel co mes by the side of a mountain. Camels don't like to go to the mountains; they like the de sert. There they are the mountains. Carl Gustav Jung was in India. He went to see the Taj Mahal, he went to see Khajuraho, he went to see the temples of Konarak, but he did not go to see Ramana Maharshi. And wherever he went, he was again and again told that \"You being one of the topmost psychoanal ysts in the West, you should not miss this opportunity of meeting a eastern mystic who has come to his full flowering.\" He was in the South, within two hours distance he could have reached Ramana Maharshi. For three months he was in Indi a, but he avoided. This cannot be just coincidence. And he himself felt that he needs to give some explanation, otherwise it will be felt that he has b een avoiding. And naturally, he was a great intellectual and a great psychoanalyst -- he could find any excuse and any explanation and he found the explanat ion which is very dangerous. His explanation was back in *Zurich, he gave the statement that he did not go to see Ramana Maharshi because the ways of th e East and the West are different and the eastern way is dangerous for the western man because he has developed differently, his tradition is different, hi s culture is different, his religion is different, his whole psychic development is different. It is dangerous to bring into this different psychology any me thod from the East because that is developed for a different kind of man, for a different kind of psychology -- that's why I did not go.\" But this is all rubbish because who was saying to you that you have to follow Ramana Maharshi, who wa s saying to you that you have to use his techniques, his methods? All that people were insisting was that yo u should at least s ee him. Just meeting him would not have destroyed your western psychology. And if it is so weak, so fragile, that just seeing the Ramana Maharshi it is going to be destroyed, then it is"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"not worth -- it should be destroyed and sooner the better. Why waste time with such a weak thing? Ramana Maharshi is not afraid of you. When he was told that Carl Gustav Jung is here and he has been continuously told by every psychologist he is meetin g in India that \"It is useless to meet professors of psychoanalysis in India because they are simply repeating like parrots what you are producing in the West . It is better to go to see something unique and different so you have a certain comparison. Perhaps he may be coming.\" And Ramana was overjoyed. He said, \"He is welcome. Whenever he wants to come, I am available.\" And this man is uneducated. He left his home when he was only seventeen. He is not an expert in anything. He is not a logician, he is not a philosopher and he is not afraid of one of the founders of psyc hoanalysis. He is ha ppy to see him. But the psychoanalyst is a coward. To me this is not just an incident bet ween Jung and Ramana; it is very symbolic, very significant. The western psychoanal ysis is afraid because it is based on shifting sands, it has no foundation. So if you ask me, I cannot suggest you small changes here and there. I cannot tell yo u how you can renovate leaving the old structure intact -- just giving it a new paint, a new arrangement of furniture and things like that. No. The whole structur e is from the foundation is wrong. The western psychology has to drop the ego and has to find the real self and that is possible only through meditation. And the East has done it for thousands of years. So it is not something new, it is not something unexplored, it is not something Quixotic. It is something fo r which centuries stand in support. And not a single meditator has gone mad, not a single meditator has committed suicide, not a single meditator has committed rape. It is not only expertise, intellectual understanding; it is a transformation of the man himself. The psychoanalyst has to be reminded of one of the Socratic sayings: physician, first heal thyself. The psychoanalyst hi mself is sick, utterly sick. He is not different from the patient. They are in the same boat. He is having the same nightmares, he is suffering from the same mental tensions, he is feeling the same meaninglessness and he is trying to help people who are having the same diseases. How he can be a authority? With what face he can emphasize to the patient that things can be different? His whole personality is not involved in his work. It is only his education. It is something like a man gets educated in the history of art, becomes a great historian about all the art that has happened in the world, but he cannot draw a straight line himself. Because that does not come in the history. That is not a point at all. His expertise is history. This is the situation with the psychoanalyst: he knows everything about the mind, but he does not know how to change it, he cannot ch ange his own mind, because for every change you have to be separate from th e thing you are going to change. And he is identified with the mind -- who is going to change whom? Meditation creates the gap. It takes yo u beyond and behind the mind, then you can change, because mind becomes an ob ject to you. Then you are no more"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"identified with the mind. Then you can rearrange or you can completely change and the mind cannot affect you at all. Yo u are so far away, so above, that the mind cannot reach to you. The mind not reaching to you gives yo u a tremendous power. You can reach to the mind and you can change anything you want and the mind is for the first time helpless. And you can help your patients for meditation. Right now they are telling to their patients futile exercises of dream analysis. The patient comes twice a week or thrice a week for one hour, talks about all his dreams. And while he is talking about th e dreams, sitting behind the couch, do you think the psychoanalyst is listening to him? Is he capable of listening? For that he will need a silent mind which he has not got. Perhaps he is dreaming himself, sitting behind. It was a great device of Sigmund Freud that the patient cannot see the psychoanalyst, whether he has gone to sleep, whether he is dreaming, whether he is listening or not. I have heard about a very rich man wh o was going through the psychoanalysis for almost ten years. The psychoanalyst was tired but could not get rid either, because he was paying too much -- he could not afford it. But something has to be done, because he was driving him nuts ! Listening to the ol d, the same rotten stuff, again and again which we had.... He had listened thousands of times, but because he pays and pays more than anybody else, he cannot say that your dream analysis work is finished. That will cut almost half of his income. He had to suffer. He had to tolerate. One day he came with an idea. He said to the rich old man that \"I have got some urgent work and I know your dreams -- fo r ten years I have listened to you -- so what I will do: I will put my tape-recorder. You continue to talk, my tape- recorder will tape it. And in the night, when I am free of all this work -- silently, at ease -- I will listen to the tape, and that will be more significant.\" The rich man said, \"I have no objectio n.\" And he was having every day session, so next day when the psychoanalyst was en tering his office, he saw the rich man getting out. He said, \"But this is the time you come in. You are getting out.\" He said, \"Yes, because I have left my tape-rec order. In the night, finished with all the business and work, silently, I taped a ll my dreams. Now my tape-recorder is talking to your tape-recorder. We both are saved! Do you think only you have got ideas? And now there is no question of any fee! Tape-recorders are talking with tape-recorders. Neither I am involved nor you are involved.\" All that psychoanalysts are doing is just telling their patients to go deeper into their dreams and bring their dreams. An d then each school of psychoanalysis interprets their dreams differently -- so it is not a science yet. It is just anybody's guess. The same dream you take to Sigmund Fr eud and the meaning is always sexual. Whatever the dream, he will bring it to sex. Sex is the source of all the dreams. You cannot dream something, you cannot even imagine something, which he"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"cannot reduce to sex. He is a perfect ma ster about that. You may think that you have worked out perfectly, that this th ing cannot be reduced to sex, but he will reduce it to sex. His whole life's expert ise is only one thing: how to reduce everything to sex. If you go to Jung with the same dream, it will not be interpreted as anything sexual; it will be interpreted in terms of mythology. He may take you thousands of years back -- perhaps to Atlantis , the continent that has drowned and disappeared, perhaps to some aboriginal tribe in Thailand which you have never heard about -- but he will reduce it to some mythology. All dreams are mythological and you are carrying a collective memory of the whole humanity. So he is capable to find from anywhe re, something that corresponds to your dream. And this is his expertise, mythologies. If you go to Adler with th e same dream, he will re duce it to will to power, because everything is to him nothing but will to power. And these are the greatest founders of three schools. Then there are small schools and they go on growing, and they all have their interpretations. And you simply confuse the patient; you don't help him. You simp ly make things worse than they were before, because before there was only a dream, ordinary dream. Now there are universal mythologies, sexual perversions, will to power and whatnot. You have not helped the person. You have filled his mind with more rubbish, you have puzzled him more, and there is not a single man in the whole western world whose psychoanalysis is complete. And there will never be a single man whose psychoanalysis will be complete. What kind of science is this? Because the criterion for psychoanalysis to be comp lete is that all your dreams disappear. They have been analyzed, they have b een brought to consciousness -- now they have nothing to do with you. They should evaporate. Your sleep should become dreamless sleep, what Patanjali calls sush upti, which is very close to samadhi. But not a single man has been able through psychoanalysis to reach to the state of sushupti, dreamless sleep. So the question of samadhi does not arise. Samadhi means when sushupti, dreamle ss sleep, becomes aler t, awake. When you are asleep as far as the body is concerned, you are asleep as far as the mind is concerned, because there is no disturba nce of any dream, there is no tension in the body -- but beyond the mind, the no-m ind is fully alert. He knows that the mind is without any dreams, he sees it, it is without any dreams, he sees it the body is absolutely relaxed. And this seei ng, this alertness, continues twenty-four hours. Then sushupti becomes samadhi. The western psychology has not even reached to sushupti. And it can never reach! Because dreams are such a thin g: you can go on analyzing and new dreams will be coming up. Because every day you will be living and every day you will be repressing. You cannot expre ss everything while you are living in the day. That repression will become dreams. And what can you do with mythologies which are millions of years ol d, which are there in your collective"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"unconscious? They are inexhaustible. An d what you can do with will to power, because that is another name of the ego. The whole teaching, the whole culture, th e whole civilization is nothing but will to power -- through money, through politics, through education, through everything -- just more power. How can you get rid of dreams? Nobody ca n be fully psychoanalyzed. That is a complete failure of the whole system, of the whole science. In the East we have never bothered about dreams. This is something to be noted, that for ten thousand years we have b een working with the mind, but we have never bothered about dreams. On the contrary, rather than making too much fuss about dreams, we have called the wh ole world a dream. Do you see the point? The western psychology is making your dreams a great reality that has to be solved, encountered, analyzed and we ha ve, with a single gesture, rejected the whole world and whole life as a dream. No analysis is needed, no profound philosophy is needed. It is all dreamstuff. What you have to do: you have to find the one who is dreaming. The dream is no t important, but the dreamer. This is where eastern and western psychologies depart: they become entangled with dreams and the East simply puts dreams aside and start looking for the dreamer, because the dreamer is the real thing. And if we can manage and change and transform the dreamer, the dreams will disappear. The dreams are projections of the dreamer. Who is the dreamer? Where is the dreamer? Rather than wasting time with analysis of the dreams -- whic h is endless, ad infinitum -- they have simply reached directly to the dreamer. And what they have found is the real self. And in finding it, they have fo und a tremendous energy of awareness. Because you were not aware of it, that 's why there were dreams. In your unawareness was the existence of dreams. In your awareness they evaporate just like dewdrops evaporating in the mornin g sun. The moment you become aware of your authentic being, all dreams disappear. So in the East there have been thousand s of people without any psychoanalysis, who have dropped all their dreams, who have not only reached to a dreamless sleep but has simultaneously reached sa madhi -- the ultimate goal of human health, wholeness, immortality. The western psychology needs a complete ch ange. It is not going to be just a partial change here and there. It is going to be en toto. And the thing that will bring the change is meditation: going in to the no-mind, beyond mind, so that you can be a witness of your mind and its activities, of your body and its activities. And this no-mind has no ego. This real self is not an ego. It is part of cosmic consciousness, it is part of the whole existence. It is not yours. The western psychology is on the verge of a great revolution. The revolution will come from the experiences of the myst ics. Perhaps, Ramana Maharshi may not have been of much help. He may have impressed Jung as a charismatic figure, but he may not have been of much help . But I can be, because I know as much western psychology as any Jung, as any Freud, as any Adler.

A: Yes, I agree. I agree totally. It was an experiment for both: as an alte rnative society and as a higher quality of communism. The old society has some basic things on which it depends. There have been many critics of the old society but none of them has succeeded to hit the very roots. They have been just pruning the leaves. So the critics have been criticizing an d the old society goes on and on. Their criticism has not made any difference to it. The roots of the old society are hidden like all roots of all the trees. They are not available unless you dig deep. For example, the family is the basic unit of the old society. Marriage is the basic unit of the old society. Money as the means of exchange -- is very fundamental to the old society. Religious orientation -- whatever the religion may be; but the old society needs a certain religion. It is the opium that keeps the people asleep and drugged. In my commune we were destroying the very roots. We were destroying the family, we were dissolving the family into the commune. The children were not going to belong to th e parents: they could love them, they could meet them, they could invite th em, but they cannot possess them. They have been only vehicles of bringing th ose children to the world. The children are not their property. The commune will take care of the children. Hence, marriage loses its relevance. You can be together with a woman or a man as long as you love. Except love, there is no other reason to be together. There should not be any other reason to be together. Because any other reason is going to be wrong reason. No law, no logic, no convenience, no respectability... the moment you see the love has disappeared it is time to depart in deep gratitude, friendship,"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"remembering all the beautiful moments th at you have given to each other. Not spoiling it by fighting, quarreling, going to a court for a divorce -- it is absolutely ugly. When there is no marriage there is no question of divorce. When there is no marriage prosti tution disappears automatically. Prostitution is the shadow of marriage. It is the marriage in which love has died that creates the prostitute -- the ugliest institution in existence. The old society forces the woman to sell her body for money. This is a crime which cannot be forgiven and strange is the fact that all the old societies are against prostitution and they are the causes to create it; and they can't see the simple logic that when a man cannot feel love for his wife and cannot enjoy her... she is no more an ecstas y to him -- he tries to find, perhaps he can buy ecstasy, he can buy love, he ca n buy happiness... a desperate effort of a miserable man. In the ancient times it was not possible for women to have male prostitutes for the simple reason that they were reduced to such slavery. They had no right, no say, how the society should be run. They had no money but in this century, as women have become slowly financially independent, simultaneously a new institution has come into being: male prostitution. Now the woman is doing the same as man ha s been doing. She is also hoping for hers through money. Those beautiful mo ments can be captured back which she has lost. But money cannot buy few things. It cannot buy love. It cannot buy peace. It cannot buy ecstasy. The old society is miserable, but itself is responsible for all the miseries. Then there is the money as a means of ex change and it is money that has created classes. The so-called communism create d by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels does not take note of the basic fact. They miss the most fundamental thing... they want to distribute the money equally, but they don't see the po int that it is the money which has created the classes. You can distribute the money but then you will have to keep a continuous dictatorial state to keep the money distributed equally; otherwise, soon there will be people who will be having more mo ney and there will be people who will be having less money, because to earn money is an art. To accumulate money is an art. To create wealth is an art. And everybody is not so talented. Soon there will be poor and the rich. But they did not see, they both were blind about the most important thing -- that the easiest way to disappear is to take the money out of the society; that it is no mo re the means of exchan ge... then there is nobody poor and nobody rich. There is no need to create a classless society: just remove the money and the classl ess society comes into being."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The commune should take the responsibilit y of providing the basic needs of the members. Everybody should get whatever is his need. And we had managed in our small commune of five thousand people for four years, the highest quality of communism that has ever existed on the earth. It was an alternative society because it dissolved the family, it dissolved the marriage, it dissolved divorce, it dissolved the whole of possessiveness of th e parents over children. It dissolved money. It made a classless society. It di ssolved any need of a ruling class and the ruled. It created a functional structure. So the president was not more prestigiou s than the plumber. He was doing his work; the plumber was doing his work.I t was possible that the plumber was doing a better work as a plumber than the president was doing his work. Then the plumber has to be honored and respected. Yes, our commune was an alternative so ciety and a higher form of communism. And we have proved that it is possible. We were not only theoreticians; we have practically proved it, against all odds, against the greatest, mightiest government... We managed to create an oasis in a world of misery. People rejoicing and dancing. People fe eling completely unburdened of the whole past and unconcerned of the future. Those four years we had managed to give reality to a dream which man has been dreaming for millenia. Q: HAS THE FACT YOU LEFT AMERIC A TO BE CONSIDERED A FAILURE OF YOUR EXPERIMENT? A: It was not a failure. It was an absolute success. We succeeded doing ever ything that we wanted. We managed to prove that whatever is ou r theoretical idea is practical. It is pragmatic, it is down-to-earth: that is our success. I call it absolute success -- not in terms of time that it existed in only four years, but in terms that it existed at all! It was going to be destroyed: that is not something unexpected. It was going to be crushed. In fact, it threatened the grea test world power -- that is its success. It challenged the greatest power -- that is its success. That the greatest world power had to use illegal means, undemocratic means to destroy it, is its success. America has failed, not the commune. Otherwise a small commune of five thousand people: what harm it could have done to America? It had no clear weapons, it was not a danger to anybody, it could not have conquered America. What was the fear? The fear was not of nuclear weapons: th e fear was not that this commune is going to conquer them. The fear was that this commune is transforming a dream which is hidden in every man's unconsci ous. That this commune is making something real... that man has always wanted to experiment with but has"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"thought that it is a dream, and it is good to dream about them but you cannot materialize them. We proved it. Anybody who thinks it was a failure is absolutely wrong. We succeeded in every way. We threatened the greatest power -- what more success do you want? Such great powers are not threatened by small things. They don't take any care. They could have ignored, but they could not ignore. They had to take note of it and they had to understand it clearly that if this commune goes on growing sooner or later it is going to threaten their very existence, without any nuclear weapons. It is going to take away their youth. It is going to take over their people. It is going to take away their most potential power -- human power; then they can go on keeping their nuclear weapons , they will be of no use. The fear, the paranoia, in the American go vernment's mind, against a single man and his small commune is a proof of absolute success. Q: BHAGWAN, THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS NO HOPE FOR WHEREVER PEOPLE LIKE YOU WILL TRY AN EXPERIMENT LIKE THIS -- IT WILL, IS IT BOUND TO BE DESTROYED? A: No, there is always hope. They can destroy one time, they can destroy hundred times, but they cannot destroy it always. Each time they will destroy we will be creating more sympathy, more lovers, more people on our side. Each time a man like me will be jailed, you will find more and more people coming closer to our philosophy, way of life. This is how history functions. They will destroy few times but each time they will be weakening themselves and they will be strengthening us. We invite them to go on destroying till we are more po werful than them and they cannot destroy any more and they have to commit suicid e because nothing else is left for them to do. Q: WE THINK THAT THERE HAS B EEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN YOU TALK AGAINST POVERTY TOO. IN FACT, IT HAS BEEN A REPORT TODAY YOU ARE AGAINST TH E POOR. WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE IT CLEAR: ARE YOU AGAINST PO VERTY OR AGAINST THE POOR? A: There is no misunderstanding. I am against poverty, but without poverty how can there be poor people? If I destroy poverty, I am destroying at the same time poor people too. The poor people exist through poverty. The misunderstanding is created by the people who would like to say that destroy poverty, but love the poor. What they are saying is: that the poor man can be still a poor man without poverty? They"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"are trying to save Jesus, they are trying to save all the old religions because Jesus is not saying that he is for poverty -- he is saying, \"Blessed are the poor.\" But how these people can be poor without poverty? And if he wants these people to be poor, he is for poverty: without an y confusion. I am against poverty, hence I am against the poor man because the poor man is nothing t a byproduct of poverty. Once the poverty is withdrawn the poor man disappears. So there is no confusion. It is better I should say that, \"To me, they are both the same thing.\" But the distinction has been made down the ages so I can understand what the question is. They have always said, \"C ondemn the evil, but don't condemn the evil man.\" But without the evil how the man can be evil? That is beyond my comprehension. They say, \"Destroy sickne ss, but love the sick people.\" t if you destroy the sickness, where you are going to find the sick people? To me, it is sickness that makes them sick and if you are really destroying sickness there is not going to be anybody who is sick , and nobody needs your sympathy. So I am against poverty an d I am against poor man. I would like every man to be rich in all the dimensions of life. I am all for riches and to me riches does not mean only money. A man who cannot understand the greatest literature of the world is a poor man and I hate him! He is living unnecessarily... he is simp ly a burden on the earth. Either he has to improve, either he has to sharpen his intelligence, or he has no future. In all the dimensions poverty has to disappear -- and with the poverty the poor man disappears automatically. The man remains... just that ugliness of poverty disappears. I cannot say \"blessed are the poor\", \"blessed are the sheep\", \"b lessed are the ugly\"... just I cannot say, and I cannot tolerate anybody else saying this. I will condemn him, criticize him to my best. Because I want this earth to be full of beautiful people -- multi- dimensionally rich; contributing more beauty, more joy, more blissfulness. Q: WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO DESTROY POVERTY FROM THE WORLD? A: My advice is very simple. First, absolute birth control for twenty to thirty years. On the other side, after seventy-five years , freedom for everybody to choose if he wants to die then he can simply go to th e hospital and register himself that he has lived enough and now there is no poin t in living and he wants to be relieved. So on the one hand, we prevent the new people coming and on the other hand we make the old people move faster in the queue... so the world population is reduced to almost one fourth of what it is, then the earth is plenty, rich, nourishing."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Secondly, nations should disappear from the world. They are one of the causes of poverty, sickness, war, destruction and misuse of technology, science and the energy that man produces. We need one world. If we want to be ri ch, we need only one world. No political lines on the earth. Then it will be very easy to see. There was a time in Soviet Russia they wer e using wheat instead of coal in their railway lines, in their engines; because they had a bumper crop of wheat and wheat was cheaper than coal and they don't have many mines for coal. The whole East was dying hung ry; they cannot eat coal. They have mines of coal, but they cannot eat coal. But the wheat is being used as coal. If it was one world things would have been simple. Shift the coal where it is too much and useless and send the wheat where it is needed -- don't burn it: it is not something to be burned when people are hungry. Just few months before in Europe they dr owned millions of tons of food in the ocean and just close by in Nigeria, in Et hiopia, people were dying. In Ethiopia people were dying in thousands because they had no water, no food. And in Europe you are drowning food, fresh food, into the ocean. In fact, one hundred thousand dollars were wasted just in drowning it: because you need labor to drown the food. If the world was one, Ethiopia would not have died the way it has died. And it has been happening always... America goes on destroying its crops, drowning its food in the ocean, but will not give it to those who are dying. For the simple reason because if you start to giving f ood then your own ec onomy suffers. Then the prices come down and no country wants -- particularly people who are holding the markets, don't want the prices to come down. And why they should bother about Ethiopia ? Ethiopia or no Ethiopia -- it makes no sense to Europe. It is good if it is finished: one problem is solved. We need one world. Just the idea of one world means tremen dous energy involved in preparation for war -- nuclear weapons, atomic energy, millions of the best minds humanity has ever produced; all the scientists, all th e technologists, are freed to do some creative work. If they can manage atomic energy to de stroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki, if they can manage nuclear weapons to destro y the whole world, why they cannot manage with the same energy, to produce more food? To produce better clothes? To produce better houses? To produce totally a new kind of world which has never been dreamt of, which is now possible. Unpolluted, ecologically sane... there is enough food in the oceans; just our scientists have to work on it. Very nourishing food can be found from the oceans. And ultimately science goes deeper into it, there is bound to come a time when science can create synthetic food; just as synthetic clothes, just as everything man can made(sic) which will be better -- far more improved than nature."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Man can live at least three hundred years very easily. Just if he gets the right kind of food and if the whole scientific world changes its direction from death to life it is possible. Things are very simple. Just we have not explored. If you look at the back you can understand it. There was a time when man liv ed only on hunting. He had no idea that fruits can be eaten, that crops can be grown. If anybody had said that he would have been thought crazy. Because people had never done that. They have all lived on hunting and to live on hunting was a very difficult process because you may get some day food, and you may not get some day. It was all accidental. But as the population grew they had to listen to the dreamers who said these fruits can be eaten; that crops can be grown... and that was a tremendous revolution -- from hunting to cultivation. And we are still hanging there. Standing in my window I see every day, and I feel so sad. One couple is working since I have co me... they may have been working long before... with their hands, preparing the gr ound to sow the seeds. They have not even come to use the bullocks or the hors es, they are living almost fifty thousand years back. In the middle of Katmandu, where yo u have all contemporary technology available, the whole day from morning to evening they are preparing the ground just by hands. It will take months to prepare... which could have been done with bullocks or horses within a week. Which co uld have been done by a tractor just in few hours. But perhaps they have no idea. We have to bring science, technology, to every field of life. In every possible way. Man's mind clings to the past. Everythin g new seems to be unnatural. It is not true. I use hundred percent polyester and my fa ther was very much against. He will say, \"This is unnatural: you should use cotton.\" But I told him, \"Do you know... there were times people never used cotto n, they were naked; and when for the first time cotton was used there were peop le like you who said it is unnatural, because our fathers, forefathers, have never used it. And I feel perfectly comfortable in it.... I have never felt so co mfortable in any other kind of clothing. So have I to understand my own experience or just to follow the old trodden path?\" Poverty is not something of a great problem. The problem is divisions of nations, divisions of religions. You can see it in India. The man is poor if he is Hindu, if he becomes converted to Catholicism he beco mes rich. Hindu, he will remain poor; Christian, he need not be poor. But is it right to exploit the man? Is it right to purchase the man's ideology by giving him food, shelter, clothing, education? Why can't you give him without"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"any conditions -- just as a human being? It means `there is enough, but first you have to be a Christian.' Poverty is not necessary: your Hinduism, your Buddhism, is a barrier. Be Christian and poverty disappears. I want all these religions to disappear... so all their riches can be used for the benefit of all. Reduce the population, destroy nations, destroy religions, and the world would be as rich as you cannot dream. It is a very simple phenomena. Q: BHAGWAN, WE AGREE WITH YO U IN TOTAL AND FOR, WHATEVER HELP WE CAN BE WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD YOU BE WI LLING TO CREATE ANOTHER EXPERIMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE SO CIETY TO OFFER AS A MODEL TO THE WORLD? A: This time I am not going to create a society or a commune, as a model. I have done that. But my people will be creating communes around the world -- on the same model. So that I don't become tethered to one small space; one single spot, with only few thousand people. I would like to remain available to all of my sannyasins around the world. Now I am going to be a constant wanderer, a traveller, looking what my people are doing around the world. Helping them to do it better. So I am not going to put my energies into a small model -- that I have done... and this is not my habit -- to do an ything again. Once is enough. I have moved to another experiment, now I will be moving around the world continuously, travelling, reaching to every sannyasin, to every lover, to every friend, to every sympathizer; and creating a worldwide movement... and now it is up to my sannyasins to create communes. This way I will be able to work on a bigger scale, larger scale. And it will become more impossible for any stupid government to destroy my work because it will be spread all over the world. Q: YOU TALK ABOUT MEDITATION. CA N YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDITATION TECHNIQUES AND MEDITATION ITSELF? AND HOW THERE CAN BE MEDITATION THAT CAN DRIVE YOU IN A BULLDOZER, OR WORKING TWELVE HOURS A DAY? A: Meditation techniques are not really meditation. Meditation techniques only prepare the ground. They are needed because people's mind s are so full of rubbish... that before meditation can be started, that rubbish has to be removed."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Meditation techniques are just to remove the rubbish. If that is removed, then starts meditation. If somebody comes with a mind clean, he does not need any technique. He can directly enter into the space I call meditation. And the space called meditation has noth ing to do where you are, what you are doing, or not doing. It is simply a constant awareness, an undercurrent of alertness. So you can work twelve hours on a bulldozer or you can just sit silently doing nothing. Deep underneath your work or no work there is a thread of alertness. I have loved always a story... There was a master thief -- he was never caught and it was thought to be an honor if he stole from your house. People talked about that, \"The master thief has visited us.\" Because it was not an ordinary thing... he never went to ordinary people -- he went only to the super rich, to the kings, to the emperors. So to be visited by the master thief people used to brag about it. It was more valuable than wh at he has stolen. His coming was more valuable. He was getting old. His son as ked him, \"That now you are old and you have not taught your art to me.\" The master said, \"It is never late. You ca n come tonight with me and I am going into a very beautiful palace.\" The son followed. He was very much afrai d. Although he was young and strong; and the old man has passed eighty, but he was unafraid... He made a hole in the wall; the son was perspiring, it was a co ld night and cold wind was blowing and he was so nervous he could not believe that that old man's hands were not even shaking. And he was doing as if it is his own house. He made the hole, he entered in the hole, he called the son -- he was very much afraid to enter in it -- but now he himself has asked and what the father will think of him, so he entered. The father said, \"Don't be af raid, can't you see me? And you are just with me, just watch me... and behave! This is not the way of becoming a master thief. Follow me!\" He followed, but his legs were trembling, his breathing was no more normal, his heart was thumping... he could not belie ve that the heart can make so much noise. The night was silent, but the old man was as if absent. He opened the doors upon doors -- he had a master key -- he entered into the innermost chamber; he opened the door of a closet... beautiful, very costly dresses. He told the son to go in and to find out the best dress you like. And as he went in the old man closed the lock, locked the door, sh outed loudly, \"Thief, thief!\" and ran out from the backside, from the sa me hole they had entered. Everybody was awake... the whole house, the servants, and the master and the children and the wife and the guests wer e there and they were all looking all around... where is the thief? and certainly there has been a thief, because the hole in the wall was a proof. And the young man could not believe that his father will do such a nasty thing to him. He has always been nice."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Closing the doors, putting the lock, and th en shouting thief, thief! And running away. Now how he is going to get out? His mind could not function: your mind would not have functioned either. It was such a situation where mind has to stop, because mind can work only with known situations. As the unknown comes in, the mind stops, simply stops. Then a maid-servant came in, looking all around. She thought perhaps it is good idea to look in the closet . She opened the lock, opened the door, she was having a candle in her hand, looked inside, and the young man had no idea what he is doing, why he is doing, he simply blew the candle out, pushed the servant, the maid-servant, and ran out from the same hole, but now everybody has seen him. They all followed. And he was running for life, so he was running at his best. He could not do better... he had been a good runner, he has participated in the university, he has been a good competit or, he has been a champion runner, but he could not believe that this is double that he is doing. If he had done this much he would have been the national champion. The people were still following and more people had joined them -- neighbours and others and they were all shouting an d they had torches and he comes by the side of a well, and still not knowing what is happening; because he is not in a situation to figure out, to think -- there is no time -- mind needs time to think. Those who know, say \"mind is time\". They are not two entities. If there is no time, there is no mind. If there is no mind, there is no time. He had no time to think, but things were happening on their own accord. This is what I call a spontaneity. He just took over a big rock and he coul d not believe that he can take that big load in his hands... the rock was too big, and he threw the rock into the well. Not knowing what he is doing, and why.... And ran away. All the people who were following gathered around the well thinki ng that he has jumped into the well. Listening to the rock so und falling into the well. He reached home.... The old man was fast asleep! He was snoring! The young man could not believe that this is your father. He pulled his blanket and he said, \"Is this a way to behave with your own son?\" The father opened his half-eyes and said , \"So, you are back? The remaining story you can tell me in morning. If you are back, it seems everything went right. But don't disturb my sleep. Just go and have a good rest.\" The son could not believe that he is not even curious what happened to him... his life was at risk at every moment... he coul d have been caught, he could have been given to the police, the people could ha ve shot him -- anything was possible, and he is saying, that \"You are back, that's enough, the remaining story you can tell me in the morning, that is not very impo rtant. What is important is that you are back and I am happy.\""},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"In the morning the father said, \"There is no need to tell the story. This is the whole art. If you want to become a master thief you have not to function out of the mind, you have to function out of yo ur totality, spontaneity. Now you can choose -- this is my business, my whole life's work... I have given you a taste. If you love it, the adventure of it, the ecst asy of it, then you are welcome my son. From today you can go on your own beca use there is only one lesson in this path.\" Meditation is a single lesson of awareness, of no-thought, of spontaneity, of being total in your action, alert, aware. It is not a technique, it is a knack. Either you get it or you don't. Q: DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR SANNYASI AND FRIENDS HAVE NOW LEARNED THE LESSON ABOUT THE DANGER OF AN ORGANIZED RELIGION? A: They certainly have. I have been tellin g to them my whole life the dangers of organized religion. But just telling is not enough. They need something practical. I gave them a practical situation. They have learnt it... they have burnt thei r fingers in learning it -- they will never forget it, they will never repeat the same mistake again. I am happy. Once in a while people n eed something actual, not theoretical. Q: IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK BOTH TO REAGAN AND GORBACHOV WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM? A: I would say to them that if they have any humanity left in them then the first thing is: help to create one world. They are the greatest powers in the world -- if they want, it becomes a very easy thing. They are in a situation to destroy the whole world. I can show them an alternative that you are also in a state of creating one world... perhaps it has not dawned on their consciousness, that the power they have is not only capable of destroying the world, it is also capabl e of creating one world. Because never before in history two countries had so much power that the whole world will have to listen to them. All that is needed that they sh ould agree on the point that we want to create one world. Then all th ese small nations, poor nations, can be given the alternative to choose... Either a third world war or one world. (Tape side C) And in the third world war only America and Russia are going to lose -- nobody else. Because nobody else has got anything to lose. Even if the third world war does not happen, most of the countries will die out of starvation and population. Can you understa nd: I used to think that by the end"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"of this century India will have the popula tion one billion. Right now it is nine hundred million. For the first time in thou sands of years it will be the first time that it will go ahead of China. Up to now China has been the leading country having the greatest population.

It would ha ve doubled: that means, eighteen hundred million. One billion and eighte en hundred million.These people are going to die by themselves -- without any war. In fact, war will be a great release of their tension, of their worry, of constant death ahead. The only countries one third of the wo rld -- the third world -- will die of poverty, starvation, sickness.... The remaining world -- which is not poor, but which has not the clear powers compared to Russia or America, will die of AIDS; which is even uglier than dying with a starvation. So this world is finished. Only in the third world war America an d Russia are going to lose. They are going to destroy themselves. The remaining world is going to commit suicide on its own -- they don't need your help. So I will suggest to these people that ju st be clear about the situation. You are going to lose, if there is a war. Only yo u will be the losers, and you both will be destroyed in it. You can propose to the world that we have decided to be together. Rather than to die together; we have decided to live together -- and create one world. And nobody can prevent Soviet Union and Russia from creating one world. They can remove all the lines from the map very easily -- there is no problem at all. And once they decide that they are not going to fight, then their tremendous energy -- which is involved into war effort s -- will be available for them, and for the whole world, to make a paradise out of it. Okay, Sarjano.  "},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"The Last Testament, Vol 5 Chapter #30 Chapter title: None 24 January 1986 pm in Kathmandu, Nepal [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use on ly. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words] INTERVIEW WITH ENZO BIAJI, AKA SARJANO Q: YOU SAY THAT MARRIAGE HAS DONE ITS WORK AND IS NOW OUT OF TIME. WE AGREE. CAN YOU SUGGEST THE COMMUNE AS A NEW BASE UNITY OF LIFESTYLE? AND SAY THAT THE CHILDREN WILL GROW UP MORE FREE IN THIS CONTEXT. IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR A MOTHER, ESPECI ALLY AN ITALIAN MOTHER, TO THINK THAT HER CHILD DOESN'T BELONG TO HER. PLEASE EXPLAIN. A: Every transformation, every revolution is difficult in the beginning because you are accustomed of the old and to ad opt to the new creates the difficulty. The very idea of possession is anti-love. You possess things, you don't possess living beings. But unfortunately we have reduced living bein gs into things. It will hurt to drop the possessiveness but it help immensely for the mother in understanding, in spiritual growth, and the hurt will be healed very soon. It is just an old habit transferred from one generation to another generation that `you possess me', `I possess you'. Droppi ng possessiveness means `I am myself', `you are yourself' -- we meet out of in dependence, we love out of freedom, not out of any contract. And once a person has tasted love, non-po ssessive love, he will be surprised that what he had been thinking of love was not love but fear. It is fear which wants to po ssess so that you cannot esca pe, so you remain always part of the furniture of the house. So th at you remain obedient, so that you are not an independent being, but just a proj ection of the idea of your mother, of your father, or your wife, or your husband. The difference is so much as if a bird comes out of the egg, he must be afraid, he is entering into an unknown world. Inside the egg he was safe, secure, no problems. Getting out of the egg is a trau ma, but once he looks at the stars and the whole sky is his, once he opens his wi ngs and rises high into the heavens, he knows that the egg was not his home -- it was a prison. Now he has found himself. In finding freedom, one finds himself."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"And only a free man is capable of loving. You cannot expect love from slaves. You cannot expect love from prostitutes. They can pretend; you pay for it. You cann ot expect love from a child who feels in a bondage -- he will pretend, and he will pretend his whole life because you are training him for pretension not for love. He will pretend with his wife, he will pretend with his children, and this way the disease goes on and on. Intelligent people are needed to come ou t of this vicious circle and I am not saying that you are not allowed to love ... I am saying you are not allowed to possess. You can love your children, you can love other people's children -- what is special in your children? They are as st rangers to you as other children. Your love should have some unconditional quality about it. In a commune a boy, a girl, will be getting love from thousands of people and it is one of the most significant thing to reme mber that when a girl is brought up by the mother she hates the mother her wh ole life. She cannot forgive her, she cannot forget her -- on the one hand; and on the other hand -- she is just a replica of her own mother. The same is about the boy. And it is known fact that the girl wants to love the father, the boy wants to love the mother, but this is thought to be a criminal act. As the boys and girls will grow up the fa ther and mother will create a distance between their own children and themselves , but the harm has already been done. Scientists say that the first days of life are the most important in your whole life because you get certain impressions wh ich you will carry your whole life. The boy will carry the impression of his mo ther his whole life -- he could not get the mother, but he will search the mother in other women, and no other woman can fit with his idea. The same is true about the girl. People fall in love and you ask them, \"W hy you fell in love with a certain woman, or a certain man?\" And they are at a loss to answer, because it is something unconscious of which they are not aware. The reality is you fall in love with a woman who had some similarity to your mother. Maybe the similarity will be very superficial -- the hairdo, the sound of her voice, the way she talks, the features of her face, the eyes, anything; just a small thing, and you fall in love. You fall in love with a fragment, but soon after marriage you will discover the woman is not a fragment, she is a whole continent, so is the man. Both are going to be frustrated, because what the hairdo will do. Even if the nose of your wife is exactly the same as your mother's, it is not going to make your life a joyous pilgrimage. What does it matter if your father rese mbles with the husband you have chosen. Because he was professor, very scholarly, al ways talking of great things, and this man is also a professor talking of great th ings -- but these things don't constitute"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"life... so when you are together twenty-fo ur hours you start di scovering so many things which do not resemble to your father or to your mother. Finally when you discover the whole ph enomenon of your woman, that small fragment is so small, it makes no differenc e at all. Then there is frustration, then there is constant quarreling. This is one of the basic facts why no co uple is happy and I say it without any exception. No couple is happy around the world an d every couple is pretending to the outside that they are living in paradise ... they are living in hell! twenty-four hours. They pretend to be loving on ly when guests come, visitors come, otherwise the house is hell. I have heard: two men used to visit a restaurant and they both remained till the manager forced them to leave. This wa s a great similarity -- just those two men one day when they were getting out of the restaurant, one man asked the other, \"Why do you stay so long?\" He said, \"I am married and as long I can remain away from the home, it is peaceful.\" But he asked, \"What is the cause of your staying because you are also staying?\" He said, \"It is better that you should not know.\" But the man insisted to know. He said, \"I am a bachelor. As long as I can remain away from my empty house it feels I am alive; when I enter into my house it seems I am entering a grave.\" When you are alone you cannot live. When you are together with a partner you cannot live. Certainly the whole human psychology is beserk. In the commune children will be part of the commune. They will have many uncles, many aunts, many sisters, many brothers. They will not get a certain fixed idea in their mind how a woman should be or how a man should be. Almost ninety percent psychological problems will dissolve and for the remaining ten, also I have some idea. As the children grow to sexual maturity they should be allowed absolute freedom, wi th all the cautions so that they don't get pregnant. Now the Pill is available. First it was available only for the woman, now it is available for the man too. All kinds of birth control methods are available. After the year thirteenth or fourteenth, the girl or the boy are going to be sexually mature. It has to be understood that natu re has brought them to maturity. As far as nature is concerned they are capable of producing children, but the society, the family, the old rotten structure will pr event them, up to twenty-five years of age -- that means a difference of ten or el even years before they get married; and for these ten years every society insists th at you should remain celibate. You are asking the impossible."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Then nature has matured their sexuality -- it is none of their fault -- it is as simple you can take a vow that I will not allow my hairs to grow, but are you capable to do that? Your hairs will continue to grow. You can go on reading BHAGAVAD GITA and holy BIBLE and you go on, on your knees, praying god that, \"I have taken the vow\". That, \"I will not grow my hairs, but they go on growing.\" Your biological structure is not under co ntrol of your mind, and sex is the most important part of your biology becaus e whole nature depends on sex for the production. These ten years are going to be of perver ted sex. They could have been a great experiment, a great experience. In a commune the children will be allowed to have all knowledge, all medical support, so they don't get pregnant. And they should move with different boys, with different girls... there is no hurry to decide. And there should not be any hurry to decide. First let the boy experience few dozen gi rls, let the girl know few dozen boys; only then you can expect for her to decide that who seems to be more closer to her being, who will be a partner with whom she would like to travel a long way. And the boy will also be able to see which is the girl, what are the qualities that impress him. And they should go on chan ging in the commune because it is not a settlement, they are just playing around with their love energy... to have an experience before they decide. And my understanding is that if ten ye ars of experience cannot make you come to a conclusion, in a seventy year life, what more do you want? These ten years will settle. Nobody is made for you; neithe r you are made for anybody else. It is a search, a groping in the dark, fo r the most convenient companion who is non-possessive, who loves freedom, who love s to give freedom, who is not only non-possessive, who is against being possesse d. That she is absolutely open to share love, without any conditions. These ten years will be the most significant of your life. Right now they are a nightmare. And then you can decide whenever you wa nt, or you can decide that a married life is not for you. Perhaps you would like to continue the same way as you have been doing for ten years -- nothing is wrong in it. It is absolutely up to you! No parent decides it. It is your decision to choose a partner, or not to choose a partner. One thing more to be reme mbered: that at the age of nearabout eighteen you have the greatest sexual power that yo u will ever have in your life. After eighteen your sexual power starts declining and it is sheer stupidity to decide for marriage at twenty-five, when sexual power has already declined tremendously - - you will not be able to satisfy a woman. The most satisfying sexual orgasm is be tween eighteen and nineteen. You are at the prime of your energies but the educat ion goes up to twenty-five, twenty-six,"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"and if you are going to do a Ph.D. it may go up to thirty, or if you are really a bookworm it may go up to thirty-five -- to have a D.Litt. I came across a man in Varanasi. He was the only man in the whole world... and that was his only achievement, useless, but he was praised -- perhaps I was the only man who condemned him in front of him... he had seventeen M.A. degrees in seventeen subjects. All that he has been doing his life was moving from one subject to another, and attaining another M.A. to prove that he is, in the world, the only man who has seventeen M.A. degrees. And the peop le who had brought him to me had brought him with great praise. They told me, \"He is a rare individual.\" And I looked at him and I told him that, \"You are absolutely idiot. What are you going to do with your seventeen degr ees? You have wasted your whole life. Now collect all your papers and keep on your chest and move in your grave. Perhaps God may very impressed seeing seventeen masters' degrees....\" First the man was shocked and then tears came to his eyes and he said, \"Perhaps you are the first man who has told me the truth. I have wasted my life, I have never loved -- I had no time, I never got married -- I had no time, I was running from one department to another depart ment, my whole idea was to have all masters' degrees that are available in the university of Varanasi. But your attitude shocks me, hurts me, but still I do understand -- I have wasted my life.\" By the year thirty-five sexual energy is fast declining. That is the reason that most of the people in the world don't have the orgasmic experience because that orgasmic experience was possible between eighteen/nineteen, somewhere there, when you were so full of energy and the woman was so receptive that making love was a divine dance. When mens' energies have declined, wome ns' energies have not declined. So she feels continuously frustrated. And ma n feels deep down that he is the unfortunate one who has never known what orgasm is but he cannot accept it. Ninety-eight percent women in India had no sexual orgasm. And that is one of the basic experiences that nature gives you, as a gift. With that experience you for the first time become aware that life is no t just mundane, it has something divine in it. My own understanding is that it was th e orgasmic experience which created the mystics in the world. Because if meeting with a woman, totall y, can give you such an experience; meeting with the whole universe, mergin g with the whole universe, totally, you can imagine how much, how vast, ho w infinite it is going to be. It is going to be absolute orgasm. But if you have missed the first, you have no possibility to attain the second. The first was an indication of a new dimension. You will collect money and power and prestige and you will die as everybody has died."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"In the commune the children will have a ll orgasmic experiences and before they decide they will know what kind of a wo man or what kind of a man brings them to that holy experience.

(Tape side B; no overlap) Q: MOST OF US IN RELATIONSHI PS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN LOOKS LIKE A SADO-MASOCHIST (INAUDI BLE)(*). AND THERE ARE NOW MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHICH CALL THEMS ELVES THE `SINGLES', CHOOSE TO BE OR NOT. THIS IS A NEW PHE NOMENON IN THE WEST INCREASING EVERY DAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? AND DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY HOPE FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHICH DOESN'T ENSLAVE BOTH?\" A: The phenomenon of people living alon e is disgusting because it is out of frustration. They wanted to be with so meone, they have tried and they have failed again and again. Now it is out of failure they have reached to a conclusion that it is better to be alone, but their aloneness will be sad, empty, ugly, because it has not come out of any abundance of love -- it has come out of the psychopathy of love. And it is true, the best couple in the world is one in which one partner is a masochist and the other is a sadist. They fit very well. The sadist wants to torture, the masochis t wants to be tortured. You cannot find a better combination. Both are happy -- ther e is no complaint, but the situation is ugly. To settle in such a state that the one is sa dist and the other is masochist; two sick people cannot create a healthy relationship. In fact, their relationship is based on sickness. Most of the couples who seem to cling to gether are of this type because they are fulfilling each other's need, and it is a natural byproduct -- if you cannot find somebody who fits with your psycho-pathology, it is better to be single... but that is not going to make you psychologically healthy. Your singleness may create thousands of perversions. I have heard a story that two men were going to Alaska. At the last village they stopped to purchase few necessary things : toothpaste, (inaudible)(*), et cetera, and the shopkeeper said that, \"I have something more which perhaps you are not aware, you will not get a woman there.\" They had not thought about it -- that is true. In Alaska, where you are going to get a woman? So the man said that, \"I have some arrangements, I have a rubber woman. You just pump it and it is more beautiful than any woman, and it is very easy, it never quarrels, never nags you and easy to carry, just take the air out, fold it back and keep in the pocket -- nobody will know.\""},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"They both looked at each other and said, \"It is a good idea.\" But one said, \"I don't have money.\" The other said, \"I have money.\" So they purchased the woman -- a really beautiful woman with filled air with a ll the right proportions of the body. After two years, one man came back. The shopkeeper said, \"As far as I reme mber, two men has gone, where is the other?\" He said, \"Don't mention him. I shot him.\" He said, \"Why you shot him, he was your friend?\" \"Don't call him my friend!\" he said. \"When I was out, he was making love to my woman. He was cheating me continuously. I had asked him again and again, are you making love to my woman? Because I had paid for it. And he said, `No, I am not interested in women.' But one day I came in the middle of the day and saw him making love to my woman. I shot both.\" These singles will find rubber womens(sic), these singles will have to come to some understanding about their sexuality. And their singlehood will create the same situation as celibacy has created for thousands of years. But it is a sign that old marriage has failed. That people are so tired of it that they choose to be single rather than getting married and entering into a continuous nightmare. I have lived with hundreds of families, I have not come across a single couple who is happy, but what else to do? The society has managed everything in such a way that they have to pretend to be happy -- that is their respectability, prestige in the society, but deep down they are dy ing of a cancer, cancer which is invisible and cannot be operated upon. The world can be so joyous, just few st upid ideas have to be removed. Give chances to children to experiment with sex so that before they decide, they decide with full awareness that the person they are choosing fits with them -- not on a fragmentary basis but whole to whole. And then too it is not a marriage according to law, it is not a marriage acco rding to social customs, it is a marriage between those two people. Any moment th ey feel that old joy is disappearing then why continue? Say goodbye, find out new partners -- the world is so full of men and women, perhaps you may find somebody else, your woman may find somebody else... and don't think of pe rmanency... in existence everything is momentary, what is beautiful today may turn ugly tomorrow; what is so great this moment that you are ready to accept it for your whole life, may turn so sour tomorrow that you may like to kill yourself or the other person. But there is no need of all these things. It should be a free-floating, free-moving society. In each constitution of the world this sh ould be a birthright of man to choose a partner, to change a partner, without any hindrance from the government or the society because it is an individual affair."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"And when the children are being taken care of by the society there is no problem. And children will not be losing you -- the mother can visit them, the father can visit them; they will be still calling you `father', calling the woman `mother'. To them, nothing has changed. To them, it is perfectly good. In fact they will be very understanding that if love has disappeare d it is good that you have separated, rather than torturing each other your whole life. Life is so simple man has made it so complex unnecessarily.... It seems that the religions of the world, the politicians and other powerful people of the world don't want human beings to be happy. They don't want to be in a state of euphoria, they want them to be miserable. There is some vested intere st in their misery. If they are miserable, continuously burdened with wife, with husband, with children, with parents, with job, with unemployment, they cannot be rebels. They are dying under the burden of their own life. Who has time for rebellion? But if my idea is to (inaudible)(*) spre ad, and people are happy and independent -- joyous, then the vested interest will be in tremendous trouble, because these rebellious people are not burdened wi th anything; their whole energy is available to revolt against anythi ng that hinders human happiness. Just the other day there was a question about drugs. Alcohol is almost universally legal, marijuana is not, LSD is not, Ecstasy is not, and the strange thing is that alcohol is the most dang erous drug out of these four I named. `Ecstasy' has no bad effects, is non-addictive, simply gives you a pleasant feeling, a well-being... it is prohibited. I can't understand. Why you prevent people from feeling well-being? And it hurts nobody. The whole medical research is in favor of it; that it is the absolutely harmless dr ug. It will bring you out of your sadness, make you smile and laugh and dance and song(sic), but it is illegal. You may have to suffer in jail if you are caught with Ecstasy. Marijuana grows in the Himalayas wild and has been used by the people for thousands of years, with no bad effect . It certainly gives you hallucinatory feelings, but rather being in real hell it is better to be in a hallucinatory paradise - - what is wrong in it? If you cannot give a real paradise, at least let people have some glimpse in their dreams, in their hallucinations.... LSD can be more perfected, it can be perfected to the point where anybody can take it without any prescription and ca n feel immensely good, healthy, full of energy, and can see life in its utter beauty ... the same rose flower and you see it for the first time radiating, surrounded by a aura of light. LSD intensifies your sensitivity. All pe ople are not born with sensitivity and nobody is training them to create more sensitivity about beauty, about joy, about compassion. LSD can do that, but LSD is illegal. Alcohol is legal -- which has no plus po ints. Alcohol simply destroys people, helps them to forget, but the next day they fall in a deeper ditch -- the hangover."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"In Kulu, Neelam reported to me that she has a friend who has two friends: one is alcoholic and another lives on marijuan a. The alcoholic has destroyed his whole life, his business is ruined, his family is ruined, he is ruined.

It is in favor of the vested interests. Drugs like `Ecstasy' are not in favor; they are in favor of humanity but they are not in favor of the vested interests. And the same is situation on many fronts. Q: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE BEEN VE RY HARD WITH THE HOMOSEXUAL, ESPECIALLY WITH LESBIAN LADIES. THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SO MUCH CONDEMNED AND DISCRIMI NATED (INAUDIBLE)(*) IN OUR SOCIETY, THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO ADD YOUR CRITICS AGAINST THEM. CAN YOU PLEASE SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THIS. A: I cannot support anything unnatural. It is homosexuality which has brough t humanity to the AIDS and AIDS may destroy two-thirds of humani ty, without nuclear weapons. I am certainly against homosexuality. I am so much against it that even people of very great genius, talents, creativity... I have appreciated them on all accounts but as far as homosexuality is concerne d I cannot support even Socrates. He was a homosexual. His homosexuality destroys much of his credibility that he did not understand Tao -- the way of nature. And homosexuality, moreover, is a relig ious disease. And condemning all the religions, for all the harm they have done to humanity: one of the greatest harm is homosexuality. Because it is these re ligions who started preaching celibacy and started separating man monk*s from female nuns. If you go into the history of three thousa nd years, you will be surprised, the nuns were having discourse with the devil. And a special investigator by the pope was appointed in the middle ages to find out the nuns who had had any sexual contact with the devil. And they tortur ed the nuns, interrogated the nuns, day and night, and finally they managed them to confess; the way they manage in Communist Russia... they can manage to conf ess anything -- just go on torturing, there is a limit to human capacity. Don't let them sleep, don't give them food; finally the woman thinks it is better to accept rather than deny, and then acceptance has to be according to the in vestigator. And thousands of nuns in the middle ages were burned alive because they had confessed. First you force them to confess that they are having intercou rse with devil, and then because they have confessed themselves, you burned them alive. Who was responsible?"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"And the monks created homosexuality. The monks are the cause, if some day humanity is going to die through an ugly disease, AIDS, the whole blame goes to the religions. I am not condemning, I am simply clarifying the situation that the homosexuals should understand that they are victims of a religious tradition and they should come out of it... and it is not difficult , just we have to create places where homosexuals can be hypnotized and convinced for heterosexuality. Lesbians -- religions created, but more than that, now the women's liberation is created. Against man, how a woman can love a man? A woman can only love a woman. No-one knows if homosexuality has brough t to AIDS to what dangerous disease is in the future that lesbianism may bring. It is better to stop it now. And I am not angry. It is my compassion . I would like religious people to make arrangements for homosexuals to be chan ged into heterosexuals -- men or woman. It is their duty, otherwise they should be punished, not homosexuals, not lesbians. But I am against anything that is not in harmony with nature: it is bound to create troubles because nature makes your body in a certain way, your biology in a certain way -- it is made for heterosexuality, it is not made for homosexuality. There is no condemnation in me, there is no criticism either. I am simply putting the facts: all the homosexuals of the world and all the lesbians of the world should protest against the religions, the churches, the pope, that, \"You are responsible for distracting us from our na tural being and you have to pay for it. Now open hospitals, nurseries, where we can be put back in harmony with nature otherwise we are going to destroy your churches, your temples, your mosques, because we are burning we cann ot allow you to be unscratched and nobody is pointing the finger towards you.\" Q: YOU SEEM THE MOST ELEGANT SP IRITUAL FIGURE IN THE WORLD. THE LOOK, WHICH SEEMS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER TODAY, IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TOO?\" A: To me what is important is my truth, is my experience, and certainly the truth changes the look... the experience changes everything. It is such a great inner revolution that the whole body is bound to follow it. Truth brings beauty, compassion, charisma. But just look does not matter to me; what matters is truth. Q: IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEAK BOTH REAGAN'S AND GORBACHOV'S WIVES, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM? "},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"A: Wives are powerful people, as far as their husbands are concerned. Their husbands may be presidents and prime ministers of countries, but before the wife, they are nobody. So I will tell to both the ladies that the whole existence of humanity in your hands.... Dictate to your husbands that it is ti me for Soviet Union and America to be friends and share scientific wisdom for the benefit of all humanity. Otherwise, nag them, throw clothes at them, wake th em in the middle of the night, sit on their chest, beat their ches t -- unless they say \"Okay\". Wives can do miracles. I am reminded of a story: a king was aski ng his close circle of wise people that, \"Can you find a husband in my kingdom who is not henpecked?\" They all said, \"Of course, thousands of people are not henpecked.\" But one man, Birbal who was one of the wisest of all remained silent. The king asked him, \"Birbal, why are you silent?\" He said, \"I am silent because the greatest king of the country is asking the question and I suspect you are a henpec ked husband yourself, and I don't see any possibility of finding another person more powerful than you.\" The king said, \"You are right, but still try. I would like to see a man who is not henpecked.\" So two horses were given to Birbal: one white and one black, great stallions, and he was told that, \"Take these two horses and if you come across a man who is not henpecked let him choose one out of the tw o. These are the best in our kingdom.\" He went to many many people. He knew it is an exercise in futility but finally he reached a small cottage. A wrestler, a very big man, maybe seven feet high, very strong and muscular, was massaging himsel f in the early morning sun. His body was worth seeing -- almost steel. Birbal thought perhaps this is the man; such a strong man cannot be henpecked. He asked the man, \"Are you henpecked?\" He said, \"If you say the word again I wi ll kill you here and now. Take your words back. Me and henpecked?\" Then Birbal said, \"Where is your wife?\" He said, \"She is inside, you can see, preparing my breakfast.\" A very small lady, thin.... Seeing both Birbal was conv inced that he is not a he npecked person. This woman he can throw thousand feet high! What she can do to him. So he said, \"I am satisfied. The order are the king has said who is not a henpecked husband he can choose one stalli on; they are the two greatest horses in the kingdom -- one is white, one is black -- which one you like?\" And he said, \"Wait a minute.\" And he ca lled his wife, \"Darling, should I choose the white or the black.\" The woman said, \"Choose the white! And if you choose the black then remember, nobody is going to be bad than me . I will put you to your senses.\""},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"So the man said to Birbal, \"White.\" Birbal said, \"Now, no more, because you are a henpecked husband -- with all these muscles and with this height, you may be a champion wrestler but before your wife you are nothing. And she is ju st a tiny woman but she challenged you that if you choose the black one, then I will show you who I am. Choose the white! Otherwise I will make your life a hell and you simply have chosen the white. Now I cannot give neither the white nor the black and I have to report to the king that, `Drop this search, ther e is nobody who is not henpecked.'\" So I would like to say to these ladies of the president of Ame rica and Russia, that you have immense power in your hands, you can change the whole course of history -- just scream loudly, break plat es, throw things all around, and your husband is going to say, \"Forgive me, I will do whatever you say.\" What all the pacifists of the world have not been able to do, women can do it.
