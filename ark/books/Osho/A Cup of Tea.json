I received your letter. How lovingly you insist on my writing something, and here am I, drowned in a deep silence! I speak, I work, but I am steeped in emptiness within. 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. There, there is no movement. Thus I seem to be living two lives at one time. What a drama! But perhaps all of life is a drama and becoming aware of this opens the door to a unique freedom. That which is inaction in action stillness in motion eternity in change – that is truth and that is existence. Real life lies in this eternity – everything else is just the stream of dreams. In truth the world is just a dream and the question is not whether to leave these dreams or not, one just has to be aware of them. With this awareness, everything changes. The centre moves. A shift takes place from body to soul. And what is THERE? It cannot be told. It has never been told A Cup of Tea 3 Osho"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and it never will be! There is no other way but to know it for oneself. Death is known only through dying and truth is known only through diving deep within oneself. May God drown you in this truth! 2 Love. I am in bliss. I have been meaning to write for a long time but many engagements prevented me. My blessings, however, I send every day. Life is a sadhana; the more you involve yourself in it the more divine it becomes. The light is hidden in the darkness, truth is hidden, and from THIS comes the joy of searching. I remember the words of a rishi: TRUTH IS HIDDEN UNDER A GOLDEN LID. The golden lid that hides truth is nothing but our mind. The mind has smothered us; we are in it, A Cup of Tea 4 Osho"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. we identify with it, therefore the suffering comes, the bondage and the chain of rebirths. Rise above it, become aware that you are distinct from it – that alone brings bliss, that alone is freedom and the end of birth and death. We have to be what we truly are: this is the only sadhana. It is the frustration of living through desires that brings this sadhana. Become alert about desire and non-attachment begins to appear. This is not to be made to happen, it follows naturally from awareness of attachment. Each one of us has to become aware of his attachments, and keep being so! Nothing should be done unconsciously. If this is remembered one day a totally new kind of revolution takes place in our consciousness. God is leading you towards this revolution – this I know. A Cup of Tea 5 Osho"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. 3 My respects to you. I was extremely pleased to get your letter. So far I have not written anything but a meditation centre has started here where some friends are experimenting. When I have some definite results there is every possibility of my writing something. About my experiments on myself, I am sure and certain, but I want to test their usefulness to others. I do not want to write anything in the manner of philosophy, my outlook is scientific. I want to say something about yoga based on certain psychological and para-psychological experiments. There are many illusory notions held about it and these have to be refuted. Therefore I am experimenting here also. It is clear to me that this work is not for promoting any group or cause. If you ever come here we can talk more about all this. 4 My respects to you. I am grateful for your affectionate letter. A Cup of Tea 6 Osho"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. You are meditating – that is a matter for joy. Drop all ideas of achieving in meditation, just do it naturally; what happens, happens on its own. One day, effortlessly, everything starts happening by itself. Effort does not lead to meditation, in fact it is a hindrance. In effort, practice, study, there is tension. Any expectation, even the expectation of peace, brings restlessness. The tension has to go. As soon as this happens a divine peace sets in. Stop feeling: I AM DOING IT; realize instead: I LEAVE MYSELF IN THE HANDS OF THAT-WHICH-IS. Surrender, surrender yourself completely; as soon as you do this, emptiness comes. Breathing and the body are becoming relaxed, you say. This will happen with the mind too. A Cup of Tea 7 Osho"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. When the mind goes what takes place is indescribable. I know that this is going to happen to you both. Just go on naturally and without purpose. Soon I shall be there, until then, go on quietly with what I have told you to do. My respects to all. Write whenever you feel like it. I am in complete bliss. 5 Love. It is through God’s grace that you are working towards the discovery of the inner light. That light is definitely there and once it is met all darkness in life disappears. Each step taken within peels away the darkness layer by layer unfolding a world of light in which everything is new. This experience cuts away all bondage – and then comes the realization that it was never there! A Cup of Tea 8 Osho"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Liberation happens to that which is eternally free! I am pleased with your progress. Your letter was received long back but as I was busy there was delay in replying, but my memory of you is always there, along with all those eager for the light. My good wishes flow for ever towards them. We have to keep going. Many times one becomes disheartened on the path but ultimately the thirsty pilgrim reaches the spring. In fact the water is there before the thirst. My kind regards to all. 6 My respects to you. I was away, but your letter followed me here. I am pleased to have it. I see life as full of bliss. Ordinarily, we do not have the eyes to see this and so are deprived of it, but this seeing can be created. Perhaps it is not correct to say it can be created; it is already there, it is only a matter of opening the eyes, A Cup of Tea 9 Osho"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and then – everything changes. Meditation achieves this. Meditation means: peace; emptiness. This emptiness is there but is concealed by the flow of thoughts. As thoughts cease it comes into view. It seems difficult to become free of thoughts but it is very simple. The mind seems very restless but it can easily settle. The key to this transcendence is witnessing. One has to be a witness, an observer of the mind. One has to watch it, just watch it. The moment the witness state dawns, that very moment one becomes free of thoughts. This in turn opens the door to bliss and then this very world changes into a new world altogether. Keep meditating. Results will come slowly. You are not to worry about that, their coming is certain. A Cup of Tea 10 Osho"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. My kind regards to all. 7 Love. It is a long time since I received your letter. I am happy that you long for peace – but drop this idea that you are way behind. Nobody is lagging behind. It is just a matter of turning in – and the drop becomes the ocean. Actually the drop IS the ocean but it does not know it – that is the only separation. In the emptiness of meditation even this separation goes. Meditation is the centre of life’s sadhana. The thought process will slow down and in its place will come peace and emptiness. When thoughts vanish the seer, the witness, becomes visible and the complex of the unconscious disappears. This complex is the cause of bondage. In the beginning it appears as hard as stone but the seeker who practises patiently finds one day that it was just a dream, A Cup of Tea 11 Osho"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. a puff of air. May the seed of your meditation blossom into the flower of SAMADHI! My kind regards to all. The rest when we meet. 8 My respects to you. Moving around for the whole of May affected my health so all programmes for June: Bombay, Calcutta, Jaipur, were cancelled. I am glad to hear you are experimenting with SAMADHI YOGA. Don’t worry about results, just be with the experimenting. The return is bound to come one day – not gradually but all of a sudden, effortlessly, without one’s knowing, it happens. Within a moment life becomes wonderfully different! I am not writing anything on Bhagwan Mahavir at the moment. There is no urge whatsoever in me to write. But if you persuade me it is a different thing! Everything else is fine. 9 Love A Cup of Tea 12 Osho"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. I read your letter on the way here. It has touched my heart. If your desire to know life’s truth becomes strong then what is longing today becomes one day the attainment. Burning desire is all that is needed and nothing else. As rivers seek out the ocean so man if he wants to can find the truth. No peak, no mountain can stop him, in fact their challenge awakens his sense of adventure. Truth is within everyone. Rivers have to find the ocean but our ocean is inside us – it is a wonder that so many remain thirsty yet without it. Actually they cannot really want it. There is a saying of Christ’s: Ask and ye shall be given. But if you don’t ask, whose fault is it? There is no better bargain than the attainment of God. We have only to ask, nothing more. A Cup of Tea 13 Osho"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. As the asking grows stronger and stronger so he who asks starts vanishing. A limit is reached, a point of evaporation is reached, where the seeker utterly disappears and only the asking remains. This is the very moment of attainment. Truth is where the I is not – this experience alone is the divine experience. Absence of ego is presence of God. My regards to all there. 10 My respects to you. I was waiting for your letter when it came. I really want your life to be filled with light, for you to surrender yourself to God. God and light are always close by. it is only a matter of opening one’s eyes and then what is ours becomes ours. The distance is just that between the eyelash and the eye – and perhaps not even that much; the eyes are always open only we don’t know it. There is an old story: A Cup of Tea 14 Osho"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. A fish had long heard stories about the ocean. She began to fret about it so one day she asked the Queen of Fishes: What is this ocean and where is it? The Queen was surprised. She said: The ocean? Why, you are in the very ocean itself! Your very existence, your very life, is in the ocean. It is within you The ocean is your everything, but for the ocean, you are nothing. For this very reason the fish couldn’t see the ocean! And for this very reason we are unable to find God. But He can be found – by being empty. In the state of emptiness we meet Him for God is emptiness. I am in bliss, or shall I say – Bliss alone is and I am not! 11 My respects to you. A Cup of Tea 15 Osho"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. I received your letter, I was waiting for it. The trip to Rajnagar was blissful. Religion robbed of the spirit of yoga has become a matter of morality only, thereby losing its soul. Morality is negative. Life cannot be based on negation, negation cannot nourish life. The emphasis has to be on attainment not on renunciation. It is not a question of renouncing ignorance but of attaining understanding, it is this that has to be central. Practise has to be positive and this sadhana can happen through yoga. In my talks with Acharya Tulsi, Muni Shri Nathamaljee and others I have stressed this point. Many letters have come from Rajnagar and Rajasthan in this connection; as you have said it seems some fruitful work has been accomplished by going there. One thing is very clear: people are eager for a spiritual life and current forms of religion do not satisfy them. A Cup of Tea 16 Osho"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. If however the right religion is given to them it can revolutionize human consciousness. I think of you. May God grant you peace. My love and regards to all. 12 My respects to you. All your letters arrived in good time but as I have been busy I could not reply sooner. I have been out most of the time and I have just returned after speaking in Jaipur, Burhanpur, Hoshangabad, Chanda and other places. How thirsty people are for spiritual life! Seeing this I am surprised that some people say man has lost all interest in religion. This can never be. No interest in religion means no interest in life, bliss, the ultimate. Consciousness is by nature God-oriented and it can only be satisfied by attaining God the state of satchitananda, the truth-awareness-bliss state of being. A Cup of Tea 17 Osho"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Hidden within one in the form of a seed is the very source of religious birth, therefore whilst religions may come ant go religion can never die. I am glad to know that you feel patient about your progress towards the light. Patience is the most important thing of all in spiritual life. How long one must wait after sowing the seed! At first all the effort seems wasted, nothing seems to happen, and then one day the waiting ends and there is actuality – the seed breaks, pushes through the earth – into a plant! But remember that even when nothing seemed to be happening the seed was working away under the soil. It is the same with the seeker for truth – when nothing appears to be happening much is happening. The fact is that all growth of life-energy is unseen and unknown. Only the results can be observed not the progress. I am in bliss. I want you to come closer to God. Forget about results, just keep going on your path; let the fruits come by themselves. One day one wonders: What has happened! A Cup of Tea 18 Osho"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. What was I! What have I become! Compared to the results all the effort seems negligible. My love to all. 13 My respects to you. I have just returned from Rajnagar in Rajasthan. I was invited to a religious function there organized by Acharya Shree Tulsi. I put four hundred monks and nuns through an experiment in meditation. The results were extraordinary. In my view meditation is the essence of all religious practice. All the rest – such as non-violence, renunciation of wealth, celibacy etc. – are just its consequences. With the attainment of samadhi, the culmination of meditation, all these things come by themselves, they just happen naturally. Since we forgot this central sadhana A Cup of Tea 19 Osho"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. all our efforts have been external and superficial. True sadhana IS not just ethical, it is basically yoga practice. Ethics ALONE are negative and nothing enduring can be constructed on negation. Yoga is positive and can therefore form a base. I want to convey this positive basis to all. 14 Love. I have received your very affectionate letter. You write that my words ring in your ears; what I want is for their echo to carry you into that space where everything is silent, empty. This is the way from words to emptiness. There one meets oneself. I am in bliss. Take my love I have nothing else to offer, it is my only wealth. The marvel of it is that the more of it you give the more it becomes. Real wealth is like that – it grows as you give it away; and if it diminishes – it is not wealth at all. A Cup of Tea 20 Osho"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Write again, for not only do you wait for my letters, I too wait for yours. 15 Love. On returning from the meditation camp I had to leave town again. I returned only last night but I thought of you all the time. I cannot forget the thirst for God I saw in your eyes and the striving for truth in your heart. This is a blessing because no one can attain without passing through this anguish. Remember, thirst is a prerequisite for the birth of light and love. Together, light and love are God. When love has no limits its flame becomes smokeless and so divine. I have seen the seeds of this growth within you and it fills my soul with great joy. The seed is there, now it has to become a tree. It could be that the time is at hand. God-realization cannot happen without meditation so A Cup of Tea 21 Osho"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. you must turn towards this now with courage and perseverance. I have great hopes – will you fulfil them? My regards to other friends there. I wait for your letter. Remember what I said about the blank paper? Everything else is fine. I am in bliss. 16 Love. I received your letter. What you say has made me very happy. Words that come out of the depth and fullness of heart echo the infinite just as a tiny flower expresses infinite beauty. When love breathes life into words what is expressed is not what is said but what wants to be said. Inside each of us there is a poet, there is poetry, but because we live on the surface these are never born. Those who go deep A Cup of Tea 22 Osho"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. awaken divine love and this love fills their lives with music, beauty, peace and poetry – their very lives become music and on to this stage truth descends. Truth will descend where there is music so life must be turned into a melody. Only through music can one reach the truth. You too have to become music, the entire life, every little act, has to be turned into music: this happens through love. Whatever is – love it. Feel love for the whole world. Feeling love for all with every breath brings the inner music. Have you ever seen this happen? See this, fill yourself with love and see. Whatever breaks up the inner music – that alone is irreligion, that alone is sin, and whatever fills us with music – that is religion, that alone is religion. Love is religion A Cup of Tea 23 Osho"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. because love is beauty, love is music. Love is God because it is all that is needed to attain Him. Give my love to everybody there and feel the light of my love beside you. 17 Love. I have received your letter. You long for the peace I have within me. It is yours any time. It is the deepest possibility in everyone, it only has to be uncovered. As springs of water lie hidden under layers of earth so does bliss lie hidden within us. The possibility is there for everyone but only those who dig for it can redeem it. The excavation of these hidden treasures lies through religion. Digging with it one reaches the well of light within. I have shown you how to dig and what with, but the digging has to be done by you. I know your soil is absolutely ready, with very A Cup of Tea 24 Osho"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. little effort the infinite streams can be reached. This state of mind is attained with the greatest good fortune so don’t waste it or miss this opportunity. Fill yourself with determination and leave the rest to God. Truth runs alongside will. Don’t hesitate to write, I have lots of time for you. I am for those who need me – nothing in my life is for myself. 18 Love, so much love. I received your letter when I got back. I could feel the ardour of your heart through your words. I well know the fervour that stirs your soul and the thirst that turns into tears within you. I was once there too, I too have suffered it. I can well understand your heart because I have travelled those same paths you now have to take in the quest for God. I too have experienced the longing that one day turns into a raging fire in which one has to A Cup of Tea 25 Osho"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. consume oneself. But this burning brings the birth of a new life. The drop can only become the ocean when it ceases to exist. Continue your efforts in meditation; you have to go deeper and deeper into it – it is the only way. Through it and it alone call one reach life’s truth. Remember: lf you become absorbed in sadhana, fully committed and surrendered, you are bound to reach the truth. This is an eternal law. No step taken towards God is ever wasted. My regards to all. 19 My respects to you. Your letters were received. I have just got back from a camp at Ranakpur. It was just for friends from Rajasthan, that’s why you weren’t informed. It lasted five days and about sixty people participated. A Cup of Tea 26 Osho"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. It was a wonderful success and it was obvious that much happened. Encouraged by the results the organizers are planning a camp on an all-India basis. You must come to that. I am glad to hear your meditation is progressing. You have only to be silent. To be silent is everything. Silence does not mean absence of speech, it means absence of thoughts. When the mind quietens down it becomes linked to the infinite. Don’t do anything, just sit and watch the flow of thoughts, just watch. This just watching dissolves thought by itself. The awakening of witnessing brings freedom from the modifications of the mind. With thoughts finished, consciousness is. This is samadhi. Love to all friends. 20 Love Last night when lamps and lamps were lit up all over town A Cup of Tea 27 Osho"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. I thought: My Sohan too, must have lit lamps and a few among them must surely be for me! And then I began to see the lamps you had lit, and also those your love has kept lit always. I shall stay here another day. I have talked of you to everybody and they are eager to meet you. 21 Beloved! Your letter came, and your photo too. You look really simple and innocent in it! Such love and devotion! The heart when purified by love turns into a temple and I can see this clearly in your photo. May God help this simple innocence grow! Two thousand years ago someone asked Christ: Who can enter the kingdom of heaven Jesus pointed to a little child and said: Those whose hearts are as innocent as a child’s. Looking at your picture today, I remembered this story. 22 Love. I have only just arrived here, the train was five A Cup of Tea 28 Osho"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. hours late. You wanted me to write as soon as I got here so I am doing so. Throughout the journey I thought of you and of the tears falling from your eyes. Nothing in the world is more sacred than tears of love and joy. Such tears, so pure, are not of this world. Though part of the body, they express something which is not. Whatever can I give you in return. 23 Love. I looked for your letter as soon as I got here yesterday. Though it was Sunday, I kept waiting for it. It came this evening – how much you write in so few words! When the heart is full it pours into the words and so few are needed. An ocean of love can be contained in just a jug! As for scriptures on love – it is enough to know the four letters of the word! Do you know how many times I read through your A Cup of Tea 29 Osho"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. letters? 24 Love. Your letter arrived this morning. The garland you have weaved from flowers of love has a fragrance that I can catch! And the love-vine you have sown spreads through my heart! The tears of your love and joy bring light and strength to my eyes! How blissful it all is! 25 Love. I am in bliss. It was good that you met me in Bombay, my heart was overjoyed to see what is happening in you. This is how a person prepares and moves along the stairway towards truth. Life is a dual journey: one journey is in time and space the other is within oneself and truth. The first ends in death A Cup of Tea 30 Osho"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. the second in deathlessness. The second is the real journey because it takes you somewhere. Those who take the first journey as it, waste their lives the real life begins the day you start the other journey. A really good beginning has taken place in your consciousness and I am filled with bliss to feel this. 26 Love. On my return home from the tour I looked for your letter. It came together with the grapes so the letter, already sweet, became still sweeter. I am in bliss. Your love enhances it yet more and the love of all makes it infinite. One body – so much bliss! What else can others do but envy he who feels all bodies to be his! May God make you envious of me, may everybody envy me, A Cup of Tea 31 Osho"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. this is my prayer. 27 Love. Your letter reached me as I was sitting on that very same spot on the grass! What I was thinking then I shall tell you only when we meet. What a fragrance memories leave behind! When life is filled with love it is so blissful Life’s only paupers are those without love in their hearts, and how to describe the good fortune of those whose hearts hold nothing but love! In moments of such abundance one encounters God. Only love alone have I known as God. 28 Love. I received your letter. I am blissful to learn of your bliss This for me IS bliss With every breath A Cup of Tea 32 Osho"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. I pray for all to be filled with bliss. This is my understanding of religion. The religion that ends in temples, mosques, churches, is a dead religion. A religion that fails to go beyond dead words and doctrines has no significance An authentic and living religion unites one with the whole and leads one to the whole. Religion is whatever unites you with the cosmos. Whatever feelings lead you towards this marvellous meeting and merging are prayers, and all those prayers can be expressed in a single word; that word is love. What does love want? Love wants to share with all the bliss it has. Love wants to share itself with everyone! To give of oneself unconditionally – that is love. A Cup of Tea 33 Osho"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. To love is to dedicate one’s being to the whole as the drop surrenders to the sea. I pulsate with such love. It has filled my life with nectar and light. Now I have only one wish: that what has happened to me should happen to all! Give my love to everyone there. 29 Love. I received your letter. How did you hurt your finger? It sounds as if you are not taking care of your body. And why the restless mind? In this dreamlike world there is nothing worth making the mind restless for. Peace is the greatest bliss and there is nothing worth losing it for. Meditate on it. Just being aware of the truth brings about inner change. I think you won’t be coming to Udaipur to assist me and that’s on your mind. A Cup of Tea 34 Osho"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Come if you can, if you can’t – never mind, you are helping me all the time. Isn’t one’s love help enough? If you don’t come I will miss you because the camp at Udaipur is linked for me with being with you, so I am hoping you can come. Regards to all. 30 Love, and lots of it. I looked at once for your letter amongst the pile waiting for me on my return. I can’t tell you how glad I was to get it – written by hand, too. You write: Now your presence is felt in your absence. love really IS presence. Where there is love space and time vanish, and where there is no love Even what is near in space and time keeps immeasurably apart. Only lovelessness separates A Cup of Tea 35 Osho"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and love is the only nearness. Those who find total love discover everything within themselves. The whole world then is inside, not outside and the moon and stars lie in the inner sky. In this fullness of love, ego vanishes. I want God to lead you to this fullness. 31 I arrived here yesterday and have been thinking of writing ever since but it didn’t happen until now. Forgive the delay though even a single day’s delay is no small delay! What shall I say about the return journey? It was very blissful. I kept sleeping, and you were with me. It appeared I had left you behind but actually you were still with me. This is the being-together that is so real that it cannot be divided. Physical nearness is not nearness, there can be no union on that level, only an unbridgeable gulf, but there is another nearness which is not of the body, and its name is love. A Cup of Tea 36 Osho"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Once gained it is never lost. Then no separation exists despite vast distances in the visible world. If you can arrive at this distancelessness with even one other it can be found with everybody. One is the door, the all, the goal. The beginning of love is through ONE, the end is ALL. The love that unites you with everything, with nothing excluded, I call religion, and the love that stops ANYWHERE I call sin. 32 I received your letter; I have been waiting for it ever since I returned. But how sweet it is to wait! Life itself is a waiting! Seeds wait to sprout, rivers to reach the ocean. What does man wait for? He too is the seed for some tree, a river for some ocean. Whoever looks deep inside finds that a longing for the endless and boundless is his very being, A Cup of Tea 37 Osho"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and whoever recognizes this begins his journey towards God because who can be thirsty and not look for water? This has never happened and never will! Where there is longing, there is thirst for attainment. I want to make everyone aware of this thirst. I want to convert everyone’s life into a waiting. The life that has turned into a waiting for God is the true life. All other ways of life are just a waste, a disaster. 33 Love. I received your letter. Its poetry filled my heart. It is said that poetry is born out of love in your letter I saw this happen. Where there is love the whole existence becomes a poem; the flowers of life bloom under the light of love. It is strange that you ask why my heart holds so much love for you. Can love ever be caused? A Cup of Tea 38 Osho"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. If it is, can it be called love? Oh, my mad friend! love is always uncaused! This is its mystery, and its purity. Love is divine and belongs to the kingdom of God because it is uncaused. As for me l am filled with love as a lamp is filled with light. To see this light one needs eyes. You have those eyes so you saw the light. The credit is yours, not mine. 34 Love. I never imagined that you would write such a loving letter! And you say that you are uneducated! There is no knowledge greater than love, and those who lack love – these are the true illiterates, because the heart is the real thing in life not the intellect. Bliss and light spring from the heart not from the A Cup of Tea 39 Osho"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. mind, and you have so much heart – that is enough! Can there be a better witness of this than me? I am surprised that you write asking me to point out any mistakes you have made. So far on earth, love has not made one mistake. All mistakes happen through lack of love, in fact this for me is the only mistake in life. Writing you you: May God make you envious of me was no mistake. I would like the bliss that has arisen in my heart to make you thirst for it more and more. Queen of Mewal! there is no reason for you to worry about it! 35 Love. It was just this time of night, two days ago that I left you at Chittor. I can see now the love and bliss filling your eyes. The secret of all prayer and worship is hidden in the overflow of those tears. They are sacred. God fills the heart of those he blesses with tears of love, A Cup of Tea 40 Osho"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and what to say about the calamity of those whose hearts are filled instead with thorns of hate? Tears flowing in love are offerings of flowers at the feet of God and the eyes from which they flow are blessed with divine vision. Only eyes filled with love can see God. Love is the only energy that transcends the inertia of nature and takes one to the shores of ultimate awareness. I think that by the time this letter reaches you you will already have left for Kashidham. I don’t know how your journey was but I hope it passed in song and laughter. Give my kind respects to everyone there. I am waiting, for your promised letters. 36 Love. I was very happy to meet you the other day. I felt the stirrings of your heart and the longing of your soul. You have not yet flowered as you were born to: the seed is ready to sprout and the soil is right you will A Cup of Tea 41 Osho"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. not have long to wait. But now you have to work with great determination. It is only a matter of starting the journey, God’s gravitational pull does the rest. 37 Love. It is good that you are forgetting the past it will open up an altogether new dimension of life. To live completely in the present is freedom. The past does not exist apart from memory and nor does the future apart from castles in the air.

To have this thirst is a divine blessing; where there is thirst – there the way is. In fact, intense longing becomes the way. God is summoning us at every moment but because the strings of our heart are slack we don’t echo His call. If our eyes are closed then even if the sun is at the door we will be in darkness; and the sun is always at the door – we only have to open our eyes and let it in, that’s all! May God give you light, that’s my wish. My love and I are always with you. Regards to the family and love to the children. 39 Love. I have your letter.

Our deepest powers are aroused by it, the unorganized energy becomes organized and then there is music. What tremendous energy exists in this atom of self! But it can’t be known without utter intensity of will. You must have seen rocks that even the strongest chisel cannot break, and yet the sprouting shrub or plant slips cracks and crevices through it so easily! When the tiniest seed is filled with determination to push through and reach the sun, even the hardest rock has to give way. So a weak seed wins over the mighty rocks!

You ask me about sex. That energy too belongs to God and through meditation it too can be transformed. No energy is bad but there can, of course, be wrong use of energy. When sex energy flows upwards it turns into brahmacharya (celibacy). It is good that you are becoming detached from it but that isn’t enough. You have to go through it to transform it, rejection just leaves you arid and dry! It is true you are not alone in your sex life A Cup of Tea 47 Osho"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. but sex is not essentially of the body at all but a modification of the mind. If the mind is completely transformed it affects the other person too, and one who is related so intimately is quickly affected. Until we meet, keep in mind that: there should be no calculated ill-will towards sex – cultivated detachment is useless: stay aware whilst making love, be a witness in this situation; if one can stay in a state of meditation and right-mindfulness then the sex energy can be successfully transformed. We shall talk more about this when we meet. Brahmacharya is a complete science in itself and many doors to bliss open on that path. Still, the very first thing is a friendly attitude towards all one’s energies. Enmity towards them does not lead to spiritual revolution but to self-destruction. Give my regards to all there.

We can talk about it in detail when we meet but first of all: the sense of humour should be directed towards oneself – it is a very great thing to laugh at oneself and he who can laugh at himself gradually becomes full of concern and compassion for others. In the entire world no event, no subject, invites laughter like oneself. About the truth of dreams as well we shall have to talk in detail. Some dreams are definitely true. As the mind quietens down glimpses of truth begin to appear in dreams. Dreams are of four kinds – those concerned with past lives, – those concerned with the future, – those concerned with the present, A Cup of Tea 49 Osho"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. – and those concerned with repressed desires. Contemporary psychology knows something about the fourth type only. I am glad to know that your mind moves towards being at peace. Mind is what we want it to be, peace and restlessness are both our own creations. Man binds himself with his own chains and so he is always at liberty to become free of the mind. 44 Love. What gift is greater than love? And still you ask – What have I given? Oh, mad one! When love is given there is nothing left to give, not even the giver, for to give love is to give oneself.

I think the day was the eleventh of December, but even this is not certain. But tell your astrologer friend not to worry; the future will simply come, there’s no point in worrying about it.

I have your letter and your question. Wherever I is there is a barrier; In fact, the i-attitude is the one and only barrier, so sleeping, waking, sitting, walking – always be aware of it; see it, recognize it and remember it wherever and whenever it comes, for recognition spells its death. It is not the truth but just a dream, and as soon as one becomes aware of dreaming the dream vanishes. Dreams cannot be renounced – how can you give up that which is not? To be aware of it is enough.

And what is joy but the fragrance of love Yet the world is full of mad people seeking happiness their whole lives – but with their backs turned towards love! The doors to God only open when love turns into the prayer of our total being. But perhaps HIS doors are already open, yet eyes dosed to love will, even so, never be able to see them.

I have got your letter. I know well how your soul thirsts; soon it can be quenched – you are right at the brink of the lake; you only have to open your eyes, and I can see that the lids are about to lift.

It is just not possible on this earth, communication seems impossible – but at times the impossible happens. The other day it did.

I have received your letters – but they are not just letters really, they are poems born out of love, out of love and prayer, for where there is love there is prayer. So it is possible to get glimpses of God through another whom one loves – love providing the eyes that can see God. Love is the door through which He appears. So when one loves all he can be seen in all things.

So the search for love is really the search for God, because love melts, and also destroys; because love only melts and only destroys. It is both birth and death. In it the self dies and THE ALL is born. So there is certainly pain – in the birth as well as in the death. Love is a deep anguish of birth as well as death. But the poetry flowering in you shows that you have begun to experience the joy that lies in love’s anguish. 57 Love. Your letter has filled my heart with joy.

Take life easily and naturally, just as it comes. Welcome it in its endless forms with an attitude of complete acceptance. And do not impose yourself on life; life has its own discipline, its own wisdom, and those who are ready to live totally have no need for any other discipline or wisdom. But you have always been afraid of life and therefore you are afraid of love. Now life has begun penetrating you, breaking your walls of security. So, God’s infinite grace showers on you!

Be aware in the waking state, don’t try to become aware in sleep or dreams. If you become aware in the waking state awareness in dreams and sleep comes easily – but you don’t have to do anything for it, doing only creates difficulties. Sleep reflects the waking state: what we are when awake we are in sleep. If we are asleep in the waking state only then is sleep really SLEEP; the stream of thoughts during the waking state becomes the web of dreams in sleep. Being aware in the waking state will begin to reflect itself in sleep too, and if there are no thoughts in the waking state dreams disappear altogether in sleep. Everything else is fine.

Silence can speak even where words fail. The void envelops even that which lines cannot contain, in fact what can resist the embrace of the great void? Nothing is left unsaid by silence. Where words fail, silence is full of meaning. Where form ends, the formless begins. Where knowledge (VEDA) ends, transcendental knowledge (VEDANTA) begins. When knowledge dies, the beyond begins. Freedom from the word is truth. 60 Love. How can I describe how happy I am to have received your letter? Whenever I saw you, only one question arose in my mind – How long are you going to keep away from me? I knew you had to come closer to me, it was only a matter of time, so I kept waiting and praying for you. To me, prayerful waiting is love. I also knew you were going through the pangs of a A Cup of Tea 64 Osho"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. new birth and that rebirth is very near – for only this can give soul to your songs. Words are the form and form has its own beauty, its own melody, its own music, but this is not enough, and he who considers this enough remains discontented for ever. The soul of poetry lies in silence. To me, prayerful waiting is love, and the void is the door to the divine temple. You have come to me and I want to take you to the Lord for how can you come close to me without first coming closer to Him? In fact without coming close to Him you cannot come close even to yourself. Then as so on as you come near Him you attain that life for which you have gone through so many lives. To come close to oneself is to be reborn – the principle of being twice born is just this. And remember, not even the pebbles lying on the road are just pebbles; they too await a new birth, for that second birth turns them into diamonds. P.S. To run after desires is to run after a mirage.

I don’t say: seek and you will find. I say: he who loses himself, finds. 62 Love. I was happy to receive your letter.

Dogen has these beautiful words to say: Do not strive after moksha (liberation); rather, allow all your actions to become liberating. This happens.

The ocean is very near – but only for those who float but do not swim. Do not be afraid of drowning because that fear makes you swim – and the truth is that he who drowns himself in God is saved for ever; and do not have a goal, for he who has a goal begins to swim. Remember always – wherever one reaches, that is a the destination, therefore he who makes God his goal goes astray. Wherever the mind is free from all goals – there alone is God. 66 Love.

Truth is like the sky: eternal, everlasting, boundless. Is there a door to enter the sky? Then how can there be one to enter into truth? If our eyes are closed, the sky exists not.

I take life as a whole and I am incapable of viewing it in bits and pieces; it is already the whole but because it has been viewed in fragments for so long it has become perverted. There is no politics, no morality, no religion; there is LIFE, there is God, whole and unfragmented.

As things are, this delay in understanding the truth is unavoidable, but seekers of truth won’t be afraid – courage is the first condition in the search for truth.

Spirituality has to be turned into a force, spirituality has to be turned into a revolution, only then can spirituality be saved. My regards to all. 71 Love. Man becomes a slave because he is afraid to be alone, so he needs a crowd, a society, an organization. Fear is the basis of all institutions, and how can a frightened mind know the truth?

Work you must, but leave the results to God. Nothing in life is ever wasted, especially steps taken towards truth. But at times impatience comes, impatience comes with thirst, but this is an obstacle. Keep the thirst and throw the impatience. Do not confuse impatience with thirst.

Life is without purpose – life is its own purpose, therefore he who lives without purpose truly lives. Live! Isn’t living itself enough? The desire to have more than just life is a result of not properly living – and that is why the fear of death grips the human mind, for what is death to one who is really alive! Where living is intense and total there is no time to fear death – and there is no time for death, either. Do not think in the language of purpose – that language is diseased in itself.

Total relaxation, with complete freedom from effort, is the supreme goal. Then life is a play, and then even effort becomes play. Poetry, philosophy, religion are the fruits of repose. This has not been available to everyone but technology and science will make it so in the near future. That is why I am in favour of technology. Those who attribute intrinsic value to labour oppose the use of machines – they have to. For me, labour has no such intrinsic value: on the A Cup of Tea 74 Osho"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. contrary, I see it as a burden. As long as work is a prerequisite for rest it cannot be blissful. When work flows out of a state of rest voluntarily then it is blissful. So I cannot call rest a sin. Nor do I support sacrifice. I do not want anyone to live for anybody else, or one generation to sacrifice itself for another. Such sacrifices turn out to be very costly – those who make them expect an inhuman return. This is why fathers expect the impossible from their sons. If each father lives for his son who will live for himself? For every son is a potential father. No, I want everyone to live for himself – for his own happiness, his own state of rest. When a father is happy he does much more for his son – and easily, because it comes out of his happiness. Then there is neither sacrifice nor renunciation; what he does comes naturally out of his being a father – A Cup of Tea 75 Osho"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and a happy father at that. Then he has no inhuman expectations of his son and where there is no pressure from expectations, expectations are fulfilled – out of the son being a son. In short, I teach each person to be selfish. Altruistic teachings have taught man nothing but suicide. and a suicidal man is always homicidal; the unhappy sow their sorrow amongst others. I am also against the sacrifice of the present for the future, because what is is always present; if you live in it totally the future will be born out of it – and when it comes it too will be the present. For he who has the habit of sacrificing the present for the future the future never comes because whatever comes is again always sacrificed for that which has not yet come. Finally, you ask why i too work for others and for the future. First of all, I do not work. Whatever I do flows out of my state of rest. I do not swim, I just float. No one can ever do anything for another but if something happens to others out of what I A Cup of Tea 76 Osho"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. am, that is something else, and there too I am not the doer. As for the future – for me, the present is everything. And the past too is also a present – that has passed away; and the future too – that is a present that is yet to come. Life is always here and now so I do not bother about past and future. And it is amazing that ever since I stopped worrying about them they have begun to worry about me! My regards to all there. 75 There is a music which has no sound; the soul is restless for such silent music. There is a love in which the body is not; the soul longs for such unembodied love. There is a truth which has no form; the soul longs for this formless truth. Therefore melodies do not satisfy, bodies do not satisfy and forms cannot fulfil the soul.

Do not depend on any other wealth, riches of any other kind bring only disaster. St. Theresa wanted to set up a large orphanage but at the time she had only three shillings.

On the road to God the only sustenance is infinite hope – hope shining like the north star in darkness, hope keeping you company like a shadow in loneliness. Dark and lonely life’s path certainly is – but only for those without hope.

Fifty years passed; the envelope remained with Macmillan as it was – sealed. Someone asked him the reason for this and he A Cup of Tea 81 Osho"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. replied: For one thing I want to keep faith with the unknown sender, and for another, I have never given up hope. What priceless words! – Ihave never given up hope 81 Love. I am delighted you have taken sannyas. A life without the flower of sannyas is like a barren tree. Sannyas is the supreme music of life. It is not renunciation, on the contrary, it is life’s highest enjoyment. Someone who finds diamonds and pearls is not going to bother about pebbles and stones. But note – he does not renounce them, interest simply drops away. 82 Love. Thought is man’s strength but blind belief has robbed him of it, that is why he has become weak and impotent. Think fully, think tirelessly, for amazingly enough the state of no-thought A Cup of Tea 82 Osho"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. is achieved only at the peak of thought, it is the culmination of thought, and at this point all thought becomes useless. In this emptiness, truth lies. 83 Love. All crutches bar the way. Shun all support and then you will receive His. He is the only help for the helpless. There is no other guide but Him – all other guides are obstacles on the path. If you want to reach the Master avoid all teachers. Don’t be afraid to make yourself empty for that alone is the door, that alone is the path – and that alone is the destination. The courage to be empty is all that is needed to become one with the all. Those who are full stay empty, and those who are empty become filled – such are His mathematics. Do not consider doing anything – through doing you can never reach Him, nor through chanting, A Cup of Tea 83 Osho"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. nor through austerity, for He is already here! Stop and see! To do is to run, not to do is to halt. Yes! If He were far away we could run to meet Him, but He is the nearest of the near! If we had lost Him we could search for and find Him, hut to us He has never been lost! 84 Love. I am glad to have received your letter. The I is not to be given up because – how can you drop that which is not? The I has to be looked into, understood. It is like taking a lamp to search for darkness – the darkness vanishes! Darkness cannot be stamped out because it doesn’t exist. You just have to bring a light and darkness is unmasked. It is the same with your thoughts – do not fight with them; the effort to be free of thought comes A Cup of Tea 84 Osho"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. itself from a thought. Know your thoughts, watch them, be aware of them, then they quieten down without difficulty. Witnessing finally leads to emptiness and where there is emptiness – there is the ALL. 85 Love. Why does man suffer so much? Because in his life there is pandemonium but no soundless music, Because in his life there is a babble of thoughts but no emptiness, because in his life there is a turmoil of feeling but no equanimity, because in his life there is a mad rushing around but no stillness which knows no directions, and finally because in his life there is much of himself but of God, nothing at all. 86 Love. The time is ripe. The hour draws nearer every day. Innumerable souls are restless. A Cup of Tea 85 Osho"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. A path has to be created for them. So hurry! Work hard! Surrender totally! Forget yourself! Plunge into God’s work like a madman; here, only madness will do – and there is no greater wisdom than such madness for God. 87 Love. Non-attachment is not concerned with things but with thoughts. Non-attachment is not related to the outside but to the within. Non-attachment is not to do with the world but with oneself. One day a beggar went to see a Sufi fakir and found him seated on a velvet cushion inside a beautiful tent with its ropes tied to golden pegs. Seeing all this the beggar cried: What is this! Honourable Fakir, I have heard much about your spirituality and non-attachment, but I am completely disillusioned by all this ostentation around you.

So saying, he immediately got up and walked off with the beggar not even waiting to put his sandals on! After a short while the beggar became distressed. I left my begging bowl in your tent, he said. What shall I do without it! Please wait here while I go and fetch it. The Sufi laughed. My friend, he said, the gold pegs of my tent were stuck in the earth not in my heart, but your begging bowl is still chasing after you! To be in the world is not attachment. The presence of the world in the mind is the attachment, and when the world disappears from the mind – this is non-attachment. 88 Love. Once the ego is surrendered there is no suffering, no sorrow, for the ego is basically the cause of all suffering and the moment it is seen that everything is God there is no more cause for complaint. Where complaining has ended, there is prayer. It is a feeling of gratitude, it is trust in God. A Cup of Tea 87 Osho"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. In this trust in God, benediction pours. Trust and know. It is very difficult to trust but there is no austerity greater than accepting life as it is. 89 Love. Do not look for results in meditation – this is an obstruction. Do not seek to repeat any meditative experience, for this too is a hindrance. When meditating, just meditate, the rest then happens by itself. The way to God does not lie in our hands so leave yourself in His. Surrender, surrender, surrender! Remember always – surrender! Sleeping or waking – remember! Surrender is the only door to God. Emptiness is the only boat that sails to Him. 90 Love. How much longer will you go on letting your energy sleep?

Don’t waste time in conflict, lose no time in doubt – time can never be recovered and if you miss an opportunity, it may take many lives before another comes your way again. 91 Love. I received your letter. Do not fall into the whirl of calming the mind; this in itself is the restlessness. The mind is what it is, accept it as such. This acceptance brings peace. Rejection is restlessness, acceptance is peace – and he who reaches total acceptance attains to God. There is no other way than this. Understand this well because this understanding brings acceptance. Acceptance cannot come from an act of will – the action of will is itself non-accepting; I DO conceals non-acceptance because will is always of the ego. Ego cannot live unless fed by rejection.

Ah, how can there he restlessness without desire? 92 Love. Search, search and search – so much that finally the seeker vanishes. There you meet Him. Where the I is lost, there He is. There is not, and never has been, any wall between – except for the I. 93 Love. When the moon lifts into the sky watch it, be absorbed by it – forget everything else, including yourself!

He who knows this music knows life too – its song is another word for God. 94 Love. Don’t float with the current of thoughts, just be aware of them. Know that you are separate from them, distinct, distant, just an observer. Just watch the flow of thoughts like traffic, watch than as you watch the dry leaves flying everywhere in the fall. Don’t be the one who makes them happy, don’t be the one to whom they happen. Then the rest takes place by itself.

This is a good beginning to the struggle and I am glad to have pushed you into it Sannyas is a challenge to the world, a fundamental declaration of freedom. To live in freedom every moment is sannyas. Now, insecurity will be with you always, but that is a fact of life. The only certainty is death and life IS insecurity, and that is its joy and its beauty. To be locked in security is suicide, a living death effected by one’s own hand. Such living-dead are everywhere, they have turned the world into a graveyard, and they number amongst them many celebrated corpses. They all have to be awakened. though for their part they are trying to put back to sleep even those who are awake. Now the struggle will go on and on In it your total resolution will be born.

My regards to everyone there. 97 Love. My work is only God’s work; apart from this there is neither me nor mine. No other work exists apart from His. You just live in God, that’s all, and the rest happens by itself. Jesus sail: First seek ye the Kingdom of God, then all else will be added unto you. I say the same.

The fragrance of SANNYAS has to be spread around the world. Religions like goals have imprisoned the flower of sannyas too within their great walls. Hence the SANNYASIN has to say now: I belong to no religion – all religions are mine. It was an awful mistake to tear sannyas away from the world. It has become bloodless. And the world without sannyas has lost its life. A new bridge has to be built between the two. Sannyas has to be given back its blood and the world, its soul. Sannyas has to be returned to samsara, fearless and unattached, in the world yet not of it, in the crowds, yet alone! And the world has to be fetched to sannyas too, fearless and unattached.

Even the impossible is not impossible if resolution is there, and even the possible becomes impossible if one lacks will. The world we live in is our own creation. The time gap between sowing and reaping creates confusion. Because cause and effect are so separated the mind fails to understand what would otherwise be obvious. Nothing is fragmented or disconnected. The missing links are always there if you look deeply. Understanding the life process opens the door to peace. The light lies close by, waiting for the seeker.

Krishna is laughing! Buddha is laughing! Listen! The earth and heaven are laughing! But man is weeping for he doesn’t know what he is. What a joke! What a lark!

Watch the drama, don’t drown in it, rather be drowned in observing – then happiness and sorrow birth and death remain just a play, they do not affect you they cannot affect you.

It is good to know that your mother’s death has made you consider your own. One has to go through the very awareness of death to reach deathlessness.

Let yourself completely feel the wound of death: wake up and live with it! This will be hard but revolution always is. Death is, it is there always, but we forget about it.

But even then you would not get your answers because some questions others can never answer – your answers lie deep within your own life.

Then there are some questions which are right questions but have no answers at all. They have to be experienced deep within oneself. 104 Love. Do not desire bliss because that desire gets in the way.

Thoughts, when concentrated, become things. As the river finds the ocean, thirsty souls find the temple of God. But the thirst must be intense and the work tireless and the waiting without end and the calling with the whole heart, and all this thirst, work, waiting, calling – are contained in one small word and that word is prayer.

A sad heart cannot enter there so avoid sadness; fill your heart with colour as vivid as a peacock – and for no reason. He who has reason to be happy is not really happy.

This much at least can be said: It cannot be defined, so forget about all definitions, drop all evaluations and interpretations – these are all mind games, all creatures of thought. What is, is beyond the mind. Thoughts are as unaware of reality as the waves are of the peace of the lake. With waves the lake loses its tranquility; when the lake is calm then the waves cannot exist. One has to know that-which-is Its interpretation is very different from knowing it.

The first steps have to be taken from where you are, even for a long journey the first steps have to be taken just close by, and in every journey, not only that towards truth, the beginning is not different from the end – they are two ends of the same span, two poles of the same entity. Yet often you cannot guess from the first step where you will end up; those first steps may seem quite unrelated to the last! Charles Catering recollects this interesting incident: Once I bet a friend that if I bought him a birdcage to hang in his sitting-room he would have to buy a bird.

He accepted the bet and I bought him a beautiful cage from Switzerland which he hung in his sitting-room. Naturally, the inevitable happened – life has its own logic. Whosoever saw the cage immediately sympathized with him, asking: When did your bird die? He would answer: I never had a bird. Then they would say: So why the empty cage? Finally he got sick and tired of explaining and went and bought a bird. When I asked him about it he said: It was easier to buy the bird and lose the bet than to explain things to each and every one from morn till night. And also, seeing this empty cage hanging there day in and day out, my mind kept repeating: The bird! The bird! The bird!

When the dreams become too much, too intense, insanity comes. To be clear and healthy is to be without dreams. Once, the president of a country went to inspect the nation’s largest lunatic asylum. The director took him to a room and told him: In this room, the inmates suffer from car-phobia. The president, curious, looked through the window. But there is nobody there, he said. They are all there, sir – under the beds repairing cars, the director replied. Everyone is lying under their dreams in the same way. If this president had looked within, what would he have found?

To be anxious or not is always our open choice. It is not that a non-anxious mind is free of anxieties – anxieties are there, they are an unavoidable part of life – but it does not burden itself with them. Such a person always sees beyond them; dark nights surround him too but his eyes look to the rising sun and therefore his soul is never drowned in darkness – and this alone is enough – that the soul be not drowned in darkness.

There is no greater power than trusting oneself – its fragrance is not of this world; peace, bliss and truth flow from this fragrance. He who trusts himself is in heaven and he who mistrusts himself holds the keys of hell in his hands. The Scottish philosopher David Hume was an atheist, but every Sunday he made it a point to attend the sermon of John Brown, a confirmed theist. When people pointed out that going to church was against his own principles he laughed – and replied: I have no faith whatever in what John Brown says, but John Brown has total faith in what John Brown says.

The search for meaning is disastrous; it has brought nothing but meaninglessness.

Why bother about understanding? Look, isn’t the thing clear there before you? All things are open! All things are clear! But man is so busy understanding no one is left to see what is clear, what is obvious, what is there! Confusion is the effort to understand. Ignorance is the effort to know.

You are busy saving yourself and that is why you are afraid of breaking down. But what is there to save? And that which is worth saving is already saved. 121 Love. You long for the sun and you will get it for sure, but you have to have the courage to burn!

You cannot do this if you condemn it because condemnation leads to repression and it is repression that pushes desires and emotions into the unconscious.

There is a great difference between love and pity. There is pity in love but there is no love in pity; therefore it is important to know things as they are: love as love, pity as pity. To take one for the other is to create unnecessary worry. Ordinarily, love has become impossible because as he is man cannot be loving: to be in love the mind must be completely empty and we love only with our minds, so that when our love is at its lowest it is sex and at its highest it is compassion, but love is a transcendence of both sex and compassion.

This looking in is called meditation. To know one’s truth as it is here and now is meditation. Dive into it, deeper and deeper; there, in the depths, all that is possible can be clearly seen, and once seen it begins to happen – the awareness of what is possible turns it into a reality, like a seed stirred by a vision of its potential beginning to sprout.

When this is realized the desire for security simply vanishes; to accept insecurity is to become free of it. Uncertainty will stay in the mind because that is its nature; don’t worry about it because that will add fuel to it, just let the mind be, where it is, and you go into meditation. You are not the mind so where is the problem of the mind? Leave the darkness where it is and just light your lamp. Are you going to think carefully and then surrender? O mad one! Surrender is a leap outside thought. Either jump or don’t jump but for God’s sake don’t ponder about it! 133 Theism is another name for infinite hope.

Wittgenstein has said somewhere: Of that which one cannot speak, one should remain silent. Oh, if only this advice was heeded there would be no useless arguments about truth! THAT-WHICH-IS cannot be spoken of. Whatever is said in words is not, cannot be, THAT-WHICH-IS. Truth is beyond words, only silence is related to truth.

The meaning of sadhana is to enter into one’s own nature, to live in it, to be it. one must therefore know what is not one’s nature so as to be aware of what one wants to be free of. Recognizing it becomes freedom from it. A disciple of Bankei asked him: I become overwhelmed by anger. I want to be rid of it but I cannot be. What shall I do?

Love is not a throne, it is a cross; but those who gladly offer. themselves to it attain the very highest throne. The cross can be seen, the throne cannot – it is always hidden behind the cross.

What is suppressed becomes attractive, what is negated, invites! Only alertness to the mind’s games brings freedom. Negation does not really negate, on the contrary, it invites. The mind plays around the forbidden like the tongue around the gap of an extracted tooth. A small shopkeeper in London once caused a sensation.

Fear is awareness of death without knowing what death is. Fear exists in the gap between you and your death, and if there is no gap, no space, then there is no fear. Do not think of death as something outside you because it is not. And do not think of death as something in the future because it is not. Death is within you, because death is the other side of life.

Yes, there is tension. To be consciously conscious is to be tense, but it is not because of consciousness but because of partial consciousness. The unconscious is always behind the so called consciousness – this situation creates tension because this creates a dichotomy, a duality; hence the tension, because the being is divided – which cannot be divided.

That is why the whole is the holy. But falling into deep sleeplike trance is just escaping the problem, and that too only for the time being, because you will be back soon – and worse, because by such escapes the gap between the conscious and the unconscious is not bridged but, on the contrary, widened even more.

So always be aware of the mind because it tries to find solace in unconscious states in so many ways – through chemical drugs, through auto-hypnotic means, A Cup of Tea 161 Osho"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and otherwise. Begin to be aware of anything which ordinarily happens unconsciously, for example – anger, jealousy, pride – and your consciousness will be deepened. Act consciously, even in day-to-day acts be conscious, for example – walking, eating, talking – and your consciousness will be expanded. Be alert when thinking. No thought should be allowed to pass unwitnessed. And then, in the end, there is explosion in which you become totally conscious with no unconsciousness behind. When this happens one is one, and to be one is to be silent. This silence is beyond time and space, because it is beyond duality. 168 Love. God is when you are not. When you are IT IS not because YOU are nothing but a blindness. The ego cannot see.

In this sleep the part begins to dream itself as the whole, and this dreaming becomes a barrier to knowing the whole. Begin to be aware, aware of your actions, thoughts and emotions, just aware. Because if you condemn or appreciate you will not be aware – in any choice the awareness is contaminated and the darkness of unawareness comes in, so just be aware without any choice; then awareness is pure and innocent, and then awareness is a mirror. In this mirror-like awareness one never finds oneself but one finds THAT-WHICH-IS. And that is God. But it is only when you are not because you are the dust which makes the mirror blind. Because you are the blindness. 169 Love. A Cup of Tea 163 Osho"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. There are three forms of knowledge. The first is intellectual knowledge, which is in fact not knowledge but information only, and the collection of facts and the use of these to arrive at further intellectual concepts. The second is emotional knowledge which also is really not knowledge but feeling of the mental states in which man feels he has known something, but there is no transformation or mutation of his being. The first is objective and out of it science is born, and the second is subjective and is the source of all art. The third is neither; it is beyond both, and this third is the real. It is achieved through meditation because meditation does not use thinking and feeling as doors of perception – really these are not doors of perception but forces of projection; through them pure knowing is impossible, whatsoever comes through them is changed and coloured by them.

But there is no alternative One cannot escape it, one cannot evade it. One has to go on the journey. The goal seems impossible but the urge to go on it is intrinsic. THE NEED IS DEEP IN THE SOUL.

A journey of three thousand miles is begun by a single step. 171 Love. When I say mutation I do not mean simply change. Change is from the known to the known: a sinner becomes a saint – then it is change and not mutation. You can practise change but you cannot practise mutation because only the known can be practised – and then any change is going to be only a modified past because the past will be continuous in it, and the past also will be the master of it because it is cultivated by the past.

But mutation is explosion: from THIS to nothingness, from here to nowhere. You cannot practise it – on the contrary, you are the only hindrance. So what is to be done. Really nothing can be done. Be aware of this helplessness, and remain in this helplessness. Do not do anything because any doing will be escaping from this fact of helplessness. Do not move at all – and then there is explosion, and then there is mutation. 172 Love. Religion is not a promise for the future but an experience HERE AND NOW.

But here also are words? Then what to do? READ BETWEEN THE WORDS. Or read that which is said but not written, or that which is shown and not even said, or that which is meant and not even shown. That is – LOOK IN, because the words are without but the meaning is within. 174 Love. Reason is not enough; it is necessary but not enough.

It creates a man anti-all and pro-nothing. It creates absolutely negative minds which can criticize but cannot create, because reason has no healing force within itself; it is only a tiny part and not the whole of life amd the healing force is always with the whole. 175 Love. With thought the mind has boundaries but without thought the mind is just infinite space. That is why in thoughtless awareness one stops being a drop and becomes oceanic. And then there is great energy. This energy wipes out everything which is dead. It wipes out the whole karmic past – and with no effort at all. The greater absorbs the lesser and remains untouched. 176 Love. The will to wholeness is inherent in everything, A Cup of Tea 169 Osho"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. but only in man has it become conscious. Therefore man lives in tension, and only when this longing is fulfilled is his negative state of tension wiped out. The tension is symbolic of the infinite potential and also of the infinite possibilities. Man is not what he can be, and unless he is that which he can be he cannot be at ease. This dis-ease is man, and health is in wholeness. The fact that language has one root for the words whole, holy and to heal conceals a deep truth: He who is whole is also healed, and to be healed is to be whole. This wholeness can only be achieved by becoming totally conscious of oneself: The darkness of the unconscious is to be penetrated and transformed into light. And meditation is the method. 177 Love.

It has always been there – within, is in being itself. It IS being itself. One may know it or not, but it is THERE – as a seed of course, as a potentiality, one has to make it actual, that is all. That is why when it is revealed, when it flowers, one laughs uproariously because it has always been there and one never knew it. To work towards meditation is just like sculpturing because just as the sculptor chisels out a figure deeply buried in a mass of inert matter. so the meditator transforms his won inert potentialities. into living, dynamic and conscious creations. of course, here the creator and the creation and the means of creation are not different but one because the meditator himself is all.

Do not think of others and waste your time; really, that is a subtle and cunning way of the mind to escape from itself. Once a monk asked Ummon: Sir, you always say that Buddhism helps us in every possible way, but how can it help the blind, the deaf or the dumb? The blind cannot see the teacher’s staff that is raised before them, the deaf cannot hear the teacher’s words, no matter how wise, the dumb cannot ask their questions or speak their understanding: so since we cannot help these people how can we say that Buddhism helps in every possible way? What good is it? Ummon just remained silent for a while and then abruptly poked at the questioner with his stick. The monk of course jumped back. Ah! said Ummon. I see you are not blind!

You cannot try to sleep, nor can you try to meditate. On the contrary, every effort hinders its smooth and silent coming. There is no place in it for action or aggression – and action is ways aggressive. Meditation is passive receptivity. Mind is aggressive, meditation is passive.

The problem of life is not philosophical, it is existential. You cannot solve it from the outside; you cannot just be a spectator to it – you are in it – you ARE IT. And moreover, what is philosophy? At the worst a linguistic misunderstanding, or at best a linguistic analysis. And even at its best it leads nowhere because the problem is existential and it cannot be solved through language analysis and grammar. One dark night a dervish was passing a dry well when he heard a cry for help from below. What is the matter? he called down.

There is no end to man’s self-deception, because whatsoever he is going to do he can rationalize it. One day one man boasted in the bar that he is a man of iron WILL, and now he will show it by not touching wine again in his life. But not even that day could pass.

The way of meditation is above the self; its base is surrendering. Surrender the self to your own no-self; Be as if you are not. Oh, the benediction when one just leaves everything to the no-self! Buddha called this phenomenon anatma or anatta (no-selfhood). One must turn oneself into a puppet in the hands of the no-self, and then everything begins to flow naturally and spontaneously just like a river flowing to the sea or like a cloud wandering in the sky. Lao-tzu says this is doing by non-doing. One ceases to be one’s own master and becomes an instrument of the unknown – and what nonsense it is to be one’s own master because there is no one to be so!

There is conflict in the mind – always, because the mind cannot exist without the conflict. It gets strengthened through conflict; even warring against conflict is conflict and struggling to go beyond the mind is mind. See this deeply and immediately without motive, just as if you have come across a snake in the street – and the jump. Then it is not that you jump but – the jump. The jump happens spontaneously without effort and without conflict. When this happens there is no-mind and no-mind is the door to the divine.

The thought-forms dissolve automatically because they cannot exist with total passivity: they are forms of an activity-addicted mind, and with them dissolves the ego – because it cannot exist without thought-forms. The ego is nothing but a whirlpool centre of constantly revolving thought-forms. Remain in passivity, that is, in the state of absolute doing-nothingness, and meditation deepens to the depths where there is no meditator; and remember that only when there is no meditator has meditation really come into being.

They possess everything except themselves, and then naturally they just become a thing among their other things. The possessor becomes the possessed. Nothing is more rare in any man, says Emerson, than an act of his own. But this is just what can be expected because no one is one’s own, no one is oneself. Most people are other people. They are not living but only acting roles given to them by others. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions and their faces are just masks. They are faceless. They have no authentic being at all. Their lives – a mimicry and their passions – a quotation. Break this vicious circle otherwise you will never BE.

It is astonishing how many people are almost completely unaware of themselves physically. The body is suppressed and denied life too much, that is why it is just a dead weight and not a living joy. That is why I insist: be back in the body and regain the wonderful joy in its movements, sheer movements. Make it a meditation and you will be enriched beyond comprehension. 190 Love.

A fakir was walking down the village street deep in thought when some urchins began to throw stones at him. He was taken by surprise, and besides he was not a big man. Don’t do that, he said, and I will tell you something of interest to you. All right, what is it? But no philosophy. The king is giving a free banquet to all comers – he just lied to them.

To be religious is to be a yea-sayer: yes to everything – yes to life and yes to death, yes to light and yes to darkness. Total acceptance is religion. Says Nicolas De Cusa: Yes God! Yes God! Yes, yes and always yes Say YES – and feel it, and you have entered the temple of the divine. Say no and you yourself have closed the doors – or closed yourself to the divine.

Begin to live positively, that is – with positive emotions. To be negative is to be self-destructive and ultimately suicidal. But ordinarily the mind works that way because it is only an instrument for safety and security; it detects death only and not life. So to be completely positive is to transcend mind.

The forms of existence are finite – all forms. Really, to have a form means to be finite. But existence is infinite because only the formless can be infinite and existence is formlessness, that is why it can take all the forms.

Negative attitudes negate life – they are good for dying but not good for living. Life needs positive attitudes; life feeds on them because they make you not only happy but creative also. Once there lived an old woman, but the older she became the younger she felt – because youthfulness has nothing to do with age, it is an attitude, and with age and its richness one can really be younger than the young. The old woman was so cheerful and creative that everyone wondered at her. But you must have some clouds in your life. said a visitor. Clouds? she replied.

Death is complete security so never be in search of security because you are searching for death. To live totally and in ecstasy never demands security. Accept insecurity blissfully and when you accept it then you will know that it has a beauty of its own. Mulla Nasrudin’s tomb was fronted by an immense wooden door, barred and padlocked.

But man in his life does hardly anything but work, and because of this everything has become upside down. Hence the agony. The law, the TAO of the universe, is play – leela, and the law of the human reason is work because reason cannot think beyond utility. But existence exists beyond utility.

Life does not need comfort when it can be offered meaning nor pleasure when it can be shown purpose, because in the total intensity of intentional living is the fruition of the seed of consciousness. And consciousness without the self is the goal. Consciousness without the centre – and you have reached. Consciousness without ego is nirvana: or you may call it God or whatsoever you like.

The secret of meditation is the art of unlearning. Mind is learning; meditation is unlearning: that is – die constantly to your experience; let it not imprison you; experience becomes a dead weight in the living and flowing, riverlike consciousness. Live in the moment unburdened by the past, flow in the moment unblocked by the mind, and you will be in meditation. Know well that it is innocence that is full and experience that is empty – although the surface appearance is quite the contrary. It is innocence that knows and experience that knows not – though innocence never claims and experience is nothing but claims and claims and A Cup of Tea 191 Osho"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. claims!

Three men made their way to the circle of a Sufi seeking admission to his teachings. Almost at once one of them detached himself from the group, angered by the erratic behaviour of the Master.

The fellow took the thread, went down the road and sat under a tree for a few minutes, then came back to the house. He told the woman he could not repair the pants unless he had a piece of cloth for a patch. She gave him a small piece of material. About an hour later the young fellow came again to the house and said: Madam, these pants are beyond repair. It would be very good of you if you could give me a pair of your husband’s old pants.

If one is aware of the present moment then one also becomes aware of the fact that there is no ME inside. The me is my past, the me is the dead past. The me is not my life because it is not living. The ego can exist only in the past or in the future – which is nothing but a projection of the past; that is why awareness, moment to moment awareness, leads to egolessness: because the ego cannot exist in the present and because awareness cannot exist except in the present.

So always be aware of the hypnotic spell of the opposite: it never solves any problem because it is beating around the bush. Do not fall into the trap of the opposite but understand anger, violence or greed or anything else directly. To seek the opposite is a way of escape. To seek the opposite is cowardice.

Moment to moment life passes into death, because it is death. Covered, it appears as life, uncovered it is death. Remember this fact always. This is silent meditation.

Stand on the bank, neither curious nor concerned. Glance or gaze at the driftwood of your past floating in memory – just like the incidents one reads about in the paper. Detached and indifferent remember that nothing matters. ONLY EXIST – and the explosion. 208 Love. Be always positive, in each and every situation – that helps meditative awareness very much. Negative attitudes negate the whole effort. Diogenes was looking for an honest man in New Delhi. What luck? asked the wayfarer. Oh, pretty fair, sir, replied Diogenes. I still have my lantern. 209 Love. Philosophy cannot cure you of questions – on the contrary, it can give you more.

In the other hand he held a recipe for liver pie which a friend had given him. Suddenly a buzzard swooped down and carried off the liver. You fool! shouted Nasrudin. Having the meat is all very well, but what will you do without the recipe? 211 Love. Man can only know what God is not. To know what God is, is impossible because there begins the realm of being. You cannot know God but you can BE, and in that dimension is the only knowing; but that knowing is altogether different from all our other knowings A Cup of Tea 202 Osho"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. because in that knowing there is no knower and no known, but only knowing. That is why in that dimension knowing and being are the same. There is no knowledge even because knowledge is dead and therefore a thing. Moreover, knowledge is always of the past, and God is never in the past nor in the future. God is now, always now; and here, and always here. Close your eyes and see. Then open your eyes and see. Then neither close your eyes nor open your eyes and see. 212 Love. There was once a man who was obsessed with the idea that there was a secret knower in those who achieved success. To discover this secret A Cup of Tea 203 Osho"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. he devoted years to study and research: ancient masonry, philosophy, astrology, psychology, salesmanship, religious beliefs, the various cults that have had their rise and fall – all these he studied long and diligently, but no conclusion was visible.

And then instead of success in his search for the secret of success came death – and as death approached him he realized the goal of his whole life’s efforts, and finally he gave his conclusion to those who were near him. It came in two short words: I WILL. 213 Love. Do not believe in thinking because that is the greatest of all superstitions – but well hidden because it pretends to be anti-superstitious! Thinking is nothing but dust in a blind mind because you cannot think that which is not known – and you need not think that which is already known. A Cup of Tea 204 Osho"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. The encounter is always with the unknown. The unknown is everywhere, within and without, and thinking is always in the known and of the known.

Man goes on dreaming and desiring but basically remains where he is. and in the end nothing but ashes of his dreams and desires are in his hands – and of course tears in his eyes. Panchatantra has a beautiful story: In a certain town lived a Brahmin named Seedy who got some barley meal by begging, ate a portion, and filled a jar with the remainder. This jar he hung on a peg one night, placed his cot beneath it and fixing his gaze on the jar fell into a hypnotic reverie. A Cup of Tea 205 Osho"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Well here is a jar of barley meal, he thought. Now if famine comes a hundred rupees will come out of it. With that sum I will get two she-goats. Every six months they will bear two more she-goats. After goats, cows. When the cows calve I will sell the calves. After cows, buffalos. After buffalos, mares. From the mares I shall get plenty of horses. The sale of these will mean plenty of gold. The gold will buy a great house with an inner court. Then someone will come to my house and offer his lovely daughter with a dowry. She will bear a son whom I shall call Moonlord. When he is old enough to ride on my knee I will take a book, sit on the stable roof and think. Just then Moonlord will see me, will jump from his mother’s lap in his eagerness to ride on my knee and will go too near the horses.

Go on discarding: not this, not this (NETI, NETI). and ultimately when nothing remains to be discarded – then is the explosion. Do not cling to anything, to any thought. Go on and on until the nothingness. I have heard about a little boy Toyo and his meditations. He was only twelve years old but he wanted to be given something to ponder, to meditate on, so one evening he went to Mokurai, the Zen master, struck the gong softly to announce his presence, and sat before the master in respectful silence. Finally the master said: Toyo, show me the sound of two hands. Toyo clapped his hands. A Cup of Tea 207 Osho"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Good, said the master. Now show me the sound of one hand clapping. Toyo was silent. Finally he bowed and left to meditate on the problem. The next night he returned and struck the gong with one palm. That is not right, said the master. The next night Toyo returned and played geisha music with one hand. That is not right, said the master. And again and again Toyo returned with some answer but the master said again and again, That is not right. For nights Toyo tried new sounds but each and every answer was rejected. The question itself was absurd so no answer could be right. And when on the eleventh night Toyo came and before he spoke anything the master said: That is still not right! – then he stopped coming to the master. For a year he thought of every possible sound and discarded them all, and when there was nothing left to be discarded any more A Cup of Tea 208 Osho"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. he exploded into enlightenment. When he was no more he returned to the master and without striking the gong he sat down and bowed. He was not saying anything and there was silence. Then the master said: So you have heard the sound without sound! 216 Love. Thought is divisive, it divides ad infinitum, so thought can never come to the total, to the whole. and the whole is while the parts are not – or they are only for the mind: and if there is no mind then there are no parts. With the mind and because of the mind the one becomes many – or appears so; and with the mind and through the mind, to conceive the one is impossible. Of course it can think about the one, but that one is nothing but a putting together of all the parts, and that one is quite different from the one which is. A Cup of Tea 209 Osho"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. The one which is conceptualized by the mind is just a mathematical construct: it is not a living whole, it is not organic, and unless one experiences the cosmos as an organic whole one has not known anything at all. This is not possible with thought, but this is possible with no-thought. 217 Love. EMPTINESS IS ALL – and to get hold of emptiness is to get all and be all. But it is very arduous to get hold of emptiness – because it is emptiness! And it hurts much – though it is emptiness, still it hurts much! Because to make way for it the ego has to die. But I am happy that you are dying because this is the only way to be beyond death – I say: the only way. Remember this always. Sekkyo said once to one of his monks: Can you get hold of emptiness – I will try, said the monk; and he cupped his hands in the air. A Cup of Tea 210 Osho"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. That is absurd, said Sekkyo. You have not got anything in there. Well, Master, said the monk, please show me the right way. Thereupon Sekkyo seized the monk’s nose and gave it a great yank. Ouch! yelled the monk. You hurt me! I cannot help it because that is the only way to get hold of emptiness! said Sekkyo. 218 Man asks questions and then answers them himself. Nothing is answered in this way. But man is capable of deceiving himself – and the whole of philosophy is nothing but such a deception. Man asks: What is mind? and then answers himself: Not matter? nd then asks: What is matter? and then answers: Not mind? and this stupid game goes on. I have heard about a distinguished philosopher who customarily began his speeches with: Why are we here? A Cup of Tea 211 Osho"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. He had occasion to address the inmates of a mental hospital and finally said: Ladies and Gentlemen, why are we here? One of the inmates called out: We are all here because we are not all there! 219 Love. The mind always thinks in terms of the self. It is egocentric. During the French revolution a man from Paris stopped at a village and was asked by a friend what was happening. They are cutting off heads by thousands, said the visitor. How terrible! cried the villager. That could ruin my hat business! But this is the way of the mind, and because of this it is never in tune with the cosmos, so how can it know life? It cannot know it because it cannot be one with it. Really with the mind there is no knowing but only superficial acquaintance. Intimate and deep knowing comes only with no-mind – and meditation is dissolving mind into no-mind. 220 A Cup of Tea 212 Osho"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Love. A monk asked Hyakujo Yekai: What is the most miraculous event in the world? Hyakujo said: I sit here all by myself! 221 Love. Freedom from becoming means freedom for being. Becoming is desiring, being is that which is. Becoming is longing for the future, being is to be in the present. Becoming is mental, being is existential. That is why becoming must cease for the being to reveal itself. Becoming is just like the smoke around the flame, or just like the outer covering around the seed, so please let the smoke go for the flame to explode in its complete glory and splendour, and let the seed die to its outer shell so that it may be what it is in its innermost depth. 222 Love.

Every Saturday night for these twenty years the poor man would come home and faithfully hand me his pay envelope – that he never missed doing. Of course the envelope was always empty, but mind you, he was loyal to the principle of the thing. 223 Love. Religion is – living without conflict, that is – without ideas and without ideals, because whenever one lives with ideals there is conflict, there is conflict between that which is and that which should be, A Cup of Tea 214 Osho"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and then life is misery. See this and go beyond. In fact the very seeing of the fact is going beyond. And please do not ask the seemingly inevitable how? because there is no HOW to it. Either you see it or you do not see it – and moreover the how is again the creator of conflict. 224 Love. Bhakti needs only time to absorb the shock she has come across in her deep meditations; remember – only time and nothing else. The shock is nothing new. It happens whenever the deeper layers of the unconscious are encountered Before any mutation this is absolutely necessary. Be grateful to the divine because this is a good omen. Bhakti needed it badly and when she is out of it she will be a new person totally. Soon she will be twice-born.

To him that sound must have been something of a shock, even an affront, do you not agree? said Bahaudin. 226 Love.

And this is not being asked for the first time, but many many times in many many lives the same question has been raised – and you have not yet answered! Now, is it not time enough? 227 Love. Mind is localization of consciousness, and it can be localized in any part of the body. Ordinarily we have localized it in the head but other cultures and other civilizations in the past have tried other parts of the body also, and on other planets there are beings with other parts of their bodies working as their minds, but whatsoever may be the part chosen localization of consciousness means its freezing, and whenever it ceases to flow freely as is needed A Cup of Tea 218 Osho"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. it is no more consciousness in its suchness. Meditation means: consciousness in its suchness, so let consciousness fill the whole body, let it flow throughout the totality of your being and you will have a feeling of aliveness which is never known and felt by localized consciousness. Whenever there is localization of consciousness the part in which the localization happens becomes tense and diseased and the remainder of the body becomes a dead weight. But with meditative consciousness or flowing consciousness everything changes completely: the whole body becomes alive, sensitive and aware and consequently weightless. Then there is no centre for tensions to exist and accumulate because they cannot exist without frozen blocks of consciousness. The flowing, the moving, consciousness washes them out constantly with every movement, and when the whole body is alive only then you begin to feel the cosmic consciousness all around you. How can a frozen consciousness, and that too surrounded by a dead body, A Cup of Tea 219 Osho"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. feel the cosmic? 228 Now man knows more about man than ever and yet no problem is solved. It seems that something is basically wrong with our so-called knowledge itself. This whole knowledge is derived from analysis and analysis is incapable of penetrating into the depths of consciousness. The analytical method is all right with matter or with things because there is no inside to them, but consciousness is insideness, and to use the analytical method with consciousness is to treat it as an object while it is not an object at all. And it cannot be made an object; its very nature is subjectivity, its being is subjectivity, so it must not be approached from outside because then whatsoever is known about it is not about it. Consciousness must be approached from inside – and then the method is meditation and not analysis. Meditation is synthetic: it is concerned with the whole and not with the parts A Cup of Tea 220 Osho"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. it is subjective and not objective, it is irrational or super-rational and not rational, it is religious or mystic and not scientific. Authentic knowledge of consciousness comes only through meditation and all else is just superficial acquaintance and basically erroneous because the very source of it is fallacious and poisonous. 229 Love. Life is a dream so enjoy it; but do not ask for more because then you only disturb the dream and get nothing except a disturbed night. Be a witness to the dreaming mind and then there is transcendence: then you go beyond dreaming and beyond mind itself. And know well that there is an awakening BELOW the dreaming mind which is nothing but just a disturbed dream. One can get to this below-dreaming state of awakening through asking for more desiring more – as ordinarily we all do. In a dream Mulla Nasrudin saw himself being counted out coins and when there were nine silver pieces in his hand the invisible donor stopped giving them.

Finding that all the money had disappeared he closed his eyes again and murmured, All right then give them back – I will take the nine. There is also an awakening above the dreaming mind – the real awakening in comparison to which man ordinarily is asleep. One can get to this awakening through witnessing the dreaming mind – and unless one gets to it one is not really alive. 230 Love. The divine is that from which one cannot depart, and that from which one can depart is not the divine. So find that from which you have never departed and cannot ever depart from – and then laugh at the absurdity of the human mind and its efforts! Buddha is still laughing because of that Listen! 231 A Cup of Tea 222 Osho"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Love. Why does man suffer? Man suffers because of his craving, craving to possess that which cannot be possessed, and craving to keep things for ever with himself which are essentially impermanent. And chief among these things is his own ego, his own persona. But all things are impermanent. Except for change itself. everything changes. Really nothing is because everything is only a process, so as soon as one tries to possess anything it slips away. The possessor himself is slipping away constantly! Then there is frustration. and then there is suffering. Know this well, realize this well and there will be no suffering because then you have uprooted the root. 232 Love. The self can never be free – A Cup of Tea 223 Osho"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. because the self itself is the bondage.

Or that of Lao Tzu in TAO-TE-KING: He who humbles himself shall be saved, he who bends shall be made straight and he who empties himself shall be filled. One is not to make the self free; rather on the contrary, ONE HAS TO BE FREE FROM THE SELF. The self is nothing but the husk of the seed. Do not cling to it. Sings Wu Ming Fu: The seed that has to grow must lose itself as seed, and they that creep may graduate through chrysalis to wings. Wilt thou then, O mortal, cling to husks which falsely seem to you the self? 233 Love.

And this is not for the first time that I have called you. nor the first life; I know you Bhakti, through so many births! And soon you will also remember many things. But not before the jump. Only your superficial persona is resisting, not you – and it is expected to resist always because the moment one take the plunge into the unknown it has to die naturally.

Total acceptance of existence is impossible for the mind because the mind exists as denial. It exists with the NO. and with a total YES it dies. So it continues to find reasons to say no even if there are no reasons. Walking with a disciple one day Mulla Nasrudin saw for the first time in his life a beautiful lakeland scene.

Be playful and only then will you know the playfulness of the universe. And to know that is to be religious. 239 Love. Do not continue circling in the old rut – and the way out is just by your hand.

Mind means consciousness somewhere – centred, focussed and tense. Meditation means consciousness nowhere, and when it is nowhere it is everywhere – decentralized. unfocussed and non-tense.

Yes, man learns by experience! Two old drunkards were in the habit of coming together twice a week to the wineseller to get drunk. After years of this one of them died.

Do not imitate anyone, do not follow anyone, otherwise you will be just a pseudo existence – and that is worse than suicide. BE YOURSELF – and only then can you be responsible and authentic and real.

The real religious experience cannot be organized, taught or transmitted. To systematize it is to kill it. It is so living and moving and dynamic that to impose a pattern on it is impossible; and the experience is always so unique and individual that it cannot be put into any category – although it happens when the individual is not! It cannot be followed, for everyone has to find it for himself, and that is the beauty of it, and also its freedom and virginity. It is not new in the sense of any opposition to the old, it is new in the sense of timelessness – that is, with eternal freshness and innocence – as every flower is new and every sunrise is new A Cup of Tea 233 Osho"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and every love is new. It is not borrowed from the past, it is not based on any tradition. it is not derived from without, it happens within without any causality. It happens unconditionally.

The clouds have gone and the sky is clear but there is no cause-and-effect relationship. The sky has not even known the clouds! It has not been affected by them in any way whatsoever. 245 Love.

Only in that transcendence is the total flowering of consciousness and the ecstasy of being. 246 Love. Man adds everything to his ego – while everything goes on without him. He is nothing, but he thinks himself everything. Mulla Nasrudin was walking past a well when he had the impulse to look into it.

As he lay there panting he saw the moon riding on the sky above. Glad to be of service, said Nasrudin. Just as well I came along, wasn’t it? 247 Love. Are you really aware of what anger is? Are you really aware of it when it is present? I ask these questions because man is never present in the present. Man lives in the past and only becomes aware of anything when it has become a part of memory. One becomes aware of anger and sadness only when they are all over, A Cup of Tea 236 Osho"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and then awareness is just pseudo-awareness; it is not awareness but remembering and remembering leads nowhere because it is running in a circle. Then one can fight with anger but can never understand it, and fighting with anger is anger – of course more subtle and therefore more strong and more poisonous. So do not think about anger or sadness or happiness and do not misunderstand remembering them as an awareness but be aware when anger is present. Be totally conscious of it, live it consciously and do not escape from it and then you will know what it is. To understand it is to transcend it.

Oh, only total nothingess is capable fo knowing all! I have heard that the nun Chiyono studied for years and meditated for years on the ultimate questions of existence but was unable to find the light. The thinking was filling her so much that she could not be a passage to the divine. She was so much filled by herself that she could not be a host to the divine guest, and the more she longed for enlightenment the more far off it was.

She wrote this verse: This way and that way I tried to keep the pail together hoping the weak bamboo would never break. But suddenly the bottom fell out: no more water no more moon in the water – and emptiness in my hand! 252 Love. One day Lin-chi was asked: What is the essence of meditation? Lin-chi came right down from his seat and taking hold of the questioner by the front of his robe, slapped his face, then let him go. The questioner, of course, stood there stupefied.

Its light enters the house through an opening. The dust is seen moving in the ray of light but the empty space of the room is unmoving. Now close your eyes and be silent. Then ask yourself: Who am I – the moving dust or the unmoving space of the room? Do not answer intellectually, because intellectual answers are not answers, but wait and realize. Hsu Yun says: The mind is nothing but the foreign dust. Who are you – the mind? – the foreign dust? or – ? 254 Love.

But it TRIES to answer, and the result is the mess called philosophy! Meditation never questions, but it answers. It is the answer, because it is life, because it is existence. Question – and there is no answer. Do not question – and you are the answer. Why is it so? It is so because the questioning consciousness, mind, is disturbed, and the non-questioning consciousness, no mind, is silent, quiet and at rest in its suchness. Philosophy comes out of questioning, religion out of the non-questioning consciousness.

If the present is just continuous with the past then it is not present at all. To be present, the present must be discontinuous with the past, only then is it young, fresh and new – and then it is not a part of time but is eternity itself. The now is eternal but we live in the past or in the future – which is nothing but a faint echo of the past itself. our whole activity springs from the past or for the future – which is the same thing. Then the present is false and dead: and if the present is false then we cannot be real, and if the present is dead then we cannot be alive. That is why I insist on living in the present and dying each moment to the past. Live atomically – moment to moment, and then your life will have a totally different quality – the quality of the divine. A Cup of Tea 242 Osho"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. 256 Love. To me meditation means: be playful and transcend all seriousness. See: life is not serious. Look around: existence is not serious. Only disease is serious, and of course death, and the exploiters of death: the priests! Life is playful and festive and therefore purposeless. It is not going anywhere, because there is nowhere to go. It is always here and here. It is always now and now. It is just abundant energy overflowing from here to here and from now to now, and once you know it and be it you are in that ecstasy which is the purpose of purposelessness! Don’t be a mind and you will know it and be it. Meditation is nomindedness. Mind is thinking, and thinking is going astray from the being. Mind is forgetfulness of ’that which is’. Meditation is coming back home. So, come back home.

Such are all the proofs of God. Sitting one day in the teahouse Mulla Nasrudin heard the rhetoric of a travelling scholar. He was arguing for the existence of God; questioned by one of the company on some point the scholar drew a book from his pocket and banged it on the table: This is my evidence! AND I wrote it myself! A man who could not only read but write was a rarity, and a man who had written a book...! The villagers treated the pundit with profound respect – and of course Mulla Nasrudin was impressed! Some days later Mulla appeared at the teahouse and asked whether anyone wanted to buy a house. Tell us something about it. Mulla, the people asked him. for we did not even know that you had a house of your own A Cup of Tea 244 Osho"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1.

If you feel like crying, then cry; if you feel like weeping, then weep; but just be uninterruptedly aware. Do not think about what you are doing – just be the doing, and when your senses are shaken like leaves in the wind – then enter this shaking, because only in such situations the being is revealed. If a mood against someone or for someone arises do not place it on the person in question but remain centred in yourself and you will know a transcendence which is not of this world at all. 259 Love.

BE in it and you are liberated. Live in it and there is bliss. 260 Love.

One of the three asked him: How deep is the river of meditation? Find out for yourself, he said, and offered to throw the questioner from the bridge.

Nothing great is ever accomplished without going mad, that is, without breaking through the ordinary level of consciousness and letting loose the hidden powers lying further below, and also penetrating to the realm that is further above. – And it may not be true for any other great thing, but it is absolutely true as far as meditation is concerned.

Presently another visitor arrived. I am a friend, he said, of the man who gave you the duck. Nasrudin fed him as well. This happened several times. Nasrudin’s house had become like a restaurant for out-of-town visitors. Everyone was a friend at some remove of the original donor of the duck. Finally Nasrudin was exasperated. One day there was a knock at the door and a stranger appeared. I am the friend of the friend of the friend of the man who brought you the duck from the country, he said. Come in, said Nasrudin.

Man is not a rational animal, but only a rationalizing one; and that is more dangerous than just to be irrational. Give me a shot of bourbon and a shot of water – said the obviously heavy drinker to the bartender. When the order was placed before him on the bar the lush pulled a worm from his pocket and dropped it into the glass of water. After watching it swim around for a few seconds the man drew the worm from the water and dropped it into the whisky. It wriggled briefly, then curled up and died.

So be always aware from now that you are not to think about past lives: let the memories come up by themselves. No conscious effort on your part is needed; on the contrary it will be a great hindrance. Let the unconscious do the work, you be just a witness, and as the meditation will go deeper many locked doors will be opened to you.

We kneel down to ourselves because we kneel down to the gods we make out of our experience or out of our desires and dreams or out of our so called logic and foolish arguments. This is neither humility nor prayer, rather on the contrary this is the most egoistic attitude possible. The true religious mind is one which just kneels down – not to anyone, not to any image in particular. This kneeling down is nothing but a flowering of one’s total nothingness.

The more deeply you go within yourself the less and less you will find yourself – and yet THAT is the very heart of your being.

It will be stopped in awareness and the created energy will be used by the laughter, and after the laugh you will feel a deep relaxation. Then begin to dance or sing and the negative state of the mind will be transformed into the positive. The craving to be someone, somebody, is absolutely negative because the ego is the negation of being. The ego is the principle of negation, and if the negative is negated then you are positive.

But I say that man is always more than all his actions and all his thoughts, and unless that MORE is known no one knows himself. That MORE can be known neither by action nor by reflection because they both belong to the periphery and that MORE IS eternally the centre.

Meditation cannot be taught directly because it is not a mechanical technique, but a living art. Dogo had a disciple called Soshin. Soshin waited long with his Master to be taught the art of meditation. He expected lessons the way a schoolboy is taught at school, but there were no special lessons coming, and this bewildered and disappointed the disciple. One day he said to the Master: It is a long time since I came here but not a word has been given to me regarding the essence of meditation.

How else do you expect to be taught in meditation? Soshin hung his head and began to think about the puzzling words of the Master, but at this the Master said again: If you want to see, SEE, RIGHT AT ONCE, because when you begin to think you miss the point altogether. 294 Love.

Emptiness is not really emptiness: rather, it is the All. It is not negative: rather, it is positivity itself It is out of it that everything is born and to it everything returns. It is the source and ground of all existence. So whenever I say EMPTINESS I never mean just emptiness! To me emptiness is not the absence of anything but the presence of emptiness itself: And now you can understand it because you yourself are in it, and it is in you.

It will be difficult for you because you will have to let go of yourself completely.

Life is non-fragmentary, but mind makes it appear fragmentary; and this fragmentation creates all the problems.

Kusunoki Masashige came to a Zen monastery when he was about to meet the overwhelming army of Ashikaga Takanji and asked the Master: When a man is at the parting of the ways between life and death how should he behave? The Master answered: Cut off your dualism and let THE ONE SWORD stand serenely by itself against the sky! 302 Love.

The real thing is A Cup of Tea 279 Osho"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. to grow in awareness in meditation because then one wins without any fight whatsoever – and to win through conflict is not a real victory because that which has been suppressed will have to be suppressed again and again. Through conflict there is no end to conflict and through fight only more fight is born. But there is a victory without any conflict, fight or suppression. That victory comes through positive growth in awareness. Do not fight with yourself but grow in awareness and understanding and silence, and all that is negative and diseased will have withered away by itself. Suzuki tells a story: Chi Hsing Tzu was raising a fighting cock for his lord. Ten days passed and the lord asked: Is he ready? Chi answered: No sir, he is not ready.

Still another ten days passed and when the inquiry came from the prince, Chi replied: Not quite yet, sir. His sense of fighting is still smouldering within him ready to be awakened. When another ten days elapsed Chi replied in response to the inquiry: He is almost ready. Even when he hears another crowing he shows no excitement. He has now become positive. He has grown in subtle inner awareness. Now he resembles one made of wood, he is so quiet and silent. His qualities are integrated. No cock is his match and to win he will not have to fight because other cocks will at once run away from him. They cannot face him now. And really it proved so. He won fights without fighting at all.

It is not from here that you have escaped it is only a vain effort to escape from yourself: Which is impossible. How can one escape from oneself? But in meditation a moment comes necessarily when the mind tries the impossible – or the mind this is the last defensive act. Meditation is ultimately suicidal to the mind. And of course the mind must be given a chance! And you have given it! Meditation is encountering yourself directly and in your total nakedness. This creates fear and the futile effort to escape. The effort is futile because whatsoever is known once is known for ever and you cannot be the old ignorant one again. There is no way to go back and there is no bridge.

It is arduous, but one has to pay for everything, and in no other way can you get to THE GREAT TREASURE. You have longed for it for lives and lives and now when the time is ripe and the key is being given to you DO NOT LOSE COURAGE. The access to the treasure is difficult because it is hidden in our own unconscious layers of the mind. It will be easy if you approach that threshold when the diurnal tide favours, that is when you are passing from sleep to waking A Cup of Tea 283 Osho"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. or from waking to sleep. Evening and morning are therefore probably the best times for meditation. You might have noticed that when the mind is recovering from sleep it takes at least fifteen minutes to close one aperture and open fully the other. That is why dreams cannot last longer than that in memory after waking. When the mind is approaching sleep it again passes the same threshold. BE AWARE OF THIS THRESHOLD because it is very significant for those who are in search of the inner treasure. This threshold is the gate to the unknown This threshold, this gap between waking and sleep, must be used for meditation.

What is meditation? Hsu Yun says: Meditation lies in laying down. But laying down what? Laying down yourself – because nothing less will do. Have you ever been at the bedside of a dead man? If you try to scold him he will not be excited, and even if you strike him with a staff he will not strike back. He also indulged before in the same things everyone indulges in.

Any practice is of the mind and by the mind – and the mind is the past, the dead; the mind is the thing one has to jump out of.

Information is not knowledge because information is not transformation and can never be – and knowledge comes only through transformation. Information is adding something to the same old mind.

When the son arrived at the palace the king was overjoyed. A great feast was prepared and all the great men of the kingdom were invited.

Mind is energy flowing in dualisms, in conflict and dis-ease, and meditation is non-dual energy, one with itself and at case. Thinking is impossible without dualisms, that is why meditation asks to go beyond thinking. The moment there is no thinking – or a single ripple of thought – the energy becomes integrated and there is qualitative change. The no-thinking energy A Cup of Tea 293 Osho"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. opens the door of the dimensionless dimension. So refrain from seeking even Enlightenment or Buddhahood because with any seeking whatsoever he mechanism of thought begins to operate and create dualisms. 317 Love. Do not forget the search for the divine for even a single moment because the time is always short and the task is great and besides, the mind is wavering. In fact the mind IS the wavering. Remember this, and remain aware of this fact as much as you can because the moment one is aware the wavering stops, and in the intervals are the glimpses: glimpses of oneself, glimpses of no-mind. One has to transcend the wavering of the mind absolutely before one comes to the doors of the beloved. NO-MINDEDNESS IS THE DOOR. And the door is not far off. But the seeker is asleep. Mind is the sleep.

Man is free to be or not to be – this is the glory and this is the burden. Freedom means responsibility, SO BE CAREFUL. If you can be that which is your potentiality, if you can flower to your fullness then there is bliss then there is ecstasy, otherwise ashes are in the hands and anguish in the heart – and ultimately everything depends on you: heaven or hell – and you and only you will be responsible for it.

Metaphysics is born out of childish curiosity, so howsoever sublime, it remains juvenile. And all the ultimate answers are foolish in a way because the ultimate is not only unknown, it is unknowable. A mature mind is one who understands the impossibility of knowing the ultimate, and with this understanding there is a new dimension: the dimension of being. Knowing is not possible, but being is. Or in other word: in relation to the ultimate only – being is knowing. This dimension is the religious dimension and unless one is religious in this sense one goes on asking absurd questions and accumulating even more absurd answers.

Even if one is clinging to the idea of liberation – moksha or nirvana, one will be in bondage. With clinging meditation is impossible because clinging is mind – the bondage, and no-clinging is meditation – the freedom.

One day he saw a delicious looking cherry and came down from his tree to get it, but the fruit turned out to be in a clear glass bottle, so he had to put his hand into the bottle to get it out. As soon as he had done so he closed his hand over the cherry but then he found that he could not withdraw his fist holding the cherry because it was larger than the internal dimensions of the bottle’s neck. Now all this was deliberate because the cherry in the bottle was a trap laid by a monkey hunter who knew how monkeys think. The hunter, hearing the monkey’s whimperings, came along and the monkey tried to run away, but because his hand was, as he thought, stuck in the bottle. he could not move fast enough to escape.

A life without meditation is like a winter landscape with the sun hidden, the flowers frozen and the wind whispering through the withered leaves. And everyone knows it because everyone lives it that way, though no one needs to live it that way But why is this so?

It is always about but never the thing itself; When the Chinese emperor Wu came to meet Bodhidharma he asked the Master: What is the holy ultimate truth? Bodhidharma laughed and replied: Nothing holy, sir, and it is emptiness itself. Of course Wu was taken aback, but he asked again: Then who is the one who at present stands confronting me?

There is no shaking of the foundations because you remain the same. So the real problem is not to change the objects of desire from the worldly to the other-worldly but to transform oneself; not to change the seeking but to change the seeker – otherwise the problem remains as it is, only it takes new shapes. But how to change the seeker. First find it out – where it is and what it is. and then you will come to know a hidden secret: that the seeker exists only until it is not sought, and when someone goes to search it out – it is never found.

Listen to the birds in the morning or to the flowers and grass blades in the sun and you will hear it, and if you do not know how to listen then you will not know from me either. So the real thing is not what you listen to but HOW you listen because the message is everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. Now I will tell you the art of listening: roam about until exhausted or dance or do vigorous breathing and then, dropping to the ground, listen; or repeat your own name loudly until exhausted and then suddenly stop and listen; or at the point of sleep when sleep has not yet come A Cup of Tea 302 Osho"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. and external wakefulness vanishes be alert suddenly and listen AND THEN YOU WILL HEAR ME. 324 Love. That which is never lost cannot be found, and to search for it is absurd. But the moment this absurdity is understood all seeking stops by itself and that which is never lost is found! That is why I say: SEEK AND YOU WILL NOT FIND, because the very seeking is the barrier. The search itself is the hindrance because it creates the seeker, the ego, the illusion that I am, and I am not. Do not seek and you will find it: the I-AM-NOTNESS. This nothingness is the gate.

Meditation requires understanding and not effort, understanding is essential, not effort, and remember always that you cannot substitute understanding with any effort whatsoever.

It is of value, of fine appearance, and it has the added capacity of opening a certain door to wealth. Some years later he had another son. When he was old enough the wise man gave him another ring with the same advice. The same thing happened in the case of his third and last son. When the Ancient had died and the sons grew up one after the other each claimed primacy for himself because of his possession of one of the rings. Nobody could tell for certain which was the most valuable. Each son gained his adherents, all claiming a greater value and beauty for his own ring.

They were all too preoccupied with the problem of precedence, the possession of the ring, its value and appearance. Only a few looked for the door to the treasury of the Ancient. The rings had a magical quality too. Although they were keys they were not used directly in opening the door to the treasury. It was sufficient to look upon them without contention or too much attachment to one or other of their qualities. When this had been done the people who had looked were able to tell where the treasury was and could open it merely by producing the outline of the ring. The treasuries had another quality too: they were inexhaustible. Meanwhile the partisans of the three rings repeated the tales of their ancestors about the merits of the rings, each in a slightly different way. The first community thought they had already found the treasure because they had the key. A Cup of Tea 312 Osho"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. The second thought that it was allegorical and thereby consoled themselves.

It is impossible to conceive of the divine intellectually, and that is why the intellect denies it or fabricates fictitious systems about it, which is even more dangerous than plain denial. The mind works only in the circle of the known; it cannot transcend the world of the known: for the mind the unknown is not. Says Attar: You know nothing of your real self here and in this state. You are like the wax in the honeycomb – what does it know of fire or guttering? But when it gets to the stage of the waxen candle and when light is emitted THEN IT KNOWS. 344 Love.

And Miguel Unamuno has responded with his: No – warmth, warmth, more warmth! For we die of cold and not of darkness! But I say to you that we die neither because of cold nor because of darkness but because of our lust for living or because of our fear of death – which is to say the same thing in different terms.

Die each moment to the past, and then each moment you will be fresh, young and reborn. And then there is light always because the very darkness becomes light, and warmth also, because only the dead past is cold. THE PRESENT IS ALWAYS WARM. 347 Love.

And only one who is no-one can be the gate. The gate means the emptiness because the gate is nothing but the space to pass through. Pass through me – not with me – and know.
