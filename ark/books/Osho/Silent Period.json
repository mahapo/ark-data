SINCE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INTERVIEW OSHO DIRECTLY, HE SENT OSHO A LETTER CONTAINING FOUR QUESTIONS. OSHO GAVE HIS REPLIES TO THE QUESTIONS THROUGH MA ANAND SHEELA AND THEY WERE FORWARDED TO BRADLEY. Q: ARE YOU GOD? Osho: There is not God, hence the question does not arise. ”Bhagwan” does not mean God, it simply means ”The Blessed One.” The very idea of God is non-democratic. Either everything is God or nothing is God. Q: IN A LETTER TO WILLIAM JAMES, OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES WROTE: ”THE GREAT ACT OF FAITH IS WHEN A MAN DECIDES THAT HE IS NOT GOD.” PLEASE COMMENT. Osho: Faith has nothing to do with religion. Faith is rooted in believing in something you know nothing of. It is a way of covering your ignorance. Religion is not belief or faith but knowing. The whole of human history has been ninety-nine-point-nine percent just stupid – because of faith. But all the so-called religions preach it, because that is the easiest way to exploit. Neither William James knows anything about religion, nor Wendell Holmes. Q: WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT? YOU ONCE SAID IT WAS LIKE CHOCOLATE. TRUE? WHAT WILL IT DO FOR THE WORLD? 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1. Osho: Enlightenment is coming to know that there is nothing to know. In other words, existence is a mystery and there is no way to demystify it. To know it and to live it is not intellectual; it is a taste – hence I have called it like chocolate. Either you have tasted it or you have not tasted it. There is no position in between. Q: ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, LIKE YOU, WERE OR ARE ABLE TO STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE MASSES. WERE OR ARE ANY OF THEM ENLIGHTENED? – POPE JOHN PAUL, RABBI BA’AL SHEMTOV (THE ’MASTER OF THE GOOD NAME’ WHO TAUGHT THAT MAN REACHES GOD THROUGH JOY RATHER THAN SORROW), MARTIN LUTHER KING, HITLER. Osho: Religion is absolutely an individual and private experience, like love. In fact, there is no way to know whether Hitler knew any experience of love or not. At the most through their words and acts we can infer: – Pope John Paul certainly is not enlightened. – and Rabbi Ba’al Shemtov is certainly enlightened. – Martin Luther King is a good man, but not enlightened. – and, of course, Hitler is not and cannot be enlightened. The really enlightened person has no desire to influence the masses. If they are influenced, that is another matter: ”The wild geese do not intend to cast their reflections; the water has no mind to receive their image.” Silent Period 3 Osho"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 14 October, 1982 in INS Portland Oregon [NOTE: This was published in THE RAJNEESH TIMES, 26th August 1983 while Osho was in silence.] OSHO’S VISIT TO THE U.S. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE WAS IN CONNECTION WITH AN APPLICATION FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN THE USA, FILED ON HIS BEHALF A YEAR EARLIER. THESE EXTRACTS ARE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT OSHO SAID ABOUT HIS WORK AND VISION. Q: ON APRIL 11, 1981, IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN POONA THAT BEGINNING MAY 1, 1981 YOU WOULD SPEAK ONLY THROUGH SILENCE AND THAT A NEW PHASE OF YOUR WORK WOULD BEGIN. THIS IS CORRECT? Osho: This is correct. One month in Poona while I was there. I was simply sitting and people were sitting by my side. Seven thousand sannyasins were living with me there. This was only one hour every day in the morning. Here also, once or twice, we have sat together. Slowly slowly, it will come again, everything, every day... it is kind of a prayer in silent communion. Q: THIS WAS YOUR DECISION TO GO INTO THIS SILENT STAGE? A: My decision. Q: OKAY, HOW LONG WILL THIS SILENT STAGE CONTINUE? A: It will continue. Q: UNTIL WHEN? 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. A: Until I feel again to speak. I have spoken so much that I felt I was speaking to the walls. It is almost futile. Q: THEN YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE ME A SPECIFIC DATE IN THE FUTURE THAT YOU WOULD RESUME SPEAKING? A: I cannot even say anything about tomorrow. Q: WAS THE SILENT PHASE OF YOUR WORK, SO TO SPEAK, IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR MEDICAL CONDITION? A: No, not at all. I had been telling it for years, that one day I’m going to stop speaking and just communicate through silence. Q: WHEN DID YOU DELIVER YOUR LAST DISCOURSE? A: That date you mentioned. Q: OKAY, ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT YOU WOULD STOP SPEAKING ON MAY 1. A: That must have been the last. Q: WHO DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THEN DURING THIS SILENT STAGE, ASIDE FROM THE PRESENT COMPANY? A: It is something difficult... less of the intellect and more of the heart. Q: I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, WHO DO YOU ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION WITH? A: I don’t engage in anything, I simply sit there silently in a prayerful mood. Q: OKAY, BUT DO YOU TALK WITH ANYBODY DURING THE SILENT MOOD? A: No, but that prayerful mood is infectious. Q: DO YOU NOT TALK WITH SHEELA? A: No, with Sheela I talk every day. That is a different matter. Q: OKAY, THAT’S WHAT I’M INTERESTED IN, WHO YOU VERBALLY COMMUNICATE WITH THEN DURING THIS SILENT STAGE. A: Only with Sheela because she has to bring the work to me, and what she cannot decide I will seek an answer to. She has to ask me. Q: THEN SHE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS CONVERSATION WITH YOU? Silent Period 5 Osho"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. A: Yes. Q: AS I SEE THE RITE OF SANNYAS, WHEN YOU INITIATE SOMEONE INTO YOUR RELIGION... WELL, I GUESS THAT YOU CAN CALL THE RITE OF SANNYAS INITIATION INTO THE RELIGION – IS THAT RIGHT? A: Right. Q: IN THE BEGINNING, IS IT TRUE THAT YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD CONDUCT THE RITE OF SANNYAS? A: Only. Q: HAS THIS CHANGED NOW? A: Now I have given responsibilities, because more people have grown up to this state of consciousness. Q: WHEN DID YOU APPROVE THIS ISSUE AS TO SOMEONE ELSE CONDUCTING SANNYAS? A: In Poona. Q: HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN ADMINISTER SANNYAS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW? THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF NOW? A: Near about thirty. Q: ABOUT THIRTY? A: Yes. Q: CAN YOU GIVE ME A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT SANNYAS MEANS TO YOU. A: Yes. Q: I MEAN BRIEFLY, IF YOU CAN DO SO. A: Yes. Sannyas to me means a life lived moment to moment, fruitfully, sincerely, without any idea of really why. All the old religions are motivating people that you get rewards, even in this life, or in some other life or after life. To me, this suggests exploiting their greed. This is not religious. This is pure business. My initiation simply means that you do not consider any reward. If you love the work, then do it for love’s sake. To me work is worship and there is no need for any other worship and there is no need for any other worship. There is no need for any church or for any temple; there is no need even to believe in God. Silent Period 6 Osho"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. I don’t teach any belief. I simply teach that you live because life is already there – you need not believe in it. and do not consider any reward. It is reward that makes you cunning, greedy, and then in devious ways you try to get it. Sannyas is a totally new kind of religion – religion in the sense that it does not bother at all about God, whether he exists or not, it does not bother about afterlife. Its whole existence is to know this consciousness that you already have and use this consciousness lovingly in whatsoever you are doing. Let go desire for any reward. If nothing comes out of it, there is no problem, because the work itself was its own reward. Q: IN SEVERAL OF THE BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ OF YOURS YOU SPEAK OF THIS STAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT. I’M ALSO INTERESTED IN WHAT ENLIGHTENMENT MEANS TO YOU. A: Enlightenment means being fully conscious, aware. Ordinarily we are not conscious and not aware. We are doing things either out of habit or out of biological instincts... Just as Freud’s conscious mind, unconscious mind, and Jung says collective unconscious mind, I say there is a superconscious mind and collective conscious mind. To reach to the collective conscious mind they are going to the roots and I am going to the flowers. But they’re all interconnected and all the devices and matters are to discover in you, something which is simply watchfulness. For example, I can watch my body – certainly I’m not the body. I can watch my hand: it’s hurting, but I’m not the hurt – I’m the watcher. I can watch my thoughts, then I’m not the thought. I’m the watcher and I can watch even the watcher. That is the moment beyond which you cannot go and enlightenment comes. Enlightenment is simply that you become so conscious, so full of light, that it starts overflowing your life, your being. You can impart it. Q: THERE HAVE BEEN MANY THINGS WRITTEN BY YOU, AND ABOUT YOU. I HAVEN’T HAD TIME TO RESEARCH EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE READ... I’M GOING TO READ SOME THINGS TO YOU AND I MERELY WANT YOU TO CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT YOU SAID THIS. WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME? DO YOU UNDERSTAND? A: Yes. Q: OKAY, NOW I THINK THIS IS AN EXACT QUOTE THAT OCCURRED IN JULY OF 1979 FROM YOU ”Book of the Books”: ”THIS ASHRAM IS ONLY A LAUNCHING PAD ON A SMALL SCALE. I AM EXPERIMENTING. THE NEW COMMUNE WILL BE ON A BIG SCALE – 10,000 SANNYASINS LIVING TOGETHER AS ONE BODY, ONE BEING. NOBODY WILL POSSESS ANYTHING, EVERYBODY WILL USE, EVERYBODY WILL ENJOY. EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LIVE AS COMFORTABLY, AS RICHLY, AS WE CAN MANAGE, BUT NOBODY WILL POSSESS ANYTHING.” DID YOU SAY THAT? A: Yes, I said it. Silent Period 7 Osho"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. Q: DO YOU REMEMBER? A: We have already started those communes in the world. Now we have communes: two communes in Italy and one in Sicily, one in England, two in Holland, two in Germany, one in France, one in Japan, one in India, one in Nepal and in many other countries. Q: DO YOU CONSIDER THESE ONE COMMUNE? A: They are separate communes. Q: IS RAJNEESHPURAM THE COMMUNE THAT YOU SPOKE OF AT THAT TIME? A: It is the commune for America. Q: OKAY, DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A TEACHER OF RELIGION? A: I will have to explain it. Q: YOU MAY FEEL FREE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. A: In India we have five categories of teachers. The first category is called the arihanta; he’s a teacher and also a master. Being a master means that he has realized what he says. For example, Jesus will be called an Arihanta because whatsoever he says is his own realization. He says, ”It is on my own authority.” The second category is called the siddha. The Siddha is only a master. He has realized but he’s incapable of communicating it. He cannot say what he has realized; in a way he is dumb. And there have been many saints in the world who have not spoken because they cannot manage to bring the beyond within the words. That too is called a Buddha, a teacher. The third category is called an acharya – who is only a teacher but not a master. He knows exactly what he’s teaching, but not on his own authority. The Pope is an Acharya. If Jesus is an Arihanta, then the Pope is an Acharya. He is speaking on the authority of the Bible, not on his own authority. The fourth category is called ubadhyay – one who is not even certain of what he says. Perhaps fragments are true. P.D. Ouspensky has written a book on Gurdjieff: IN SEARCH OF THE MIRACULOUS. Its subtitle is ”FRAGMENTS OF AN UNKNOWN TEACHING”, and he’s very true in writing the subtitle – only fragments, because he could understand only parts of it; parts were beyond him. He’s also called a teacher. And the fifth is called a sadhu. A Sadhu is one who has not achieved but is trying sincerely to achieve. He may be just one foot ahead of you, but he can teach that much. He cannot claim the achievement; he cannot say with certainty that this is so. English is poor in that way, it has only two words. English is poor in many ways, particularly as far as religion is concerned, but is bound to be so. Eastern languages are poor in scientific terms. So you have only one word, teacher, for everything. You can call me a teacher but to us it means a very lower category. Silent Period 8 Osho"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. Q: WHERE WOULD YOU PUT YOURSELF ON THIS LIST OF FIVE CATEGORIES? A: I am an Arihanta. You can call me a super teacher, because I speak on my own authority. I don’t have to rely on Jesus, or Buddha, or Krishna. What I say, I know. If I don’t know, I don’t say it. Q: DO YOU CONSIDER SHEELA ENLIGHTENED? A: No, not yet. Q: DOES SHE NOT HAVE THE POWER TO CONDUCT SANNYAS? A: She has the power to conduct Sannyas, as one of the Acharya category – those five categories all can conduct Sannyas – but she has to conduct Sannyas only with my consent, she cannot conduct Sannyas on her own. Q: SHEELA HAS NOT REACHED? A: She may reach any moment, but she has not reached yet. THERE IS SOME DISCUSSION OF THE RUNNING OF THE ASHRAM IN POONA. OSHO EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DAY-TO-DAY RUNNING OF THE ASHRAM AND THE SPIRITUAL WORK. A: about these small things I give them absolute freedom. As far as initiation is concerned and the inner transformation is concerned, sannyas is total surrender. Either you are a Sannyasin or you are not. You cannot be in a doubtful situation. And it is not democratic, remember... no transformation process can be democratic because it is like asking the sleeping people, ”Would you like to be awake?” So what?... A sleeping person has to be awakened. He cannot be asked. He may even resist, he may even fight you, that you are disturbing his beautiful dream. I’m not talking about the society. For the society and the political world, democracy is perfectly okay, but for any inner transformation process democracy does not work, it has never worked. Q: ARE YOU EVEN CONSULTED THEN IN SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MATTERS OF THE FOUNDATION GO? A: No, nothing. Q: NOT SO FAR AS THE PURCHASE OF ANY PROPERTY? A: No, I know also nothing. Q: YOU HAD NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OR THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAJNEESHPURAM? A: No. Silent Period 9 Osho"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. Q: ARE YOU AWARE THAT MANY SANNYASINS HAVE RECENTLY MARRIED HERE IN OREGON? A: I have heard. Q: DID YOU APPROVE OF THESE MARRIAGES? A: Nothing – I neither approve nor do I disapprove. That is their business if they want to marry here; it is perfectly for them... Q: IN YOUR OPINION, SHOULD THEY GO INTO THIS MARRIAGE WITH THE IDEA THAT IT BE A LIFE-LONG RELATIONSHIP? A: No, nothing can be lifelong in this life. Only bogus and hypocritical things can be lifelong. Q: WELL, I REALIZE THAT THINGS CHANGE IN EVERYBODY’S LIFE... A: Everybody changes, everything changes. Today maybe... it may look like we will be together for the whole life, tomorrow it may not look... Q: BUT SHOULD THERE NOT BE THAT COMMITMENT AT THE TIME THEY ENTER INTO THIS MARRIAGE? A: No, any commitment for the future is a bondage, and is a destructive bondage. You can commit only for the moment. I can say about this moment, I cannot say about tomorrow. What that tomorrow will bring, who knows? So to me, marriage is only a working partnership. If it works, good; if it works your whole life, good. If it does not work, then say good-bye. I don’t think it’s anything sacred. It is just an institution and a working partner ship like any working partnership of the business world; nothing to be bothered about so much. And every marriage carried the divorce behind it. Either you have to become one day a hypocrite – you go on smiling and saying ”dear” and ”darling” and you don’t mean it – or the society condemns you if you divorce. Marriage brings divorce in. If you want no divorce in the world, then the marriage has to go. And it should be a working partnership: two person who want to live together, perfectly good. Q: THERE HAVE BEEN ARTICLES WRITTEN IN MAGAZINES WHICH DESCRIBE THE DISMANTLING OF THE ASHRAM IN POONA AFTER YOUR DEPARTURE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN SOME OF THESE MAGAZINES... A: The ashram exists still. Q: WELL, ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE, THOUGH, RIGHT? A: It is bound to be because I’m not there and for one and a half years I’ve not been there. Silent Period 10 Osho"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2. Q: DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GURUS THERE ARE IN INDIA? JUST AN ESTIMATE? A: It is very difficult. In India there must be thousands of people. Q: HOW DO YOU PUT IMPORTANCE UPON WEALTH? A: All the religions have condemned it and praised poverty, and I’ve condemned all those religions. Because of their praise of poverty, poverty has persisted in the world. I don’t condemn wealth. Wealth is a perfect means which can enhance people in every way, can make their life rich in all.... So I am a material spiritualist. I’m not just a spiritualist, and I’m not just a materialist. Q: WITHIN THE VOLUME OF ARTICLES THAT I READ, I CAME ACROSS A STORY THAT TALKS ABOUT A GURU WHO LIVED 700 YEARS AGO. HE WENT ON A FAST THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST 21 DAYS, WAS MURDERED ON THE 18TH DAY OF HIS FAST AND WAS REINCARNATED 700 YEARS LATER. THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF HIS LIFE HE NEITHER CRIED OR NURSED. IS THIS STORY TOLD ABOUT YOU? A: Right. Q: DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOT STARTED? A: I have told it. Q: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TREATED FOR ANY MENTAL DISORDER? A: No, I have been treating people for mental disorders. Q: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TREATED FOR ANY DRUG ADDICTION? A: I don’t even take coffee or tea... Quoted in Max Brecher’s A Passage to America, page 177: The Rajneesh Times printed Hunter-Rajneesh interview at the Portland INS, what was left out, as far as Sheela was concerned, was more important: From The Oregonian, ”For Love and Money”, July 1985 ”I am not making anybody head of my religion because I don’t want any books to be followed. I don’t want people exploiting others in my name. I am not going to be succeeded by anybody. The day I am dead, I am dead. There is no question of my successor.” Silent Period 11 Osho"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 1983 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA [NOTE: This was published in THE RAJNEESH TIMES, 19th August 1983 while Osho was in silence.] INTERVIEW WITH KIRK BRAUN Q: WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF RAJNEESHISM? Osho: Rajneeshism is not a religion like Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, etc. The name should not be misunderstood. It simply shows a poverty of language – to be exactly true, Rajneeshism is a religionless religion. In other words it is a kind of religiousness, not a dogma, cult or creed but only a quality of love, silence, meditation and prayerfulness. Hence it can never end. It is not beginning with me. It has always existed and it will always exist. It is the very essence of human evolution, of culture consciousness. Buddha, Jesus or Krishna are nothing but expressions of this spirit, but it was not possible in those days for religion to be manifested as well as it can be now. Because Jesus did not know about Buddha, Buddha did not know about Lao Tzu, and Krishna was also unaware of Lao Tzu, etc. I have traveled all the paths and have looked at the truth from all the windows. What I am saying is going to last forever because nothing more could be added to it. Buddha was not so sure of his religion. He said that his religion would last for 5,000 years, and that too only if he didn’t allow women to join his commune. And when women entered his commune he said, ”Now the religion will only last 500 years”. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3. All of these people have talked about some aspect fo truth and their disciples have understood it as the whole truth. I am talking about the whole truth so the future of my religion is infinite. All other religions will disappear into it as all the rivers disappear into the ocean. Q: WILL THE WORLD MAKE ANY PROGRESS IN THE AREA OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING? Osho: Certainly. In fact the time in which we are living is of tremendous importance. A revolution in human consciousness is no more a luxury, it has become an absolute need as there are only two alternatives – suicide or a quantum leap in consciousness, which Nietzsche called superman. And I absolutely believe that nobody wants to choose suicide. Up to now man has been surviving without transformation because there was no urgency for change. Nuclear weapons have brought a great urgency for a choice of now or never. There is a simple law that life wants to survive, so in my vision humanity is going to take the same significant change that the monkeys made when monkeys became human. Q: DO YOU THINK RAJNEESHEES WILL SURVIVE THE PREDICTED NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST AND IF SO, HOW? Osho: As I said earlier monkeys took a jump and became human beings, but not all monkeys did. The remaining ones are still monkeys so let me put your question in a different way. I will not say that Rajneeshees will survive the holocaust but I can say with an absolute guarantee that those who will survive will be the Rajneeshees and the remaining will be monkeys or commit suicide. In fact the remaining don’t matter.

Beginning next year, the world will face 15 years of catastrophic natural and man-made disasters – including nuclear war. Tokyo, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Bombay all will be destroyed – but the holocaust to come will not be confined to these major population centers. And unless human consciousness changes totally, man cannot survive. As he is right now, he is already outdated. There will be floods which have never been known since the time of Noah, along with earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and everything else that is possible through nature. There will be wars which are bound to end in nuclear explosions, hence no ordinary Noah’s Arks are going to save humanity. (Here) we are creating a Noah’s Ark of consciousness, remaining centered exactly in the middle of the cyclone.

Rajneeshism does not ask anyone to renounce their religion and does not have any conflict with Buddha, Christ, Krishna, Lao Tzu, etc. Basically Rajneeshism has the essential core of all religiousness. The other religions are against each other’s traditions and attitudes. In fact, these other religions are fanatic and each believes and fights that theirs is the true religion and others are false. This is not the case with me or Rajneeshism. A Christian can become a Rajneeshee and he is not asked to drop his love for Jesus, in fact he finds Jesus in me. The same is true for a Buddhist or a Mohammedan. Our commune consists of people from all religions who have found their religion’s truth in me. We have thousands of Christians, Buddhists, Jainas, Hindus and Jews who are Rajneeshees. we have people from every country, every race and every religion and there is no discrimination. Even an atheist is absolutely accepted and loved in our religion. Rajneeshism is a way of life. It has nothing to do with hocus-pocus or heaven and hell. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5.

MCMURRAY Your Honor, before I take the oath, I have to say few things, otherwise the oath will be a fraud. The first thing – I have always been against the ritual of oath-taking for the simple reason that if a man is capable fo lying he can lie even while he is taking the oath. His oath can be a lie, and if a man is a man of truth, the oath creates a dilemma for that man. For the man of truth to take the oath means that he is capable of lying. Without the oath he will lie and with the oath he will say the truth. You are putting me into a dilemma, but I am not a serious man. In life I never take anything seriously, except the jokes. I will take this oath just to play the game of this deposition. I will follow the rule, but I would like you to remember that by taking the oath I am lying in the first place. It is against my philosophy of life and you are forcing me to take the oath, that means you are freeing me, giving me the freedom to lie later on although I am not going to lie. The oath allows me to lie, but in spite of that freedom I will only say the truth, because I am incapable of lying. That is impossible, that is against my being and my existence. Now, just to play the game, I will take the oath. You can repeat what you want. ... I take the oath on the book of Rajneeshism that I will speak only the truth. It is good that you have allowed me to take the oath on the book of Rajneeshism because these are my own words, but this is such ridiculousness that I am taking oath on my own words. These dead words on the paper mean more to you than my living words. But if it was a Bible, I would have refused immediately, or 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6. Koran, or Gita, or any so-called holy book, because they are full of lies, out-of-date, un-scientific, sub-status. ... When Christ is alive it is a religion, when Christ is dead then it is a cult because those who are believing are not knowing their belief is just blind belief. so there has been only one Christian, and that was Jesus who was crucified, after him there has not been a single Christian again. All other Christians are bigots. I have rarely come across a person who is not a bigot. He may not consciously accept it, but deep down either he is a Christian or a Mohammedan, or a Hindu, and all those beliefs make him a bigot, because he already has made his mind without knowing the truth. Jesus may not be a bigot, but Christians are, Buddha may not be a bigot, but Buddhists are, because Buddha is speaking his own experience and Buddhists are only believing that his experience is true. So they know who is a bigot, and who is a fascist and who is a racist. that is so simple they need not come to me and ask about it, I have said it all, I stopped speaking only because I have said everything possible that they will need. I have answered 10,000 questions and I cannot think you can bring any questions more than that concerning religion, mind, philosophy, psychology, but there is no need now, I am a silent man, I am not in any way active. ... Please don’t waste the time of the honorable judge, and don’t show that you don’t have enough intelligence to understand simple things. Ask me some intelligent question. I was hoping some intelligent person is going to be there, don’t be so mediocre. don’t you have anything else? ... I trust my people, that is my whole way of life. A SELECTION FROM A DISCOURSE GIVEN BY OSHO IN 1978 IS READ AND THEN OSHO CONTINUES: It is absolute nonsense to read that big passage – you simply ask me the question. These are my own words, but they were spoken six years before, they were spoken in India; they were spoken in a totally different context. I have been in different phases of work. First, I was working on myself, then I was working to find the right expression to allow people to know what I have known, so for 20 years I have been travelling all over India; third, when I have found my people then I remain in one place, in Poona. That was a special experiment. it was not a political place, so the question of democracy does not arise at all. Jesus was not a democrat, not was Buddha a democrat, nor was Moses a democrat. These people who have known the truth cannot depend on voting whether it is true or not. It is their own experience. I am not a democrat as far as my religion is concerned but that does not imply politics at all. Democracy is a political phenomenon. And democracy takes care of the last person in the society, the most ignorant. Democracy is really for the most ignorant. It is mobocracy. Religion takes care of the highest man, the Buddha, the enlightened, the Christ, who has known the truth. Now there is no question of deciding whether it is true or not by voting, by people who know nothing about it. In that experiment there was no question of democracy. That does not mean that I am against democracy. In politics democracy is okay, but politics is a lower Silent Period 18 Osho"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6. field. Religion is the highest phenomenon on the earth. In religion it can only be dictatorial, and by dictatorial I don’t mean the dictatorship of masses, communists, by dictatorial I mean simply the master dictates and the disciple follows, there is no question of whether it is right or wrong. This was my third phase of work. When that phase was over I moved out of India and I moved into silence. Now the situation and the context is totally different. I am no more concerned with the Commune, its day to day work, its details, its economics, its finance. I am not concerned at all with any mundane worldly affairs. Now my disciples are prepared enough to take care of the Commune. I am just an outsider. they can ask only their spiritual questions to me, nothing else. and if you want to ask me spiritual questions you have to come here like a disciple, sit on the ground in total acceptance, not like the way you are sitting here, interrogating me.

All other religions were only experiments that failed. So not only say to them that we are a religion, say to them that we are the only religion. Christianity has failed, failed its master, Christ. Mohammedanism has failed. Buddhism has failed. Hinduism has failed. Up to now, perhaps man was not mature enough to become religious, so only individuals have been religious. This is the only commune in the whole history of man which is religious. So, tell those guys this is the only religion. All others are just premature experiments which have failed. And we are not going to fail. For the simple reason because we don’t have any belief that can be proved untrue. We don’t have any dogma that can be criticized. We don’t live on fictions like Christians believing in God and the Trinity which they cannot prove. Hindus, mohammedans, Jains, Buddhists, they all live on fictions which have no logical roots, which are not scientific, but superstitious, utterly superstitious. 20"}]
