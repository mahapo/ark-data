Wherever this intention does not plainly appear, neither the books nor their authors have the finalleft claim to the approbation of mankind. To diffufe the knowledge of Science, is the profefled defign of the fol¬ lowing work. What methods, it may be afked, have the compilers em¬ ployed to accomplifh this defign ? Not to mention original articles, they have had recourse to the belt books upon almoft every fiibject, extracted the ufeful parts, and rejected whatever appeared trifling or lefs interefl- ing. Inftead of difmembering the Sciences, by attempting to treat them intelligibly under a multitude of technical terms, they have digefted the principles of every fcience in the form of fyftems or diffcinct treatifes, and explained the terms as they occur in the order of the alphabet, with re¬ ferences to the fciences to which they belong. As this plan differs from that of all the Dictionaries of Arts and Scien¬ ces hitherto publiflied, the compilers think it neceflary to mention what they imagine gives it a fuperiority over the common method. A few words will anfwer this purpofe. Whoever has had occafion to confidt Chambers, Owen, rirc. or even the voluminous French Encyclopedic , will have difcovered the folly of attempting to communicate fcience under the various technical terms arranged in an alphabetical order. Such an at¬ tempt is repugnant to the very idea of fcience, which is a connected fe- ries of conclufions deduced from felf-evident or previoufly difcovered prin¬ ciples. It is well if a man be capable of comprehending the principles and relations of the different parts of fcience, when laid before him in one uninterrupted chain. But where is the man who can learn the prin¬ ciples of any fcience from a Dictionary compiled upon the plan hitherto adopted? We will, however, venture to affirm, that any man of ordi¬ nary parts, may, if he chuf s, learn the principles of Agriculture, of A- ftronomy, of Botany, of Chemiftry, &c. drc. from the Encyclopedia Britann ica. In the execution of this extenfive and multifarious undertaking, the Compilers laboured under many difadvantages, partly arifing from the nature of the work, and partly owing to the following ciicumflance. The"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"vi PREFACE. Th e Editors, though fully fenfible of the propriety of adopting the prefent plan, were not aware of the length of time neceffary for the ex¬ ecution, but engaged to begin the publication too early. However, by the remonflrances of the Compilers, the publication was delayed for twelve months. Still time was wanted. But the fubfcribers pufhed the Editors, and they at lafl perfuaded the Compilers to confent to the publication. If time had been allowed, the Compilers defigned to have compleated the fciences before proceeding to the technical terms; and by that means to have guarded againft omiffions, and made all the references from the terms to the fciences more particular. The conlequence was unavoidable. Ail the references to any fcience that occur in the alphabet previous to the name of the fcience itfelf, are general: tliofe that follow' are parti¬ cular ; pointing out, not only the name of the fcience, but the number of the? page. We mult further acknowledge, that, in fome in fiances, we have de¬ viated from the general plan; but, we hope, not without reafon. For ex¬ ample, under the words Botany and Nat u r a l History, it would have been an endlefs, and perhaps an ufelefs talk, to have given the generic diftindtions of every plant, and of every animal. Thefe are to be found under the names of the plants and animals themfelves. The fame obfei> ration may be made with refpeet to Mineralogy, Materia Medica , Pa¬ thology, Pbyftolo'gy , and ‘Therapeutics. Thefe, are fo interwoven with Anatomy, Botany,. Cbcmijiry, and Medicine, that, in a work of this kind, it was almoft impoffible, without many unneceflary repetitions, to treat them as diftined fciences. Indeed, properly fpeaking, they are not fciences, but parts or acceffbries of fciences, which, by the dexterity of teachers and authors, have been long exhibited under that form. With regard to errors in general, whether falling under the denomi¬ nation of mental, typographical, or accidental, we arc confcious of being able to point out a greater number than any critic whatever. Men who are acquainted with the innumerable difficulties attending the execution of a work of fueh an extenfive nature will make proper allowances. 1 o thefe we appeal, and fhall refl fatlsfied with the judgment they pronounce. In order to give fame idea,of the materials of which this Dictionary is eompofed, we fhall conclude the preface with a iifl of the principal au¬ thors made life of in the compilation.

For largenefs, trade, and. beauty, it greatly exceeds any town in the North. It (lands upon a hill or riling ground. The buildings are generally four (lories high, and have, for the mod part, gardens behind them, which gives it a beautiful appearance. On the high dreet is a large church, Which formerly belonged to the Frao- eifeans. This church was begun by Bp William Ei- phinflon, and finifhed by Gavinus Dunbar, Bifhop of Aberdeen, about the 1500. Bp Dunbar is faid like- wife to have built the bridge over the Dee, which Con- fids of feven arches.. The chief public building in the new town is the Marifhall-collcge, founded by George Keith Earl cf Mar(hall, in the year 159J ; but has fince been greatly augmented \"with additional buildings.

ABRENUNCIATION. See Renunciation. ABRIDGEMENT, in literature, a term fignifying the redudion of a book into a fmaller compafs.—The art of conveying much fentiment in few words, is the happieft talent an author can be pofleffed of. This talent rs peculiarly neceffary in the prefent ftate of li¬ terature ; for many writers have acquired the dexte¬ rity of fp reading a few tritical thoughts over feve- xal hundred pages. When an author hits ujSon a thought that pleafes him, he is apt to dwell upon it, to view it in different lights, to force it in improperly, or upon the flighteft relations. f I'hough this may be pleafant to the writer, it tires and vexes the reader. There is another great fource of diffufion in compo- fition. It is a capital object with an author, whatever be the fubjed, to give vent to all his belt thoughts. When he finds a proper place for any of them, he is peculiarly happy. But, rather than facrifice a thought he is fond of, he forces it in by way of digrelfion, or fuperfluous illuftration. If none of thefe expe¬ dients anfwer his purpofe, he has recourfe to the mar¬ gin, a very convenient apartment for all manner of pedantry and impertinence. There is not an author, however corred-j but is more or lefs faulty in this refped. An abridger, however, is not fubjed to thefe temptations. The thoughts are not his own; he views them in a cooler and lefs affedionate manner; he dilco- vers an impropriety in fome, a vanity in others, and a want of utility in many. His bufinefs, therefore, is to retrench fuperfluities, digreffions, quotations, pe¬ dantry, <bc. and to lay before the public only what is really ufeful. This is by no means an eafy employ¬ ment : To abridge fome books, requires talents equal, if not fuperiour, to thofe of the author. The fads, manner, fpirit, and reafoning, mull be preferved; no¬ thing effential, either in argument or illuftration, ought to be omitted. The difficulty of the talk is the prin¬ cipal reafon why we have fo few good abridgements : Wynne’s abridgement of Locke’s Effay on the Hu¬ man Underftanding is, perhaps, the only unexception¬ able one in cur language. ) ABR 0 Thefe obfervations relate folely to fuch abridge¬ ments as are defigned for the public. But, When a perfon wants to fet down the fubftance of any book, a fhorter and lefs laborious method may be followed. It would be foreign to our plan to give ex¬ amples of abridgements for the public : But, as it may be ufeful, efpecially to young people, to know how to abridge books for their own ufe, after giving a few diredions, we fliall exhibit an example or two, to ftiew with what eafe it may be done. Read the book carefully ; endeavour to learn the principal view of the author; attend to the argu¬ ments employed: When you have done fo, you will generally find, that what the author ufes as new or additional arguments, are in reality only collateral ones, orextenfions of the principal argument. Take a piece of paper, or a common-place book, put down what the author wants to prove, fubjoin the argu¬ ment or arguments, and you have the fubftance of the book in a few lines. For example, In the Effay on Miracles, Mr Hume’s defign is to prove, That miracles which have not been the imme¬ diate objeds of our fenfes, cannot reafonably be be¬ lieved upon the teftimony of others. Now, his argument, (for there happens to be but one), is, “ That experience, which in fome things is vari- “ able, in others uniform, is our only guide in rea- “ foning concerning matters of fad. A variable ex- “ perience gives rife to probability only; an uniform “ experience amounts to a proof. Our belief of any “ fad from the teftimony of eye-witneffes, is deri- “ ved from no other principle than our experience “ in the veracity of human teftimony. If the fad “ attefted be miraculous, here arifes a conteft of “ two oppofite experiences, or proof againft proof. “ Now, a miracle is a violation of the laws of na- “ ture ; and as a firm and unalterable experience has “ eftablilhed thefe laws, the proof againft a miracle, “ from the very nature of the fad, is as complete as' “ any argument from experience can polfibly be ima- “ gined; and if fo, it is an undeniable confequence, “ that it cannot be furmounted by any proof what- “ ever derived from human teftimony.” In Dr Campbell’s Differtation on Miracles, the au¬ thor’s principal aim is to (hew the fallacy of Mr Hume’s argument; which he has done moft fuccefsfully by an¬ other Angle argument, as follows : “ The evidence arifing from human teftimony is “ not folely derived from experience : on the contra- “ ry, teftimony hath a natural influence on belief an- “ tecedent to experience. The early and unlimit- “ ed affent given to teftimony by children gradually “ contrads as they advance in life: it is, therefore, “ more confonant to truth, to fay, that our diffidence “ in teftimony is the refult of experience, than that “ our faith in it has this foundation. Befides, the. “ uniformity of experience, in favour of any fad, is “ not a proof againft its being reverfed in a particular “ inftance. The evidence arifing from the Angle te- “ ftimony of a man of known veracity will go far to “ tftablilh"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"A B R ( ** eftablilh a belief ia its being actually reverfed: If “ his teftimony be confirmed by a few others of the “ fame character, we cannot with-hold our afi’ent to “ the truth of it. Now, though the operations of na- “ ture are governed by uniform laws, and though we “ have not the teftimony of our fenfes in favour of a- “ ny violation of them , Hill, if, in particular inftan- “ ces, we have the teftimony of thouftnds of our fel- “ low-creatures, and thofe too men of ftrid integri- “ ty, fwayed by no motives of ambition or intereft, “ and governed by the principles of common fenfe, “ That they were actually eye-witnelfes of thefe vio- “ lations, the conftitution of our nature obliges us to “ believe them.” w Thefe two examples contain the fubftance of about 400 pages. — Making private abridgements of this kind has many advantages; it engages us to read with accuracy and attention; it fixes the fubjcft in our minds ; and, if we Ihould happen to forget, inftead of reading the books again, by glancing a few lines, we are not only in pofleflion of the chief arguments, but recall in a good meafure the author’s method and manner. Abridging is peculiarly ufeful in taking the fub fiance of what is delivered by Profeflors, isc. It is impoflible, even with the afliflance of Ihort-hand, to take down, verbatim, what is faid by a public fpeak- er. Befides, although it were practicable, fuch a ta¬ lent would be of little ufe. Every public fpeakerhas circumlocutions, redundancies, lumber, which deferve not to be copied* All that is really ufeful may be comprehended in a fliort compafs. If the plan of the difeourfe, and arguments employed in fupport of the different branches be taken down, you have the whole. Thefe you may afterwards extend in the form of a difeourfe drefled in your own language. This would not only be a more rational employment, but would likewife be an excellent method of improving young men in compofition, an objeCt too little attended to in all our univerfities. Befides, it would be more for the honour of profeflors ; as it would prevent at lead fuch immenfe loads of disjointed and unintelligible rubbifh from being handed about by the name of fuch a man’s lcCturcs.

The conttadidtory fyrtems and hypothefes that had fucceffively been urged upon the world, Were become fo numerous, that, from a view of this ineon- ftancy and uncertainty of human opinions, many were led to conclude, that truth lay beyond the reach ofoup comprehenfion. Abfolute and univerfal fcepticifm was the natural confequeiice of this conclufien. In order to remedy this abufe of philofophy and of the hufmn Faculties, Plato laid hold of the principles of thTe aca¬ demical philofophy, and, in his Phaedo, reaforiS ntthe following manner: “ If we ate unable to difeover “ truth, (fays he), it muft be owing to two circUm- “ rtances; either there is no truth, in the nature bf “ things, or the mind, from A defedt in its powers, “ is not able to apprehend it. Upon the latter fuppo- “ fition, all the uncertainty arid fludluaiion in the opi- “ hions and judgments of mankind admit of an eafy “ folntion: Let us therefore be modeft, and aferibe “ our errors to the real weaknefs of our own minds, “ and not to the nature of things themfdves. Truth “ is often difficult of aceefs: in order to come at it, ** we mult proceed with Caution and diffidence, care- “ fully examining every ftep ; and after ail cor labdur, “ we Will frequently find our greatert efforts difap- “ pointed, and be obliged to confefs bur ignorance “ aad v/eaknds.” Labour and caution in out refearches, in oppofition to rafh and hafty decifions, were the dirtinguiffiing charac- teriftres of the difciples of the imoient academy. A philofopher poffeffed of thefe principles, will be flow in his progrefs, but will foldom fall into errors, or have ocCafion to alter his opinion after it is once form¬ ed. Vanity and precipitance are the great futures’of fcepticifm : hurried bn by thefe, inrtead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, feveral of our modern philofophers have plun¬ ged themf Ives into ah abford and- ridicul.ous kind of fcep¬ ticifm. They pretend to diferedit things that are plain, fimple, and eafily comprehended ; but give peremptory and decifive judgments upon fubjetfs that evidently ex¬ ceed the limits of our capacity; Of thefe Berkley Jnd Hume are the moft confiderable. Berkley denied the exirtence of every thing, excepting his own ideas. Mr Hume has gone a ftep further, and queftiobed even foe exirtence of ideas; but at the fame time has not hdfi- tared to give determined opinions with regard to eter¬ nity, providence, and a futUre ftate, miraculous intfcr- pofitions of the Deity, 6 c . fubjefts far above foe reach of our faculties. In his feffay on the academical or feeptical philofophy, he has confounded two vdry oppofite fperies of philofophy. After the days of Plato, indeed, the principles of the firft academy were grofsly Corrupted by Areefilas, Carneades, 6 c. TIris might lead Mr Hume into the notion that the acade¬ mical and feeptical philofophy were fynommous terms. But no principles can be of a more oppofite nattire C than."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"A C A < xo ) A C A than thofe which were inculcated by the old academy of Socrates and Plato, and the fceptical notions which were propagated by Arcefilas, Carneades, and the o- ther difciples of the fucceeding academics. ACADEMY, in antiquity, a garden or villa, fituated within a mile of Athens, where Plato' and his follow¬ ers held their philofophical conferences. It took its name from one Academus, or Ecademus, a citizen of Athens, who was the original owner of it, and made it a kind of gymnafium : he lived in the time of The- feus. . Cimon embellilhed it with fountains, trees, and walks; but Sylla, during the fiege of Athens, employed thefe very trees in making battering-engines againft the city. Cicero too had his villa, or place of retirement, near Puzzuoli, which he alfo named an academy, where he compofed his Academical que- Jlions , and his book De natura deorum. Academy, among the moderns, is mod commonly ufed to fignify a fociety of learned men, edablifhed for the improvement of any art or fcience. Charlemagne was the firft that edablifhed an academy in Europe. Mod nations have fince followed his example; but Italy has by far the greated number. In the cities of Piedmont, Ferrara, and Milan, Jarckius reckons 550. We have but few in Britain. In England thofe of note are, the Royal Society, the Antiquarian Society, Society for the encouragement of arts, and the Aca¬ demy of Painting; in Scotland, the Edinburgh So¬ ciety, College of Phyficians, and Mufical Society; all which fee in their proper places. The French have feveral academies; as, the Royal Academy of Sciences, for the improvement of phy- fics, mathematics, and chemidry. It was firft infti- tuted in 1666, by the afliftance of Mr Colbert, comptroller-general of the finances, but was not con¬ firmed by the French king till the year 1696, who, by a regulation dated the 26th of January, new-mo¬ delled and put it on a better footing. According to this regulation, the academy was to be compofed of ten honorary academicians, eight drangers affociates, twenty penfionaries fellows, twenty eleves or fcholars, and twelve French adociates ; thefe were to be divi¬ ded into fix claffes, viz. geometricians, adronomers, mechanics, anatomids, chemids, and botanids; the honorary academids to be all inhabitants of France, the penfionaries and eleves all to refide at Paris. In the year 1716, the duke of Orleans, then re¬ gent, made an alteration in their conditution, aug¬ menting the number of honoraries and adociates to twelve, admitting regulars among fuch adociates, fup- prefiing the clafs of eleves, and edablilhing in lieu thereof a new clafs of twelve adjuncts to the fix feve¬ ral kinds of fcience cultivated by the academy; and, ladly, appointing a vice-prefident, to be chofen yearly by the king out of the honorary members, and a di- redlor and fub-diredlor out of the penfionaries. The academies of Florence and Bologne, of Mont¬ pelier and Bourdeaux, of Leipfic and Berlin, and of late thofe of Peterdmrg and Seville, were formed up¬ on the fame model with the Royal Academy of Sci¬ ences. French Academy, a fociety of forty, edablifhed for improving the French language. This academy was founded by Cardinal Riclilieu, and confirmed by the edidt of Lewis XIII, in 1635. They have compiled a didtionary, intided, I.e Dic- tionaire de I'academie Francoife. This work was begun, in 1637, and finifhed in 1694. They have a diredtor and chancellor, who are drawn by lot every three months, and a fecretary who is perpetual. They meet at the old Louvre, on the Mondays, ThUrfdays, and Saturdays, all the year round, and hold an ex¬ traordinary meeting at the reception of a new mem¬ ber, and on St Lewis’s day, when the prizes of elo¬ quence and poetry are adjudged. Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This fo¬ ciety was founded about the year 16461. The mem¬ bers were at firft about twenty-five in number, viz. twelve officers, called ancients , eleven private mem¬ bers, and two fyndics; but at prefent it confifts of forty painters and fculptors. There are four perpe¬ tual redtors, nominated by the king; a diredtor and chancellor; a fecretary, who keeps the regifter, and counterfigns the difpOtches; a treafurer, twelve pro- feflors, adjundts to the redtors-and profeffors, fix counfellors, a profeffor for the part of anatomy that belongs to painting and fculpture, and another for geometry and perfpedtive. There is alfo an academy of painting, fculpture, (yc. at Rome, eftablifhed by Lewis XIV. wherein thofe who have won the annual prize at Paris, are en¬ titled to be three years entertained for their further improvement. Academy of Medals and Infcriptions, called alfo The academy of belles lettres, was eredted by Lewis XIV. for the ftudy and explanation of ancient monuments, and to perpetuate the remembrance of great events, by medals, relievos, infcriptions, iyc. The plan of this academy was formed by Mr Colbert, and efta¬ blifhed in 1663. In its firft inftitution it confifted only of four or five members ; but in 1701, they were increafed to forty, viz. ten honoraries, ten penfiona¬ ries, ten afTociates, and ten novices or eleves, under the direction of a prefident and vice-prefident, who are annually appointed by the king. Their chief employment has been upon the medal- lie hiftory of the reign of Lewis their founder. But the learned are indebted to this academy for many volumes of efl’ays on other parts of hiftory, publifhed under the title of Memoirs, &c. Academy of Architefiure, eftablifhed about the end of the year 1671 by Mr Colbert, confifted at firft only of fix architedls; but their number is fince confiderably increafed. Academy of Politics, is compofed of fix perfons, who meet at the Louvre, in the chamber where the papers relating to foreign affairs are lodged. But as the kings of France are unwilling to truft any, except their miniflers, with the infpedtion of foreign affairs, this academy is of little ufe to the public.

They began in 168410 publilh their obferv itions, under the title of Epheme- rides ; which publication has been continued annually, with fome interruptions, and under different titles. This academy confifts of a prefident, two adjuncts or fecretaries, and colleagues or members without limi¬ tation. Berlin Academy, was founded by Frederick I. the late King of Pruflia, in the year 1700. It has for its objects the improvement of natural knowledge, and the belles lettres. The charter of this fociety was amended in 1710, and by it the prefident is to be no¬ minated by the king. The members are divided into four claffcs; 1. for phyfic, medicine, and chemiftry; 2. for mathematics, aftronomy, and mechanics; 5. for the German language, and the hiftory of the country; 4. for Oriental learning, particularly what relates to the propagation of the gofpel among infidels. The great promoter of this foundation was the celebrated Mr Leibnitz. Ruffian Academy was founded by Czar Peter the Great, at Peterlburg, upon the plan of the Academy of Sci¬ ences at Paris ; befides which, they take in the Ruf¬ fian language. Academy is alfo a term for fchools and other feminaries of learning among the Jews, where their rabbins and doctors inftruCted their youth in the Hebrew language, and explained to them the Talmud, and the fecrets of the Cabbala: Thofe of Tiberias and Babylon have been the mod noted.

ACCENT, or accenting, in reading or fpeaking : When we raife the tone higher in founding any particular word or fyllable, that word or fyllable is faid to-be accented, or graced with an accent. In hexameters there is a capital accent in every line, eafily diftin-. guilhable from the reft by a-good ear. Thus, Nee bene promeritis capitdr, nec tangitur ira. Accents either in profe or poetry have a double effeft : They contribute to the melody, by giving it air and fpirit; they contribute not lefs to the fenfe, by diftin- guilhing words of importance from others. Accent¬ ing is entirely confined to long fyllables ; for a ffiofit fyllable is not capable of an accent. Every word in an hexameter line that has a long fyllable may be ac¬ cented, unlefs the fenfe interpofe, which rejects the accenting a word that makes no figure by its fignifica-* tion. But, notwithftanding this circumftance, there is conftandy one accent in every line which makes a greater figure than any of the reft. Thus, Smooth flow the wives, the zephyrs gently play, , Belinda fmil'd, and all the world was gay. In order to facilitate the reading of dead languages, grammarians have adopted various characters for di- . ftinguifhing the accents belonging to particular Eylla- bles; fuch as the acute, marked thus, ('), the grave thus ('), and the circumflex thus (' J ) , ! or(*), fee. The .. acute denotes that the voice is to be raifed; the grave, that it is to be lowered or flattened ; and the circumflex, that the fyllable is to be lengthened or dwelt upon.

Lipf. 17x6, Bernouilli’s Cogitat. degravitate xtkeris, &c. See, Before the method of philofophiffng by induction was known, the hypothefes of philolophers were wild, fan¬ ciful, ridiculous. They had recouife to ether, occult qualities, and other imaginary caufes, in order to ex¬ plain the various phenomena of nature: But fince the days of the great Lord Verulam, who may be ftyled the parent of genuine philofophy, a contrary courfe has happily been followed. He convinced the world, that all knowledge mud be derived from experiment and obfervation; and that every attempt to invedigate caufes by any other means mud be unfuccefsful. Since his time, the bed philofophers have followed the tradh 'which he pointed out. Boyle, Locke, Newton, Hales, and a few others, in little more than one centujry, have improved and extended fcience far beyond what the accumulated force of all the philofophers fince the creation had been able to effedluate : A driking proof both of rhe comprekenfive genius of Bacon, and of the folidity of his plan of inveltigation. It mud indeed be acknowledged, that there is a pro- penficy in the human mind, which, unlefs it be pro¬ perly redrained, has a diredt tendency both to corrupt fcience, and to retard ourprogrefs in it. Not contented, with the examination of objedls which readily fall with¬ in the fp-here of cur observation, we feel a drong de¬ fire to account for things which, from their very na¬ ture, mud, and ever will, elude our refearches. Even Sir Ifaac Newton himfelf was not proof againft this temptation. It was not enough that he had difeovered the nature of light and colours, the application of gra¬ vity to the motions cf the heavenly bodies, &c. lie mud go further, and attempt to allign the caufe of gravity, it- ielf. But, how dots he proceed kilns matter ? Not in the ( 3 * )"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"m t h ( 32 the way ofcxpcriment, which had led him to his former difcoveries, but in the way of conjedture, which will never lead any man to truth. He had recourfe to a fubtile elaftic aether, not much different from that of the ancients, and by it accounted for every thing he did not know, fuch as the caufe of gravitation, mufeu- lar motion, fenfation, he. Notwithftanding the reputation of Sir Ifaac, philo- fophers have generally looked upon this attempt as the foible of a great man, or, at leaft, as the moft ufelefs part of his works ; and accordingly perufe it rather as a dream or a romance, than as having any connexion with fcience. But we are forry to find, that fome late attempts have been made to revive diis dodtrine of aether, particularly in a differtation De ortu animalium caloris, publifhed in May laft. As the revival of an old dodfrine becomes in fome meafure a new one, we fhall plead no other apology for inferting a fpecimen of the method of reafoning employed in this differtation. The author makes frequent ufe of a fpecies of ar¬ gument termed dilemma by logicians. For example, ,in the firft part of the work, after endeavouring to prove that animal heat cannot be owing to fermenta¬ tion, the motion of the fluids, and other caufes that have ufually been affigned, he draws this conclufion:— “ If none of thefe caufes are fufficient to produce the “ effedt ; therefore, by dilemma,” fays he, “ itmuft be ‘ ‘ fought for in the nature and adtion of the nerves.” —This is a new fpecies of dilemma:—-If the author had proved, that the caufe of heat in animals could not poflibly exift any ’where , but either in fermenta¬ tion, the motion of the fluids, he. or in the nerves, after having difprpved its exigence in all the reft, his conclufion in favour of the nerves would have been juft; but, as he has not fo much as attempted this, the conclufion is not only falfe, but ridiculous. However, upon the authority of this dilemma, the au¬ thor firft gives what he calls a Compend of a new doc¬ trine concerning the nerves, and then proceeds to inquire in what manner the nerves produce animal heat: He tells us, “ That thought ( cog 'tlatio ) and fenfation depend “ uponimpulfes either on the extremities of the nerves, “ or the fenforium commune, and the confequent mo- “ tions produced by thefe impulfes: That thefe motions ** are fo quick, as to be almoft inftantaneous: That as “ all motion is mechanical; therefore thought, fen- “ fation, and mufcular motion, muft likewife be me- “ chanical: That fuch quick motions cannot be pro- “ duced without the intervention of fome extreme- “ ly elaftic power; and, as Sir Ifaac Newton has “ Ihown, that the impulfes which occafion the diffe- “ rent fenfations muft be owing to an elaftic power; “ therefore the mufcular motions of animals muft be “ occafioned by the ofcillations of fome elaftic pow.er.” “ But,” fays he, “ as this elaftic power cannot ex- “ ift in the folid nervous fibres, nor in any inelaftic “ fluid; therefore, by dilemma, it muft exift in an “ elaftic fluid; and hence alfo, by the former dilemma, “ this elaftic fluid muft be feated, either in the nerves, Ci or in their medullary fubftance.” ) M T H Here again the author calls Sir Ifaac into his aflift- ar.ee.—“ What confirms this opinion,” fays he, “ is “ the Newtonian aether, which pervades all nature, “ ahd which, with a few variations in its modification, “ Sir Ifaac has Ihown to be the caufe of cohefion, e- * lafticity, gravity, eledtficity, magnetifm, he. in “ the following manner: 1. As the rays of light, “ when reflected, do not touch the folid parts of bo- “ dies, but are refledted a little before they reach “ them, it is plain that the aether not only fills the “ pores of bodies, but likewife floats upon their fur-, “ faces; and hence it becomes the caufe of attraction “ and repulfion.— 2. All metals, and inelaftic fluids, “ are non-eledtrics ; on the other hand, all folid bo- “ dies, metals excepted, are eledtrics, i. e. proper for “ accumulating aether. But aether, thus accumulated “ in fuch a variety of bodies, may produce various “ motions in the parts of thefe bodies, without indu- “ cing any change in the bodies themfelves. Hence “ aether, with fome variations in its modification, is “ fufficicnt to account for all the phaenomena of elec- “ tricity. 3. As iron, by accumulating aether around “ it, exhibits all the wonders of piagnetifm; fo this “ magnetical aether is more analogous to the nervous “ aether of animals than any-other kind of it. For, “ as the magnetical aether paffes along iron without “ changing any part of the iron ; fo the nervous aether, “ in like manner, paffes along the medullary fubftance “ of the nerves, and excites motion in any part; that is “ continuous with them, without inducing any change “ in the nerves.— 4. The irritability and life of “ plants, which very much referable thofe in animals, “ cannot be expjained by any inelaftic caufe, ahd “ muft therefore be attributed to an aetherial one. “ Laftly, As the common aether is differently modi- “ fied in each of the fubftances above taken notice “ of, and alfo produces various motions or effedts pe- “ culiar to each, it likewife varies and has fome pe- “ culiar qualities when refiding in animal bodies; fo “ that the nervous or animal aether is not exactly the “ fame, but differs in fome refpedts from thofe fpecies “ of aether which give rife to cohefion, gravity, mag- “ netifm, dedlricity,” he. Having thus explained the nature and qualities of aether, our author ftarts a very important queftion, viz. “ Whence is aether derived ? and whether does it leave “ any body after having once got poffefSon of it ?” In anfwer to this, he ohferves, “ That certain bodies “ have the power of‘colledting the eledlrical matter ■ ** from every circumjacent body, and of accumula- “ ting it in their pores and on their furfaces, but do “ not fuffer it again to tranfmigrate into any other “ body. There are other fubftances of an oppofite “ nature, which do not accumulate the eledtric mat- “ ter, but inftantly allow it to pafs into others, unlefs. “ prohibited by an eledlric. Hence,” fays he, “ no- “ tiling more is neceffary for fubftances of the former “ kind, but to be in fuch circumftances as allow them “ to accumulate the eledtric matter. In the fame. “ manner,” proceeds our author, “ the nervous aether, ■ “ which is diffufed through every part of nature, “ flows"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"JE T H ( 33 < £ flows copioufly into the meduHary par,t of the nerves, “ when no obftacle ftands in its way : but, when onee “ it has got there, it keeps firm po.fleflion, and never “ afterwards leaves it. Now,” fays he, a quan- « tity of aether probably conftitutes one of the ftami- “ nal parts of animal bodies, and increafes in propor- «** tion to their age and growth: For nothing is more “ ridiculous than to fuppofe that what is-commonly “ called the nervous fluid can be daily wafted by la- « bour and exercife, and daily repaired by a newfe- « cretion from the brain. To refute this vulgar no- “ tion, nothing more is neceflary than to fay, That “ it is one of Boerhaave's theories , and mujl be falfe, ■ “ as all Boerhaave’s other theories have been proved “ to be ill-founded! But aethgr is of a more fixed “ and determinate nature whenever it gets pofleflion f * of any fubftance, it never forfakes it, unlefs the “ texture and conftitution of the body itfelf be chan- ged. Hence,” continues our author, “ the aether “ of an acid body remains as long as the body conti- “ nues to be acid; the fame observation holds with “ regard to the aether of an alkaline body: But, if “ thefe two be blended together into a neutral fait, “ the aether muft .likewife be changed into a neutral; 44 and therefore, in the formation of the medullary “ or ftaminal part of animals, the aether which before “ belonged to, or had the properties of fome other fub- “ fiance, is inftantaneoufly changed into animal aether, ** and remains fo till the diflolution of that animal.” Our author next obferves, “ That bodies require to “ be in a certain ftate or condition in order to the for- “ mation of an aether that is proper for them. This “ condition of bodies is called an excitedftate: Thus, ** as fulphur, when fluid, does not receive the eledric “ matter, but, when folid, inftantly receives it; in “ the fame manner, the nerves, though properly “ formed, do not admit an aether adapted to their “ nature, unlefs they be in an excited ftate. Hence,” fays he, “ the aether of a dead, and that of a living “ perfon, are very different, although the texture ana “ figure of the nerves be the fame. The ftate necef- “ fary for conftituting the aether of a living animal, “ feems to depend on heat and moifture ; becaufe thefe “ things are abfolutely neceflary in the conftitution of “ Jife: And henee,” concludes our author, “ the ex- “ cited ftate of the-nerves depends on heat and moi- “ fture. There are alfo certain circumftances,” fays he, “ which contribute to render the ftate of the “ nerves more or lefs apt for accumulating aether: A “ fpafmodic fever, for example, renders the nerves of “ the whole body lefs pervious to the motion ©f the “ aether ; and hence, in cafes of this nature, health, “ and all the vital funttions, muft.be injured.” “ Thefe,” our author obferves, “ are the outlines “ of a new doftrine concerning the nature and func- “ tions of the nerves;” and, upon this foundation, proceeds to give his new theory of animal heat. “ From the foregoing reafoning,\" fays he, “ the “ heat, as well as all the functions of animals, feem “ to be oceafioned by the ofeillations of the nervous 1 ‘ aether betwixt the extremities of the fentient nerves Vpi. I. No. 2. 3 ) JE T H “ and the brain, or, more properly, betwixt the brain “ and mufcles. But electrical aether, as above ob- “ ferved, varies a little from common aether; all in- “ elaftic fluids, as was likewife formerly remarked, “ are non-eledtrics ; and all felid bodies, metals ex- “ ceptcd, are eleCtrics: Thefe circumftanCes,” fays our author, “ feem to be owing to the ofeillations of “ the eleCtric matter in bodies. In the fame manner,” fays he, “ the nature of animals may be fuch, and the “ nerves may be fo conftituted, as to form an aether ad- ** apted to their nature, and to excite thofe ofeillations 44 which occafion animal heat. The wonderful effedts 44 of heat and cold upon the nerves,” continues our author, 44 confirms this theory: Every adtion, and “ even life itfelf, requires a certain degree of heat; “ for, as the heat of the external air is fo variable, it “ was abfolutely neceflary that animal bodies, lhould ** be endowed with the faculty of producing a degree “ of heat fuited to their nature, independent of ex- 44 ternal circumftances : Hence we fee the reafon why “ the degree of heat fo feldom varies in the fame fpe- “ eies of animals. However, although the nervous ■ “ aether is always ready for exciting heat by its ofeif- “ lations ; yet, in order to bring about this effed fuc- ** cefsfully, external flimuli are neceflary, otherwife “ the aether would be in danger of flagnating, which “ would occafion fleep, a.palfy, and, laft of all, death. “ The moft permanent of thefe flimuli is the -puli'a- “ tion of the arteries; which is the reafon why heat “ is fo connedled with the circulation of the blood, “ and why many authors have miftaken it for the true “ caufe of animal heat.” Our author now concludes with obferving, “ That ** by his theory, the varieties of heat in different parts ** of the body, the heat and flufhing of the face from “ fhame, and all the other phenomena of heat in ani- ** mal bodies, admit of abetter explanation, than by •“ any other theory hitherto invented.” Having thus given a pretty full account of an at¬ tempt to explain the moft abftrufe operations of na¬ ture, as nearly as poflible in the very words of the author, we cannot deny ourfelves the liberty of ma¬ king a few obfenvations. To give a formal refutation of this author’s reafon¬ ing, is no part of our plan. It is, perhaps, wrong to fay that he has reafoned ; for the whole hypothe¬ tical part of his effay is a mere farrago of vague afler- tions, non-entities, illogical conclufions, and extra¬ vagant fancies. His aether feems to be an exceedingly tradable fort of fubftance: Whenever the qualities-of one body differ from thofe of another, a different mo¬ dification of tether at once folves the phsenomenon. The aether of iron muft not, to be fure, be exadlly the fame with the nervous aether, otherwife it would be in danger of producing fenfation in place of mag- netifm. It would likewife have been very improper to give the vegetable aether exadly the fame quali¬ ties with thofe of animal aether; for, in fuch a cafe, men would run great rifle of ftriking root in the foil, and trees and hedges might eradicate and run about the fields.

Aik him the caufe’ of thought, he will gravely reply, “ The folution of “ this queftion was once univerfally allowed to ex- “ ceed the limits of human genius: But now, by “ the grand difcoveries we have lately made, it is “ as plain as that three and two make five:— Thought “ is a mere mechanical thing, an evident effect of cer- “ tain motions in the brain produced by the ofcilla- “ tions of afubtile el attic fluid called ether!” This is indeed aftonilhing! Such jargon, however, affords an excellent leffon to the true philofopher. It fhows to what folly and extravagance mankind are led, whenever they de¬ viate from experiment and obfervation in their inqui¬ ries into nature. No fooner do we leave thefe only faithful guides to fcience, than we inflantly land in a labyrinth of nonfenfe and obfcurity, the natural pu- nifhment of folly and prefumption. When endeavouring to account for that propenfity In the human mind which prompts us to attempt the folution of things evidently beyond our reach, we re- colleftcd a paffage in Swift’s works, which explains it in the moil fatisfa«3ory manner. Let us next examine (fays the Dean) the great ■ “ introducers of new fchemes in philofophy, and “ fearch till we can find from what faculty of the foul “ the difpofition arifes in mortal man, of taking it **- into his head to-advance new fyftems, with fuch an “ eager zeal, in things agreed on all hands impojftble “ to he known; ft ora what feeds this difpofition “ fprings, and to what quality of human nature thefe “ grand innovators have been indebted for their num- “ ber of difciples; becaufe it is plain, that feveral of “ the chief among them, both ancient and modern, “ were ufually miftaken by their adverfaries, and in- “ deed by all except their own followers, to havebeen “ perfons crazed, or out of their wits; having gene- “ rally proceeded, in the common courfe of their “ words and adtions, by a method very different from “ the vulgar diftates of unrefined reafon; agreeing, “ for the mett part, in their feveral models, with “ their prefent undoubted fucceffors in the Acade- “ my of modern Bedlam. Of this kind were Epi- “ curus, Diogenes, Apollonius, Lucretius, Paracel- “ fus, Des Cartes, and others; who, if they were “ now in the world, tied fad, and leparated from “ their followers, would, in this undijlingui/hing age, “ incur manifeft danger of phlebotomy, and whips, “ and chains, and dark chambers, and fraw. For “ what man, in the natural Hate or courfe of think- “ ing, did ever conceive it in his power to reduce the “ notions of all mankind exadlly to the fame length, “ and breadth, and height of his own ? Yet this is “ thefirft humble and civil defign of all innovators in “ the empire of reafon.-Now, I would gladly “ be informed, how it is poflible to account for fuch “ imaginations as thefe in particular men, without re- “ courfe to my phenomenon of vapours, (i. e. tether), “ afeending from the lower faculties to overlhadow “ the brain, and there dittilling into conceptions, for “ which the narrownefs of our mother-tongue has not “ yet alfigned any other name befides that of madnefs “ or phrenzy. Let us therefore now conjecture bow “ it comes to pafs that none of thefe great projectors “ do ever fail providing themfelvcs and their notions “ with a number of implicit difciples; and I think “ the reafon is eafy to be afligned.—For there is a “ peculiar firing in the harmony of Jiuman underttand- “ ing, which, in feveral individuals, is exaCtly of the “ fame tuning. This if you can dextroufly ferew “ up to its right key, and then Jlrike gently upon it, “ whenever you have the good fortune to light among “ thofe of the fame pitch, they will, by a fecret ne- “ ceffary fympatliy, ltrike exadtly at the fame time. “ And in this one circumttance lies all the /kill or “ luck of the matter: For if you chance to jar the “ firing, among thofe who are either above or be- “ low your own height, inflead of fubferibing to your “ dodlrine, they will tie you fetft, call you mad, and “ feed you with bread and water. It is therefore a ** point of the nicefl condudt, t6 diflinguifli and adapt “ this noble talent with refpedt to the difference of “ perfons and of times. —For, to fpeak a bold truth, “ it is a fatal mifearriage fo- ill to order affairs as to “ pafs for a fool in one company, when in another “ you might be treated as a philofopher: Which I de- “ fire jome certain gentlemen of my acquaintance to “ lay up in their hearts as a very feafonable insist- “ endo.’ > Wc would not have dwelt fo long upon this article, had it not been to guard, as far as our influence ex-, tends, the minds of thofe who may be unacquainted with the genuine principles of philofophy, from being led into a wrong track of invefligation. ./Ether, in cbymiftry, a name given to any volatile fpi- rit.

The fituation of this quarter on the globe is betwixt 35. o. S. and 36. o. N. lat. and betwixt 17. 35. W. and 53. 21. E. long.

A GRICULTURE is the art of aflifting the earth, by means of culture, manure, £jc. to bring forth plants in greater quantity, and likewife of a larger fize and better quality, than it would produce with¬ out thefe alEftances. Agriculture is an art of fuch confequence to man¬ kind, that their very exigence, efpecially in a Hate of fociety, depends upon it. A compendious view, there¬ fore, of every material difeovery that hath hitherto PAR Of Vegetation, and the r lP H E vegetation and ceconomy of plants is one of thofe fubjeefts in which our knowledge is extremely circumfcribed. Many hypothefes have been invented ; as many have been, or may eafily be, refuted. Hypo- thefes in matters that evidently exceed our powers do much hurt : But they are likewife of fbme ufc. They incite to further inquiries ; and thefe inquiries are car¬ ried on with greater fpirit, becaufe they are intended for the purpofe of confuting. It is true this fpirit is not the moft friendly to impartial obfervation; but it makes us more indefatigable in our refearches. Retailing theories is no part of our plan. A total in¬ attention to the ftrutfure and ceconomy of plants is the chief reafon of the fmall progrefs that has been made in the principles of vegetation, and of the inftability and fluctuation of our theories concerning it. To recall the.attention of philofophers and cultivators, to the only fource from which any folid theory can ever be formed on this fubjecl, we fhaU give a fhort deferip- been made in this art, mull be ufeful both to the farm¬ er and philofopher. To accomplilh this end with the greater perfpicuity, the fubject (hall be divided into two parts. Under the firft, Vegetation, and the Structure of Plants, ihall be confidered. The fecond will contain the various Operations upon the Soil, in order to prepare it for the reception and nourifhment of plants. For the eafe of the reader, each of thefe parts Ihall be fubdivided into a number of fed ions. T I.

The feeds of plants are of various figures and fizes. Moft of them are divided into two lobes; though fome, as thofe of the creis-kind, have fix; and others, as the grains of corn, are not divided, but intire. But, as the eflential properties of all feeds are the fame, when confidered with regard to the principles of vegetation, our particular deferiptions Ihall be limited to one feed, viz. the great garden-bean. Neither is the choice of this feed altogether arbitrary; for, after it be¬ gins to vegetate, its parts are more confpicuous than ma¬ ny others, and confequcntly better calculated for invelii- gation. , This feed is covered with two coats or membranes. The"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"L_"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"A G R I C U The outer coat is extremely thin, and full of pores ; but may be eafily feparated from the inner one, (which is much thicker), after the bean has been boiled, or lain -a few days in the foil. At the thick end of the bean, there is a fmall hole vifible to the naked eye, immediately over the radicle or future root, that it may have a free paffage into the foil. Plate IV. fig. I. A. When thefe coats are taken off, the body of the feed appears, which is divided into two fmooth portions or lobes. The fmoothnefs of the lobes is owing to a thin'filin or cuticle with which they are covered. At the bafts of the bean is placed the radicle Qr future root, Plate IV. fig. 3. A. The trunk of the radicle, juft as it enters into the body of the feed, divides into two capital branches, one of which is inferted into each lobe, and fends off fmaller ones in all diredHons through the whole fubftance of the lobes, Plate IV. fig. 7. A A. Thefe ramifications become fo extremely minute towards the edges of the lobes, that they require the fineft glaf- fes to render them vifible. To thefe ramifications Grew and Malpighius have given the name of feminal root; becaufe, by means of it, the radicle and plume, before they are expanded, derive their principal nourilhment. The plume, bud, or germ, Plate IV. fig. 3. is .in- clofed in two fmall correfponding cavities in each lobe. Its colour and confiftence is much the fame with thofe of the radicle, of which it is only a continuation; but having a quite contrary direction: For the radicle de- feends into the earth, and divides , into a great number of fmaller branches or filaments ; but the plume afeends into the open air, and unfolds itfelf into all the beautiful variety of item, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit, itc. The plume in corn (hoots from the fmaller end of the grail), and, among maltfters, goes by the name of acrofpire. The next thing to be taken notice of is the fubftance, or parenchymatous part of the lobes. This is not a mere concreted juice, but is curioufly organifed, and confifts of a vaft number of fmall bladders refembling thofe in the pith of trees, Plate IV. fig. 4. Befides the coats, cuticle, and parenchymatous parts, there is a fubftance perfectly diftihdlfrom thefe, diftribu- ted in different proportions through the radicle, plume, and lobes. This inner fubftance appears very plainly in a tranfverfe fedlion of the radicle or plume. Towards the extremity of the radicle, it is one entire trunk; but higher up, it divides into three branches.; the middle one runs diredly up to the plume, and the other two pafs into the lobes on each fide,. and fpread out into a great variety of fmall branches through the whole body of the lobes, .Plate IV. fig. 7. This fubftance is very proper¬ ly termed the feminal root: for when the feed is fown, the moifture is firft abforbed by the outer coats, which are every where furnifhed with fap and air-veffels; from thefe it is conveyed to the cuticle; from the cuticle it proceeds to the pulpy part of the Jobes; when it has got thus far, it is taken up by the mouths of the fmall branches of the feminal root, and paffes from one branch into another, till it is all colledted into the main trunk, which communicates both with the plume and radicle, the two principal involved organs of the future plant. After this the fap, or vegetable food, runs in two oppo- Vol. I. No. 2. 2 L T U R E. , 41 fite directions; part of it afeends into the plume, and pro¬ motes the growth and•expaflfion of that organ; and part of itjefeends into the radicle, for nourifhing and evol¬ ving the root and its various filaments. Thus the plume and radicle continue their progrefs in oppofite directions, till the plant arrives at maturity. It is here worth remarking, that every plant is really poffeffedof two roots, both of which are contained in the feed. The plume and radicle, when the feed is firft depofited in the earth, derive their nourhhment from the feminal root: but, afterwards, when the radicle begins to ftjoot out its filaments, and to ahforb fome moifture, not, however, in a fufficient quantity to fapply the exigencies of the plume, the two lobes, or main body of the feed, rife along with the plume, affume the appearance of two leaves, refembling the lobes of the lecd in fize and (hape, but having no refemblance to thofe of the plume, for which reafon they have got the name of dijjimilar leave?. Thefe dilKmilar leaves defend the young plume from the injuries of the weather, and at the fame time, by abforbing dew, air, <bc. aflift the tender radicle in nou- riftnng the plume, with which they have ftill a connec¬ tion by means of the feminal root above deferibed. But, when the radicle or fecond root has defeended deep e- nough into the earth, and has acquired a fufficient num¬ ber of filaments or branches for abforbing as much ali¬ ment as is proper for the growth of the plume; then the feminal, or dilfimilar leaves, their utility being entirely fuperfeded, begin to decay and fall off.

L Sect,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"4 2 A G 11 I C V S e c t. II. Of the Root. I n examining the root of plants, the firft thing that prefents itfelf is the Ikin, which is of various colours in different plants. Every root, after it has arrived at a certain age, has a double fkin. The firfl is coeval with the other parts, and exifls in the feed: but afterwards there is a ring fent off from the bark, and forms a fe- cond fit in; eg. in the root of the dandelion, towards the end of May, the original or outer fkin appears ftiri- veled, and is eafily feparated from the new one, which is frefher, and adheres more firmly to the bark. Peren¬ nial plants are fupplied in this manner with a new fkin every year; the outer one always falls off in the autumn or winter, and a new one is formed from the bark in the fucceedihg fpring. The fkin has numerous cells or veffels, and is a continuation of . the parenchymatous part of the radicle. However, it does not con fid folcljr of parenchyma; for the microfcope fhews that there are many tubular lignous veffels interfperfed through it. When the'fkin is removed, the true cortical fubflance Or bark appears, which is alfo a continuation of the pa¬ renchymatous part of the radicle, but greatly augment¬ ed. The bark is of very different fizes. In moll trees, it is exceeding thin in.proportion to the wood and pith. On the other band, 7 : n carrots, it is almoft one half of the femidiameter of the root; and, in dandelion, it is near¬ ly twice as thick as the woody part. i. The Bark is compofcd of two fubftances ; the pa¬ renchyma, or pulp, which is the principal part; and a few rhoody fibres. The parenchyma is exceedingly porous, and has a great referoblance to a fpunge; for it fhrivels confiderably when dried, and dilates to its former dimen- flons when infufed in water. Thefe pores or veffels are not pervious fo as to communicate with each other, but cenfift of difHr.ff little cells or bladders, fcarcely vifible without the afiiftance of the microfcope. In all roots, thefe cells are conflantly filled with a thin watery liquor. They itre generally of a fpherical figure; though in fome roots, as the buglofs and dandelion, they are oblong. In many roots, as the horfe-raddifli, peony, afparagus, potatoe, err. the parenchyma is of one uniform ftruffurc. But in o- fhers it is more diverfified, and puts on the fhape of rays running from the centre towards the circumference of the bark. Thefe rays fometimes run quite through the bark, as in lovage; and fometimes advance towards the middle of it, as in melilot and raeft of the leguminous and umbelliferous plants. Thefe rays generally ftand at an equal diflance from each other in the fame plant; but the diftance varies greatly in different plants. Neither are they o,f equalizes : In carrot they are exceedingly fmall, and fcarcely difcernible ; in melilot and cherval, they are thicker. They are likewife more numerous in fome. plants than in others. Sometimes they are of the fame thicknefs from one edge of the bark to the other; and fome grow wider as they approach towards the fkin. The veffels with which thefe rays are amply furnifhed, are fuppofed to be air-veffels, becaufe they are always found to be dry, and not fo tranfpareut as the veffels which e- vidcntly contain die fap. t T U R E.‘ In all roots, there are lignous veffels difperfed in dif¬ ferent proportions through the parenchyma of the bark. Thefe lignous veffels run longitudinally through the bark in the form of fmall threads, which are tubular, as is evident from the rifing of the fap in them when a root is cut tranfverfely. Thefe lignous fap-veffels do not run' in direff lines through the bark, but, at fmall distances, incline towards one another in fuch a manner, that they appear to the naked eye to be inofculated; but the mi¬ crofcope difeovers them to be only contiguous, and bra¬ ced together by the parenchyma, Thefe braces -or co- arffations are very various both in fize and number in different-roots; but in all plants they are mod mime-* rous towards the inner edge of the bark. Neither are thefe veffels Angle tubes, but, like the nerves in animals, are bundles of twenty or thirty fmall contiguous cylin¬ drical tubes, which uniformly run from the extremity of the root, without fending off any branches, or fuf- fering any change in their fize or fhape. In fome roots, as parfnip, efpecially in the ring next, the inner extremity of the bark, thefe veffels contain a kind of lymph, which is fweeter than the fap contained in the bladders of the parenchyma. From this circum- ftance they have got the name of lympb-dutts. Thefe lymph-duffs fometimes yield a mucilaginous, lymph, as in the comphrey; and fometimes a white milky glutinous lymph, as in the angelica, fonchus, burdock, fcorzonera, dandelion, <bc. The lymph-duffs are fup¬ pofed to be the veffels from which the gums and bal- fams are fecemed. The lymph of fennil, when expofed to the air, turns into a clear tranfparent balfam ; and that of the fcorzonera, dandelion, <&c. condenfes into a gum. The fituation of the veffels is various. In fome plants; they Hand in a ring or circle at the inner edge of the bark, as in afparagus ; in others, they appear in lines, Or rays, as in berage; in the parfnip, and feveral other plants, they are molt confpicuous toward the outer edge of the baric; and in the dandelion, they are difpofed in the form of concentric circles. 2. The Wood of roots is that part which appears after the bark is taken off, and is firmer and lefs porous than the bark or pith. It confifts of two diftinff fub¬ ftances, viz. the pulpy, or parenchymatous, and the lignous. The wood is connected to the bark by large portions of the bark inferted into it. Thefe infertions are moftly in' the form of rays,' tending to the centre of the pith,, which are eafily difeernibie by the eye in a tranf- verfe feffion of moft roots. Thefe infertions, like the bark, confift of many veffels, moftly of a round or, oval figure, x The lignous veffels are generally difpofed in collateral rows running longitudinally through the root. Some of thefe contain air, and others fap. The air-veffels are lo called, becaufe they contain no liquor. 7*hefe air-vef- fels are diftinguilhed by being whiter than the others. q. The Pith is the centrical part of the root. Some roots have no pith, as the ftramonium, nicotiana, others have little or none at the extremities of the roots, but have a confiderable quantity of it near the top. The pith, like every other part of a plant, is derived from"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"A G H I C U from the feed : But in fome it is more immediately deii- ved from the bark. For the infertions of the bark run¬ ning in betwixt the rays of the wood, meet in the centre, and confiitute the pith. It is owing to this circumftance, that among roots which have no pith in their lower parts, they are amply provided with it towards the top, as in columbine, lovage, &c. The bladders of the pith are of very different fizes, and generally of a circular figure. Their pofition is more uniform than in the bark. Their fides are not mere films, but a compofition of fmall fibres or threads ; which gives the pith, when viewed with a microfcope, the appearance of a piece of fine gauze, or net-work. We fiiall conclude the defeription of roots, with ob- fervingj that their whole fubftance is nothing but a con¬ geries of tubes and fibres, adapted by nature for the ab- forption.of nourifhment, and of courfe the extenfion and augmentation of their parts.

In deferibing the trunks of plants, it is neceffary to preiqife, that whatever is faid with regard to them, ap¬ plies equally to the branches, The trunk, like the root, confifts of three parts, viz . the bark, wood, and pith. Thefe parts, though fub- ftantially the fame in the trunk as in the root, are - in many.cafes very different in their texture and appearance. 1. The fkin of the bark is compofed of very minute bladders, incerfperfed with longitudinal woody fibres, as in the nettle, thillle, and moft herbs. The outfide of the fkin is vifibly porous in fome plants, particularly the cane„ The principal body of the bark is compofed of pulp or parenchyma, and innumerable veffels much larger than thole of the (kin. The texture of the pulpy part, tho’ the fame fubftance with the parenchyma in roots, yet fel- dom appears in the form of rays running towards the pi th ; aud when thefe rays do appear, they do not ex¬ tend above half way to the circumference. The veffels Qf the bark are very differently lituated, and defined for various purpofes in different. p lants. For example, in the bark of the Pine, the imnolf are lymph-duffs, and ex¬ ceedingly fmail ; the outmofl are gum or refini'croUs vefr L T U R E. 45 fels, deftined for the fecretion of turpentine; and are fo large, as to be diftinctly vifible to the naked eye. 2. The Wood lies betwixt the bark and pith, and confifk of two parts, viz. a parenchymatous, and lig- nous. In all trees, the parenchymatous part of the wood, though much diverfified as to fize and confidence, is uni¬ formly difpofed in diametrical rays, or infertions running betwixt fimilar rays of the lignous part. The true wood is nothing but a congeries of old dried lymph-duds. Between the bark and the wood a new ring of thefe duds is formed every year, which gradually Iooies its foftnefs as the cold feafon approaches, and, to¬ wards the middle of winter, is condenfed into a folid ring of wood. Thefe annual rings, which are diftindly vifible in mod trees when cut through, ferve as natural marks to diftinguifli their age, Plate V. fig. 1, 2. The rings of one year are fometimes larger, fometimes lefs, than thofe of another, probably owing to the favour- ablenefs or unfavourablencfs of the feafon. 3. The Pith, though of a different texture, is ex¬ actly of the fame fubftance with the parenchyma of the bark, and tjie infertions of the wood. The quantity of pith is various in different plants. Indead of being in- creafed every year like the wood, it is annually dirai- niflied, its veffels drying up, and affuming the appearance and (trudure of wood; in fo much that in old trees there is fearce fuch a thing as pith to be difeerned. A ring of fap-veffels are ufually placed at the outer, edge of the pith, next the wood. In the pine, fig, and walnut, they are very large. The parenchyma of the pith, is compofed of fmall cells or bladders, of the fame, kind with thofe of the bark, only of a larger fize. The general figure of thefe bladders is circular; though in fome plants, as the thidle, and boiage, they are angular. Though the pith is originally one conneded chain of bladders ; yet as the plant grows old, they fhrivel, and open in different diredic-ns. In the walnut, after a cer¬ tain age, it appears in the form of a regular tranfverfe hollow divifion. In fome plants, it is altogether want¬ ing ; in others, as the fonchus, nettle, &c. there is only a tranfverfe partition of it at every joint. Many other varieties might be mentioned; but thefe. muff be left to the cblervation of the reader. Plate V. Fig. 1. A tranfverfe fedion of , a branch of a(h, as it appears to the eye.\" Fig. 2.

Sect. IV. Of the Leaves. The leaves of plants confift of the famefubftance with that of the trunk. They are full of nerves, or woody portions, running in all directions, and branching out in¬ to innumerable fmall threads, interwoven with the Pa¬ renchyma like fine lace or gauze. The Ik in of the leaf, like that of an animal, is full of pores, which both ferve for perfpiration, and for the abforption of dews, air, fee. Thefe pores, or orifices, differ both in fhape and magnitude in different plants, which is the caufe of that variety of texture or grain pe¬ culiar to every plant. The pulpy or parenchymatous part, corififts of very minute fibres, wound up into fmall cells' or bladders. Thefe cells are of various fizes in the fame leaf. All leaves, of whatever figure, have a marginal fibre, by which all the reft are bounded. The particular fhape of this fibre determines the figure of the leaf. The veflels of leaves have the appearance of inofcula- .ting 5 but, when examined by the microfcope, they are found only to be interwoven, or laid along each othef. What is called air-veflels, or thofe which carry no fap, are vifible even to the naked eye in fome leaves. When a leaf is flowlv broke, they appear like fmall woolly fibres, connected to both ends of the broken piece. Plate VI. Fig. 1.

In deferibing the ftru&ure of fruits, a few exam¬ ples (hall be taken from fuch as are moft generally known. 1. A Pear, befides the fldn, which is a produftion of the fldn of the bark, confifts of a double parenchyma or pulp, fap, and air-veflels, calculary, and acetary. The outer parenchyma is the fame fubftance continued from the bark, only its bladders are larger and more fuc- culent. It is every where interfperfed with fmall globules or grains, and the bladders refpeft thefe grains as a kind of centres, every grain being the centre of a number of bladders. The fap and air-veflels in this pulp are ex¬ tremely fmall. Next the core is the inner pulp or parenchyma, which confifts of bladders of the fame kind with the outer, only larger and more oblong, correfponding to thofe of the pulp, from which it feems to be .derived. This inner pujp is much fourer than the other, and has none of the fmall grains interfperfed through it; and hence it has got the name of acetary. Between the ^cetary £\\nd outer pulp, the globules or grains begin to grow larger, and gradually unite into a hardftony body, efpecially towards thecorculum, or ftool of the fruit; and from this circumftance it has been cal¬ led the calculary. Thefe grains are not derived from any of the organi- cal parts of the tree, but feem rather to be a kind of concretions precipitated from the fap, fimilar to the pre¬ cipitations from wine, urine, and othei liquors. The core is a roundiih cavity in the centre of the pear, lined with a hard woody membrane, in .which the feed is incldfed. At the bottom of the core there is a fmall dudl or canal, which runs up to the top of the pear; this canal allows the air \\o get into\" the core, for the purpofe of drying and ripening the feeds.

The parenchyma of the rind is of a coarfe texture, being compofed of thick fibres, woven into large bladders. Thofe neareft the furface contain the eflential oil of the fruit, which burlls into a flame when the Ikin is fqueezed over a candle. From this outmoft parenchy¬ ma nine or ten infertions or lamellae are produced, which run between as many portions of the pulp, and unite in¬ to one body in the centre of the fruit, which correfponds to the pith in trunks or roots. At the bottom and top of the lemon, this pith evidently joins with the rind, without the intervention of any lamellae. This circum- ftance (hows, that the pith and bark are actually con- nedtedin the trunk and roots of plants, though it is dif¬ ficult to demonftrate the connexion, on account of the clofenefs of their texture, and the minutenefs of their fibres. Many veffels are difperfed through the whole of this parenchyma; but the largeft ones (land on the inner edge of the rind, and the outer edge of the pith, juft at the two extremities of each lamella. The fecond kind of parenchyma is placed between the rind and the pith, is divided into diftindt bodies by the lamellae ; and each of thefe bodies forms a large bag. Thefe bags contain a third parenchyma, which is a duller of fmaller bags, diftindt and unconnedted with each other, having a fmall (talk by which they are fixed to the large bag. Within each of thefe fmall bags are many hundreds of bladders, compofed of extremely mi¬ nute fibres. Thefe bladders contain the acid juice of the lemon. From this Ihort (ketch of the ftrudture and compoli- tion of vegetables, both the farmer and philofophermay draw very ufeful and important conclufions. Some of them will perhaps be taken notice of in the courfe of this treatife. Plate V. Fig. 3. A longitudinal fedtion of a le- A A A, The rind with the vef- fcls that contain the effential ■ j, oil.

Of the nature and motion of the Sap. The veffels in the roots of plants abfoTb moifture from the earth, and convey ft to the trunk, branches, leaves, ijc. This juice, when it firft. enters into the root, is crude; but as it afeends into the other parts of the plant, it undergoes feveral changes, by means of the different configurations of the veflels peculiar to each part. Thus the leaves, flowers, fruit, and feed, have all fomething peculiar in the ftrudture and arrangement of their veffds, v^iich produces confiderable changes in the nature of the fap. It is not known how thefe changes are produced: but how the ftomachs of animals make chyle from ani¬ mal and vegetable fubftances, or how urine, faliva, bile, <bc. is fecreted from the common mafs of blood, is as little known. The fap likewife moves in a lateral or ho¬ rizontal diredlion. Philofophers are greatly divided about what they call the circulation of the fap. Some contend, that it re¬ turns to the root betwixt the bark and wood. But Hales, who has made many accurate experiments on the fubjedt, has ftiown, that it does not circulate, but afeends and defeends in the fame veffels; that it afeends in hot wea¬ ther, and defeends in cold, like the fpirits in. a thermo¬ meter. Vegetables begin to abforb fap about the beginning of Spring, and foon after (hoot out their buds, leaves, and flowers. When plants are in a Hate of vegetation, efpecially in hot weather, there is a great deal of fuperfluous fap ab- forbed; but the fuperfluous parts are carried off by tran- fpiration. Every part of a plant tranfpires; but the greateft quantity paffes by the leaves. Some have afligned the tranfpiration of plants, as the caufe of the motion of the fap. It is undoubtedly one caufe of this motion; becaufe, if the tranfpiration be flopped, at a time when all the veffels are full, the mo¬ tion of the fap mull Hop of courfe. But then there is a previous and principal caufe, viz. that power in the vef- L T U Plate V. Fig. 3. Fig. 4."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"4 6 AGRICULTURE. fels, whatever it is, that firft puts the Tap in motion, be¬ fore any tranfpiration has commenced. Heat, moifture, and air, are the three chief circum- ftances that promote the afcent of the fap. Hence no¬ thing is more favourable to vegetation than warm weather accompanied with rain: on the other hand, cold dry weather is its greateft enemy. In a wet, cold feafon, every thing rots; and in hot dry weather every thing is parched. But the circumftances mod favourable to ve¬ getation are cloudy, hot weather, inclinable to thunder, fucceeded by plentiful rains.. Sect. VIII. Of the Food of Plants. It is thought to be an important queftion in agriculture, whether the feveral kinds of plants require the fame, or different nourilhment. Upon a fuperficial view of this queftion, it would appear very improbable, that the fame matter could nourilh fuch a variety of plants, differing fo effentially in fmell, tafte, figure, fee. Much, however, may depend upon the in¬ ternal ftrudture and arrangement of the veffels. One thing is certain, that if the veffels in any plant be un¬ commonly fmall, parts will be rejedted by that plant which would be abforbed by one whofe veffels are larger. Nay, changes may be made in the crude homogeneous nourilhment, by a fmall difference in the figure or adtion of the veffels. It is- given out as a fadt, by writers on this fubjedt, that one plant will ftarve another, by robbing it of its nourilhment. This does not feem toaffedl .either fide of the queftion; for it may ftarve its neighbour, either by extending its roots, and requiring a greater quantity of nourilhment than the other; or it may abforb the pecu¬ liar food which is neceffary for the growth of the other plant. In either cafe, the plant is deprived of a proper quantity of nourilhment. It is likewife propofed as a difficulty. Why a poifonous plant and its antidote will grow in the fame foil, and very near each other. This argument is of the fame nature With the former. It may be owing either to thefe plants imbibing different juices from the earth, or to peculiari¬ ties in the ftrudture and adtion of their vefl’els. Thefe, and many other ambiguous fads, have been advanced on both fides of this queftion, which we lhall not fpend time iii enumerating. . ■ The argument drawn from grafted plants, feems more dired and decilive. A ftalk of a lemon, grafted on a branch of an orange-tree, grew, ripened its fruit, and preferred the figure and all the other qualities belong¬ ing to a lemon. This plainly indicates, that the or¬ ganisation of the lemon had given a different modifica¬ tion to the juices of the orange, through the interven¬ tion of which it received its nourilhment. It is alfo certain, that the different parts of the fame plant have frequently various fmells, taftes, fee. although the nourilhment derived from the root mult be the fame. This is an evidence, that the different ftrudlire of parts in the lame plants is capable of producing very fenlible changes in the nature and quality of the fap. Repeated experiments Ihow, .that many plants of very oppofite qualities, and even trees, have been nourilhed and brought tQ maturity by the pureft water alone. It is obferved, op the other hand, that different plants require different foils.. This is certainly true : But what then ? Does not this difference in foil rather depend up¬ on the greater or'leffer quantity, than any peculiar qua¬ lity in the food ? Thyme grows bell in a dry foil; but it will grow equally well in earth carried from a marlh to die top of a mountain. The roots of plants are fitted to abforb every fluid that comes within their reach. They have been found by experiment to imbibe fluids that adtually poifon them. From this circumftance it may be fairly concluded, that they have not, like animals, the fagacity of chufing the food that is moft proper for nourilhing them, and reject¬ ing that which is either hoxiops or lels nourilhing. Mr Dickfon, author of an excellent .treatife on agri¬ culture, pubhlhed in 1765, has endeavoured to fix the particular ingredients that enter into the compofition of the food of vegetables. He contends, that neither earth, water, air, oil, nor fait-, can be called the food of plants; but he thinks that it confifts of a combination of all thefe fubftances. His arguments in fupport of this theory are chiefly drawn from the chemical analyfis, which lhows, •that all thefe fubftances may be extorted from vegetables by the force of fire; and from a confideration that a due admixture of thefe fubftances (or fitch things as con¬ tain them) is favourable, and even neceffary, to vegeta¬ tion. His laft argument is good : But whoever attempts to difeover the properties of plants, or the ingredients of their food, from a chemical analyfis, will probably never do much fervice to the fcience of agriculture. Fire and a retort is capable of torturing either animals or vege¬ tables into forms and qualities which never exifted either in thefe bodies, or in their food. We fliall conclude this fedtion with obferving, that the farmer, in nourilhing his plants, Ihould be directed entire¬ ly by experience. If he knows, that- putrid animal and vegetable fubftances, that lime, foot, marie, fee. when applied with judgment, affift the growth of his plants, and augment his crop, it is of little confequence whether he be acquainted with their chemical analyfis, or the particular mode of their operation. We do not mean that he Ihould continue obftinately in the old beat¬ en track, as it is called ; but rathep that he Ihould try whether he can by any means improve upon the old method, and that his pradiice Ihould be diredted accord¬ ing to the fuccefs of thefe trials. PART"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"AGRICULTURE. 47 PART II. . 0 / the various Operations upon the Soil, in order to prepare it for the Recep¬ tion and Nourifoment of Plants. Sect. I. Of Manures. 17 Very fubftance which promotes the growth of plants is denominated a manure. As to the operation of manures, fome maintain, that they give to the earth an additional quantity of the vege¬ table food; others, that they are of no other ufe than to divide the foil, and therefore that tillage may be fub- ftituted’in their place. This laft opinion was embraced by Mr Tull, and is the fundamental principle in his horfe-hoeing hulbandry. A minute divifion of the foil will do. a great deal; but the experience of all ages fhows that it will do much more by the addition of ma¬ nure. In Scotland, it is the univerfal pra&ice to dung lands, that are in conftact tillage, at leafl once’ in five years ; and it eonfifts with obfervation, that the ground is con- fiderably enriched the firft year, but that the crops gra¬ dually decline till the virtues of the dung are entirely ex- haufted. Some manures lofe their virtue by being long expofed to the air. If dung be kept after it is fufficiently rotted, the moft valuable part of it will evaporate. Others, as lime and marks, are of an oppofite nature: the longer they are expofed to the air, their utility to the land is improved, trom this circumftance it is probable, that marles and lime attraCt fomething from the air which ren¬ ders them more favourable to vegetation. There is a great variety of fubftances which, when laid upon land, a< 5 t as manures. But the moft ufual ma¬ nures in this country are dung, lime, marles, afhes, foot, fea-weed, fhells, &c. Of Dung. Dung is properly the excrement of animals ; but what commonly goes by that name, is a mixture of excre- • ments, putrefied vegetable and animal fubftances. If dunghills be kept after they are fufficiently rotted, the oily and more volatile, parts, which are the beft ingre¬ dients,- fly off. They ffiould likewife be placed in a dry fituation, and raifed high at the fides, to prevent thefe parts from being carried off by water ; for much water prevents the uniform putrefaction of dunghills of this mixed kind. To promote a proper putrefaction, the dung fhould not be laid in fmall heaps, but fpread thick upon the dung¬ hill ; for by this means the fermentation commences foon- er, the natural fap is preferved, and the dung is prevent¬ ed from being burnt, or fre-fanged, as it is termed by farmers. Dung, when burnt in this manner, is dry, white, and ufelefs as a manure. It is agreed, that dung¬ hills ought to be covered, to prevent the exhalation of vegetable food. But the difficulty is, how to execute it ; . -Some propofe a thin layer of earth for this purpofe; others, that a pit fhould be dug, built with flags at the fide, and covered with a roof. The former would an; fwer very well, were it not for the additions that are conflantly making to dunghills; and the latter is fo expenfive, that few people will chufe to make trial of it. When dung comes from the liable or byre, it is mixed with ftraw; which abforbs the moifture, and prevents it from exhaling till the ftraw itfelf putrefies. When in this fituation, if it be laid thick upon the top of the dunghill, there being but a fmall furface expofed to the air, the juices will be tolerably well preferved. As dung thus lofes its beft qualities by being expofed to the fun and weather, it ought to be plowed in as foon as poflible, after being laid upon land. If fufficiently putrefied, it fhould be plowed in with a fhallow furrow, as its juices are waffied down by the rain : It fhould like- wife be fpread very equally; for when large pieces lie fcattered up and down, they become a nidus to infeCts • and vermin. Of Lime. Lime being of an alkaline nature, attra&s acids ; Hence it is fuppofedto communicate to the foil a powei? of attracting the vegetable food from the air. Lime is a heavy fubftance, and penetrates deep into the- foil; it fomctimes even finks below the reach of the plow. By fermenting with acids, it breaks down and divides the foil into fmall particles, and makes it foft, mellow; and evidently in a ftate of fermentation. It likewife dif- folves oils, and all animal and vegetable fubftances, and converts them into vegetable food. This quality ren*. ders it peculiarly uleful in deftroyirg root-weeds. Thefe being the general properties of lime, it is flip- pofed to have a twofold operation upon land. When a large quantity is ufed, efpecially after being long expo- fed to the air, it promotes vegetation by giving a kind of ftimulus to the foil, and making it exert itfelf. This operation of lime is not merely hypothetical; for expe¬ rience fhcws, that land thoroughly limed may be reduced to a poorer condition by cropping, than if it had not been limed at all. It is even poflible to reduce limed land to a caput mortuum; and the more frequently and the better the land is plowed, it is the fooner reduced to this ftate. Lime alfo enriches land, by augmenting the vegetable\" aliment. When intended for this purpcfe, only a fmall quantity fhould be employed; as a fmall quantity of lime is fufiicienl to impregnate a large quantity of earth,’ and"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"yj.8 A G II I C U and to communicate to it as high a degree of an abforb- ing quality as it is capable of receiving. Thefe different operations of lime is confirmed by experience, and agreeable to the pi'aftice in thofe parts of Scotland where lime is mod ufed. When employed for the purpofe of improving barren lands, it is laid on in large quantities, to give a ftimutus to the foil, and make it exert all its vigour; and when applied to land already improved, it is ufed in fmall quantities, and repeated once every third or fourth, year, to prevent too great an exertion, and impoverishing the land, by exhauft- ing too much of the vegetable food. The lands in Scotland capable of the greateft im¬ provement by lime, are the out-field and muir lands. The out-field land is generally kept three years in tillage, and carries three crops of oats ; it is then allowed to reft fix years, and after that is brought again into tillage. This method of cultivating out-field land is found, by calculation, to be fufficiently able to bear the expence, and allow a reafonable profit to the farmer, befides the improvement the lands derive from the lime. Is England, lime is fometimes ufed as a top dreffing for wheat. The method is this: They fow their wheat without laying on any manure ; and in the beginning of February, for every acre of land, they take 20 bufhels of unflaked lime, and 4 bufhels of fand, or brick-rubbifh. Towards the end of the month, the lime is flaked and mixed with the fand : In the laft week of the month, this is fcattered byway of top-dreffing over the green wheat; and as rain generally fucceeds, it is foon wafhed down to the roots of the plant, and gives them a, vigour and ftrength of grov/jh that is aftonifhing to people who have never feen this method praftifed. But, if the weather inclines to be dry, the quantity of fand muft be doubled, to prevent the plants from being burnt by the eorrofive quality of the lime. Of Maries. The general characters by which marie is bed diftin- guifhed, are thefe : It attracts and ferments with acids, and does not bake in the fire like potter’s earth, which diftinguifhes it fufficiently from clay; upon being expo- fed for fome time to the air and weather, it diflolves like quick-lime, and falls intp a fine powder; when dry, it is friable and unftuous like lead-ore; when wet, it is feft and flippery to the touch; whereas virgin-earth is rough and gritty. There are a great variety of marles; but they are generally reduced to three kinds: The clay, the ftone, and the ffiell marie. The clay and ftone marles are nearly of the fame na¬ ture ; but the fhell-marle differs from both. Of Clay and Stone Maries. Though, plants will not grow in thefe marles, when pure ; yet, when mixed with foil, they become an excel¬ lent manure. Stone and clay marles are poffeffed of much the fame qualities with lime, and confequently aft nearly in the L T U II E. fame manner upon the foil. They communicate to the foil a power of attracting the vegetable food from the air, diffolve the vegetable food, and prepare it for en¬ tering the roots of plants. They likewife attradt oils fo ftrongly, that they are frequently ufed for extracting greafy fpots out of cloth; they are therefore fuppofed to attradt oil from the air and earth, which is the chief in¬ gredient in the nouriffiment of plants. Both the clay and ftone marles are long of diffolving. Large pieces of the ftone-marle are fometimes found un- difl'olved many years after'it has been laid on the land This renders it neceffary to lay on a large quantity 0. them, left their effedts ffiould not at firft appear. As marie may \"be ufed with fafety in greater quanti¬ ty than lime, it muft communicate to the foil a ftronger power of attracting the vegetable food, and confequently it ought always to be preferred. Marie is likewife pre¬ ferable to lime in this refpedt, that it is longer of diffol¬ ving; and therefore the land will continue to carry bet¬ ter crops for feveral years longer after it has been marledl However, if the foil be foft and fpungy, the marie, like lime, will fink below the reach of the plough, and pre¬ vent thofe advantages which might naturally be expefted from it. Though marie is preferable to lime as a manure j yet it muft be confidered, that their operation upon the earth is the fame; confequently, when marlfed land has been exhaufted with crops, it cannot receive much benefit from an immediate application of marie a fecond time ; for the fame reafon, it can receive as little advantage from lime: Dung therefore, as it contains a great propor¬ tion of the vegetable food, which lime and marles dimi- nifh, is the moft proper manure for marled or limed lands exhaufted with ciops. What was faid with regard to the application of lime, in fmaller or larger quantities, to barren lands and lands in good o*!er', may be faid with equal propriety with regard to ftone and clay marles. Of Shell-marie. This marie is of a different nature from the ftone and clay marles. It does not diffolve with water, but abforbs and fwells with it like a fpunge: It attradb acids more forcibly. But the principal difference betwixt the Ihell-marle and the other marles confifts in this, that the ihell-marle contains a great quantity of oil. .This marie is therefore fuppofed to promote vegeta¬ tion, by increafing the food of plants, by communicating to the foil a power of attracting this food from the air, by dividing the foil into fmall particles, and by preparing the vegetable food for being abforbed by their roots. As ihell-marle does not exhauft land like lime and the other marles, it may be repeated as often as the huf- bandman pleafes. Its effefts are likewife more fudden. Of Jfies. The aihes of vegetables contain a large quantity of alkaline fait: Hence they attraft acids more ftrongly than any other fubftances. The"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"49 AGRICULTURE. The operation of afhes upon the foil muft therefore be of the fame nature with that of lime, only it is more vio¬ lent and hidden, and confequently it is fooner over. This is confirmed by experience. After land has been manured with afhes, .the firft crop is commonly very lux¬ uriant ; but a fecqnd crop almoft entirety exhaufts the land. Hence afhes fhould be laid on in fmall .quantities, and fhould not be applied to land exhaufted by lime or marie; neither fhould they be repeated, or followed by thefe manures. Burnt turf is generally recommended as a manure. Turfs are chiefly compofed of vegetables ; their afhes, therefore, muft be of the fame nature with thofe of wood or any other vegetable fubftance. It is found by experi¬ ence, that the burning of turfs turns out to advantage in proportion to the number of roots they contain; and therefore land, with a tough fward of graft, is m ft proper to be improved in this manner. In burning turf, the heaps muft be covered in fuch a manner as to prevent the flame from breaking out; o- therwife the mod ufeful part of the afhes will fly off. To prevent burnt land from being exhaufted, one or two crops only fhould be. taken, and then the land ought to be laid out in graft. Its fertility will be ready increafed, if a little dung be added after the rft crop. Of Soot. Soot contains oil, fait, and earth. It promotes ve¬ getation in the fame manner as dung or fliell-marle. Soot is generally applied in the Spring as a top-dreffing to winter corn or graft. The effects of foot ufed in this way are fo fudden, that they evidently appear after the firfl rain. But its virtues are commonly exhaufted by a Tingle crop. However, when the effects of foot are o- ver, the foil is not exhaufted, as by afhes or lime; it may therefore be repeated as often as the farmer thinks pro¬ per ; or it may be followed with advantage by afhes, lime, or marie. Of Sea-weed. All plants that grow upon rocks, within reach of the fea, are good manures. Thefe are frequently loofened and driven a-fhore by the tide. They are of a foft pul¬ py nature, and Toon putrefy. Sea-weeds promote vegetation in the fame manner as dung or foot; but their effects are not fo lafting as dung. However, they are preferable to dung in this refped, that they do not produce fo many weeds. They may be applied to land in any fituation, and are peculiarly proper for land that is exhaufted by lime or afhes. When their effects ceafe, the land is not injured, and any kind of manure may bp ufed after them. The oftener fea-weeds are applied, the land becomes the richer. This is confirmed by experience. The lands near the fhores, where the weeds have been long ufed as manures, are among the richeft in Scotland, and have been kept almoft conftantly in tillage. Vol. I. No. 3. 3 Of Shells. Beds of fhells are to be met with in many places, but particularly near the fea-fhore. Thefe fhells ferment with acids, and, like other ani- mal-fubftances, contain oil, fait, and earth. Their ope¬ ration is fuppofed to be of the fame kind with that of fhell-marle: But, as they take a long time to diffolve, their effetts muft be flower and weaker: They ought therefore to be applied in large quantities, otherwife their operation will be hardly perceptible. Shells exhauft the land, but not near fo much as lime or afhes; it is therefore improper to ufe them immedi¬ ately after thefe manures. When fhells are found below the furface of the ground, as they generally are, they fhould be expofed to the air for fome time before they are ploughed in: This not only afEfts their fermentation, but promotes their pu¬ trefaction. Of Vegetables in an entire State t or foven for Manure. It is a practice in many places, particularly in Eng¬ land, to fow turnip, peafe, buck-wheat, 6 'c. and to plough them down for manur ing the land. This practice 4 s thought by fome people to be attend¬ ed with no advantage; becaufe the plants, when plough¬ ed down, can convey no more food to the foil than they take from It. But it ought to be confidered, that fome of the plants employed in this manner pulh their roots below the reach of the plough, and fuck up the food to the furface; the feed that is fown likewise contains a great proportion of vegetable food; befides what the plants, when growing, may derive from the air, <tyc. From thefe circumftances it may be inferred, that they aftual- ly return more nourifhment to the foil than they extract from it. The covering of the furface is alfo an advan¬ tage : Every farmer knows, that when the foil has been covered for a confiderable time by a ftrong crop of peafe, or any other corn laid down, the foil, though natural¬ ly hard and ftiff, becomes foft, mellow, and free. Of Water. Rain-water contains a confiderable quantity of ve¬ getable food. When it falls upon land that has a defeent, by running off, it muft carry along with it fome of the fineft particles of the foil and the vegetable food contain¬ ed in them. If this water, then, is let in upon a field, and allowed to fettle, the land will receive from it not only the vegetable food contained in the water itfelf, but likewife what is contained in the particles of earth carried off from the higher grounds. This method of manuring can only be ufed in fields which lie on the fides of rivers, or fuch as can be eafily drained. In praCtifing it, the water muft not be allowed to run off violently, otherwife it does more hurt than good. Land in graft is mod proper for this kind of N manuring."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"50 AGRICULTURE. manuring. The firmnefs of the furface prevents any of • the foil from being Carried off when the water is drain¬ ing, and the grafs intangles the mud, fisc. and hinders them from going along with the Water. This operation fhould be performed in the fpring. Iri that feafon grafs-lands differ lead from being -over- . flowed. Sect. Ill, Of Soils with respect to Manures. . Soils are very different in their natures, and compo¬ sed of Very different ingredients: Some foils contain more, and others lefs, of the food neceffay for the nou¬ rishment of plants. It is neceffary to inquire into thefe differences, in order to difcover what manures are moil proper for each kind. The foils mod common in Scotland are the black loamy, the clay, the fandy, and the moffy. Of thefe there are many varieties, according to the different pro¬ portions of that particular kind of earth from which tljey are denominated. Some foils are even fo blended, that it is difficult to determine what kind of earth molt pre¬ vails in them. Of the black Loamy Soil. Pure loam feems to be nothing elfe but the earth of putrefied vegetables, accumulated by the fucceffive de¬ cay of natural or artificial crops. In cultivated lands, ilung and other manure greatly increafe the quantity of the loam. The principal qualities of loam are thefe : When al¬ lowed to red, it acquires a degree of cohefion, but ne¬ ver becomes fo hard and tough as clay: When turned up and expofed to the air, it becomes free and open, and eafily crumbles down : When dry, it readily admits water, and fwells and retains it like fhell-marle; how¬ ever, it only retains a proper quantity, and allows the red to run off. It alfo contains oil, fermentswith acids, and is of an abforbent nature. There is no foil altogether pure; but that foil which has loam in its compofition .poddies in fome degree all the qualities of loam; and thefe qualities are unquedion- ably the mod proper for nourifhing plants. Its oils and fairs afford food to the plants; the abfor¬ bent quality of which it is pofieffed, alfo. at tracts vegetable food from the air; its friablenefs, aad fermenting w'ith ' acids, give an eafy paflage to. the roots to acquire this I’ood. Experience, the only fare guide in ffibjedts of this, kind, fhows that a loamy foil is mod fruitful. Some foils, when well limed or dunged, may bear as great crops as the loamy foil; but then they require a fupply much fooner. The loamy foil has likewife another ad¬ vantage over every other : It does not differ fo much from drought or rain, as clay and fandy foils. . All land called in-field land has a certain quantity of loam in, its compofition, probably owing to the dung which is laid from time to time upon it. This is the on¬ ly didindtion betwixt out-field and in-field land. ■ The foil which contains a great proportion of loam, re¬ quires very little manure. It may be kept coridantly in good heart by proper tillage and good management. The common loamy foil -requires manure, and no kind of manurb is ; improper for it; dung, however, is unquedionably the bed. Lime, unlefs managed with care, is in danger of hurting a loamy foil by exhaud- . ing it. Of the Clay-Soil. The riched kind of clay-foil is that which confids of clay and loam. To difcover the nature of this foil, it is neceffary to know the qualities of clay. Clay is a very folid body, and its parts adhere firmly together: It does not eafily admit water, but is capable of containing a great quantify, fwells but little, and does not eafily part with it. When dry, clay- is very hard, and becomes the harder the more Suddenly it is dried. In the procefs of drying, it contracts unequally, and breaks out into rents or fiflures where the cohefion is weaked. It ferments with acids, but has no oil in its compofition. From 9. dight view of thefe qualities it appears, that a clay-foil is not fo well adapted for the nourilhment of plants as the loamy: it is more fubjeft to receive in¬ juries from drought or rain. In a rainy feafon, as it is averfe to part with the water after it once admits it, the roots of plants will be much weakened or dedroyed by being long foaked in the water. On the other hand, in a very c^ry feafon, it becomes fo hard, that the roots cannot penetrate deep enough to fearch for food. Thefe obfervations are fully confirmed by experience. For it is well known to the hulbandman, that the pro¬ duce of clay-foils are extremely uncertain, as they ar6 liable .to be dedroyed by dry or wet feafons. Thefe foils labour under another difadvantage; as they repel water, efpecially when it falls in fmall quantities, they reap no benefit from dews or flight Ihowcrs. The clay-fcil is faid to contain vegetable food, but does not allow it to be eafily difl’clved: and hence lime, marles, or allies, are the mod proper manures for it, as they divide it into fmall particles. . Thefe manures likewife commu¬ nicate to it a greater power of abforption ; and therefore they will enable it both to receive andtranfmit water more readily, and of courfe make it lefs fubjedt to be injuied by the weather. Clay-foils, when mixed with loam, are very rich; but, when mixed with fand or till, they are very poor. Poor clay-foils require fuch manures as contain the greated quantity of vegetable food; there¬ fore dung, fhell-marle, fea-weed, fic. are the bed ma¬ nures for them. Of the Sandy Soil. There are two kinds of fand that enter into the com¬ pofition of foils; the one confids of fmall particles of flint, the other 01 broken fliells."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"A G R I C U The fandy-fsil which is compofed of flinty particles, eafily receives and tranfmits water; and confequently is hot capable of containing a fufficient quantity for promo¬ ting the growth of plants: Its particles do not adhere, and is therefore unable to fupport plants that have few roots and grow high. Befides, it is fcfbeptible of great¬ er heat from the fun than any othgr pail, which is apt to parcA the plants. As this foil contains no oil, it mull: be very defective in vegetable food; and, as it has no abforbent quality, it will receive but a fmall fupply from the air. • From the qualities of this foil, the manures molt pro¬ per for it are eafily difeovered. Clay will make it firmer, and enable it to retain the water; but clay contains lit¬ tle vegetable food. Dung will fupply it with the food of plants ; but will not render it firm, or make it retain water, Mofs will help it to retain water, and fupply it with vegetable food; but will not make it firmer. A mixture'of clay and dung, or of clay and mofs,. feems therefore to be the mod proper manure for this foil. The qualities of a fandy fo;l compofed of broken fhclls, are' nearly the fame with thofe of the former kind. The only differences are, that it ferments with acids, contains oil, and is capable of belng'diffolved. Hence this foil mull have h larger qnantity of vegetable food, and mult alfo receive a greater fupply from the air. mixture of dung and clay, or of mofs and clay, is likewife the moll proper manure for this foil: But if any fubflance could be found that could reduce the par¬ ticles of the fliells to a flate of putrefaction, it would be preferable to any thing hitherto known for improving a foil of this kind. Of the Moffy Soil. Moss principally conlilts either of Jive or at leafl uncorrupted vegetables. It mull therefore have fait and oil in its composition. It does not eafily putrefy, fold prevents other bodies from putrefying. It fwells with water like a fp.unge, and does not eafily part with it. To render the moffy foil fit for nourifhing plants, the vegetables in it mull be reduced to a flate of putrefaction. This will not only fupply it with vegetable food, but Jikewife render it firmer, and make it more eafijy part with water. Hence thofe manures which ferment mofl violently with acids, as the clay and flone marles, feem to be the melt proper for this foil. Thefe marles will not only raife a violent fermentation, but fill up the .pores, and make the foil more folid. When the mofs is deep, or has not a folid bottom, lime is improper, be- caufe it will foon penetrate beyond the reach of the plough ; but, if it has a fol.d bottom, lime will anfwer very well. It is improper to fow upon this foil till the fermen¬ tation raifed by the manure is completely finifhed; for the violence of the fermentation fometimes throws the feeds, a (id even the roots, out of the ground. Frequent ploughings make the moffy foil run much into weeds ; and from this circumltance, the practice of ploughing it but fddom is found to anfwer better. L T U R E. .51 Sect. IV. Of the Impediments to Ve¬ getation. 1. Weeds, as an Impediment to Vegetation. Every vegetable that grows in afield, different from the particular plant that is intended to be cultivated, may be called a need. Weeds injure the plants we defire to cultivate, by rob¬ bing them of part of their nourifhment, and by preventing the fpreading of their roots. Some weeds, as quicken¬ ing grafs, extend and interweave their roots in fuch a manner that- it is difficult to pulverife the foil by tillage. It is therefore of great importance to the farmer to know how weeds may be dellroyed. Weeds are generally di¬ vided into three claffes, viz. thofe that are propagated by the feed; thpfe that are propagated by the roots; and fhrubs. Of dejlroying Weeds that are propagated ly Seed. Weeds are very different in their natures. Some, if prevented from vegetating,- die in a lew years by lying moill in the earth ; others will lie many years in this fituation, without lofing the power of vegetating. The firft kind may be dellroyed, by turning the land infelled w'ith them into grafs for five or fix years; and both kinds may be rooted out by allowing them to vege¬ tate, and then tearing up the young plants before they begin to flower. In order to promote the vegetation of the weeds that are intended to be dellroyed, the land ought to be well ploughed; if a little dung, or other manure, be applied, the crop of weeds will be • increafed, and their deduc¬ tion will be rendered more general. Several weeds, as the thillle, dandelion, rag-weed, &c. are furnilhed with a kind of down, by which they float in the air, and are carried to great dillances by the wind. Farmers Ihould be as careful to root out all weeds of this kind from the roots of hedges, banks of fences, ire. as from their arable land; for although they may have the appearance of being inoffenfive in that fituation, they are tranfported from thence in great quantities by the wind into the adjacent fields. There is another great fource of weeds, but too little attended to by farmers. It is a general practice, to throw the feeds that are feparated from the corn in win¬ nowing upon the dung-hill; and by this means they are carried out with the dung, and again fown upon the land. Of dejlroying Weeds that are propagated by the Root. There are many different kinds of weeds propagated by the roots. Some of them infelt land that is in til¬ lage, and others land that is in grafs. Thofe that infell land in tillage may be dellroyed by turning it into grafs for fwne years. This is the moll effectual"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"52 A G R I C U effectual means of rooting out quicken-grafs, and other root-weeds of the fame nature,. If the foil be hard and ftiff, it is the fooner cleared of weeds by being laid Out in grafs; But a foft fpungy foil requires to be in grafs fix or feven years before the weeds are deftroyed. Thofe weeds that infeft lands in grafs, are eafieft de¬ ftroyed by turning the land into tillage. Neither is it necelfary to continue it long in this fituation ; for the weeds commonly difappear after the firft ploughing. But as, in fome cafes, it may he inconvenient to turn a field infefted with weeds from tillage into grafs, or from grafs into tillage, it is neceffary to confider whether the fame may not be accompliffied, without altering the fituation of the land. When land is in tillage, the weeds may be deftroyed by frequently ftirring and turning it over in dry weather; for when the weeds are difplaced, die drought prevents them from taking root again. Land cannot be made too fine, nor the furface too fmooth, when it is intended to be freed of feed-weeds ; becaufe by that the greateft number are brought to ve¬ getate : But, when intended to be freed of root-weeds, the rougher the furface, the weeds are the more eafily deftroyed; becaufe the drought has the eafier accefs to their roots. If grafs-lands be infefted with weeds, and it is incon¬ venient to turn them into tillage, the only way of de- ftroying the weeds, is to an them frequently, or pull them up by the roots. Some lands, after being in grafs a few years, are lia¬ ble to be over-run with fog r In this .cafe, rolling, by making the furface firmer, will be of great ufe in de- ftroying the fog. This weed, as well as others, may be deftroyed by depriving it of air. This may be done by covering the furface with a crop of peafe, potatoes, or other plants that lie thick on the furface. A deep trenching will, in fome cafes, anfwer the fame intention. Of deflroying Shrubs, as Furze , Broom, Bram¬ ble, See. i. FURZE. The common method of deftroying furze (or whins) is by grubbing them out with a hoe. But it is impoffible to root them out fo compleatly as to prevent their fpringing again, efpecially if the 'land be continued in grafs. The moft effectual method, therefore, is to bring the land into tillage immediately after the whins have been grubbed up. As long as it continues in tillage, no whins will appear; but if turned into grafs, they grow as numerous as ever. To prevent this return of whins, the young plants that appear after the land is turned into grafs, ftiould be pul¬ led up by the roots. Unlefs they are very thick, this is neither troublefome nor expenfive : When the ground is moift, it may be performed by young boys. If any of them rife afterwards, which is commonly the cafe, the fame operation muft be repeated every feafon till the land is compleatly cleared of them. There is another fcheme of management which in a L T U R E. few years will effectually deftroy whins. It is certain that the feeds of whins will not vegetate unlefs they are allowed to lie in the earth undifturbed for a confiderable time. As long as land is left in tillage, although there be many whin-feeds in it, yet they never vegetate. Whin-plaints do not even appear till two years after the land has been allowed to reft, or has been turned into grafs. Now, if a fcheme of management be followed, by which the land is turned from tillage into grafs, and from grafs into tillage, the whins by degrees will be wholly eradicated. , It was obferved above, that before lands infefted with whins can be improved, the whins muft be grubbed up. This operation is both tedious and expenfive. The following method of rooting them out by the plough is more expeditious, lefs expenfive, and has been tried with fuccels. This work muft be performed by a ftrong Scotch plough, with a well redd beam. As it requires great force to tear up the roots, fix horfes ftiould be yoked in pairs. Two drivers are likewife neceffary, to prevent the horfes from ftepping afide. As the whins in rifing are apt to entangle or choke the beam, another man is alfo neceffary to pufti them off with a pitch-fork. A plough yoked and attended in this manner, will plow down whins near three feet high, with roots above four feet long, and an inch in diameter. This operation Ihould be performed in the winter, when the land is well foaked with rain. After the land has been -ploughed in this manner, it Ihould be allowed to lie till fummer, when the whins tom up by the plough may be burned, the land harrow¬ ed, and the roots gathered. Afterwards the land may be dreffed according to the judgment of the farmer; only the fecond ploughing Ihould be acrofs, that any roots which have been left may be tom up. But when the whins are fo ftrong that it is impoffrble to plough them down, they may be burned ; and if the land be allowed to lie a few years after, it may be ploughed without: much difficulty. 2. BROOM. Broom is not fo bulhy, and does not cover the fur¬ face fo much as whins; and therefore land infefted with it is more eafily cleared. Though the methods re¬ commended for deftroying whins will moft effectually deftroy broom, a more fimple and lefs expenfive one will •fufficiently anfwer the purpofe. If broom, efpecially when it is old, be cut fo low as to take away all the leaves, it will never fpring again, A kind of feythe has lately been invented, by which broom may be cut in this manner with great expedition. If this method be obferved, it is unneceffary to bring land from grafs into tillage in order to clear-it of broom. * 3, BRAMBLE. This plant is of a very different nature from whin or broom. The root finks deep into the earth, and fpreads very wide. Though cut in the winter, it rifes and comes to fuch perfection as to carry fruit in the fummer. It"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"A G R I C E It is therefore a difficult matter to clear land of bram¬ ble, efpecially when it is ftony; for the bramble pufties and interweaves its roots among the ftones, which renders it neceflary to dig out the ftones before it can be fuffi- ciently rooted up by ploughing or tearing. How¬ ever, digging out the ftones, and ploughing the land in fucli a manner as is moft proper for cutting and tearing up the roots of bramble, may be the more lafely. recom¬ mended, as they at the fame time ferve many other ■ ufeful purpofes. 2. Of Water, as an Impediment to Vege¬ tation. Some plants require a greater, and fome a lefler pro¬ portion of water in their food. The plants ufually cul¬ tivated in our fields are of the latter kind, and are eafi- ly injured by an over-proportion of water. Hence, wa¬ ter may be confidcred as an impedement to vegetation; and it becomes neceflary to confider the moft proper me¬ thods of conveying it off the land. Of draining Land. Some lands are wet from their fituation, being expo- fed to overflowings from higher grounds, and having no proper defcent to allow the water to run off. The bottom of fome land is of fuch a nature as to force out, in fprings, the water that runs below the fur- face. Springs fometimes bteak out, becaufe the chan¬ nels, in which they run, reach the furface; and fome¬ times becaufe they are interrupted.in th'eir courfe, which makes them force their way above ground. The wetnefs of land is fometimes occationed by vio¬ lent and frequent rains; and.lometimes all thefe caufes may concur in rendering land wet.* Land that is wet from its fituation may be drained in this manner : Although the wet land be lb low, as to render it difficult to carry off the-water; yet the water may be intercepted by a-drain, before it reaches the low ground. Land, wet by fprings, lies generally in a Hoping dr- reftion, which makes it the more eafy to drain. When the water runs near the furface,\" before it breaks out, it may be intercepted by a drain'drawn acrofs the decli¬ vity, a little above the place where it firft makes its ap¬ pearance. But, if the channel lies deep, the diainftiould be drawn dire&ly acrofs where it fprings up. But, when the wetnefs of the land is owing to the climate, or a rainy feafon, the welter cannot be inter¬ rupted by drains • however, obftru6fions may be remo- .ved, fo as to allow the water to run off as quickly as poilible. To drain land in this fituation, it is neceffary to lay it up in ridges properly placed, and to cut fmali drains acrofs thefe ridges, communicating with each o- ther, and with the furrows. By this method all the furrow's betwixt the ridges become drains; the water, as it falls upon the ridges, immediately makes its way to the furrows; and, if it meets with an interruption in any of them, it is conveyed by the drains acrofs the Vol. I. No.' 3. * j L T U R E. 53 ridges into fome other furrow, along which it Is carried off the field. There are two kinds of drains, viz. open drains, and hollow drains. Hollow drains differ from open ones, in being filled with loofe ftones, covered with turff, brufti* wood, or ftraw, and a layer of earth thick enough to al¬ low a plough to go'eafily through above. Thefe hollow drains are attended with two advantages; no land is Jolt by them, and they are no impediment in ploughing. Open drains, however, are in moft cafes preferable to hollow ones: They alone are capable of .intercepting o- verflowings from higher grounds, and for carrying off water that falls in rain. The water in thefe cafes being always on the furface, will run freely over hollow drains, efpecially when fituated on a declivity. But hollow drains may be ufed with advantage in land wet by fprings ; be¬ caufe nothing more is required than to continue the chan¬ nels of the water below ground, and not allow it to break out, till it arrives at a place where it can do no harm. It will not be improper here to mention, that fome foils retain water much longer than others, and confe- quently are more liable to be damaged by water. Soils that have a large proportion of clay, or of mofs, are of this kind. As thefe foils naturally retain water like a Jpunge, carting drains, and laying the land up in ridges, will not convey it away. To drain fuch lands, their na¬ ture, and power of retaining water, muft be changed by culture. The clay-foil can only be drained by frequent ftirring, and the application of fuch manures as raife a fermentation. Thefe operations open the pores of the foil, and thereby afford a free pafl'age to tjie water. The mofly foil, on the other hand, is too open and porous, but is poffefled of an abforbing quality, by which it retains the water. To drain this foil, it is neceflarv to condenfe it, and, if pofiible, to deftroy its quality of retaining water. Frequent ftirrings, and fetch manures as raife a fermentation, and tend to putrefy the mofs, are faid to render it firm and folid, and thereby both pre¬ vent it from receiving fo large a quantity of-water, and: deftroy the quality of retaining it. Of draining Marifkes. The foil of marifhes, being compofed of diflblved ve¬ getables, duft blown in by the winds, and earth wafhed down from the high grounds with which they are gene¬ rally furrounded, is light and fpungy, but very rich and valuable when drained. In draining a marifti, all the ftagnating water fhould be firft carried off by a large open drain, with a fufficiertt fall, and as deep as the bottom of the marifti. When the ftagnating water is conveyed away, the earth by de¬ grees will fubfide, and become folk! ; and fome land will thus be gained on each fide : The bottom, likewife foon becomes firm enough to allow the drain to be gra¬ dually carried forward through the middle of the mariih,’ If the fprings, which fnpply the water, rife near the middle of the marifti, tiffs principal drain, with a few blanches on each fide, where the firings are largeft or O moft"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"54 A G R I C U molt numerous, will, be fufficient. But, if the fprings be irregularly difperfed through the whole marilh, as is frequently the cafe, fide-drains parallel to the principal one will be neceflary to intercept the water that comes from the higher grounds and fepplies the fprings. Crofs drains, communicating with the parallel and principal drains, are likewife neceffary ; and (hould all be kept o- pen till the foil hath fully fubfided, and become firm; then the fide-drkins and crofs-drains may be convert¬ ed into hollow-drains, in the manner above defcribed. But the principal drain, efpecially if the marilh be ex- tenfive, Ihould always remain open. S e c t. V. Of Tillage. Tillage is the operation of breaking the foil into fmall particles, by ftirring and turning it over, laying it up in ridges, isc. In this part of agriculture, it is ne- cefiary to be acquainted with the different foils proper for nourilhing plants; the inllruments belt adapted for ftirring and turning them over; and the conftrudtion and manner of ufing thefe inllruments. Soils, with refpedt to tillage, may be divided into ftiff and light, wet and dry, deep and (hallow. This divifion is the more proper on this account, that the me¬ thod of performing the operation of tillage has always a reference to one or more of thefe qualities of foil, and to no other. The inllruments employed in tillage are various; as the plough, the harrow, the roller, &c. which are a- gain greatly diverfified by differences arifing from their conftrudion and particular ufes. i. Of the Scots Plough. In Scotland, this plough is Hill the moll common and the moll generally underllood. If properly made, it is the bell plough for anfwering all purpofes, when only one is ufed; though others are, perhaps, more pro¬ per for fome particular purpofes. The parts of which this plough is compofed are, the head, the beam, the (heath, the wrell, the mold-board, the two handles, thp two rungs, the fock, and the coulter; the two lad are made of iron, and all the red of wood. The Head, Plate VIII. fig. i. is defigned for open¬ ing the ground below. The length of the head from A to B is about twenty inches, and the breadth from A to D about five inches; C is the point upon which the fock is driven, and the length from B to C is about fix inches ; a is the mortoife into which the larger handle is fixed ; and b is the mortoife into Which the (heath is fixed. The head is that part of the plough which goes in the ground; therefore the (horter and narrower it is, the friction will be the left, and the plough more eafily drawn; but the longer the head is, the plough goes more deadily, and is not fo eafiiy put out of its direc¬ tion by any obdruftions that occur. Twenty inches is confidered as a mean length; and five inches as the mod convenient breadth. The Skeath, fig. 2. E, is driven into the mortoife. L T U R E. fig. i. b, and thus fixed to the head A B. It is not perpendicular to the head, but placed obliquely, fo as to make the angle formed by the lines A B and E B about 60 degrees. The (heath is about 13 inches long, befides what is driven into the mortoife b ; about three inches broad, and one inch thick. The (heath is fixed to the mold-board, as in fig. 11. E, in the fame manner as the wred is fixed to the head in fig- 7 - The Mold-board is defigned to turn over the earth of the furrow made by the plough ; and it is obvious, that, according to the pofition of the (heath, the mold- board will turn over the earth of the furrow more or lefs fuddeply. Befides, when it forms a lefs angle with the head than 60 degrees, the plough is in great danger of being choked , as the farmers term it. The Larger Handle, fig. 3. F A, is fixed to the head, by driving it into the mortoife a, fig. 1. It is placed in the fame plane with the head; and its length from A F is about five feet four inches, and its diameter at the place where it is fixed to the beam is about two inches and a half, and tapers a little to the top F. About ten inches from A, there is a curve in the handle, which, when F is raifed to its proper height, makes the lower part of it nearly parallel to the (heath E B. This curve is defigned to llrengthen the handle. The proper pofi¬ tion of the handle is, when the top F is about three feet two inches higher than the bottom of the head A B. The longer the handles, the plough is the more eafily managed, becaufe the levers are more diffant from the centre of motion. The higher the top of the handles, the plough is more eafily raifed out of the ground, pro¬ vided they be no higher than the lower part of a man’s bread. The Beam, fig. 4. is fixed to the larger handle and the (heath, all of which are placed in the fame plane with the head. The length of it, from H to I, is a- bout fix feet; its diameter is about four inches. When the plough is in the ground, the beam (houldbe judhigh enough not to be incommoded by any thing on the fur- face. The pofition of the beam depends on the number of cattle in the plough. When two horfes are yoked, the beam (hould be placed in fuch. a manner as to make the perpendicular didance betwixt the bolt-hole of the beam and the plane of the head about 2 x inches; when four horfes are yoked, two a-bread, this didance (hould only be about 18 inches. The Sock, fig. 5. B P, is fixed to the end of the head, and is about two feet long. In fitting the fock to the head, the point ought to be turned a little to the land or left fide ; becaufe othery/ife, it is apt to come out of the land altogether. When turned to the left, it like¬ wife takes off more land; when turned upwards, the plough goes (hallow; and when downwards, it goes deeper. The Coulter, fig. 6. is fixed to the beam, and is about two feet ten inches long, two inches and a half broad, (harp at the point and before, and thick on the back, like a knife. It is fixed and directed by wedges, fo as to make the point of it equal to, or rather a little before"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"AGRICULTURE. before the pqint of the fock, and upon a line with the left fide of the head. This oblique pofition enables it to throw roots, <bc. out of the land, which requires lefs force than cutting or puihing them forward. The Wrest, fig. 7. B D, is fixed to the head, and is about 26 inches long, two broad, and one thick. It is fixed to the head at B, in fuch a manner as to make the angle contained between the lines A B and B D about 2J degrees. The wreft is feldom or never placed in the fame plane with the head, but gradually railed from the place where it is fixed to it; that is, from B to K, as in fig. 8. The pofition of the wreft determines the nature of the furrow. When the wreft is wide and low fet, this furrow is wide; and when it is narrow and high fet, the furrow is narrow. Fig. 9. reprefents the two Handles, fixed together by the two rungs. The larger handle has been already defcribed ; the lefler one is a few inches fhorter, and does not require to be quite fo ftrong. The diftance of the handles at the little rung depends on the pofition of the wreft. Their diftance at M and P is about two feet fix inches. The lefler handle is fixed to the mold-board at M, fig 10. and to the wreft K B, at L. Fig. 11. reprefents the plough complete, by joining together figures 6. and 10. in the (heath E B. The wreft B K is fuppofed to make an angle with the head A B, as in fig. 7., and the handles joined together, as in fig. 9. After having given fuch a particular defcription of all the parts and proportions of the Scots plough, it will ea- fily appear how it feparates, raifes, and turns over the earth of the furrow. If it had no coulter, the earth would open above the middle of the fock,. and in a line before the (heath; but as the coulter opens the earth in a line with the left fide of the head, if the foil has any cohefion, the earth of the furrow will be wholly raifed from the left fide, and as the fock moves forward, will be thrown on the right fide of the (heath, and by the calling out of the mold-board, or the railing of the wreft, will be. turned over. This plough, though the beft general one, is not alto¬ gether perfect. As the fock is high in the middle, and round on the (ides, and as the point of it is in a line with the middle of the head, a great force is neceflary •to raife the earth of the furrow. Befides, as the (heath is nearly in a line with the point of the fock, and to the right of the left fide of the head, the earth of the fur¬ row, as it is raifed, mud ftrike againft the (heath, and a part of it, inftead of being turned wholly to the right, will fall to the left fide. Thefe defeAs make the plough .heavy to draw; and, befides, this pofition of the (heath renders the Scots plough improper for hoeing, as the earth that falls to the left buries the young plants in the rows. To remedy the defedls arifing from the fock, it (hould be made ftraight on the land-fide, fo as to be in a line with the land or left fide of the head; and ftraight al(o below, fo as to be in a line with the under fide of the head, (loping on the furrow or left fide; and Iikewife on the upper fide from the point, fo as to make it, at the root, about feven inches broad, and three inches, thick; at the fame time (loping all the way from the land to 55 the furrow, fo as to form the furrow-fide into a (harp edge. It is obvious, that this fock will, meet with lefs refiftance than the common one, will raife the earth of the furrow wholly from the left fide, and turn it as it is raifed. To remedy the defed arifing from the (heath, it (hould be brought a little nearer the larger handle, and another (heath (hould be fixed a little before it, to the left or land-fide of the head and beam; to this (heath the mold- board (hould be fixed. If this be done, the earth of the furrow, as it is raifed, will be refifted by the mold- board only, and wholly turned to the right. The Bridle, or Muzzle, is another article belong¬ ing to the plough. It is fixed to the end of the beam, and the cattle are yoked by it. The muzzle commonly ufed is a curved piece of iron, fixed to the beam by a bolt through it. In fig. 12. A B C is the muzzle, A C the bolt by which it is fixed to the beam; D is the fwingle-tree, or crofs-tree, to which the traces are fix¬ ed ; and B is a hook, or cleek, as it is commonly called, which joins the muzzle and fwingle-trce. Someufe another kind of muzzle, fig. 13. A B C D. It is fixed to the beam by two .bolts, and has notches by which the cleek of the fwingle-tree may be fixed either to the right or the left of the beam. There are alfo dif¬ ferent holes for the hind-bolt to pafs through, by which the draught may be fixed either above or below the beam. A D is the fore-bolt upon which the muzzle turns ; on B C are four notches, betwixt any two of which the cleek of the fwingle-tree may be fixed. When the cleek is fixed at B, the plough is turned towards the firm land, and takes off a broader furrow; and when fixed at C, it is turned towards the ploughed land, and takes off a narrower furrow. E and F are the holes on each fide through which the hindmoft bolt pafles. When the bolt is put through the higheft two, thefe holes being thereby brought to the middle of the beam, the fore-part of the muzzle is raifed above the. beam, and the plough is made to go deeper; and when put through the lowed two, the fore-part of the muzzle is funk below the beam, and the plough is made to go (hallower. This muzzle may be fo conftru&ed as to have the fame play with the common one. Fig. 16. A is the end of the beam; B a plate of iron funk into it, and, with a fimilar one in the other fide, is rivetted into it by bolts; C is the muzzle fixed to thefe plates of iron by the bolt D, which bolt may be put through any of the holes E E. From the conftruc- tion of this muzzle it is plain, that it has the fame play with the common one, and that by it the land of the plough may be altered at pleafure. Of the Plough with the curved Mold-board. The mold-board of the Scots plough is not quite ftraight, but is caft out above, and more and more fo as it approaches the lefler handle. Ploughs with a curved mold-board commonly have no wreft, the mold-board ferving for both. The under¬ pay of it, which ferves in place of the wreft, becomes parallel to the plane of the head as it approaches the handle; and fometimes, after It has pafled the handle."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"$6 A G R I C U is made to turn inwards; and the fore-part of it, which is flraight below, is more and more eurved the further up it comes, refembling the bow of a fiiip/j If one mold-board be preferable to another, it mull be either becaufe it throws the earth of the furrow moire properly, or makes the plough more eafily drawn. Now, the ufe of the mold-board is to raife the earth, turn it over, and, if it be taken off narrow, to fhift it a little to the right hand. The common mold-board, when right made, performs all thefe operations gradually. But the Curved mold-board, as it is call out above in the fore-part, prevents the furrow from riling, and turns it over fuddenly. In land that eafily breaks in pieces, the common mold-board has the advantage, becaufe it raifes the earth of the furrow higher than the other, and leaves it more loofe and open. But the curved mold-board is preferable in land that is not eafily broke, for, by turning over the earth fuddenly, it is apter to tear it afunder. The plough is more eafily drawn by the common mold-board, as it has lefs friction than the curved one. Of the Plough with the feathered Sock. The difference between the feathered and the com¬ mon fock will be belt underftood by comparing their fi¬ gures. Fig. 14. is the common fock, and fig. 15. the feathered one. From the conftruftion of the feathered fock, it is ob¬ vious, that it mull meet with greater refiftance than the common fock. However, when the plough takes off the earth of the furrow broader than that part of the fock which goes upon the head, it is more eafily drawn than the plough wjth the common fock; for the earth whigh the c ommon fock leaves to be opened by the wreft, is more e afily opened by the feather of the other fock. In lea, the feathered fock makes the plough go more eafily } be¬ caufe the roots of the grafs, which go beyond the reach cf the plough, are more eafily cut by the feather than they can be torn afunder by the common fock. The fea¬ thered fock is alfa t>f great ufe in cutting and deftroying root-weeds. The common fock, however, anfwers much better in ftrong land. It is proper here to add, that in fitting the feathered fock to the head, the point of it fhould be turned a little from the land, or a little to the right hand. L T U R E. eafy for the ploughman to keep the ridges fir sight, which it is difficult to do without them. The difadvantages attending a wheeled plough are nearly equal to its advantages. It has too much-ma¬ chinery, which is an inconvenience in any inftrument, If is improper for ploughing ridges acrofs. It is’sdfo very inconvenient for ploughing narrow ridges; for it waft be frequently altered in ploughing out a ridge. The wheel that goes in the furrow being higher thaa the 0- ther, when both wheels are going upon the furfocc, the beam muff be changed from its ordinary politico, and placed in fuch a manner as to keep th$ plough even, and to make it go a little deeper than ordinary. When a furrow is made for the wheel to go in, the\" be am mull be altered again to its ordinary pofition ; and when the ridge is near finilhed, fo that both wheels- are going in furrows, the pofition of the beam mtift be changed, to keep the plough even, and to prevent it from going tod deep. Of the Four-coultered Plough... In England, this plough is faid to be ufed with fuc- cefs. But after repeated trials by thofe who attempted to ufe it in Scotland, they have been obliged to give it up. So many coulters in the ground at once mull meet with many obftacles, which will give different directions to the plough, according to the different parts of the coulters to which the refiftance is applied. Befides, it is difficult to place the planes of the coulters exactly paral¬ lel to each other; and if this be not done, they will be continually aCting upon the plough in different directions. When this plough is employed for breaking up grafs- rounds, which is the chief defign of it, the oblique po¬ tion of the coulters is apt to raife the turf in fuch a manner as to intangle it betwixt them, and thereby en¬ tirely flop the plough. This plough fhould always be made with wheels for regulating its direction; the planes of the coulters fhould be exaClly parallel to each other : The firft coulter muft be fet almoft perpendicular, and fhould not go above two inches deep; the fecond fhould Hope a little, and go fomewhat deeper than the firft, and fo on to the laft. Soft meadow-land, free from frones^ is beft adapted to the nature of this plough. Of the Wheeled Plough. Of the Iron Plough. Th e Scots wheeled plough is formed by adding wheels This plough is formed upon the model of the old Scots to the old Scots plough, and giving it a curved mold- plough; only the fever al parts of it are fliorter, and'the board, or feathered fock, according to the inclination of head and fock are of one piece like the Englifh plough- the former.

The iron.plough is fubjedl to another iriconveniency. When any thing goes wrong, it cannot be redtified on the field, but mult be carried to the fmithy, which is often at a confiderable diftance. Of yoking Cattle in Ploughs. It is not eafy to determine whether horfes or oxen, or both together, are molt proper for drawing ploughs ; be- caufe, in this country, fuch a determination depends on circumllances almoft as various as the number and Situ¬ ation of farms in it. If, indeed, real labour alone was fufficient to determine this point, oxen would be prefer¬ red ; becaufe they will (land to the draught, and over¬ come a refiftance which horfes would yield to. We (hall therefore confine this head to the manner of yoking cattle, without regard to the kind of cattle em¬ ployed. The chief queftion on this fubjedt is. Whether cattle Ihould be yoked in pairs, or in a line before one an¬ other ? The moft common way of yoking cattle is in pairs. Though this, upon the whole, be the beft method, yet it is fubjedt to fome difadvantages. In ploughing the furrows betwixt the ridges, the cattle go upon the ploughed land, and trea<j. it down with their feet, which is peculiarly hurtful to wet land : When there is but as much of the ridge unploughed as the cattle have hardly room to go upon, they frequently give the plough a wrong diredtion by going into the oppofite furrow; or, which is ftill worfe, they are apt to juftle the furrow- cattle upon the ploughed land. To remove thefe inconveniencies, yoking the cattle in a line has been recommended. But this method has been attended with greater inconveniencies than thofe it is intended to remedy. When yoked in this manner, they go all in the furrow, which makes it neceffary to give the plough more land than ordinary, either by means of the fock or muzzle ; and confequently makes the draught too heavy. Befides, when cattle are yoked in a line, it gives fome of them an opportunity of throw¬ ing the chief burden upon the others. There is ftill an¬ other inconveniency attends this method. When the cattle are all in a line, the whole force is applied to the diredtion of die traces of the hindmoft horfe; and confe- quendy it cannot have fuch an effedV on the plough as when a part of it is in a more horizontal diredtion. Each of thefe methods, however, may be ufed with advantage in certain circumftances; yoking in pairs, as it is certainly the ftrongeft draught, Ihould be preferred in ploughing ftiff land. On the other hand, yoking in a line anfwers beft in wet land, which is liable to be much hurt by the treading of the cattle. Of Ploughing. Ploughing is the adtion of the plough in ftirring and turning over the foil. By opening the foil and en¬ larging the furface, it gives it an opportunity of extradl- Vol. I. N0.3. 3 L T U ' R E. 57 ing the vegetable food from the air; and confequently increafes the food of plants. Ploughing likewife dif- folves and reduces to a ftate of putrefadtion the dung, oils, and vegetable fubftances that happen to be mixed with the foil, and prepares them for entering the roots of plants. When properly managed, ploughing de- ftroys weeds, and drains the land when too wet. Hence, ploughing is one of the moft important operations in agriculture, and therefore merits the greateft atten¬ tion. When ploughing is defigned to enrich the land, or in- creafe the food of plants, the furface cannot be made too uneven; becaufe the more of it is by this means expofed to the influence of the air. But when the intention of ploughing is to deftroy feed- weeds, the furface cannot be made too fmooth, nor the mold too much broken ; becaufe, by this management, their vegetation is promoted, and confequently they may be more completely deftroyed by ploughing them in. Again, if you plough with a view to remove wetnefs, the land muft be laid up in high ridges; for the greater the number of furrows, and the higher the ridges, the water is more expeditioufly carried off. Thus the manner of ploughing muft always depend on the object in view. It frequently happens indeed, that two or more of thefe objedts require our attention in ploughing the fame piece of land. But the methods a- bove mentioned are perfedlly confident with each, and may be combined fo as to anfwer any intention that may occur. In ploughing, there are fome general rules to be obfer-* ved, whatever be the objedt in view. Thus, land Ihould never be ploughed when it is wet, becaufe the intention of it will be fruftrated, whatever may be the nature of the foil. A ftiff foil, when ploughed wet, dries fud- denly, and becomes hard. If a light foil be ploughed wet, the water hinders it from being reduced to fmall enough particles. Befides thefe difadvantages, the labour be¬ comes very fevere on the cattle, and the land is much hurt by their treading. With regard to ploughing lee, or opening up grafs- grounds, the common pradiice in Scotland is to plough it as (hallow and narrow as poflible, and to fet the turf upon its edge. After this fingle furrow, the land is fown, and if it be good, a profitable crop may be ex- pedled; and the turf will be completely rotten before, next feafon. On the contrary, in breaking up of barren land, it Ihould be ploughed deep, and the turf turned on its back. Of Ridges. It was formerly obferved, that ploughing in ridges removes wetnefs, enlarges the furface, and confequently affords more fpace for the plants to extradl nourilhment from the foil. When the foil is wet, the ridges ought to be narrow, and fteep; becaufe, by this means, the number of drains- is increaJfed, and the water finds its way more eafily into the furrows. They Ihould bkewife be raifed high in the P middle"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"58 AGRICULTURE. middle or crown ; for the higher they are raifed, the more is the furface enlarged. However, if the foil be fhallow, the ridges fhould not be raifed high, as they de¬ prive the furrows of foil. But, in low flat-lying ground, the ridges fhould be rt'iade flat, in order to raife the furrows; for, in fome cafes, the higher the furrows are raifed, it is the more eafy to find a fall for carrying off the water. Flat ridges are alfo capable of being fown with greater ex- adtnefs. It is impracticable to give any general rule For laying out ridges. In fome fituations, narrow ridges are pre¬ ferable to broad ones ; in others, flat ridges are better than fteep ones, ire. In laying out of ridges, therefore, every perfon mufl be determined in this point by the na¬ ture and fituation of the foil, and the advantages or difadvantages of the different kinds of ridges. But, whatever be the nature or fituation of the foil, the ridges fhould always be made ftratght. Iri plough-' ing crooked ridges, the cattle mufl often go in a diffe¬ rent direction from the plough, and are obliged to take fhort turnings, which hurt the land by the treading of the cattle. Befides, when the ridges are crooked, the fall for the water is diminifhed. In all foils too, the ridges fhould be made of the fame breadth throughout, and equal to one another. When they are unequal, it is difficult to fow them with exaClnefs, or to alter them when neceffary ; and the plough muft often turn in the middle of the ridge, which hurts the land by the tram¬ pling of the cattle. Of the Pofttion of the Ridges. It is a matter of fome confequence to know how j idges fhould be placed, fo as beft to anfwer the fituation of the land. In lands that have a Hope, the ridges are commonly placed in a ftraight line from the top to the bottom of the declivity. -When the declivity is gentle, this pofi- tion is very proper, as it drains the land of water. But when the declivity is great, this pofitiort allows the foil to be wafhed away by the'rain ; and the quantity of foil carried off will always be in proportion to the violence with which the current runs : Hence, in a foil fituated in this manner, the ridges fhould be placed acrofs the de¬ clivity, to prevent the foil from being carried down by the water. Making the ridges very narrow will, in a good meafure, anfwer the fame purpofe; however, it is not fo proper as placing them acrofs the declivity. When land is very dry, crofs ridges are alfo of great life ; for they retain the water, and prevent the foil from being wafhed away. Of ploughing in Ridges. There are three different ways of ploughing in ridges, viz. gathering, carting, and cleaving. By gathering, the crown and furrows of the ridge are kept in the fame pofition in which they were before : the plough begins in the crown, and plows out the ridge, turning die earth towards the crown,, where it firft en¬ tered. Every ridge is ploughed by itfelf; or the halves of two contiguous ridges may be ploughed together. By this method, as the earth on each fide is turned upon the crown, and thrown up out of the furrows, the ridge muft be raifed higher. By cajling, the crowns and furrows are likewife kept in theif former pofition: The ridges are ploughed in pairs : The plough may enter in the furrow betwixt the ridges, and plough out the ridges, turning the earth to¬ wards the furrow where it entered; or, the plough may enter in the furrow on the right fide of the two ridges, then turn to the one on the left, and plough out the ridges, turning the earth to thefe furrows, and from the furrow that is betwixt them. By this method of plough¬ ing, the ridges are kept of the fame height in the crown, and one of the furrows made a little higher, and the o- ther a little lower than before. Cleaving is the reverfe of gathering. The plough enters in the furrow on the right-fide of the ridge, turns to the furrow on the left-fide, and ploughs out the ridge, turning the earth from the crown towards the fur¬ rows. Every ridge is ploughed by itfelf, or the halves of two contiguous ridges may be ploughed together. If the ridge be raifed in the crown, this method of plough¬ ing makes it flatter, by throwing foine of it into the furrows. , There is another method of ploughing ufed in fome places, called ribbing. This method is performed by making furrows about two feet diftant from each other. One half of the furface is untouched by the plough ; and the other half, which the plough turns up in making the furrows, is thrown on the top of what remains fall. The land may be ploughed in this manner either without re¬ gard to ridges, or the plough may be made to enter and turn, as in gathering, carting, or cleaving. This kind of ploughing is feldom praifHfed, but in the beginning of winter, and upon land to be fown with barley, after two additional clean ploughings. Although fome modern im¬ provers have condemned ribbing, it certainly has its ufes : It keeps the land dry; the rain that falls is confined to the furrows, from whence it is eafily carried off; it pro¬ motes the rotting of the ftubble, and expofes a greater part of the foil to the influence of the air. ' , Of Harrows. The harrow is an inftrument employed for fmoothing the furface after the land is ploughed. One horfe is fuf- ficient to draw the harrow commonly ufed in Scotland. Sometimes two of them go a-breaft, and fometimes three. When the furface is very rough, two are reckoned fuffi- cient for the attention of one perfon : But when three can be ufed, they make better work, and are nearly e- qual to two pair. There are feveral kinds of harrows ufed in Scotland. The common one is fo well known that it needs no de- feription. When the land is rough, the harrows are apt to ftarr, and get a-top of each other. To prevent this, fome fix pieces of crooked timber to the out-fide bulls that are contiguous to one another, which, by ftretching a little over,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"A G R I C U over, keep the harrows in their proper place. Others couple the harrows in fuch a manner as to allow them to go before and fall back of each other, and at the fame time turn upon a hinge. When ftiflt land is ploughed wet, it rifes in large pieces, whieh, when dry, become fo hard, that the common harrows make no impreflion on them. To re¬ duce this kind of land, a large harrow, called a break , has been contrived. Tire break-harrow is fonretimes made of the fame figure with the common harrow, and fometimes in a triangular form. Both kinds are made heavier or lighter according to the nature of the foil for Which they are intended. Some of them are fo heavy as to require fix or eight cattle to draw them. But the heavieft kind are very improper for land infefted with large fall hones ; becaufe their weight hinders them from darting over the hones; and therefore they are often in danger of being torn afundcr by the cattle. There is another harrow, which, though little ufed, will be found to be very ufeful in many cafes. It is of the fame form with the common harrow, but much broader. The bulls are at a greater diflance, and cori- fcquently'the teeth thinner placed ; the teeth are longer than thofe of the common harrow, but very little thick¬ er ; and thofe in the fore-part Hope forward. It is made of fuch a weight as to be eafily drawn by a couple of horfes. This harrow goes deeper, opens land better, hovers the feed deeper, and is more proper for tearing up roots than the common harrow. The French harrow is of a triangular form, with a joint near the angle, to which the draught is fixed. It has two handles, by which it is either made to go deep, br fhallow, as occafion requires. Its principal ufe is to level deep ridges, which it does moft effeftually. It is drawn acrofs the ridges: When, at the crown of the fridge, by prefling on the handles, the harrow finks down, and carries earth along with it to the furrows; and, When at the furrows, by lifting up the handles, the har¬ row is brought out of the ground, and leaves the earth behind. This operation, however, is extremely impro- J ier, unlefs the land be in a very dry fituatiou, and not iable to be damaged by water. Of Harrowing. Harrowing fmooths the furface, dedroys Weeds, and covers the feed after it is fown. When the intention of harrowing is to dedroy root- weeds, the harrows fhould be drawn acrofs the ridges. However, if fuch weeds are net fully tom up, the liar- rowing, by filling up the hollows, and defending the fronts from the drought, rather promotes their growth. For this reafon, harrowing is improper for dcilroying root-weeds, excepting after a fpring-fallcw, when the land is foon after to be ploughed for feed. But the fmoother the furface is made, and the mere the mold is broke, the vegetation of the feed-weeds is the more effeftually promoted, and of courfe they are the more liable to be deftroyed by harrowing. If the feafon be favourable, the land may be harrowed feveral times, and as many crops of weeds dedroyed. L T U R E. 59 A light fpungy foil can hardly get too much harrow¬ ing ; for the more it is harrowed, it becomes the firiAer. But if the foil be lliff, the lefs harrowing it gets, the better, provided the purpofes propefed can be anfwered. The common method of harrowing after the feed is fown, is fird along the ridges, then acrofs, and then a- long again. When the ridges are flat, they may be har¬ rowed either along or acrofs; and the work may be be¬ gun or ended either way. But when the ridges are fleep, it is improper to begin by harrowing acrofs, be¬ caufe too much of the feed will be drav/n into the fur¬ rows. Of the Roller. The roller is intended for fmoothingthe furface, and making the land firmer. Rollers are fometimes made of done, fometimes of wood, and fometimes of iron : but the only effential difference of rollers lies in their weight. As rollers, in different circumftances, require to be lighter and heavier, they are generally condrufted fo that their weight can either be augmented or diminilhed. The common roller, in turning, is very fevere upon the citttle, for it does not move on its axis, but is drag¬ ged along the furface. To remove this inconvenience, a roller has lately been condru&ed with a divifion in the taiddle, as if two rollers were joined together. In turning, both parts of this roller move round their axis, the one forward, and the other back. Of Rolling. Rolling is pra&ifed with advantage, both on land lying in grafs, and in tillage. It preffes down mole¬ hills, fmooths the furface, and makes pafture-grafs ftool, and grow thicker. Rolling upon land in tillage, not only fmooths the fur¬ face, but breaks clods that the harrow cannot reduce. In a light foil, the roller fhould be applied immediately after the feed is fown; it is peculiarly ufeful to this kind of foil, by eor.denfing and making it firmer. Of Sowing. It is remarked by farmers, that the corn whieh is ear- lied fown is in general fooned ripe. However, as this operation depends on the nature of the weather, and a number of other circumdanccs, no precifc time can be fixed for performing it. The practice of fowing wheat, oats, barley, 6v. at different times of the year, feerns not to depend fo much on the different natures of thefe grains, as on the incon¬ veniences which would attend the fowing them all at the fame time. It may however be obferved, that wheat, the only grain in this country which is fown befere win¬ ter, fhould be fown as early as poflible, that its roots and leaves may be put forth before the frod comes cn. The mod common method of fowing is by the hand. This method requires great fkill and addrefs in the fower: For, at the fame time that he gives his arm a circular motion, to cad the feed with drength, he mud open his hand"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"6o AGRICULTUR'E. hand gradually, that it may not fall in a heap, but be .pr.perly fcattered and fpread. It is remarkable, that good fowers, by the force of habit, take their handful out of the fheet fo very exaftly, that they will fow any quantity of feed on an acre, according as it is defigned to be thinner or thicker. , But this dexterity in a few fowers, is itfelf an objedtion to the method of fowing by the hand; becaufe long practice and oblervation are neceflary to make a good lower : This remark is too well juftified by experience; for good fowers are extremely rare, and, in fome places of the country, hardly to be got. Befides, in fowing by the hand, efpecially when the land is uneven, the feed rebounds on the clods, falls into the cavities, and often the greateft part of it is col- lefted in the furrows. Different plants require to be fown at different depths. The fame feeds, however, may be laid deeper in light than in ftrong foils. Wheat requires to be placed two inches and a half or three inches below the lurface: And it may be laid down as a general maxim in fowing, that fmall feeds Ihould always be placed nearer the fur- face than fuch as are larger. Befides the unequal di-. flribution of the feed when fown by the hand, too large a quantity of it may be ufed; for, as it is placed at dif¬ ferent depths, that which is too deep nevet comes up, and that which lies on the furface, which may be obfer- ved on the beft harrowed land, is eat up by the birds. When feed is fown thin, and placed at equal difiances by a drill, a lefier quantity of it, by leaving room to fpread and branch out, will produce even a better crop than a larger quantity fown irregularly by the hand. The faff has been confirmed by repeated experiments both in our own country and in France, Sect. VI. Of the Culture of par¬ ticular Plants. Of the Culture of Wheat. Though wheat be the moft valuable grain that is cultivated in Scotland, there are many places where it cannot be fown with advantage; for it requires not only a rich foil, but a warm climate. The Englifii writers mention about 13 or 14 different kinds of wheat; but in Scotland we feldom ufe more than two, viz. the white and the red wheat. The laft is reckoned the moft hardy plant, and fucceeds in fome foils and climates where the white kind fails. Bearded wheat is ufed in fome places. This is likewife a hardy plant, and is not fo apt to lodge, or to be fhaken out by the wind, as the other kinds. It fucceeds very well in wet land, and the grain produces a great quantity of flour. The white wheat moft commonly ufed in Scotland, is not a particular fpecies, but a mixture of all the fpecies cultivated in England. This mixture is probably occa- fioned by want of care in providing ourfelves with fo¬ reign feed. It is found by experience, that, in this country at leaft, wheat degenerates; for which reafon a frefh fupply is every year brought from the Englifh gra¬ naries, which generally confifts of a mixture of all the kinds. Now it is at leaft very probable, that thefe dif¬ ferent kinds of wheat require different foils ; and there¬ fore the farmer fhould endeavour to provide himfelf an¬ nually with a quantity of unmixed wheat, of fuch kinds as are found tofucceed beft in Scotland. Wheat is commonly fown either upon land that has been fummer-fallowed, or after a crop of peafe. In the latter cafe, the feed cannot be fown till O&ober; but in the former, it is generally fown in Auguft. However, in Scotland, we fow wheat from the beginning of Auguft till the middle of November. Some have tried fowing wheat in the fpring; but the plants were neither fo vi¬ gorous, nor the grain fo large, as thofe that were fown in autumn. The fowing of oats in autumn has likewife been tried; but, though the crop was bulky, the quan¬ tity of grain was not in proportion. Upon the whole, the month of O&ober feems to be the moft proper time for fowing. wheat; when it is either earlier or later, it is fubjedt to a number of dangers. The quantity ufually fown upon a Scots acre, is from three to five firlots, Linlithgow meafure, which is the meafure always meant in this treatife. The proper quan¬ tity, however, muft always depend upon the fituation of the land: in proportion as it is clean and rich, a fmaller quantity of feed is requifite; and in proportion as it is poor and full of weeds, a larger quantity becomes necef- lary. A wet bed is moft proper for wheat-feed. In the month of Auguft, or even the beginning of September, it is dangerous to fow,' if there be not as much moifture in the land as to make the feed vegetate, efpecially if the feed ■ has been fteeped in brine, and dried with lime. But though the danger\" be great in fowing when the land is very dry, yet the beft fituation of land for receiving feed is when it contains no more moifture than is fufficient to make the feed vegetate. When wheat-land is light, or well reduced by fal¬ lowing, the feed Ihould be ploughed in, or the land al¬ lowed to lie fome time after it is ploughed before the wheat be fown. By this the land acquires a degree of firmnefs before the harrows go upon it, and the feet of the cattle are prevented from preffing the feed too deep into it. Wheat-land Ihould be ploughed fo as to raife the ridges higher in the crown than is neceflary on other oc- cafions, in order to prevent it from being damaged by wa¬ ter : If the ridges are made narrower than ordinary, the fame end will be ferved, becaufe the water finds its way more eafily to the furrows. Hence the old pradtice iu Scotland, of cleaving for peafe, and gathering for wheat, was well founded. When the wheat is fown, and the land harrowed, the field fhould be carefully water-furrowed; and if there be ridges at the ends for the ploughs to turn upon in ploughing, a water-furrow Ihould likewife be drawn be¬ twixt them and the ridges, and the communication be¬ twixt thefe and the furrows opened up. Of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"A G R I C U Of the Culture of Rye. Rye is a winter-grain, and thrives very well on land that is improper for wheat. As there is hardly a good market for this grain in Scotland, it.is but Jittle cultiva¬ ted. In forric places, the land is prepared for it by a fallow, and good crops are reaped in this way. It may be fown in October, November, or early in the fpring. It may be fown after peafe or barley ; but it is improper to fow it after wheat or oats, as this would encourage the growth of root-weeds, and greatly exhauft the land.' Rye is fometimes fown as a grafs-feed. If it.be fown witji this view in September, upon'a well-prepared fal¬ low, it will afford good feeding for fheep in March and April; and after it is cut down, the land may be plough¬ ed, and fown with barley. This practice, however, will not anfwer in wet land. Of the Culture of Barley. There are four kinds of barley ufed in Scotland, the common barley, the Lincolnfhire barley, the High¬ land barley, more commonly called rough bear, and the Thanet. Thefe different kinds are fown at different feafons. The Lincolnfhire barley may be fown any time during the winter, or in the fpring; the common barley and Thanet may be fown in April, the beginning of May, or even later ; and the rough bear may be fown in May, or the beginning of June: but’the precife time of fow- ing mult be determined by the weather and the fituation of the liind. When the feafon is favourable, the land free from weeds, arid not too wet, Lincolnfhire barley may be fown in February, and the other kinds fooner than the periods above mentioned. When barley is fown in winter, or early in the fpring, ‘the land ought to be ploughed forae time before; but when fown late in the fpring, or in the beginning of fum- mer, it ought to be fown immediately after it is plough¬ ed. In winter, or early in the fpring, land is in no dan¬ ger of becoming too dry, but in fummer, land is ve¬ ry liable to become too dry for the purpofes of vegeta¬ tion. The farmer fhould therefore endeavour to have all his feed fown before the feafon be too far advanced. The quantity of barley fown on an acre is from two to four firlots. When the land is clean and rich, two firlots are fufficient y but when it is infefted with weeds, a larger quantity is neceffary. Barley has tender roots, and is not able to pufh them far in quell of food; it is therefore neceffary to bring land deltined for barley into good tilth, and to enrich it either by manures or frequent ploughings. Barley is often fown upon land that has been fallowed, or after a crop of peafe. In fome places it is fown after a crop of oats ; and fometimes it is repeated for two or three years fucceffvely upon the fame land. When barley is to be fown upon fallow, in {tiff land not much in felled with annual weeds, it fhould be dreffed in November in the fame manner as for wheat; fo that Lincolnfhire barley may be fown, if the winter be favour- Vol. I. No. 3. 3 L T U R E. 61 able, or fpring barley upon the winter-furrow, if the feafon proves unfavourable. But when barley is to be fown after wheat, peafe, or oats, the land fhould be ploughed as foon after harvefl as poffible, and laid up in fucli a manner as to be belt expofed to the air and froft, and to fecure it againfl damage from rain. To anfwer thefe purpofes, barley-land is fometimes ribbed at this feafon: But ribbing ftirs only a fmall quantity of the foil; and therefore it is better to gather, it into narrow ridges of four or fix furrows each, and to make proper drains' for carrying off the water. As the firfl ploughing for barley-land is .defigned to cover the flubble, increale the vegetable food, and keep the land dry, it need: not be very deep, but ought to be as broad as poffible, provided it be clean ploughed. If it be propofed to dung barley-land, the dung may belaid on during the winter-frofl, and ploughed in as foon as the land is in proper condition. When,the dunging is delayed till immediately before the latt ploughing, or feed-furrow, the land, efpecially if it be of a ftiff na¬ ture, is in danger of being battered fo as to rife in large clods when ploughed. In {leering, the ploughing foould be as deep as the plough can go, and the foil allows : For by deep plough¬ ing at this feafon, part of the earth that has been expo- fed to the air through the winter, and part of it turned up by the ordinary ploughing, are mixed together for the nourilhment of the crop. In {leering, the. furrows foould not be fo broad as in the former ploughing; on the contrary, the narrower they are the better. Crofs- ploughing is very proper at this feafon, if the land be fo dry as to allow it. After {leering, the land foould be well harrowed. It> makes the weeds fpring, retains the fap, and, if the land, be tolerably dry, takes out the roots of the quickening- grafs. But, if. the land be in'no danger of lofing the fap, the harrowing may be delayed for fome time after it is ploughed; for by this method a greater number of weeds are deflroyed. Though, in general, frequent plpughings are benefi¬ cial, yet ploughing when the land is wet is defiruftive. When the fpring is wet, the barley-land in many places' is not in a proper condition to be fown. In this cafe, the fte.ering-furrow mull be omitted, and the land foould get the feed-furrow as foon as it is in a proper condi¬ tion. When barley is to be fown a fecond time upon the fame land, without any other crop intervening, two ploughings are fufficient. As our fummers in Scotland are fometimes very wet, barley-lapd foould. be water-furrowed, and dreffed up in the fame manner as wheat-land. Of the Culture of Oats. The qat is a very hardy plant, and its roots are ftrong, which enables it to procure food where many other plants would ftarve ; and hence the practice of gi¬ ving lefs culture to oats than to, any other grain. There are three kinds of oats ufed in Scotland, the white, the black, and the grey. The white is the mofl Q__ common,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"62 AGRICULTURE. common, and ufed in all the low countries ; the black is the hardieft, and is ufed in the cold hilly countries ; and the grey is often fown with fuccefs upon light gravel or fand. The white is again divided into two kinds, called cold feed and hot feed. There is fcarcely any difference in appearance betwixt thefe; but the hot feed ripens eight or ten days before the cold. Experience muft de¬ termine which of them ought to be chofen for feed. Though the oat be a hardy plant, and does not eafily degenerate, yet the changing of feed is univerfally al¬ lowed to be a good praftice. This change fhould always be made from a warm foil to a cold, and from a cold to a warm. Oats are often fown upon grafs-ground newly broken up, or, which is the fame thing, upon lee once plough¬ ed. They are likewife often fown after barley, fome- times after wheat, fometimes upon fallow, and fome- times they are repeated for fcveral years fucceffively upon the fame land. In ploughing lea for oats, when the land is foft and mellow, the plough fhould go as fhallow as poffible ; and the earth of the furrows fhould be fet upon its edges, to allow the harrows to have the greater impreflion in tearing k. But when the land is ftiff, or the turf very tough, it is neceffary to plough deeper, and to turn the turf ful¬ ly over, fo that the harrows may raife a kind of mold upon its back to fill up the hollows, and to nourifii the feeds. When oats are to be fown upon lee, the land ought to be ploughed early in v/inter, that it may receive the greater benefit from the air and froft. It is ufual to lime lea-ground intended for oats. This is a very good cuftom; for lime promotes the corruption of the grafs-roots, by which the land is fooner reduced. It is likewife common to fpread the lime upon the fward fome time before the land is ploughed: This is alfo very proper; for the lime is intangled in the fward, and is not fo apt to penetrate too deep. Oats are generally fown after barley ; and the land is ploughed as foon as the wheat-feed is made, and the bar¬ ley-land has got the firft furrow. The iliff land, and land in danger of being damaged by wetnefs, fhould be firft ploughed, to give the one the benefit of the winter- froft, and to put die other out of danger. It is likewife an advantage to light and dry land to be ploughed early in the feafon, as it makes the ftubble rot fooner, andex- pofes the foil longer to the air. It was formerly obferved, that oats are fometimes fown upon fallow. In the hilly countries, they often fallow the land that has been in lea for fome years ; and they find that this practice does better than giving it only one ploughing in the winter before the feed is lown. In the low countries, this practice of fallowing for oats is found to fucceed very well. The fallow for oats fhould be ma¬ naged through the fummer in the fame manner as if for barley or wheat. Before winter, it ought to get die laft furrow, and be laid up in proper ridges, to preferve it dry during the winter. Oats may be fown in any of the winter-months, or in die month of March. Some people have fown oats fo early as die beginning of November, and have had good crops. Eut, if the land be properly laid up in winter, it is better to delay die fowiog till Mareh. The quantity of oats generally fown upon an acre, is from four to five firlots ; and fhould always get a dry bed. Of the Culture of Peafe. The pea is a grain very different from any of thofe' already mentioned. A crop of it is not fo valuable, though it is much ufed in fome places for bread. The ftraw of peafe ist reckoned better for feeding hor- fes than the ftraw of any other grain. A crop of peafe docs not require fuch a quantity of nourifliment as a crop of any of die other grains mentioned above. When the crop is good, the ftraw covers the ground, and deftroys all the fmall weeds by depriving diem of a free commu¬ nication with the air. Peafe likewife minutely divide the particles of the foil ; befides, they pufti their roots much deeper than any of the white grains, and extradl part of their ndurifhment from below die reach of the plough. There are two kinds of peafe cultivated in Scodand, the white and the grey. The white is njofl common, and confifts generally of a mixture of fcveral kinds. All of thefe kinds feem to be fpecics of the pea cultivated in pur gardens. The grey pea feems to be a fpecies of the vetch or tare. This is the hardieft plant of the two, and thrives on foils where the white pea does not fuccced. The ftraw of the grey peafe, and the peafe them- felves, are better for horfes than thofe of die white. The farmer Ihould therefore cultivate this pea where the, other does not thrive, although the value of the grain be inferior. The white pea, like the oats, is divided into hot feed and cold feed. The fowing of the hot feed may be delayed three weeks after the cold feed is fown, and yet the peafe will come as foon to maturity. The time of fowing is from the firft of February to the end of April. The early fown peafe have die beft chance to produce a crop of corn, and the late fown to produce a crop of ftraw. However, when the land is clean and in good heart, the peafe may be fown early; becaufe, on fuch land, a good crop both of corn and ftraw may be expected. But if the land be foul or wet, the fowing of peafe Ihould be delayed, as long as poffible ; becaufe on fuch land die crop is more precarious, and the failing of a crop of peafe gives fuch encouragement to weeds, as to endanger the following crops likewife. In fuch a cafe, to prevent the bad confequences that may follow, the crop fhould be ploughed in ; for when a bad crop of peafe is allowed to ftand, it does more harm to the land than all the value of the crop. The quantity of peafe fown upon an acre, is from 4 to 5' firlots. If the intention of fowing peafe be to ob¬ tain ftraw, and enrich the land, they fhould be thick fown; becaufe in that cafe they have a better chance to deftroy the weeds, and to cover the furface. But when the principal defign is to have a crop of corn, they fhould be diinner fown ; for, when thin fown, they have more air, and fill better. Peafe are commonly fown after oats or barley, and fometimes"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"A G R I C U fometimes after wheat. Seldom more than one plough¬ ing is given to peafe, and they are ufually fov/n imme¬ diately after it. The reafon of this practice is, that the feed may be better covered; for the fooner that a- ny grain is fown after ploughing, it is always the deep¬ er covered. If rain fails foon after peafe are fown, it makes them fwell and come above-ground, and then they, are in danger of fplitting, and of being dedroyed by vermin. Sometimes peafe are fov/n and ploughed in. This an- fwers very well in light land, particularly' after a crop qf barley, the culture of which opens the foil. Land deligned for peafe is generally cloven. This is a good practice when the ridges are deep, as all of them were formerly. As wheat or barley are commonly fown after peafe, the land mull be ploughed before winter. Ga¬ thering is the mofl proper way of ploughing before win¬ ter, and this follows heft after cleaving. But if the ridges be not high, calling is the belt method of ploughing for peafe ; or, if the ridges be flat and narrow', the land may be ploughed in the ordinary way, r ever fine the former ploughing, and turning the furrows into the crowns. Though peafe are generally the lowelt-priccd grain, yet fometimes they rife to a great, price, when the prices of other grains are moderate. This mikes the faving of feed an article of great importance. By fowing in drills, one firlot will ferve for an acre as compleatly as four in the bread call-way: But the advantages of drilling fall to be conlidcrcd afterwards. Of the Culture of Beam. What has been faid with regard to the culture of peafe, may be applied to beans. However, it is necef- fary to obferve, that the bean puftes its roots further down than the pea; and therefore requires a deeper foil. The lands in Scotland, where beans are mofl com¬ monly fown, and where they fucceed btll, are deep and wet clays. , In fome lauds, the crops of beans are very great, and almolt as valuable as any grain. There is no crop fuc- ceeds better in the drill-huibandry than a crop of beans. Of the Culture of Rye-grafs . Rye-grass is the moll common of all the artificial £ra!Tes cultivated in Scotland, and not the leaf! valu¬ able. It is a fibrous-rooted plant, and binds the foil ; this circurnllance has led many to think, that it greatly impoverilhes land. However, the culture of this graXs is attended with fevcral peculiar advantages. It deftroys weeds, particularly the quickcning-grafs, and grows up- cn foils which will not anfwer for any of the other arti¬ ficial graiTes. A fhallow, wet, fpungy foil, or one which has a mixture of mofs in it, is unfit for clover of every kind ; but experience fliows, that rye-grafs, when unmixed with clover, will fuccced upon any of thefe foils. Rye-grafs is ufually fown along with a crop of barley or oats. When fown along with barley, the field fhould be rolled, or well harrowed, to preferve the fap at the diy reason of the barley-feed. This precaution is not L T U R E. 63 fo npceffary, whea the rye-grafs is fown along with oats ; bccaufe the land on which oats are fown is generally firmer, the fowing fcafon is earlier, and confequently not fo liable to be too dry. This grafs feldom hurts the crop of corn. On the contrary, when the foil is loofc and open, it makes it firm, and prevents the corn from lodging. Though the common method is to fow rye-grafs with corn, yet, when the land is poor, it js better to fow it by itfelf, and Hill better to fummer-fallow, and fow it in autumn. But, as the land by fallowing is made open 'and loofe, and as the ploughing and fowing are near the rainy feafon, cattle ought not -to be allowed to paflure upon it during the winter, except in the time of hard frolt. Even when fown in the fpring, the farmer fhould not allow much paduring on it, efpecially in wet weather. But, if fown by itfelf, cattle may fafely paflure uppn it in the winter, as the roots, having nothing to obdrudt their progrefs, penetrate deeper, and fpread wider, than when any other grain grows along with it. This prac¬ tice, however, can only be followed with fafety in very clean land; otherwife weeds are apt to rife along with it, and prevent the furface from being covered; which, of courfe will keep the foil open. Rye-grafs is fometimes fown for hay, and fometimes for paflure. When for hay, from two to four firlots ar* commonly fown upon an acre. Rye-grafs rifes very early in the fpring, and, if .tha foil be dry and warm, affords good paflure all the win¬ ter. It is very hardy, flands the froft, and, if continued in paflure, does not weir out in many years. The belt way of managing it is, to eat it down in the fpring and beginning of fummer, and then to let it red till autumn. When allowed to get up in fummer, it runs to feed, and becomes difagreeable to the cattle. Befides, by this method of managing rye-grafs, a good crop may be cx-» peCled in autumn. When propei ly managed, rye-grafs makes very good hay; and there is fuch a demand for the feed, that the* farmer is often tempted to let it dand till the feed is perfected, and then to threfh it. When this is done, the hay can never be good; bccaufe the fap is exhauded, the dalk becomes dry and withered, and affords little Bourifhment to cattle. The hay ought therefore to be always cut before the feed ripens. This practice not on¬ ly makes tire bed hay, but is likewife of great advantage to the land; for, when plants are allowed to perfect their feeds, the land is much more exhauded, than when they are cut before that period. Of the Culture of Clover. Though clover be ufed for the fame purpofes as rye- grafs, it is, however, a plant of a very different nature- It has a large tap-root, which penetrates the foil perpen¬ dicularly downward, and opens the earth and makes it free: The roots of clover cannot penetrate the foil, un- lefs it be free and open. Hence, a dry, open, deep foil, free from quicken-grafs, is the molt proper for this plant. There arc fcveral kinds of clover cultivated in Scot¬ land,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"64 A G R I C U laud, dnUngnifhed by the colour of their flowers, viz. the red, the white, and the yellow. The red is the largeft plant, has the ftrongcft ftalk. and brcadeft leaves. The yellow fometimes grows tall, but the ftalk is fmall: The white is the fmalleft plant, and is fometimes called / o p-clover, from the refemblance its flowers bears to thefe of the bop. Both the feafons and methods of fowing clover are various. • Mod of the Englifh writers recommend the autumn, ft has frequently been tried, at this feafon, in Scotland without fuccefs. When fown in fpring, it an- kivers much better in this country. The common way of fowing clover, both in Scotland and England, is* along with wheat, oats, or barley, in the fpring. This method is fometimes attended with disadvantages. The clover fometimes hurts the corn, and the corn the clover. However, thefe diladvantages are probably more than over-balanced by the corn’s pro¬ tecting the clover from drought when very young, which it is much expofed to, efpecially when fown in the fpring. As the lodging of corn delays all plants that are be¬ low; to prevent this, the corn fown along with clover ought to be fown thin, and the land made very clean of weeds. * Sometimes, in a wet feafon, the clover gets a-top of the corn, and deftroys the crop. This feldom happens- when it is fown with barley or wheat; becaufe it is much later in the feafon when fown with barley than when fown with oats, and therefore is not fo far advanced at harveft; and the wheat is advanced fo far before the clo¬ ver-feed is fown, that the clover can never get the better of it. To prevent,the clover, then, from hurting the corn, it may be fown early in the feafon with wheat, or late in the feafon with barley. The Thanet barley, from the ftrength of its roots and ftalk, is not fo apt to lodge as the common barley; and, of courfe, it is the moft pro¬ per kind to be fown along with clover. But, as all kinds of barley are more apt to lodge than oats, and as the feafon for fowing oats is more proper for fowing clo¬ ver than the feafon of fowing barley, the farmer, when it is equally convenient for him, Ihould prefer the fow¬ ing of clover with oats. ^ When clover is fown with barley or oats, after thefe grains are fown, and the land harrowed, the clover-feed is thin fown, and then the land is again harrowed or rolled. When the clover is fown with a crop of wheat, the clover is fown in the fpring, and afterwards the wheat is rolled. It is common to fow clover-feed with¬ out any preparation given to the land; but it is better to harrow it before fowing. The harrowing does no harm to the wheat, \"and it makes the roller cover the feed more effe&ually. Clover-feed may be fown in the fame manner amongft oats or early-fown barley. Some time after the corn has come up, the land may be harrowed, and the clover fown. If the weather be dry, the dif¬ ferent parts of the operation lhould fucceed one another as quickly as poflible. The harrows lhould be imme¬ diately followed by the fower, and the fower by the roller, to prevent the drought from penetrating too deep. The Engliflt writers differ widely as to the quantity &f clover-feed proper to be fown on an acre. However, L T . U R E. the farmers in Scotland, who fow clover with oats or barley, find, that from io to 16 fo. of red, ot from 1to 18 lb. of white clover on the acre, produces a ve- ry good crop. Clover, like rye-grafs, is fometimes fown for hay, fometimes for pafture, and fometimes for both. The red clover is the moft proper for hay, the white for pafture ; and, when both are intended, a mixture of the two a'n- fwers beft. When red clover is fown without being mixed with any other kind, the' farmer ought to bring his land into tillage again in two or three years : For, af¬ ter the fecond year, a crop of this kind of clover is of little value. When white clover is fown by itfelf, the farmer muft : not expedt a crop of hay; for it feldom rifes to fuch a height as to produce a good crop : But, to balance this, the field may be kept long in pafture, as this clover con¬ tinues till wore out by the natural grafs of the foil. When a mixture of the two are fown, feme crops of hay may be taken, and theil the land may be allowed to lie forae years longer for pafture. The red clover af¬ fords the crops of hay ; and the white remains till the natural grafs rifes. In this cafe, there is commonly fown upon the acre, from 8 to 12 lb. of red clover, and from 6 to 8 of white. But thefe proportions may be varied according to the judgment of the farmer. In Scotland, feldom more than one crop of hay in the feafon fucceeds. The fecond crop is commonly fo late, that it is very difficult to get-the hay properly made. It may therefore be paftured on, or cut green for cattle. When clover is cut green for cattle, it is a proper way to feed them upon a field that needs dung. This me¬ thod is preferable to feeding them in ftalls ; it faves the expence of carrying out the dung, and procures to the land the benefit of the i*rine, which is a very rich ma¬ nure. v ' Before concluding this article, it muft be obferved, that red clover, while green, is dangerous to blade cat¬ tle and fheep, when firft given them, efpecially if wet with dew or rain. They ought therefore to be allowed it only fparingly at firft, and brought to it by degrees. 1 After being accuftomed to it for a few days, the danger is over, and they may be allowed to ufe as much of it as they pleafe. Of the Culture of Clover mixed with Rye-grafs. Red clover makes the beft green forage for cattle. An acre of it will maintain more cattle than three or four acres of common grafs: But then it is not fo proper for hay. Clover-hay is very troublefome in making, and is not reckoned fo good for feeding as fome other kinds of hay. It likewife hurts the land, by encouraging the' growth of quickening-grafs. To remedy thefe difadvan- tages, it is common to fow rye-grafs along with it. Clo¬ ver, when mixed with rye-grafs, is eafier made into hay; the hay itfelf is much better; and the rve-grafs, by covering the furface, prevents the growth of the quickening-grafs. The quantity fown upon the-acre in this way is from 8 -to 12 fo. of clover, and from 1 to 3 firlots of rye-grafs. f"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"AGRICULTURE. 65 Of the Culture of St-Foin. The writers on agriculture reckon this grafs prefer¬ able to clover in many refpeCts: They fay, that it pro¬ duces a larger erop; that it does not hurt eattle when eaten green ; that it makes better hay ; that it continues four times longer in the ground j and that it will grow on land that will bear no other crop. Thefe are great advantages: But, as we have fo little of that kind of grafs in Scotland, it cannot be expected that any direc¬ tions ean be given concerning the manner of cultivating it, founded upon experience. We muft therefore confine ourfelves to fueh fads as are mentioned by authors of the belt credit. St-foin has a very long tap-root, which is able to pieree very hard earth! The roots grow very large, and the larger they are, they penetrate to the greater depth; and hence it may be concluded, that this grafs, when it thrives well, receives a great pan of- its nourifhment from below die ftaplc of the foil: of eourfe, a deep dry foil is beft for the eulture of St-foin. When plants draw their, nourifhment from that part of the foil that is near the furfaee, it is not of much eonfequanee Whether their^ number be great or fmall. But the eafe is very different when the plants receive their food, not only near, but alfo deep below the furfaee. Befides, plants that {hoot their roots deep are often fupplied with moifhire, when thofe near the furfaee are parched with drought. To render the plants of St-foin vigorous, it is necef- fary that they be {own thin. The bell method of doing this is by a drill; beeaufe, when fown in this manner, not only the weeds, but alio the fupernumerary plants, ean eafdy be removed. It is feveral years before St-foin comes to its full ftrength ; and the number of plants fuf- fieient to flock a field, while in this imperfeCt ftate, will make but a poor crop for the firft year or two. It is therefore lieeefikry that it be fown in fueh a manner as to make it eafy to take up plants in fueh numbers, and in fueh' order, as always to leave in the field the proper number in their proper places. This can only be done with propriety, by fowing the plants in rows by a drill. Suppofing a field to be drilled in rows at ten inches di- ftanee, the partitions may be hand-hoed, and the rows dreffed in fueh a mannpr as to le&ve a proper number of plants. In this (ituation the field may remain two years ; then one fourth of the rows may be taken out in pairs, in fueh a manner as to make the beds of fifty inches, with fix rows in eaeh, and intervals of thirty inches, whieh may be ploughed. Next year, another fourth of the rows may be taken out in the fame manner, fo as to leave double rows with partitions of ten inehes, and in-' tervals of thirty : All of whieh may be hoed at once or alternately, as it may be found mod -convenient. The'great quantity cf this grafs which the writers on this iubject arffiire us may be ruifed upon an acre, and the excellency and great value of the hay made of it, fhould induee farmers to make a complete trial of it, and even - to ufe the fpade in place of the hoe, Or hoe-plough, if ne cellar y. The plants taken up from a field of St-foin may be fet Vol. I. No. 3. 3 in another field; and if the tranfplanting of this grafs fueceeds as w'dl as the tranfplanting of lucern has done with Mr Lunin de Chateauvieux, the trouble and ex¬ pence will be fuffieiently reeompenfed by the largenefs of the crops. In tranfplanting, it is neceffary to cut off great part of the long tap-root: this will prevent it from lin¬ king very deep into the foil, and make it pulh out large roots in a Hoping direction from the cut end of the tap¬ root. St-foin managed in this manner, will thrive even on {hallow land that fias a Wet bottom, provided it be not overftoeked with plants. Whoever inclines to try the eulture of this grafs in Scotland, fhould take great pains in preparing the‘land, and making it as free from weeds as pofhble. Of the Culture of Lucern. Th£ writers on agriculture, ancient as well \"as mo¬ dern, beftow the higheft eneOmiums upon this grafs, as affording excellent hay, and producing very large crops. Lucern remains at leafl ten or twelve years in the grfcind, and produces about eight tons of hay upon the Scots acre. There is but little of it cultivated in Scotland. However, it has been tried in {everal parts of this coun¬ try; and it is found, that, when the feed is good, it comes up very well, and ftands the winter-frofl. But the ehief thing that prevented this grafs from being more* ufed in this country, is the difficulty of keeping the foil open, and free from weeds. In a few years the furfacd becomes fo hard, and the turf fo flrong, that it deffroys the lucern before the plants have arrived at their greateft: perfection: fo that we cannot hope to cultivate lueern with fueeefs, unlefs we fall upon fome mediod of de- ftroying the natural grafs, and prevent the furfaee from becoming hard and impenetrable. This cannot be done effectually by any other means than horfe-hoeing. This method was firft propofed by Mr Tull, and afterwards pra'Cttfed fueeefsfully by M. de Chateauvieux near Geneva. It may be of ufe therefore to give ft. view of that gen¬ tleman’s method of cultivating lueern. He does not mention any thing particular as to the manner of preparing the land; but only obferves in ge¬ neral, that no pains ihould be {pared in preparing it. He tried the fowing of lucern both in rows upon the beds where it was intended to {land, and likewife the fowing it in a nurfery, and afterwards tranfplanting it into the beds prepared for it. He prefers tranfplanting; beeaufe, when tranfplanted, part of the tap-root is cut off, and the plant {hoots out a number of lateral branches from the cut part of the root, which makes it fpread its roots nearer the furfaee, aftd confequently renders it more eafily cultivated: befides, this cireumflanee adapts it to a {hal¬ low foil, in whieh, if left in its natural ftate, it would not grow. The tranfplanting of lucern is attended with niany ad¬ vantages. The land may be prepared in the fummer for receiving the plants from the niirl’ery in autumn; by which means the field muft be in a mueh better fituation than if the feed had been fown upon it in the fpring. By tranf¬ planting, the rows ean be made more regular, and the intended diftances more exactly obferyed; and confe- R quently"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"66 AGRICULTURE. quently the hoeing can be performed more perfectly, and with lefs expence. M. Chateauvieux likewife tried the lucern in Angle beds three feet wide, with Angle rows; in beds three feet nine inches wide, with double rows ; and in beds four feet three inches wide, with triple rows. The plants in the Angle rows were Ax inches afunder, and thofe in the double and triple rows were about eight or nine inches. In a courfe of three years he found, that a Angle row produced more than a triple row of the fame length. The plants of lucern, when cultivated by tranfplantation, fhould be at leaft Ax inches afunder, to allow them room for extending their crowns. He further obferves, that the beds or ridges ought to be raifed in the middle; that a fmall trench, two or three inches deep, fhould be drawn in the middle; and that the plants ought to be fet in this trench, covered with earth up to the neck. He fays, that if the lucern be fown in fpring, and in a warm foil, it will be ready for tranfplanting in September; that, if the weather be too hot and dry, the tranfplanting fhould be delayed till Oftober; and that, if the weather be unfavourable during both thefe months, this operation muft be delayed till fpring. He further direfts, that the plants fhould be carefully taken out of the nurfery, fo as not to damage the roots; that the roots be left only about Ax or feven inches long; that the green tops be cut off within about two inches of the crown; that they be put into water as foon as taken up, there to remain till they are planted; and that they fhould be planted with a planting-flick, in the f^me man¬ ner as cabbages. He does not give particular direftions as to the times of horfe-hoeing; but only fays in general, that the in¬ tervals fhould be flirred once in the month during the whole time that the lucern is in a growing flate. He likewife obferves, that great care ought to be taken not to fuffer any weeds to grow among the plants, at leaft for the Arft two or three years; and for this purpofe, that the rows, as well as the edges of the intervals where the plough cannot go, fhould be weeded by the hand. _ Of the Culture of Potatoes. The potatoe is one of the moft ufeful roots that are cultivated in this country, and is raifed in a very differ¬ ent manner from any of the other roots. It has a num¬ ber of eyes in it, each of which produce a feparate plant. The largeft potatoes are the beft for feed; becaufe, when cut according to the eyes, and properly fown, the plants are not in danger of crowding each other. The plant fends out roots in every direction to a conAderable di¬ ftance, and upon thefe the potatoes are formed. There are feveral kinds both of the white and red po¬ tatoes. They fucceed beft in a light dry foil; and though there be but a fmall mixture of loam in it, if to¬ lerably rich and properly cultivated, it feldom fails to produce a good crop. But a good crop is not to be ex- pedted from a ftiff wet foil, unlefs it be laid up in ridges fo as to make it dry, and a conAderable quantity of dung laid on to render it open. When the crop of potatoes is the chief point in view. the land fhould have a ploughing before winter, efpe- cially if the foil be not very free and open. If dung be neceffary, the proper time for laying it on is before this ploughing. When the potatoes are to be planted, which may be done any time in March or beginning of April; the land muft again be ploughed in narrow furrows, and the potatoes dropped into every fecond furrow. But if the land be open and very loofe, they may be dropped into every furrow; and as the plough opens the furrow for the fecond row, it buries the Arft row at a proper depth. The furrow fhould not be very deep ; and two horfes are fufficient. It is better in this cafe to make the horfes go a-breaft than in a, line; becaufe, as one of them only goes in the furrow, the potatoes are not fo liable to be hurt or difplaced. This method of planting them by the plough is greatly preferable to the dibble or plant¬ ing-flick. When a fmall quantity is intended to be cultivated, they may be planted with the fpade. A fmall crofs- trench or furrow fhould be opened with the fpade at the end of the ridge. Into this furrow drop the potatoes at proper diftances; and, in making the next furrow, the roots laid in the Arft will be covered in the fame man¬ ner as is done by the plough. According to the diftance of the rows made by the plough, the diftance of the plants in the rows fhould be regulated: One plant in a fquare foot is fufficient to al¬ low them to be properly hoed. When planted in every fecond furrow ploughed narrow, the rows will be about 12 or 14 inches afunder. The plants may be placed at the fame diftance in the rows. It is unneceflary to harrow the land after the po¬ tatoes are planted: This operation may be delayed till the weeds appear, which gives the farmer an opportunity of deftroying them without any additional labour. Tho’ potatoes be planted early in the fpring, or even before winter, they do not come up till May. Before that time the weeds are far advanced; and, if they be not deftroyed by the harrows, the land muft be hoed. Indeed, the goodnefs of the crop depends fo much upon preventing the weeds from coming to any height, that it is necefia- ry to hoe potatoes frequently. If the rows be wide, a kind of breaft-hoe may be ufed to throw the earth a lit¬ tle on each Ade, by which it will be raifed about the plants. When two or three plants are in one piece, as often happens in light land, they fhould be cleaned with the hand at the root, and only one ftalk left to-each plant. This not only gives air to the roots, but alfo prevents much of the nourifhment from going into the llalks. When the hulk that contains the feed, or the apple, as it is commonly called, is completely formed, the ftalks may be cut down and given to cows.- Milk-cows have been tried with this food •, they eat it very freely, and it gives no bad flavour to the milk. The time of taking up potatoes is commonly regulated by the market. But, if nothing be in view but the largenefs of the crop, they ought to Hand till Odtober, or as long as they can be conveniently taken up before the froft fets in. The moft expeditious method of taking them up is by the plough: Eight or nine perfons to attend"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"T U R E. A G R I C t attend the plough are fufficient. After the field is once ploughed, it ought to be harrowed, by which fome of the potatoes will be raifed ; and, when thefe are gather¬ ed, it Ihould be ploughed a fecond time. Of the Culture of Turnips. Turnips have been long cultivated in England, and, in fome places, are eftee'med one of the mod valuable crops that can be raifed. The trials made in Scotland have been very fuccefsful, which gives great encourage¬ ment to proceed. The goodnefs of the crop depends more on the open- nefs of the foil than its richnefs. Land newly broke up is particularly proper for turnips. Though this kind of land be naturally poor, yet, with the affiftance of a lit¬ tle dung, it feldom fails to produce an excellent crop. The land intended for turnips (hould be ploughed and laid up in ridges before winter, that it may have the benefit of the froft. This winter-ploughing, however, is unneceflary when the land is dry and light: The fpring is early enough for this kind of land. It may get a fecond ploughing in the end of May, and a third in the middle or end of June, when the feed is to be fown. Though three ploughings are here mentioned, no particular number is intended ; for the land ought to be ploughed over and over, till it be thoroughly pul- verifed. If dung be ufed, it Ihould be well rotted, and laid on before the laft ploughing. Turnip-feed is ufually fown by the hand; and about half a pound is fufficient for an acre. It Ihould be mix¬ ed with land; that it may be fcattered the more equally. But fowing by a drill is better than fowing by the hand, as, in this way, the plants can be more eafily hoed, and thinned. Turnips Ihould be hoed as foon as the plants can be eafily diftinguilhed; for they gsow quickly, and, if they meet with any obftrudiion from weeds, they are apt to become fickly* and, when this happens, they can never be recovered fo as to produce a good crop. Turnips may be cultivated with great fuccefs by the new husbandry. They have been tried in jingle, double, and triple^ rows, and, in alleys, from four to fix feet wide, according to the fituation of the land. The poor¬ er the land is, or the more difficult to be reduced, the alleys ought to be the wider. After the ridges are form¬ ed, the turnip Ihould be drilled upon the crowns; and, as foon as they come up, and are paft all danger from the fly, they Ihould be horfe-hoed. The turnip is proper food, either for Iheep or black cattle. When the land is dry and needs manure, the fheep may be folded on it: But the fold muft be removed every day; for it is improper to allow them to eat more at once than they can confume in that time. When the land is wet, or very rich, the turnip may be pulled, and the fheep fed with them on another field that needs manure. But, when defigned for black cattle, they muft be pulled up and given them, either in ftalls or in another field, ■ as the farmer fhall find mod conve¬ nient. Of the Culture of Carrot. The carrot is but rarely cultivated in our fields : In¬ deed, the prefent market does not encourage the cultiva¬ tion of this plant. But they have lately been found to be excellent food for horfes; they eat them greedily, and are well fed by them. Carrots are not difficult to raife a very fmall field is fufficient, and the trial may eafily be made by any farmer, at a very fmall expence. The beft crops of carrots, in our gardens, are produ¬ ced by trenching. When the foil is hard below, though it be well dunged, it does not produce a good crop. Whenever the roots reach the hard foil, they become forked, i. e. the roots divide, which prevents them from growing large. Trenching makes the earth deep, and, by throwing what was on the furface into the bottom of the trench, lays good foil below for the roots to extend themfelves into. Something like this muft be done in our fields before we can expert a good crop. M. de Chateauvieux tried to raife a crop of carrots by the horfe-hoeing hufbandry, and was very fuccefsful. He fowed them in beds fix feet broad, on the 4th of May. He ftirred the alleys with the fpade on the 15 th and 27th of July, and a third time on the 6th of Septem¬ ber. They were digged up on the 8th of November, meafured from 18 to 25 inches in length, and from two to four in diameter, and weighed from 25 to 33 ounces. Land that has a hard bottom of clay or till is improper; and it is vain to expert that> fuch land can be prepared for carrots by the plough, without great trouble and ex¬ pence. But, when land has a foft bottom, a good crop of carrots may be raifed at a fmall expence by horfe- hoeing. As the feed, in this country, muft be fown in March, the land Ihould get a ploughing before winter, and be laid out in beds or ridges of the breadth propofed when the carrots are to be fown; the furrows betwixt thefe' ridges Ihould be made as deep as poffible, becaufe it is upon thefe furrows that the rows of carrots are to be fown. A fecond ploughing in winter fliould reverfe the firft, and turn the furrows into crowns; and,, before the carrots are fown, one bout of the plough may raife the crown of the ridge ftill higher. Upon thefe crowns the feed muft be foVn out of the hand, into a fmall trench, drawn as ftraight as poffible, and covered with a rake. When the weeds firft appear, the remaining part of the ridges may be ploughed out, turning the earth to the rows, and taking care not to go fo near as to cover the plants. Before the feed is fown, which is fome time in- March, inftead of ploughing the whole ridge, the plough Ihould only go once about on the crown, to prevent the bad effedls of too much moifture. As foon as the plants can be eafily diftinguilhed,- they Ihould be hand-hoed, and thinned where they ftand too thick; and after this the alleys muft be regularly hoed, as dire died in the culture of turnips. It is natural to expedl, that carrots raifed in this way Ihould be freer from worms, and much better every way,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"<53 A G R I CJ U way, than thofe railed in our gardens, except fuch as are fown upon newly trenched ground. Sect. VI. Principles and Advanta¬ ges of the New Husbandry. The general principles of the new hulbandry may be reduced to two, viz.- the promoting the growth of plants by hoeing, and the laving of feed; both of which are equally profitable to the farmer. But, before illustrating thefe principles and advanta¬ ges, it will be necelTary to defcribe the inflruments that are commonly ufed in cultivating land by this new me¬ thod. Plate IX. fig. i. is a marking plough. The principal -rife of this plough is to Itreight and regulate the ridges. The firlt line is traced by the eye, by means of three poles, placed in a Itreight line. The plough draws the firlt furrow iti the direction of this line; and, at the fame time, with the tooth A, fixed in the block of wood near the end of the crofs-poll or Aider B B, marks the breadth of the ridge at the diftance intended. .The ploughman next traces the fecond line or rutt made by the tooth, and draws a fmall furrow along it; and con¬ tinues in this manner till the whole field is laid out in {freight and equidiftant ridges. —Fig; 2. is a plough for breaking up lee, or turning up the bottom of land when greatly exhaufted. By its con- ftru&ion, the width and depth of the furrows can be re¬ gulated to a greater certainty than by any other hitherto known in this country. Its appearance is heavy; but two horfes are fufficient to plough with it in ordinary free land; and'only four are necefiary in the ftiffeft clay- foils. This plough is likewife eafily held and tempered. A, is the fword fixed in the fixers B» which runs thro’ a mortoife at the- end of the beam E, and regulates the depth of the furrow, by railing or depreffing the beam ; it is fixed by putting the pin D, through the beam and fword, and is moveable at E. t—F ig. 3. is a jointed break harrow with 24 teeth Aia- ped like coulters, and Handing at about an angle of 80 degrees. By this inftrumentthe land is finely pulverifed, and prepared for receiving the feed from the drill. It requires four horfes in ftiff, and two in open land. This harrow is likewife ufed for levelling the ridges; this is done by prefiing it down by the handles where the ridge is high, and railing it up when low. —Fig. 4. is an angular weeding harrow, which may follow the break when necefiary. The feven hindmoft teeth lliould Hand at a more acute angle than the reft, in order to colleft the weeds, which the holder can drop at pleafure, by railing the hinder part, which is fixed to the body of the harrow by two joints. —Fig. 5. is a pair of harrows with lhafts. This har- rowis ufed for covering the feed in the drills, the horfe going in the furrow. —Fig. 6. is a drill-plough, conftruded in fuch a man¬ ner as to fow at once two rows of beans, peafe, or wheat. L T U R E. This machine is eafily wrought by two horfes. A, is the happer for containing the feed ; B, circular boxes for receiving the feed from the happer; C C, two fquare boxes which receive the feed from fmall holes in the cir¬ cular boxes, as they turn round; and laft of all, the feed is dropped into the drills through holes in the fquare boxes, behind the coulters D. The cylinder E fol¬ lows, which, together with the wheel F, regulates the depth of the coulters, and covers the feed; the harrow G comes behind all, and covers the feed more completely.

A A the mold-boards, which may be raifed or deprefied at pleafure, according as the farmer wants to throw the earth higher or lower upoh the roots. Advantages of Horfe-hoeing. The advantages of tillage before fowing have already been pointed out. In this place we muft, confine our- felves to the utility of tillage after fowing. This kind of tillage is moft generally known by the name of horfe- hoeing. Land fowed with wheat, however well it may be culti¬ vated in autumn, finks in the winter; the particles get nearer together, and the weeds rife; fo that in fpring, the land is nearly in the fame fituation as if it never had been ploughed. This, however, is the feafon when it ftiouId branch and grow with moft vigour; and cohfe- quently ftands moft in need of ploughing or hoeing, to deftroy the weeds, to fupply the roots With frefii earth, and, by dividing anew the particles of the foil, to allow the roots to extend and colled nouriftiment. It is well known, that, in gardens, plants grow with double vigouf after being hoed or tranfplanted. If plants growing in Arable land could be managed with eafe and fafety in this manner, it is natural to exped, that their growth would be promoted accordingly. Expe¬ rience ftiows, that this is not only practicable, but at¬ tended with many advantages. In the operation of hoeing wheat, though fome. of the roots be moved or broke, the plants receive no injury;, for this very circumftance makes them fend forth a greater number of roots than formerly, which enlarge their pa- fture, and confequently augment their growth. Sickly wheat has often recovered its vigour after a good hoeing, efpecially when performed in weather not very hot or‘dry. Wheat, and fuch grain as is fown before winter, re¬ quires hoeing more than oats, barley, or other grain fown in the fpring ; for, if the land has been Well ploughed before the fowing of fpring-corn, it neither has time to harden nor to produce many weeds, not having been expofed to the winter’s fnow and rain."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"TlatelS. vv\\ *** ' //><// f. . '"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"A G II I G U Of Sowing. As, in the practice of the new hufoandry, plants grow with greater vigour than by the old method, the land fhould be fowed thinner. It is this principle of the new hufbandry that has been chiefly objected to; for, upon obferving the land occupied.by a fmall number of plants, people are apt to look upon all the vacant fpace as loft. But this prejudice will foon be removed, when it is con- fidered, that, in the beft land cultivated in the common method, and fown very thick, each feed produces but. one or two ears; that, in the fame land fown thinner, every feed produces two or three ears ; and that a fingle feed fometimes produces eighteen or twenty ears. In the common method, as there are many more plants than can find fufficient nourifliment, and as it is impoffible to aflift them by hoeing, numbers die before they attain maturity, the greateft part remain fickly and drooping; and thus part of the feed is loft. On the con¬ trary, in the new method, all the plants have as much food a» they require; and as they are, from time to time, affifted by hoeing, they become fo vigorous as to equal in their production the numdrous, but fickly plants cultivated in tire common method. Of Hoeing. The new hufbandry is abfolutely impracticable in lands that are not eafily ploughed. Attempting to cul¬ tivate land according to this hufbandry, without attend¬ ing to this circumftance, that it is practicable in no land, excepting fuch as have already been brought into good tilth by the old method, has gone far to make it con¬ temptible iu many places. When a field is in good tilth, it fhould be fown.fo thin as to leave fufficient room for the plants to extend their roots. After being well ploughed and harrowed, it mud be divided into rows, at the diftance of 30 inches from one another. On the fides of each <tf thefe rows, two rows of wheat mud be fowed fix inches diftant from each other. By this means there will be an interval of two feet wide betwixt the' rows, and every plant will have room enough to extend its roots, and to fupply it with food. The intervals will likewife be fufficient for allowing the earth to be hoed or tilled without injuring the plants in the rows; The firft hoeing, which fhould be given before the winter, is intended to drain away the wet, and to dif- pofe the earth to be mellowed by the frofts. Thefe two ends will be anfwered by drawing two fmall furrows at a little diftance from the rows, and throwing the earth taken from the furrows into the middle of the intervals. This firft hoeing fhould be .given when the wheat is in leaf. The fecond hoeing, which is intended to make the plants branch, fhould be given after the hard frofts- are over. To do this with advantage, after ftirring the earth a little, near the rows, the earth which was thrown in the middle of the intervals fhould be turned back in¬ to the furrows. This earth, having been mellowed by the Vol. I. No. 3. 3 L T IT R E. 6 9 winter, fupplies the plants with excellent food, and makes the roots extend. The third hoeing, which is intended to invigorate the ftalk, fhould be given when the ears of the corn begin to fhew themfelves. This hoeing may, however, be very flight. But the laft hoeing is of the greateft importance, as it enlarges the grain, and makes the ears fill at their ex¬ tremities. This hoeing ihould be given when the wheat is in bloom ; a furrow muft be drawn in the middle of the interval, and the earth thrown to the right and left on the foot of the plants. This fupports the plants, prevents them from being laid, and prepares the ground for the next fowing, as the feed is then to be put in the middle of the ground that formed the intervals. By this fucceifive tillage, or hoeing, good crops will be obtained, provided the weather is not very unfavour¬ able. But as ftrong, vigorous plants are longer before they arrive at maturity, corn railed in the new way is later in ripening than any other, and muft therefore be fown earlier. In order to prepare the intervals for fowing again, fome well-rotted dung may be laid in the deep furrows made in the middle of the intervals; and this dung muft be covered with the earth that was before thrown to¬ wards the rows of wheat. But, if the land does not re¬ quire mending, the deep furrow is filled without any dung. This operation fhould be performed immediately after harveft, that there may be time to give the land a flight ftirring before the rows are fowed ; which fhould occupy the middle of the fpace which formed the inter¬ vals during the laft crop. The intervals of the fecond year take up the fpace occupied by the ftubble of the firft. Suppofing dung to be neceflary, which is denied by many, a very fmall quantity is fufficient ; a fingle layer, put in the bottom of each furrow, will be enough. Summary .cf the Operations necejfary in execu- tingtheNew Husbandry with t/je Plough. 1. It is indifpenfibly neceflary that the farmer be provided with a drill and hoe-plough. 2. The new hufbandry may be begun either with the winter or fpring corn. 3. The land muft be prepared by four good plough- ings, given at different times, from the beginning of A- pril to the middle of September. 4. Thefe ploughings muft be done in dry weather, to prevent the earth from kneading. 5. The land muft be harrowed in the fame manner as if it were fowed in the common way. 6. The rows of wheat fhould be fowed very ftraight. 7. When the field is not very large, a line muft be ftrained acrofs it, by which a rill may be traced with a hoe for the horfe that draws the drill to go in; and, when the rows are fown, fifty inches muft be left betwixt each rill. But, when the field is large, flakes at five feet diftance from each other, muft be placed at the two ends. The workman muft then trace a fmall furrow, . S with"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"7 o A G . R I C U with a plough that has no mold-board, for the horfe to go in that draws the drill, diredting himfelf with his eye by the ftakes. 8. The fowing fhould be Unified about the end of September, or beginning of Odlober. 9. The furrows muft be traced the long way of the land, that as little ground as poffible may be loft in head¬ lands! - 10. The rows, if it can be done, fhould run down the'Hope of the land, that the water may get the ea- fier off. 11. The feed-wheat muft be plunged into a tub of lime-water, and ftirred, that the light corn may come to the furface and be flammed off. 12. The feed muft next be fpread on a floor, and fre¬ quently ftirred, till it is dry enough to run through the valves of the happer of the drill. 13. To prevent fmut, the feed may be put into a lye of afhes and lime. 14. After the happers of the drill are filled, the horfe muft go fldwly along the furrow that was traced. That a proper quantity of feed may be fown, the a - perture of the happer muft be.fuited to the fize of the grain. 15. As the drill is feldom well managed at firft, the field fhould be examined after the corn has come up, and the deficiencies fupplied. 16. Stiff lands that retain the wet, muft be ftirred or hoed in Odlober. This fhould be done by opening a fur¬ row in the middle of the intervals, and afterwards filling it up by a furrow drawn on each fide, which will raife the earth in the middle of the intervals, and leave two fmall furrows next the rows, for draining off the water, which is very hurtful to wheat in winter. 17. The next ftirring muft be given about the end of March, with a light plough. In this ftirring, the fur¬ rows made to drain the rows muft be filled up by earth from the middle of the intervals.

Some time in May, the rows muft be evened, which, though troublefome at firft, foon becomes eafy, as the' weeds are foon kept under by tillage. 19. In June, juft before the wheat is in bloom, ano¬ ther ftirring muft be given with the plough. A deep furrow muft be made in the middle of the intervals, and the earth thrown upon the fides.of the rows. 20. When the wheat is ripe, particular care moft be ta¬ ken in reaping it, to trample as little as pofiible on the ploughed land. 21. Soon after the wheat is carried off the field, the . intervals muft be turned up with the plough, to prepare them for the feed. The great furrow in the middle >muft not only be filled, but the earth raifed as much as poffible in the middle of the intervals. 22. In September, the land muft be again fowed with a drill, as above directed. 23. In October, the ftubble muft be turned in for forming the new intervals; and the fame management muft be obferved as diredled in the firft year. We pretend not to determine whether the old or new ■ hufbandry be preferable in every country. With regard to this point, the climate, the fituation of particular land, {kill and dexterity in managing the machinery, the comparative expcnce in railing crops, and many other circumltances, muft be accurately attended to before a determination can be given. One obferva- tion, however, may be made in favour of the new huf¬ bandry:—Though the particular modes of cultivating land by it are perhaps too limited to be univerfally ad¬ opted ; yet it has been of great ufe in railing fufpicions concerning the old method, and in turning the views of philofophers and farmers towards improving in general. Many real improvements in agriculture have been the confequcnces of thefe fufpicions; and as this fpirit of inquiry remains in full vigour, particularly in our own country, a folid foundation is laid for expedling ftill fur¬ ther improvements in this ufeful art.

A LGEBRA is a general method of computation by f 1 certain figns and fymbols, which have been con¬ trived for this purpofe, and found convenient. It is called an Universal Arithmetic, and proceeds by operations and rules fimilar to thofe in common arith¬ metic, founded upon the fame principles. But as a number of fymbols are admitted into this fcience, being neceflary fer giving it that extent and generality which is its greateft excellence, the import of thofe fymbols mult be clearly ftated. In geometry, lines are reprefented by a line, triangles by a triangle, and other figures by a figure of the fame kind: But, in algebra, quantities are reprefented by the lame letters of. the alphabet; and various figns have ♦ been*"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Bo A L G E been imagined for reprefentiftg their affeftions, relations, and dependencies. The relation of equality is.expreffcd by the fign = ; thus, to exprefs that the quantity reprefented by a is equal to that which is reprefented by b, we write a — b. But if vve would exprefs that a is greater than b, we write a ~ b ; and if we would exprefs algebraically that a is le's than b , we write a b. Quantity is what is made up of parts, or is capa¬ ble of being greater or lefs. It is increafed by addition, and diminillied by fubtrattion ; which are therefore the . two primary operations that relate to quantity. Hence it is, that any quantity may be fuppofed to enter into al¬ gebraic computations two different ways, which have con¬ trary effefts; either as an increment , or as a decrement; that is, as a quantity to be added, or as a quantity to be fubtrafted. The fign + {plus) is the mark of addition, and the fign — {minus) of fublrattion. Thus the quan¬ tity being reprefented by a, + a imports that a is to be added, or reprefents an increment ; but, — a imports that a is to be fubtracled, and reprefents a decrement. When feveral fuch quantities are joined, the figns ferve to fhew which are to be added and which are to be fub- trafted. Thus •+ ■ a + b denotes the quantity that arifes when a and b are both confidered as increments, and therefore expreffes the fum of a and b. But + a — b denotes the quantity that arifes, when from the quantity 4'the quantity b is fubtt'afted ; and expreffes the excefs of a above b. When a is greater than b, then a — b is itfelf an increment; when a — b, then a — b — o ; and when a is lefs than b, then a — b is itfelf a decrement. As addition and fubtraftion are oppofite, or an incre¬ ment is oppofite to a decrement, there is an analogous oppofition between the affeftions of quantities that are confidered in the mathematical fciences; as, between excefs and defeft ; between the value of effefts or mo¬ ney due to a man, and money due by him. When two quantities, equal in refpeft of magnitude, but of thofe oppofite kinds, are joined together, and conceived to take place in the fame fubjeft, they deftroy each other’s effeft, and their amount is nothing. Thus, tool, due to a man and i oo /. due by him balance each other, and in eftimating his flock may be both neglefted. When two unequal quantities of thofe oppofite qualities are join¬ ed in the fame fubjeft, the greater prevails by their dif¬ ference. And, when a greater quantity is taken from a leffer of the fame kind, the remainder becomes of the oppofite kind. A quantity that is to be added is likewife called a po¬ sitive quantity ; and a quantity to be fubtrafted is faid to be negative ; They are equally real, but oppofite to each other, fo as to take away each other’s effeft, in a- ny operation, when they are equal as to quantity. Thus, 3 — 3 = o, and a — a — o. But though + a and «*- a are equal as to quantity, we do not fuppofe in al¬ gebra that + a — — a ; becaufe, to infer equality in this fcience, they muff not only be equal as to quantity, but of the fame quality, that in every operation the one may have the fame effeft as the other. A decrement may be equal to an increment, but it has in all operations a con¬ trary effeft ; a motion downwards may be equal to a no- B R A. tion upwards; and the depreffion of a ftar below the ho- rifon may be equal to the elevation of a liar above it: But thofe pofitions are oppofite, and the diflance of the ftars is greater than if one of them was at the horizon, fo as to have no elevation above it, or depreffion below it. It is on account of this contrariety, that a negative quan¬ tity is faid to be lefs than nothing, becaufe it is oppo¬ fite to the pofitive, and diminifhes it when joined to it; whereas the addition of o has no effeft. But a negative is to be confidered no lefs as a real quantity than the po¬ fitive. Quantities that have no fign prefixed to them are understood to be pofitive. The number prefixed to a letter is called the numeral coefficient, and ftiews how often the quantity reprefented by the letter is to be taken. Thus 2 a imports that the quantity reprefented by a is to be taken twice; 3 a that it is to be taken thrice; and fo on. When no number is prefixed, unit is underftood to be the coefficient. Thus 1 is the coefficient of a or of b. Quantities are faid to be like or ftmilar, that are re¬ prefented by the fame letter or letters equally repeated. Thus + 3 a and — 5 a are like; but a and b, or a and a a are unlike. A quantity is faid to confift of as many terms as there are parts joined by the figns + or —; thus a + b con- fifts of two terms, and is called a binomial; a -\\-b + c confifts of three terms, and is called a trinomial.

The fame rule for the ligns is to be obferved in divi- fion as in multiplication ; that is, “ If the figns of the “ dividend and divifor are like, the fign of the quotient “ mud be -f; if they are unlike, the fign of the quo- “ tient mult be —.” This will be eafily deduced from the rule in multiplication, if you coofider, that the quo¬ tient mufi be fuch a quantity as, multiplied by the divi¬ for, lhall give the dividend. The general rule in divifion is, “ to place the dividend “ above a fmall line, and the divifor under it,'expun* “ ging any letters that may be found in all the quanti- ** ties of the dividend and divifor, and dividing the co- “ efficients of all the terms by any common meafure.” Thus, when you divide 10 a b + 15 a c by 20 a d, ex¬ punging a out of all the teims, and dividing all the ll+lS . and 4 * coefficients by 5, the quotient is 2 b)ab + bb “ Powers of the fame root are divided by fubtrafting “ their exponents, as they are multiplied by adding “ them.” Thus, if you divide a s by a 1 , the quotient is a'— * or a 3 . And b 6 divided by £ 4 gives b 6 r - 4 or b * ; and a 7 b divided by a 1 b 3 gives a % b 1 for the quotient. “ If the quantity to be divided is compound, then “ you mull range Its parts according to the dimenfions of “ fome one of its letters, as in the following example.” In the dividend a 1 + 2 a b + b*, they are ranged ac¬ cording to the dimenfions of a, the quantity a 1 , where a is of two dimenfions, being placed firfi, 2 a b, where it is of one dimenfion, next, and b 1 , where a is not at all, being placed lad. “ The divifor mull be ranged •* according to the dimenfions of the fame letters; then “ you are to divide the firfi term of the dividend by the “ firfi term of the divifor, and to fet down the quotient, *« which, in this example, is a ; then multiply this quo- «« tient by the whole divifor, and fubtraft the produft “ from the dividend, and the remainder lhall give a new “ dividend, which, in this example, is a b + b 1 . ” a + b) a* +2ab +b* (a + b a' + a b a b + b' a b + b* o . o. “ Divide the firfi term of this new dividend by the “ firfi term of the divifor, and fet down the quotient, “ (which in this example is b), with\" its proper fign. “ Then multiply the whole divifor by-this part of the “ quotient, and fubtraft the produft from the new divi- “ dend; and if there is no remainder, the divifion is fi- “ nilhed:” If there is a remainder, you are to proceed after the fame manner, till no remainder is left; or till it appear that there will be always fome remainder.

It often happens, that the operation may be continued without end, and then you have an infinite feries for the quotient; and by comparing the firjl three or four terms you may find what law the terms obferve: by which means , without any more divifion , you may continue the quotient as far as you pleafe. Thus, in dividing 1 by x — a , you find the quotient to be i+a + aa+aaa + a a a a + <bc. which feries can be continued as far as you pleafe, by adding the powers of a. The operation is thus: l — a) I (1 + a + a a + a a a, &e. + a -}- a —— a a + a a + a a — a a a + a a a + aaa — a a a a -f- a a a a, foe.

In the laft chapter it was faid, that the quotient of any quantity a, divided by i, is expreffed by placing a a- bove a fmall line, and b under it, thus, -y. Thefe quotients are alfo called fradians ; and the dividend, or quantity placed above the line, is called the numerator of the fraction, and the divifor, or quantity placed un¬ der the line, is called the denominator. “ If the numerator of a fradion be equal to the de- “ nominator, then the fraction is equal to unity. Thus, “ and -y are equal to unit. If the numerator is “ greater than the denominator, then the fradion is “ greater than unit.” In both thefe cafes, the fradion is called improper. But “ if the numerator is left than “ the denominator, then the fradion is lefs than unit,” and is called proper. Thus, is an improper frac¬ tion ; but ~ and - 1 - are proper fradions.

Therefore a — b is the greateft common meafure re¬ quired. The ground of this operation is, That any quantity that meafures the divifor and the remainder (if there is any) muft alfo meafure the dividend; becaufe the dividend is equal to the fum of thedivifor multiplied into the quo¬ tient, and of the remainder added together. Thus, in the laft example, a—b meafures the divifor a* — b z , „ and the remainder —- 2 a b + 2 b ; it muft therefore like- wife meafure their fum a* —'2 a b + b*.

Thus - a - , ^ cannot be reduced lower. Sdc And, numbers whofe greateft common meafure is unit, are faid to be prime to one another. If a vulgar fraflion is to be reduced to a decimal (that is, a fraflion whofe denomination is 10, or any of its powers,) “ anpex as many cyphers as you pleafe to the. “ numerator, and then divide it by the denominator, the ( f quotient ihall give a decimal equal to the vulgar frac-’ “ tion propofed.” Thus, —= .66666, (yc.

The railing of quantities to any power is called invo¬ lution, and any ftmple quantity is involved by multiply¬ ing the exponent by that of the power required, as in the preceding examples. The coefficient mujl alfo be raifed to the fame power by a continual multiplication of itfelf by itfelf, as often as unit is contained in the exponent of the power requi¬ red. Thus the cube of 3 a b is 3 x 3 x 3 x a 1 b 3 = 27 a 3 b 3 . As to the figns. When the quantity to be involved is pojitive, it is obvious that all its powers mujl be pojitive. And, when the quantity to be involved is negative, yet all its powers, whofe exponents are even numbers, mujl be po¬ jitive : for any number of multiplications of a negative, if the number be even, gives a pofitive; fince— x— = +, therefore — x- 1 —x — x — = + x + = +; and — x — x — x — x — x — = + x + x + = +.

Thofe whofe exponents are 2, 4, 6, isc . are pofitive; but thole whofe exponents are 1, 3, $, isc . are negative. The involution of compound quantities is a more diffi¬ cult operation. The powers of any binomial a-\\-b are found by a continual multiplication of it by itfelf, as fol¬ lows : a + b = Root.

The quantity a m exprelfes any power of a in general, the exponent ( m ) being undetermined; and a — m ex- prelfes i-, ora negative power of a of an equal expo- a m ponent: and a m x a — m — a m — m = a° = 1 is their pro¬ duct. a n exprelfes any other power of a ; a m Xa n = a m - \\- n i s t he projduft of the powers a m and a n , and a m — n is their quotient. To raife any fimple quantity to its fecond, third, or fourth power, is to add its exponent twice, thrice, or four times to itfelf; therefore the fecond power of any quantity is had by doubling its exponent, and the third by trebling its exponent; and, in general, the power exprejfed by m of any quantity is had by multiplying the exponent h m, as is obvi us from the multiplicat on of powers.

The powers of b are in the contrary order; it is not found in the firft term, but its exponent in the fe- cond term is unit, in the third term its exponent is 2 \", and thus its exponent increafes, till in the laft term it becomes equal to the exponent of the power required.” . As the exponents of a thus decreafe, and at the fame time thofe of b increafe, “ the fum of their “ exponents is always the fame, and 4s equal to the “ exponent of the power required.” Thus, in the 6th power of a + b, viz. a 6 + 6 a[ b + 15 a 4 b z ■ +• 20 a 3 b 3 + 15 a 1 b* 6 a b 5 + b 6 , the exponents of a decreafe in this order, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,0; arid thofe of b increafe in the contrary order, o, 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And the fum of their exponents in any term is always 6. To find the coefficient of any term, the coefficient of the preceding term being known, you are to “ divide the “ coefficient of the preceding term by the exponent of “ b in the given term, and to multiply the quotient by “ the exponent of a in the fame terra, increafed by u- “ nit.” Thus to find the coefficients of the terms of the 6th power of a + b, you find the terms are a 6 , a* b, a A b \\ a* b*, a z b\\ a bf b 6 ; and you know the coefficient of the firft term is unit •, therefore, according to the rule, the coefficient of the fecond term will be-i-X 5 + 1 = 6; that of the third term will be ,-^-X 4 + 1 = 3X5 = 15; that of the fourth term will be X 3 + 1 = 5 X 4 = 20 ; and thofe of the following will be 15, 6, 1, agreeable to the preceding table.

The roots of fingle quantities are eafily extracted “ by dividing their expo- “ nents by the number that denominates the root re- “ quired.” Thus, the fquare root of a 8 is a|- = a 4 ; and the fquare root of a A b s c* is a* £ 4 c. The cube root of a 6 b 5 is b\\—a 1 b ; and the cube root of x 9 y 6 z 1 * is x 1 y 2 z 4 . The ground of this rule is obvious from the rule-for involution. The powers of any root are found by multiplying its exponent by the index that denominates the power} and therefore, when any power is given, the root muft be found by dividing the exponent of the given power by the number that denominates the kind of root that is required. It appears, from what was faid of involution, that “ any power that has a pofitive fign may have either a “ pofitive or negative root, if the root is denominated by any even number.” Thus the fquare-root of may be +a or— a, becaufe +«X+a or —a X—a gives +a* for the product. But if a power have a negative fign, “ no root of it “ denominated by an even number can be be affigned,” fince there is no quantity that multiplied into itfelf an even number of times can give a negative product. Thus thefquare root of— a* cannot be affigned, and is what we call an impoj/ible or imaginary quantity. But if the root to be extracted is denominated bjr an odd number, then fha.ll “ the fign of the root be the fame as the fign of the given number whofe root is required.” Thus the cube root of ■ — a 5 is —a, and the cube root of —a 6 b 5 is —a 1 b. Tf the number that denominates the root required is a divifor of the exponent of the given power, then fhall the root be only a lower power of the fame quantity. As the cube root of a 1 1 is a 4 , the number 3 that denominates the cube root’being a divifor of 12. But if the number that denominates what fort of root is required is not a divifor of the exponent of the given power, “ then the root required fhall have a fraction for its exponent.” Thus the fquare root of a 3 is a^; the cube root of a 5 is alf, and the lquare root of a itfelf is a 4-. Thefe powers that have fractional exponjrts are called imperfect poolers or ftrds ; and are otherwife exprefied by placing the given power within the radical fign tf , and placing above the radical fign the number that deno¬ minates what kind of root is required. Thus c \\—/fa 3 > a\\—fa s ; and dH—tfa m . In numbers the fquare root of 2 is expreffed by 4/ 2, and the cube root of 4 by 4/ 4.

The fquare root of any number is found out after the fame manner. If it is a number under 100, its neareft fquare root is found by the-following table; by which al- fo its cube root is found if.it be under 1000, and is bi¬ quadrate if it be under 10000. jTherootj I 1 ! 1 ? 3| 4 J 5| 6| 71 81 9 (Square j M 1 4 9 i6f 25 1 3-6f 4 x>j 6 4 | 81 Cube | M 8 27! 64*1251 216 343 J 512I 729 (Biquad. | li.l 16 81)25616251 I2y6| 24011 4096)6561 But if it is a number above 100, then its fquare root will confift of two or more figures, which muft be found by different operations by the following R U L E.

Then find the fquare root of the firft part, and it will give the firft figure of BRA. 87 the root; fubtraCt its fquare from that part, and an¬ nex the fecond part of the given number to the re¬ mainder. Then divide this new number (neglecting its laft figure) .by the double of the firft figure of the root, annex the quotient to that double, and multiply the number thence arifing by the faid quotient, and if the product is lefs than your dividend, or equal to it, that quotient fhall be the fecond figure of the root. But if the product is greater than the dividend, you muft take a lefs number for the fecond figure of the root than that quotient.” Much after the fame manner may the other figures of the quotient be found, if there are more points than two placed over the given number. To find the fquare root of 99856, firft point it thus, 99856; then find the fquare root of 9 to be 3, which therefore is. the firft figure of the’root; fubtraCt 9, the fquare of 3, from 9, and to the remainder annex the fe¬ cond part 98, and divide (negleCting the laft figure 8) by the double of 3, or 6, and place the quotient after 6, and then multiply 61 by 1, and fubtraCt the product 61 from 98.

Chap. VIII. Of Proportion. When quantities of the fame kind are compared, it may be confidered, either how much the one is greater than the other, and what is their difference ; or, it may be confidered how many times the one is contained in the other; or, more generally, what is their quotient. The firft relation of quantities is exprefled by their a- rithmetical ratio ; the fecond by their geometrical ra¬ tio. That term whofe ratio is inquired into is called the antecedent , and that with which it is compared is called the confequent. When of four quantities the difference betwixt the firft and fecond is equal to the difference betwixt the third and fourth, thofe quantities are called arithmetical proportionals \\ as the numbers 3, 7, 12, 16. And the quantities a, a-\\-b, e, e-\\-b. But quantities form a fe- ries in arithmetical proportion, when they “ increafe or “ decreafe by the fame conftant difference.” As thefe, a, a+b, a+2b, a+$b, a+qb, &c. x, x — b, x —2 b, tie. or the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, (sc. and 10, 7, 4, 1, —2, —j, —8, &c. In four quantities arithmetically proportional, “ the “ fumof the extremes is equal to the fum of the mean “ terms.”"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"A I, G E B R A. 89 £< terms.” Thus, a, a-\\-b, e, e-\\-b, are arithmetical proportionals, and the fum of the extremes ( a-\\-e-\\-b ) is equal to; the fum of the mean terms («+£+<?)• Hence, to find the fourth quantity arithmetically proportional to any three given quantities; “ Add the fecond and third, “ and from their fum fubtradt the firft term, the remain- “ dcr (hall give the fourth arithmetical proportional re- “ quired. ” In a feries of arithmetical proportionals, “ the fum of “ the firft and laft terms is equal to the fum of any two “ terms equally diflrant from the extremes.” If the firft terms are a, a-\\-b, a+2b, <bc. and the laft term x, the laft term but one will be x —£, N t he laft but two x — 2b, the laft but three x — 3 b, £lc. So that the firft half of the terms, having thole that are equally diftant from the laft term fet under them, will ftand thus; a, a-\\-b, a-\\--ib, a-\\-o,b, a-\\-ifi, . • x, x — b, x—2 b, x —3 b , x —4 b, a-\\-x,a-{-x, a-\\- x, a-{-x, a-{-x, &c. And it is plain, that if each term be added to the term above it, the fum will be a+x, equal to the fum of the firft term a and the laft term x. From which it is plain, that “ the fum of all the terms of an arithmetical pro- “ grcflion is equal to the fum of the firft and laft taken “ half as often as there are terms;” that is, the fum'of an arithmetical progreflion is equal to the fum of the firft and laft terms multiplied by half the number of terms. Thus, in the preceding feries, if n be the number of terms, the fum of all the terms will be a + x X — 2 * The common difference of the terms being b, and b not being found in the firft term, it is plain that “ its “ coefficient in any term will be equal to the number of terms that precede that term ” Therefore in the laft term x you m uft have n —1 X b, fo that x muft be equal to a-\\-n — 1 Xb.

And, if it is required to find a fourth proportional to any three given quantities, “ multiply the fecond by the third, and di- “ vide their produdt by the firft, the quotient fhall give “ the fourth proportional required.” Thus, to find a fourth proportional to a, ar, and b, multiply ar by b, and divide the produdt arb by the firft term a, the quo¬ tient br is the fourth proportional required. In calculations it fometimes requires a little care to place the terms in due order; for which you may ob- ferve the following ' Rule. Firft fet down die quantity that is of the fame kind with the quantity fought; then confider, from the nature of the queftion, whether that which is given is greater or lels than that which is fought; if it is greater, then place the greateft of the other two quan¬ tities on the left hand; but if it is lefs, place the leaft of the other two quantities on the left hand, and the other on the right. Then lhail the terms be in due order; and you are to proceed according to the rule, multiplying the fecond by the .third, and dividing their produdt by the firft. Examp. “ If 30 men do any piece of work in 12 “ days, how many men fhall do it in iS days?” Becaufe it is a number of men that is fought, firft fet down 30, the number pf men that is given : you will eafily fee that the number that is given is greater than the number that is fought; therefore place 18. on the left hand, and 12 on the right; and find a 4th proportional to 18, 30, 12, viz. 20, When a feries of quantities increafe by one common multiplicator, or decreafe by one common divifor, they are faid to be in geometrical proportion continued.

An equation is “ a propofition averting the equality “ of two quantities.” It is exprefled moft common¬ ly by fetting down the quantities, and placing the fign ( =) between them. An equation gives the value of a quantity, when that quantity is alone on one fide of the equation: and that value is known, if all thofe that are on the other fide are _ 4 >< 6 _ known. Thus if I find that x = 3 = 8, I have a known value of x. Thefe are the laft conclufions we are to feek in queftions to be refolved; and if there be only one unknown quantity in a given equation, and only one di- menfion o c it, fuch a value may always be found by the following rules. Rule I. Any quantity may be tranfpofed. from one fide of the equation to the other, if you change its fign. For to take away a quantity from one fide, and to place it with a contrary fign on the other fide, is to fubtradt it from both fides; and it is certain, that “ when from e¬ qual quantities you fubtradl the fame quantity, the re¬ mainders muft be equal.” By this, rule, when the known and unknown quantities are mixed in an equation, you may feparate them by bringing all the unknown to one fide, and the known to the other fide of the equation ; as in the following exam¬ ples, Suppofe 5 x +50=4X+j 6 By Tronfpofit. 51—4*3:5 6—5 o, or, *—6 And if 2x+a xzx+& 2x—-x =zfi-r-ra, or, x~l — ra. Rule. II. Any quantity by which the unknown quantity is multiplied tnay be taken away, if you di¬ vide all the other quantities on both fides pf the equa¬ tion by it. For that is to divide both fides of the equation by the fame quantity, and when you divide equal quantities by the fame quantity, the quotients muft be equal. Thus, If axx=i then x= ; and if 3*+i2=2 7 by Rule ift. 3*=27—12=15 and by Rule 2d. *= V = 5 Rule III. If the unknown quantity is divided by any quantity, that quantity may be taken away if you mul¬ tiply all the other members of the equation by it. Thus, If ^ = »+5 then lhall x=i6-\\-$b By this rule, an equation whereof any part is a frac- - fion may be reduced to an equation that lhall be expref- fed by integers. If there are more fraddons than one in the given equation, you may, by reducing them to a common denominator, and then multiplying all the other terms by that denominator, abridge the calculation thus ; If JL+JL= x -y 5 3 then 3 H±l x = x- 7 and by this Rule 3x-+-5x=i5x—105 and by R. 1. and 2. 1 =15. Rule IV. If that member of the equation that in¬ volves the unknown quantity be a furd root, then the equation is to be reduced to another that lhall be free from any furd, by bringing that member firft to ftand alone upon one fide of the equation, and then taking away the radical fign from it, and railing the other fide of the equation to the power denominated by, the furd.

If any quantity be found on both fides of the equation with the fame fign prefixed, it may be ta¬ ken away from both: Alfo, if all the quantities in the equation are multiplied or divided by the fame quan¬ tity, it may be ftruck out of them all. Thus, If 3x+fc=4+i .. . 3x=et . . . and x= , Rule VIII. Inftead of any quantity in an equation, you may fubftitute another equal to it. Thus if 3x49=24 and 9=9 then 333+9=24 ... x— =5.

If a lefler quantity meafures a greater fo'as to leave no remainder, as 2 a meafures 10.7, being found in it five times, it is faid to be an aliquot part of it, and the greater is faid to be a multiple of the lelfer. The Idler quantity in this cafe is the -greateji common meafure of the two quantities: for as it meafures the greatefl, fo it alfo meafures itfelf, and no quantity can meafure it that is greater than itfelf. When a third quantity meafures any two propofed quantities, as 2.-1 meafures 6 a and 10a, it is faid to be a con, mon meafure of thefe quantities; and if no greater quantity meafure them both, it is called their greateji common meafure. Thofe quantities are faid to be commenfuralle which have any common meafure; but if there can be no quan¬ tity found that meafures them both, they are faid to be incommenfurable ; and if any one quantity be called ra¬ tional , all others that have any common meafure with it, are alfo called rational: But thofe that have no Com¬ mon meafure with it, are called irrational quantities. If any two quantities a and b have any common mea¬ fure x, this quantity x lhall alfo meafure their fum or difference a=+zb. Let x be found in a as many times as unit is found in m, fo that ae=mx, and in b as many times as unit is found in n, fo that b = nx; then fhall az+zb=mx=+znxz=mz+zfiXx ; fo that x fhall be found in a^zb, as often as unit is found in mr^r.n : now fince m and n are integer numbers, merlin mull be an integer number or unit, and therefore x mud meafure a—.b. It is alfo evident, that if x meafure any number as a, it muft meafure any multiple of that number. If it be found in a as many times as unit is found in m fo that a—mx, then it will be found in any multiple of a, as na , as many times as unit is found in mn; for na—mnx. If two quantities a and b are propofed, and b meafure a by the units that are in m (that is, be found in a as many times as unit is found in in) and there be a remain- • der c, and if x be fuppofed to be a common meafure of a and b, it lhall be alfo a meafure of c. For by the fup- pofition a—mb-\\-c , fince it contains b as many times as there are units in m, and there is c befides of remainder. Therefore a — mb—c. Now x is fuppofed to meafure a and b, and therefore it meafures mb, and confequently a — mb, which is equal to c If c meafure b by the units in n, and there be a re¬ mainder d, fo that b=znc+d, and b — nc—d, then lhall x alfo meafure d; becaufe it is fuppofed to meafure b, and it has been proved that it meafures c, and confe¬ quently nc, and b — nc which is equal to d. Whence, as, after fubtra&ing b as often as poflible from a, the re¬ mainder c is meafured by x; and, after fubtra&ing c as often as poflible from b, the remainder d is alfo meafured by x; fo, for the fame reafou, if you fubtrad d as of¬ ten as poflible from c, the remainder (if there be any) muft ftill be meafured by x: and if you proceed, ftill fubtrading every remainder from the preceding remain¬ der, till you find fome remainder, which, lubtraded from the preceding, leaves no further remainder, but exadly meafures it, this laft remainder will ftill be mea¬ fured by x, any common meafure of a and b. The laft of thefe remainders, viz. that which exadly meafures the preceding remainder, muft be a common meafure of a and b: fuppofe that d was this laft remain¬ der, and that it meafured c by the units in r, then lhall c—rd, and we lhall have thefe equations,- a — mb-^-c b=nc+d c = rd.

For it would meafure a — mb, or c, and confequently b — nc, or d, and fo on ; now thefe remain¬ ders decreafe in fuch a manner, that they will neceflarily become at length lefs than x, or any aflignable quantity. For c mud be lefs than \\a ; becaufe c is lefs than b, and therefore lefs than mb, and confequently lefs than 4-c-f- imb, or \\a. In like manner d mull be lefs than \\b ; for d is lefs than c, and confequently lefs than \\d\\-\\nc, or ib . The third remainder, in the fame manner, mull be lefs than 4-c, which is itfelf lefs than \\a : Tlius thefe remainders decreafe, fo that every one is lefs than the half of that which preceded it next but one. Now if from any quantity you take away more than its half, and from the remainder more than its half, and proceed in this manner, yon will come at a' r emainder lefs than any aflignable quantity. It appears therefore, that if the remainders c, d, 8cc. never end, they will become lefs than any aflignable quantity, as x, which therefore can¬ not poflibly meafure them, and therefore cannot be a common ineafurc of a and b. In the fame way the greateft common meafure of two numbers is difcovcred. Unit is a common meafure of all integer numbers, and two numbers are faid to be prime to each other when they have no greater common mea¬ fure than unit; fuch as 9 and 25. Such always are the leaft numbers that can be aflumed in any given pro¬ portion ; for if thefe had any common meafure, then the quotients that would arife by dividing them by that common meafure v/ould be in the fame proportion, and, being lefs than the numbers themfelves, thefe numbers would not be the leaf! in the fame proportion; againft the fuppofition. The leaft numbers in any proportion always meafure any other numbers that are in the A fame proportion. Suppofe a and b to be the leaft of all integer numbers in the fame proportion, and that c and d are other num¬ bers in that proportion, then will a meafure c, and b meafure d. For if a and b are not aliquot parts of c and d, then they muft contain the fame number of the fame kind of parts of c and d ; and therefore dividing a into parts of c, and b into an equal number of like parts of d, and call¬ ing one of the firft 11; , and one of; the latter n ; then as m is to n, fo will the fum of all the m ’s be to the fum of all the n 's ; that is, m : n <1: b, therefore a and b will rot be the leaft in the fame proportion; againft the fuppofition. Therefore a and b muft be aliquot parts of c and d. Hence we fee that numbers which are prime to each other are the leaft in the fame proportion; for if there were others in the fame proportion lefs than them, thefe would meafure them by the fame number, which therefore would be their common meafure againft the fuppofition, for we fuppofed them to be prime to each other. If two numbers a and b are prime to one another, and a third number c meafures one of them a, it will be prime to the other b. For if c and b were not prime tp B R A. each other, they would have a common meafure, which, becaufe it would meafure c, would aifo meafure a, which is meafured by c, therefore a and b would have a com¬ mon meafure, againft the fuppofition. If two numbers a and b are prime to c, then fhall their product ab be alfo prime to c: For if you fuppofe them to have any common meafure as d, and fuppofe that d meafures ab by the units in e, fo that de—ab, then (hall dt a able. But fince d meafures c, and c is fuppofed to be prime to a, it follows that d and a are prime to each other; and therefore d muft meafure b; and yet, fince d is fuppofed to meafure c which is prime to b, it follows that d is aifo prime to b ; that is, d is prime to a number which it meafures, which is abfurd. It follows from the laft article, that if a and c are prime to each other, then a 1 will be prime to c: For by fuppofing that a is equal to b, then ab will be equal to a 1 ; and confequently a 1 will be prime to c. In the fame manner c % will be prime to a. If two numbers a and b are both prime to other two c, d, then (hall the produift ab be prime to the produtft cd; for ab will be prime to c and aifo to d, and there¬ fore, by the fame article, cd will be prime to ab. From this it follows, that if a and c are prime to each other, then (hall a 1 be prime to c 1 , by luppofing, in the laft, that a=h, and c=d. It is aifo evident that a 1 will be prime to c 3 , and in general any power of a to any power of c whatfoever. Any two numbers, a and b, , being given, to find the leaft numbers that are in the fame proportion with them, divide them by their greateft common meafure x, and the quotients c and d Jhall be the leaft numbers in the fame proportion •with a and b. For if there could be any other numbers in that pro- pbrtion lefs than c and d, fuppofe them to be e and ft and thefe being in the fame proportion as a and b would meafure them: And the number by which they would meafure them, would be greater than x, becaufe e and ft are fuppofed lefs than c and d, , fo that x would not be the greateft common meafure of a and b; againft the fuppofition. Let it be required to find the leaft number that any two given numbers, as a and b, can meafure. Firft, “ If “ they are prime to each other, then their produ<ft ab is “ the leaft number which they can both meafure.’’ For if they could meafure a lefs number than ab as r, fuppofe that c is equal to ma, and to nb ; and fince c is lefs than ab, therefore ma will be lefs than ab, and m lefs than b\\ and nb being lefs than ab, it follows that n muft be lels than a ; but fince ma—nb, and confequently a : b : : * : m, and u and b are prime to each other, it would follow that a would meafure n, and b meafure m, that is, a greater number would meafure a lefs, which is abfurd.

The furd /fa’”x = afx ; and in like manner, if a power of any quantity of the fame name with the furd divides the quantity under the radical fign without a re¬ mainder, as here a m divides a m x , and 25 the fquare of 5 divides 75 the quantity under the fign in 4/75 without a remainder, then place the root of that power rationally before the fign, and the quotient under the fign, and thus the furd will be reduced to a more fimple expreflion.

Of the Genesis <7^Resolu t t 1 ok of Equ at i ons' in general; and the number oj Roots an Equation of any Degree may have. After the fame manner, as the higher powers are produced by the multiplication of the lower powers of the fame root, equations of fuperior orders are genera¬ ted by the multiplication of equations of inferior orders involving the fame unknown quantity. And “ an equa- ‘‘ tion of any dimenfioh may be considered as produced “ by the multiplication of as many firople- equations as “ it has dimenlions, or of any other equations what- “ foever, if the fum of their diinenfions is equal to the “ dimenfion of that equation.” Thus,* any cubic equa¬ tion may be conceived as generated by the multiplication of three fimple equations, or of one quadratic and one fimfle equation. A biquadratic is generated by the multiplication of four jimpte equations, or of tnvo qua¬ dratic equations, or, laftly, of one cubic and one ftuple equation. If the equations which you fuppofe multiplied by one another are the fame, then the equation generated will be nothing elfe but fome power of thofe equations, and the operation is merely ivvoluti-n; of which we have treated already.: ariL, when any fuch equation is given, the fimfle equation by whofe multiplication it is produ¬ ced is found by evolution, or the extra/lion of a root. But when the equations that are ftippeftd to be-mid-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"IOI A L G E tiplied by each other are different, then other equations than powers are generated; which to refolve into the fimple equations whence they are generated is a diffe¬ rent operation from involution, and is what is called, the refolution of equations. But as evolution is performed by obferving and tracing back the fteps of involution; fo to difeover the rules for the refolution of equations, we mult carefully obferve their generation. Suppofe the unknown quantity to be x, and its values in any fimple equations to be a, b, c, d, Sec. then thofe fimple equations, by bringing all the terms to one fide, become x — a— o, x — b—o, x — <r=o, Sec. And, the product of any two of thefe, as x—a x x — b=o will give a quadratic equation, or an equation of two dimen- fions. The produd of any three of them, as x — a X x — b X x — c — o, will give a cubic equation, or one of three dimenfions. The produd of any four of them will give a biquadratic equation, or one of four dimenfions, as x — a x x — b x x — exx — d=so. And, in general, “ in the equation produced, the higheft dimenfion of “ the unknown quantity will be equal to the number “ of fimple equations that are multiplied by each o- “ ther.” When any equation, equivalent to this biquadratic x — a X x — by. x — fX* — d — o, is prOpofed to bere- folved, the whole difficulty confi fts in fi nding the fimple equations x — a — o, x— b — o , x — c — o, x — d—o, by whofe multiplication it is produced; for each of thefe fimple equations gives 6ne of the values of x, and one fo- lution of the propofed equation. For, if any of the va¬ lues of x, deduced from thofe fimple equations, be fub- ftituted' in the propofed' equation in place of x, then all the terms of that equation will vanifh, and the whole be found equal to nothing. Becaufe, when it is fuppo- fed th a t xzza, o r x—h, or x—c, orx—d, then the product x — aXx—bXx — cXx— 1 /does vanifh, becaafe one of the fadors is equal to nothin g. There are the refore four ftippofitions that give x — aXx — b y x— cXx—d — o according to the propofed equation; that is, there are four roots of the propofed equation. And after the fame manner, “ any other equation admits of as many “ folutions as there are fimple equations multiplied by “ one another that produce it, or, as many as there are “ units in the higheft dimenfion -of the unknown qflanti- “ ty in the propofed equation.” But as there are no oth r quantities whatfoever be- fides thefe fou r ( , b, c, d,') that fubftituted in. the pro¬ duct x— a X x — bXx — fX*— d , in the place of x, will make the produd vanifh; therefore the equation x — aXx — bXx — cXx — d=o, cannot poflibly have more than thefe four roots, and cannot admit of more folutions than four. If you fubftitute in that product a quantity neither equal to a, nor b, nor c, nor d, which fuppofe e, then fince neither e — a, e — b, e — -c, nor e — d is equal to nothing; their product e — a X e — h X e — c Xe — d cannot be equal to nothing, but mufl be fome real produd: and therefore there is no fuppo- fition be fide one of the fore faid four that gives a juft Vol. I No. 5. 3 B R A. value of x according to the propofed equation. So that it can have no more than thefe four roots. And af¬ ter the fame manner it appears, that “ no equation can “ have more roots than it contains dimenfions of the un- “ known quantity.” To make all this ftill plainer by an example, in numbers; fuppofe the equation to be refolved, to be x 4 iox 3 -f- 3JX 1 — y ox + 24 = o, and that you difeover that this e- quatio n is the fame with the produd of x— 1 X x — 2X x — 3 X X — 4, then you certainly infer that the four values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4; feeing any of thefe numbers placed for x makes that product, and confequently x 4 — iox J +35x*—jox+24, equal to nothing, according to the propofed equation. And it is certain that there can be no other values of x befides thefe four: fince when you fubftitute any other number for x in thofe fadors x —1, x—2, x—*3, x—4, none of the fadors vaniffi ; and therefore their produd cannot be equal to nothing, according to the equation. It may be ufeful fometimes to confider equations as generated from others of an inferior fort befides fimple ones. Thus a cubic equation may be conceived as ge¬ nerated from the quadr -tic x*—/>x-j-y=o, and the fnn- ple equation x— a=o, multiplied by each other j whofe prodad N X ~ ^ — o may exprefs any cubic e- quation whofe roots are the quantity [a) the value of x in the fimple equation, and the two roots of the qua¬ dratic equation, viz. and . as appears from Chap. 12. And, according as thefe roots are real or impoffible, two of the roots of the cubic equation are real or impoffible. In the dodrine of involution, we fhewed, that “ the “ fquare of any quantity, pofitive or negative, is always “ pofitiveand therefore “ the fquare root of a nega- “ tive is impoffible or imaginary/^ For example, 'the if a* is either +a, or —a ; but a *can neither be +a nor — a, but muft be imaginary. Hence is iwiderftood, that “ a quadratic equation may have no impoffible “ expreffion in its coefficients ; and yet, when it is re- “ folved into the fimple equations that produce it, they “ may involve impoffible expreflions.” Thus, the qua¬ dratic equation-x*-j-«*=0 has no impoffible coefficient; but the fi mple equations from which it is produced, viz. x+v'— 3 a =o, an d *— f' — a'— o, both, involve an imaginary quantity; as the fquare —is a red quantity, but its fquare root is imaginary. After the fame manner, a biquadratic equation, when refolved, may give fobr fimple equations, each of which may give an impoffible value for the root: and the fame may be faid of any equation that Can be produced from quadratic equations only, that is, whofe dimenfions are of the even numbers. But, “ a cubic equation (which cannot be generated “ from quadratic equations only, but requires one fim- “ pie equation befides to produce it) if none of its coef- “ ficients are impoffible, will have, at leaft, one real “ root,” the fame with the root of the fimple equation C c whence."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"E B R A; 102 A L G whence it is produced. The fquare of an impoffible quantity may be real, as the fquare cf 4/— a 1 is — a 1 ; but “ the cube of an impoffible quantity is ftill impoffi- “ b!e,” as it ftill involves the fquare root; of a negative : as, of — a % X \\/— a x X \\ f — a x — i f—a 6 — a 1 if — i, is plainly imaginary. From which it appears, that though two Ample equations involving impoffible expreffions, multiplied by one another* may give a produd where no impoffible expreffion may appear; yet “ if three fuch “ fimple equations be multiplied by each other, the im- “ poffible expreffion will not difappear in their product.” And hence it is plain, that though a quadratic equation whbfe coefficients are all real may have its two roots im¬ poffible, yet “ a cubic equation whofe coefficients are * ■ real cannot have all its three roots impoffible.” In general, it appears, that the impoffible expreffions - cannot difappear in the equation produced, but when their number is even; that there are never in any equa¬ tions, whofe coefficients are real quantities, fingle impof- ftble roots, or an odd number of impoffible roots, but “ that the roots become impoffible in pairs, and that “ an equation of an odd number of dimenfions ha3 al- “ ways one real root.” “ The roots of equations are either pofttive or negative, “ according as tlie roots of the fimple equations whence “ they are produced are pofttive or negative.” If you fuppofe x=—, -a, x —— b, x— — c, x ~— d, &c. then ffiall x-|-tf=o, x-\\-b~o, x-ff=o, x-\\-d—o ; and the equation * +«X* -f b X* + cXx + d — o will have its roots, • — a, —b, — c, — d, &c. negative. But to know when the roots of equations are pofttive, and when negative, and hcW many there are of each kind, ffiall be explained in the next chapter. Chap. XV. Of the Sights and Coeffi¬ cients of Equat.ons. When any number of fimple equations are multiplied by each other, it is obvious that the higheft dimension of the unknown quantity in their produd is equal to the number of thofe fimple equations- and the term involving the higheft dimenfion is called the firji term of the equa¬ tion generated by tills multiplication. The term invol¬ ving the next dimenfion of the unknown quantity, lefs than the greateft by unit, is called the fcond term of the equation'; the term involving the next dimenfion of the unknown quantity, which is kfs than the greateft by two, the third term of the equation, be. ; and that term which involves no dimenfion of the unknown quan¬ tity,. but is fome known quantity, is called the lujl term of the equation. “ The number of terms is always greater than the “ h'gheft dimenfion of the unknown quantity by unit.” And when any term is wanting, an afterilk is marked in its place. The figns and coefficients of equations will be understood by confidering the following table, where the fimple equations x -— a, x — b, &c. are multiplied by one another, and produce fucceffively the higher equations. x —<s=o Xx — b=o X \\-Z+ab}= 0 ’ *1«**r*tie- Xx — c=d =x s —<0 -\\-aby — X x x +ac C ~c j -\\-bcj Xx •— d—o Xx — abc— o, a cubic. +*b') + ad Vv r +bc >** +bd J +cdj X x—e=o — abe'y —^acdC ^ ■ x ~^ ma ^ cd=:o > a biqua- l —bcdj , t dra ! ic ' -j -ab — be ■ \\-abcd ^ +ac —abd -J -abce / Xx*+ad —abe -\\-abdf> xx— alcde-C, +ae —,acd -\\-acde'\\ -\\-bc +bd. )xx- !,de 1 —ace \\xx'+ bcdt +be —bed +cdl —bee (a furfolid.) +H —bde +de) — ede- 8 cc. From the infpedion of thefe equations it is plain, that the coefficient of the firft term is unit. The coefficient of the fecond term is the fum of all the roots (a, b, c,*d, e,) having their figns changed . The coefficient of the third term is the Jum of all the predufts that can be made by multipying. any t-vjo of the roots (a, b; c, dfe,) by one another. The coefficient of the fourth term is the fum of all the produfts that can be made by multiplying into one ant- other any three of the roots, ’with their Jigns changed. And after the fame manner all the ether coefficients are formed. The laft term is always the produ ft of all the roots ha¬ ving their fgns changed, multiplied by one another. Although in the table fuch fimple equations only are multiplied by one another as have pofitive roots, it is eafy to fee, that “ the coefficients will be formed ac~ “ Cording to the fame rule when any of the fimple equa- “ tions have negative roots.” And, in general, if x 3 — px x -\\-qx— r=o reprefent any cubic equation, then.ffiall p be the fum of the roots; q the fum of the produds made by multiplying any two of them; r the produd of all the three: and, if— p, -fy, — r, +/, — t, +«, &c. be the coefficients of the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, be. terms of any equation,, then ffiall /-be the fum of all the roots, q the fum of the produds of any two, r the fum of the produds of any three, s the fum of the produds of any four, / the fum of the produds of any five, « the fum of the produds of any fix, ’be. When"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"log A L G ] When therefore any equation is propofed to be refol- ved, it is eafy to find the fum of the roots, (for it is e- qual to the coefficient of the fecond term having its fign changed); or to find the fum of the products that can be made by multiplying any determinate number of them. But it'is alfo eafy <c to find the fum of the fquares, or “ of any powers, of the roots. The fum of the fquares is always /* ■ — iq. For call¬ ing the fum of the fquares B , fince the fum of the roots is p ; and “ the fquare of the fum of any quantities is “ always equal to the fum of their fquares added to “ double the products that can be made by multiplying “ any two of them,” therefore p x =B-\\-2g , and confe- quently B—p % — 2q.

In general therefore, “ B the “ fum'of the fquares of the roots may always be found “ by fubtrading 2q from /* the quantities p and q being always known, fince they are the coefficients in the propofed equation. “ The fum of the cubes of the roots of any equation i s eq ual to p % — 3pq+3r, . o r ^p — pq+3 r -” For B—qXp gives always the excefs of the fum of the cubes of any. quantities above the triple fum of the produ&s that can be made by faulti plying any th ree of t hem. Thus, a 1 J rb 1 -j-c 1 — ab — ac — bcXa-\\-b-\\-c (=B — qXp)= a'+b 1 - \\-c* — 3 abc. Therefore if the fum of the cubes is called, C, then ffiall B- — qXp~C — %r, and C—Bp—qp (becaufe B—p 1 — 2q)=p i — 3pq+3 r ' After the fame manner, if D be the fum of the 4th powers of the roots, you will find that D-pC—qB-\\-pr —4/, and if E be the fum of the 5th powers, then (hall E—pD — qC+rB — pJ+S f ‘ And after the fame manner the fum of any powers of the roots may be found; the progreflion of .thefe expreffions of the fum of the powers being obvious. As for the figns of the terms of the equation produ¬ ced, it appears, from inflection, that the.figns of all, the terms in any equation in the table are altefnately + and —: thefe equations are generated by multiplying conti¬ nually x— a, x — b, x• — c, x — d, &c. by one another. The firft term is always fome pure power of x, and is pofitive; the'fecond is a poWer of x multiplied by the quantities — a, — b, •— c, Ac. And fince thefe are all negative, that term mult therefore be negative. The third term has the products of any two of thefe quanti¬ ties (— a, •— b, -^-c. See.) for its coefficient; which pro¬ ducts are all pofitive, becaufe —X— gives +. For the like reafon, the next coefficient, confiding of all the products made by multiplying any three of thefe quanti¬ ties mult be negative, and the next pofitive. So that the coefficients, in this cafe, will be pofitive and negative by turns. But, “ in this cafe the roots are all pofitive fince x—a, x—b, x—c, x~d, x~e, &c. are the afTumed fimple equations. It is plain then, that “ when all the “ roots are pofitive, the figns are alternately -H a n d — .” But if the roots are all negative, then x+«X*-HX 1 B R A. x+cXx+d, &c. =0. will exprefs the equation to be pro¬ duced ; all whofe terms will plainly be pofitive ; fo that, “ when all the roots of-an equation are negative, it is “ plain there will be no changes in the figns of the terms “ of that equation.” In general, “ there are as many pofitive roots in any e- “ quation as there are changes in the figns of the terms from + to —, or from — to +; and the remaining “ roots are negative.” The rule is general, if the im- poffible roots be allowed to be.either pofitive or negative; and may be extended to all kinds of equations. In quadratic equations, the two roots are either both pofitive, as in this (.%• ■ —uX.v— b=) x 1 — ax-\\-ab=- o, —bx where there are two changes of the figns: Or they are both negative, as in this < 7 +aXx+b=) x 1 - ^ x+a b =Q , where there is not any change of the figns: Or there ia one pofi tive and one negative, as in where there is neceflarily one change of the figns; be¬ caufe the firft term is pofitive, and the laft negative, and there can be but one change whether the 2d term be + or —. Therefore the rule given in the haft paragraph extends to all quadratic equations. In cubic equations, the roots may b e,_ i°. All pofitive, as in this-, x — aXx — bXx — c ^= o, ip which the 'figns are alternately + and —, as appears from the table; and there are three changes of the figns. 2°. The roots may be all negative, as in the equation x-f aXx+bXx +c=o, where there can be no change of the figns. Or, 3 q . There may be tw o pofi tive roots and one negative, as in the equation x— aXx—bXx+c=o ; which gives x J —O +ab~) — b C x 1 — ac\\ x-\\-abc—o. +0 —be} Here there muft be two changes of the figns; becaufe if a-\\-b is greater than c, the fecond term muft be negative, its coefficient being — a — b-\\-e.

And there cannot poffibly be threechanges of the figns, the firft and laft terms having the fame fign. 4 0 .

And there can be but one change of the figns, fince if the ad term is negative, or a-j-6 lefs than c, the third muft be negative alfo, fo that there will be but one change of the figns. Or, if the fecond term is affirmative, whatever the third term is, there will be but one change of the figns. It appears therefore, in general, that in cubic e- quations, there are as many affirmative roots as there are changes of die figns of the terms of the equation. There are feveral confedtaries of what has been al¬ ready demonftrated, that are of ufe in difcovering the roots of equations. But before we proceed to that, it will be convenient to explain fome transformations of equations, by which they may often be rendered more Urnple, and the inveftigation of their roots more eafy. Chap. XVI. Of the Transformation of E- quatiom ; and exterminating their interme¬ diate Terms. We now proceed to explain the transformation of e- quations that are mod ufeful: arid, firft, “ The affirma- “ tive roots of an equation are changed into negative “ roots of the fame value, and the negative roots into “ affirmative, by only changing the figns of the terms “ alternately, beginning with the fecond.” Thus, the roots of the equation x 4 —**—I9x 1 + 49x-—30=0 are -Hi, +2, +3> —5 5 whereas the roots of the fame e- quation having only the figns of the fecond and fourth terms changed, viz. x 4 +x 5 —i9x 1 +49» ; -3o=o are '—i» — 2 > — 3 > + 5 - To underftand the reafon of this rule, let us affume an equation, as x— aXx — bXx — eXx — dXx—e, 8c c. =0, whole roots are +a, +b, -| -c, +d, +<?, &c. and ano¬ ther, having its roots of the fa me v alue, but affedted with contrary figns, as x+aXx+bXx+cxlt+dXx-\\-e, & c. =0. It is plain, that the terms taken alternately, beginning from the firft, are the fame in both equations, and have the fame fign, “ being produdts of an even number “ of the roots;” the produdl of any two roots having the fame fign as their produdt when both, their figns are changed; as -F<*X— b=— aX+b. But the fecond terms, and all taken alternately from them, becaufe their coefficients involve always the pro¬ dudts of an odd number of the roots, will have contrary figns in the two equations. For example, the produdt of four, viz. abed, having the fame fign in both, and one equation in the fifth term havin g'abcdX+e, and the other iibcdX — e, it follows, that their produdt abode muft have contrary figns in the two equations : thefe two equations therefore that have the fame roots, but with contrary figns, have nothing different but the figns of the alternate terms, beginning with the fecond. From which it follows, “ that if any equation is given, and “ you change the figns of the alternate terms, begin- “ ning with the fecond, the new equation will have roots “ of the fame value, but with contrary figns.” It is often very ufeful “ to transform an equation into B R A. “ another that Itydl have its roots greater or lefs than “ the roots of the propofed equation by fome given dif- “ ference.” Let the equation propofed be the cubic x 3 — px 1 +?x ■ — rvzo. And let it be required to transform it into ano¬ ther equation whole roots ffikll be lefs than the roots of this equation by fome given difference (<?), that is, fup- pofe/=x— e, and confequently x==>-H«; then, inftead of x and its powers, fubftitute y+e and its powers, and there will arife this new equation. (•^ 3 + 39 ,, + 3 < ? 1 >+ ' —py '—zpey—pe 1 f + 2 y+qe C ’ whofe roots are lefs than the roots of the preceding e- quation by the difference (<?). If it had been required to find an equation whofe roots Ihould be greater than thofe of the propofed equation by the quantity (*>), then we muft -have fuppofed y—x+e t- and confequently x==y— e, and then the other equation would have had this form. — py x + 2 pey—p* x + zy— 1 e = 0 . If the propofed equation be in this form x 5 + ^x*+yx +r=o, then, by luppofing x+i r~y, there will arife an e- quation-agreeing in all refpedts with the equation {A), but that the fecond and fourth terms will have contrary figns. And by fuppofing x— ezzy, there will arife an equation agreeing with (i?) in all refpedts, but that the fecond and fourth terms will have contrary figns to what they have in (B).

From whidh this rule may eafily be deduced for exterminating the fecond term out of any cubic equation. Rule."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"A L G E R:ule. Add to the unknown quantity of the given e- quation the third part of the coefficient of the fecOnd term with its proper fign, viz. rpc-f p, and fnppofe this aggregate equal to a new unknown quantity (^). From this value of y find a value of x by tranfpofition, and fubllitute this value of x and its powers in the given equation, and there will arife a new equation that ffiall want the fecond term. Examp. Let it be required to exterminate the fe¬ cond term out of this equation, x , —yx 2 - \\-26x —34=0, fuppofe x—3 —y, or^+3=x; and fubllituting according to the rule, you will find y 5 + §)' 1 +2 7/+2 7 ^ —qy 1 —54y—8if +26^+78 r —34J yi * - y -10=0. In which there is no term where y- is of two dimenfions, and an afterifk is placed in the room of the 2d term, to (hew it is wanting. Let the equation propofed be of any number of di- menfions repfefented by («); and let the coefficient of the fecond term with its fign prefixed be — p, then fup- pofing x——=y, and confequently x=y-f—, and fubfti- tuting this value for x in the given equation, there will arife a new equation that fhall want the fecond tern). It is plain from what was demonftrated in chap. 15. that the fum of the roots of the propofed equation is +p ; and fince we fuppofe y—x— A , it follows, that, in the new equation, each value of y will be lefs than the refpe&ive value of x by -A; and, fince the number of the roots is n, it follows, that the fum of the values of y will be lefs than -f p, the fum of the values of x, by «X-£-, the difference of any two roots, that is, by .• therefore the fum of the values of y will be ■ +> p—p-o- But the coefficient of the fecond term of the equation of y is the fum of the values of y, viz. +/>— p, and therefore that coefficient is equal to nothing; and confe¬ quently, in the equation of y, the fecond term vanifhes. It follows then, that the fecond term may be extermi¬ nated out of any given equation by the following Rule. Divide the coefficient of the fecond term of the propofed equation by the number of dimenfions of the equation; and affuming a new unknown quantity y, add 'to it the quotient having its fign changed^ Then fuppofe this aggregate equal to x the unknown quantity in the propofed equation ; and for x and its powers, fubllitute the aggregate and its powers, fo ffiall the new equation that arifes want its fecond term. if the propofed equation is a quadratic, as x 2 — fx+q Vol. I.

And from this example the ufe of exterminating the 2d term appears: for commonly the folution of the equa¬ tion that wants the 2d term is more eafy. And, if you can find the value of y from this new equation, it is eafy to find the value of x, by means of the equation y+\\pz=x. For example, Since y 2 +q —£/>*=o, it follows, that y 2 =\\p 2 — q , and j=±=y/j -/> *—q, fo that x=y+j:p=ip=t='/ip l —q ; which agrees with what we demonftrated, chap. 12. If the propofed equation is a biquadratic, as x 4 — px i +yx*—rx-f-/=o, then, by fuppofing x— \\p—y or x—y an equation ffiall arife having no fepond term. And if the propofed equation is of 5 dimenfions, then you mull fuppofe x=y=faf/>. Andfo on. When the fecond term in any equation is wanting, it follows, that “ the equation has both affirmative and ne- “ gative roots,*' and that ‘‘the fum of the affirmative. “ roots is equal.to the fum of the negative roots:” by which means the coefficient of the 2d term, which is the fum of all the roots of both forts, vaniffies, and makes the fecond term vaniffi. In general , “ The coefficient of the 2d term is the “ difference between the fum of the affirmative roots “ roots and the fum of the negative roots:” and the operations we have given ferve only to diminiffi all the roots when the fum of the affirmative is greateft, or in¬ crease the roots when the fum of the negative is greateft, fo as to balance them, and reduce them to an equality. It is obvious, that in a quadratic equation that wants the fecond term, there mull be one root affirmative and. one negative; and thefe mull be equal to one another.. In a cubic equation that wants the fecond term, there muft be either two affirmative roots equal, taken toge¬ ther to a third root that muft be negative; or, two ne¬ gative equal to a third that muft be pofitive. “ Let an equation x 3 — px l - \\-qx— r=o be propofed, “ and let it be now required to exterminate the third “ term.” By fuppofing y=x—e, the coefficient of the 3d term in the equation of y is found (fee equation A) to be 3#* — 2pe-\\-q. Suppofe that coefficient equal to nothing, and by refolving the quadratic equation 3?*— ape+q=o,- you will find the value of e, which fubftituted for it in the equation y—x — e, will lhew how to transform the propofed equation into one that ffiall want the third term.

The 4th term of any equation may be taken away by folving a cubic equation, which is the coefficient of the 4th term in the equation when transformed, as in the former -part of this chapter. The fifth term may be ta¬ ken away by folving a biquadi atic; and after the fame manner, the other terms can be exterminated if there are any. There are other tranfmutations of equations that, on fome occafions, are ufeful. At> equation, as x 3 — px z + qx — r— o, “maybetranf- “ formed into another that (hall .have its roots equal to “ the roots of this equation multiplied by a given quan- \" tity,” as fy by fuppofing y=/x, and confequently r x=^r, and fobftituting this value for x in the propofed equation, there will arifej ^— ~- t — r=o, and mul¬ tiplying all by y 5 . • y i —ft>y' l + f*qy—f i r±=.o, where the coefficient of the 2d term of the propofed equation multiplied into /, makes the coefficient of the 2d term cf the transformed equation; and the following coeffi¬ cients are produced by the following coefficients of the propofed equation, (as q, r, &c.) multiplied into the powers of / (/*,/ 3 , &c.). Therefore “ to transform any equation into another whofe roots ffiall be equal to the roots of the propofed. equation multiplied by a given quantity (/),” you need only multiply the terms of the propofed equation, begin¬ ning at the 2d term, by/, /*, f 3 , / 4 , &c. and put¬ ting y inftead of x, there will arife an equation having its roots equal to the roots of the propofed equation mul¬ tiplied by (/) as required. The transformation mentioned above is of ufe when the higheft term of the equation has a coefficient dif¬ ferent from unity; for, by it, the equation may be tranf- formed inf,o one that ffiall have the coefficient of the high- eft term unit. • If the equation propofed is ax 3 — -px*-\\~qx — >r=o, then transform the equation into one whofe roofs are equal to the roots of the propofed equation multiplied by («). That is, fuppofe y—ax or x=— an d there will arife ‘Jl-Jl +M^r=o; fo that a 3 a y 3 — - py i ^r9 a y — I = o. From which we eafily draw this Ruue. Change the unknown quantity x into another y , prefix no coefficient to the higheft term, pafs the 2d, multiply the following terms, beginning with the 3d, by a, a*, a 3 , a 4 , &c. the powers of the coefficient of the higheft term of the propofed equation, refpec- tively. Thus the equation 3X 3 —13* *+i4x+16=0, is tranf- formed into the equation^ 3 —I3^*+I4X3 X x+i 6 X9:=0>' or y 3 —1 qy 1 + 42 x+ 1 4 4=0. Then finding the roots of this equation, it will eafily be difeovered what are the roots of the propofed equation, fince 3*=y, or x=ly. And therefore, fince one of the values of y is —2, it follows, that one of the values of x is —y. By the laft rule, \" an equation is eafily cleared of “ fractions.” Suppofe the equation propofed. is x 3 — — x*+-^-x-—=0. Multiply all the terms by the produdl of the denominators, you find mneXx 3 — » sp Xx * + wt- y X x— m n r=o . Then (as above) transforming the equation into one that ffiall have unit for the coefficient of the higheft term, you find y 3 — nepXy' 1 -\\-m x e x nqXy — vt 3 n 3 e 1 r =- o. Or, neglecting the denominator of the laft term—- you need only multiply all the equation by tnn, which will give mnXx 3 — npXx i -\\-mqXx — W --==0. And then y 3 — npXy* +;«* n qXy ——— = 0. Now after the values of y are found, it will be eafy to difeover the values of x; fince, in the firft cafe, x—J!— ; in the fecond, x=—. nine mn For example, the equation x 3 * —yX — ’ /t — O) is firft reduced to (his form 3X 3 # — 4X — 1 £--=0, and then transformed into.? 3 * —12 y —146=0. Sometimes, by thefe transformations, “ fords are ta- “ ken away.” , As for exampie, The equation x 3 — p\\/aXx Z J rqx—r^/a=o, by putting y—4/axx, orx = - -^ - , is transformed into this equation, a/ a — ■ - p aX^—-\\-qx—. -xyfo=o. Which, by multi- a^/a a •/a plying all the terms by a a/ a, becomes y 3 — pay*-\\-qay — ra x -=Oy an equation free of fords. But in order to make this fucceed, the ford (y/a) muft enter the alter¬ nate terms, beginning with the fecond. “ An equation, as x 3 — px*-\\-qx — r=o, maybe tranf- “ formed into one whofe roots ffiall be the quantities re- “ ciprocal of x;” by fuppofing y——, and y——, or. (by one foppofition), x=—, becomes z 3 — qz x - \\-prz— r*=o. In the equation of y, it is manifeft, that the order of the coefficients is inverted; fo that, if the fecond term had been wanting in the propofed equation, the laft but one ffiould have heen wanting in the equations of y and z. If the 3d had been wanting in the equation propofed, the laft but two had been wanting in the equations of y and z. Another ufe of this transformation is, that the great-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"ALGEBRA. 107 eft root in the one it transformed into the lsoft root in the other. For fince x = —, and^ = —, itis plain, that when the value of x is greateft, the value of y is lead, and converfely. How an equation is transformed fo as to have all its roots affirmative, ffiall be explained in the following' chapter. Chap. XVII.

If it is the biquadratic x 4 — px 3 - \\-qx x — rx+ s—o that is propofed, then by fuppofing y—x — e, it will be transformed into this other, j*+/iey s +'6e*y*'+/ie 3 y + —Py l ~3PV ’ ■ —^pe'y—pe 3 J + 2q<y + qe 1 > = o —- ry — re \\ + s / Where again it is obvious, That the laft term is the equa¬ tion that was propofed, having e in place of x : That the laft term but one has for its coefficient the quantity that ariles by multiplying the terms of the laft quantity by the indices of e in each term; and dividing the pro- du£t by e: That the coefficient of the laft term but two, {viz. 6e x —3 pf+q) is deduced in the fame manner from the term immediately following, that is, by multiplying every term of 4*?*—3/<? l -j-2y <?— r by the index of e in that term, and dividing the whole by e multiplied into the index o(y in the term fought, that is, by eX.2 : And the next terpi is 4c— p— — X2 . 3 ‘ The demonftration Sf this may eafily be made general by the theorem for finding the powers of a binomial, fince the transformed equation confifts of the powers of the binomial y-\\-e that are marked by the indices of e in the laft term, multiplied each by their coefficients 1, •— p t -\\-q, — r, -j-t, See. refpedtively. §3. F rom the laft two articles we can eafilyfindthe terms of the transformed equation without any involution. The laft term is had by fubftituting e inftead of x in the pro¬ pofed equation ; ■ the next term, by multiplying every part of that laft term by the index of e in each part, and dividing the whole by e\\ and the following terms in the manner deferibed in the foregoing article ; the refpedive divifors being the quantity e multiplied by the index of y in each term. ' The demonftration for finding when two or more roots are equal will be eafy, if we add to this, that “ when \" -the unknown quantity enters all the terms of any eqqa~. “ tion, then one of its values is equal to nothing.” As in the equation x 3 — px % -\\-qx—o, where x— 0=0 being- one pf the fimple equations that produce x 3 — px x -f- qx—o, it follows that one of the values of x>is o. In like manner, two of the values of x are equal to nothing, in this equation x 3 - — px x =0 ;i and three of them vaniffi in the equation x 4 — px i — o. It is alfo obvious {converfely) that “ if x does not en-* “ ter all thh terms of the equation, i. e. if the laft term “ be not wanting, then»ncne of the values of x can be “ equal to nothing,” for if every term be not multiplied by x, then x-^o cannot be a divifor of the whole equa¬ tion, and confequently o cannot be one of the values of x. If x 1 does not enter into all the terms of the equa¬ tion, then two of the values of x cannot be equal to no¬ thing. If x 3 does not enter into all the terpis of the equation, then three of the values of x cannot be equal to nothing, <bc. § 4. Suppofe now that two values of x are equal to one. another, and to e ; then it is plain that two values-of y in the transformed equation will be equal to nothing : fir.ee y—x — e. And confequently, by the laft article, the two laft terms of the transformed equation muft va- niffi. Suppofe it is the cubic equation of § 1. that is pro¬ pofed, viz. x 3 — px*-rq x — r—O'y and becaufe >ve fuppofe x=e, therefore the laft term of the transformed equation, viz. e 3 — pe x + qe — r will vanift. And fince two values of y vaniffi, the laft term but one, viz. 3 e 'y — apey-fqy will vaniffi at the fame time. So that — Zpeftq—o.

After the fame manner, if there are three equal roots in the biquadratic x 4 — px*-\\-qx* —rx4o=o, and if e be equal to one of them, three values of y (=x— e) will vaniih, and confequently y 5 will enter all the terms of the transformed equation ; which will have this form, y +49’ 3 2 # # *=o. So that here —py’5 6e 1 — ype+q— 0; or, fince e=x, therefore, 6x*— ypx+q=o: and one of the roots of this qua¬ dratic will be equal to one of the roots of the propofed biquadratic. In this cafe, two of the roots of the cubic equation 4X 3 — 3/x 1 +2^x—r=o are roots of the propofed biqua¬ dratic, becaufe the quantity 6x*-—3 px+q is deduced from 4X 3 —3/>x l +2?x—r, by multiplying the terms by the indexes of x in each term. In general, \" whatever is the number of equal roots “ in the propofed equation, they will all remain but one ‘f in the equation that is deduced from it, by multiplying “ all the terms by the indexes of x in them ; and they “ will all remain but two in the equation deduced in the “ fame manner from that;” and fo of the reft. . § 6. What we obferved of the coefficients of equations transformed by fuppofing y—x—e, leads to this eafy de- monftration of this rule; and will be applied in the next chapter to demonftrate the rules for finding the limits of equations. : B R A. It is obvidus, however, that though we make ufe of equations whofe figns change alternately, the fame rea- foning extends to all other equations. It is a confequence alfo of what has been demonftra- ted, that “ if two roots of any equation, as, “ x 3 — px x - \\-qx— r=o, are equal, then “ multiplying the terms by any arithmetical feries, as, “ a-j-yb, «+2 b , a-\\-bi a , the product will be =0.” For, fince ax* — -apx x -f-aqx—arzzo and 3X 1 — 2px+qXbx—o, it follows that ax 3 + 3 b x 3 —ap x*— ’ibpx' 1 +aqx-\\-bqx — arzzo. Which is the produdt that arifes by multiplying the terms of the propofed equation by the terms of the fe¬ ries, <1+3 b , a-\\-ib, a-\\-b, a ; which may reprefent any arithmetical progrefiion. Chap. XVIII. Of the Limits of Equations. We now proceed to fhew liow to difcover the limits of the roots of equations, by which their folution is much facilitated, Let any equation, as x 3 — px*+qx —r=o be propofed and transform it, as above, into the equation y i +3ty t + $ e'y + e*~\\ —Py *—2 pey—pe* f + qy + q ' C Where the values of^ are lefs than the refpective values of x by the difference e. If you fuppofe e to be taken fuch as to make all the coefficients of the equation of y pofitive, viz. e* — pe x - \\-qe —r, 3<r*— 2pe+q, ye—p ; then there being no.variation of the figns in the equa¬ tion, all the values of y muft be negative; and confe¬ quently, the quantity e, by which the values of x are diminifhed, muft be greater than the greateft pofitive value of x; and confequently muft be the limit of the roots of the equation, x 3 —/>x I + yx—r=o. It is fufficient therefore, in order to find the limit, to “ inquire what quantity fubftituted for x in each of thefe “ expreffions x 3 — px*+qx — r, 3X 1 —2 px-\\-q, 3X— p, “ will give them all pofitive for that quantity will be the limit required. How thefe expreffions are formed from one another, was explained in the beginning of the laft chapter. Ex amp. If the equation x J — 2X 4 ' — i o x 3 +30x*+ 63x4-120=0 is propofed; and it is required to deter¬ mine the limit that is greater than any of the roots; you are to inquire what integer number fubftituted for x in the' propofed equation, and following equations deduced from it by §3. chap. 17. will give, in each, a pofitive quantity, 5X 3 —8x 3 —30x^460x463 5 x } —6* 1 —15X+15 5* 1 4 * 5 Sx —2. - The leaft integer number which gives each of thefe pofitive, is 2 j which therefore is the limit of the roots"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"ALGEBRA. it 9 of the propofe'd equation; of a number that exceeds the greateft pofitive root. If the limit of the negative roots is required, you may {by chap. 16.) change the negative into pofitive roots; and then proceed as before to find their limits. Thus, in the example, you will find, that —3 is the limit of the nega¬ tive roots. So that the five roots of the propofed equa¬ tion are betwixt —3 and +2. Having found the limit that furpafles the greateft po¬ fitive root, call it ns. And if you aflfume y—rn —x, and for x fubftitute m—y, the equation that will arife will have all its roots pofitive; becaufe m is fuppofed to fur- pafs all the values of x, and confequently m—x (=fcy) muft always be affirmative. And, by this means, any equa¬ tion may be changed into one that Jhall have all its roots affirmative. Or, if —n reprefent the limit of the negative roots, then by affuming ^=x+», the propofed equation {hall be transformed into one that {hall have all its roots affirma¬ tive ; for +« being greater than any negative value of x, it follows, that^=x+« muft be always pofitive. The greateft negative coefficient of any equation in- creafed by unit, always exceeds the greateft root of the equation. To demonftrate this, let the cubic x J —px*—yx—- r=*o be propofed; where all the terms are negative ex¬ cept the firft. Affuming yzzx — e, it will be transformed into the following equation; 1°; Let us fuppofe that the coefficients p, q, r, are equal to each other;' and if you alio fuppofe e=/>4-i, then the laft equation becomes (B)jt t +2py*+p'y+i'} +a+a# >=o; +V j where all the terms being pofitive, ft follows that the values of y are all negative, and that confequently e, or P+t, is greater than the greateft value of x in the pro¬ pofed equation. 2°. If q and r be not —p, but lefs than i.t, and for e you ftiil fubftitute p -|-i (fince the negative part (— qy — qe^ becomes, lefs, the pofitive remaning undiminiflied,) a for¬ tiori, all the coefficients of the equation (A) become pofitive. And the fame is obvious if q and r have pofi¬ tive figns, and not negative figns, as we fuppofed. It appears therefore, “ that if, in any cubic equation, p ** be the greateft negative coefficient, then /+1 muftfur- “ pafs the greateft value of x.” 3 0 . By the fame reafoning it appears, that if q be die greateft negative coefficient 'of the equation, and evzq-\\- 1 , then there will be no variation of the figns in the equation of y : for it appears from the laft article, that if all the three (/>, q, r ,) were equal to one another, and e equal to any one of them increafed by unit, as to q+ 1 , then all the terms-of the equation (A) would be Vol. I. No. J. 3 pofitive. Now if e be fuppofed ftiil equal to q-\\-1, and p and r to be lefs than q, then, a fortiori, all thefe terms will be pofitive, the negative part, which involves p and r being diminifhed, while the pofitive part and the negative involving q remain as before. 4 0 . After the lame manner it is demonftrated, that If r is the greateft ne’gative coefficient in the equation, and e is fuppofed =r+i, then all the terms of the equation (yf) of_y will be pofitive ; and confequently r+I will be greater than any of the values of x. What we have faid of the cubic equation x , —/x 1 H b qx—r=0], is eafily applicable to others. In general, we conclude, that the greateft negative “ coefficient in any equation increafed by unit, is always “ a limit that exceeds all the roots of that equation.” But it is to be obferved at the fame time, that the greateft negative coefficient increafed by unit, is very feldom the neareft limit s that is beft difeovered by the rule in the beginning of this chapter. Having ffiewn how to change any propofed equation into one that {hall have all its roots affirmative ; we {hall only treat of fuch as have all their roots pofitive, in what remains relating to the limits of equations. Any fuch equation may be reprefented by x — a Xx — b Xx — cX x — d, &c. =0, whofe roots are a, b , c, d , 8 c c. And of all fuch equations two limits are eafily difeo¬ vered from what precedes, vit. a, which is lefs than the lcaft, and e, found as diredled in the beginning of this chapter, which furpafles the greateft root of the equation. But, befides thefe, we (hall now ffiew how to find 0- (her limits belkoixt the roots thtmfeldes. And, for this purpofe, will fuppofe a to be the leaft root, b the fecond root, c the third, and fo off; it .being arbitrary. If yon fubftitute o iff place of the unknown quantitv, putting x=0, the quantity that will arife from that fup- pofition is the laft . term of the equation, all the others that involve x vanifliing. If you fubftitute for x a quantity lefs than the leaft root a, the quantity refulting will have the fame fign as the laft term ; that is, will be pofitive or negative ac¬ cording as the equation is of an even or odd number of dimenfions. For all the fadtors x— a, x — b, x— c, 8c c. will be negative, and their produdt will be pofitive or ne¬ gative according as their number is even or odd. If you lubftitute for x a quantity greater than the leaft root a, but lefs than all the other roots, then the fign of the quantity refulting will be contrary to what it was be¬ fore; becaufe one fadtor (x — a) becomes now pofitive, all the others remaining negative as before. If you fubftitute for x a quantity greater than the two leaft roots, but lefs than all the reft, both the fadlors x— a, x — b, become pofitive, and the reft remain as they were. So that the whole produdt will have the fame figil as the laft term of the equation. Thus fuccef- fively placing inftead of x quantities that are limits be¬ twixt the roots of the equation, the quantities that re*- fult will have alternately the figns + and —. And, converfely, “ if you find quantities which, fubftituteef in “ place of x in the propofed equation, do give altcr- “ nately pofitive and negative refults, thofe quantities “ are the limits of that equation.” E c It"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"no A L G ] It is ufeful to obferve, that, in general, “ when, by “ fubftituting any two numbers for x in any equation, “ the refults have contrary figns, one or more of the “ roots of the equation muft be betwixt thofe numbers.'’ Thus, in the equation, x 3 — 2x*—j=o, if you fubfti- tute 2 and 3 for x, the refults are —5, +4’, whence it follows, that the roots are betwixt 2 and 3 : for when thefe refults have different figns, one or odier of the fa&o’rs which produce the equations mud have changed its fign; fuppofe it is x=f, then it is plain that * mud be betwixt the numbers fuppofed equal to x. Let the cubic equation x 3 — px^-^-qx —r=o be pro- pofed, and let it be transformed, by affuming _y=x—r, •into the equation Jf*+ 3 ey* + —P ) 1 —2 PV —pe* C=n' + qy + 9 * C Let us fuppofe e equal fucceflively to the three values of x, beginning with the leaft value; and becaufe the laft term e l — pe % - \\-qe—r will vaniflt in all thefe fuppofi- tions, the equation will have this form, .r*+K 7-+30 —py—2pe V =0; + q ) where the laft term 3/?*—2 pe+q is, from the nature of equations, produced of the remaining values of y, or of the exceffes of two other values of x above what is fup¬ pofed equal to e ; fince always y—x — e .. Now, i°. Iff be equal to the leaft value of x, then thofe two exceffes being both pofitive, they will give a pofitive product, and confequently 3**—2 pe-\\-q will be, in this cafe, pofitive. 2°. If e be equal to the fecond value of x, then, of thofe two exceffes, one being negative and one pofitive, their produft 3?*—2 pe+q, will be negative. 3 0 . If e be equal to the third and greateft value of x, then the two exceffes being both negative, their produft je 1 -—2 pe-\\-q is pofitive. Whence, If in the equation 3e l — 2pe+q=o, you fubftitute fuc- ceffively in the place of e, the three roots of the equa¬ tion e 3 — pe‘ L - \\-qe — r—o, the quantities refulting will fucceflively have the figns +> —> + > and confequently the three roots of the cubic equation are the limits of the roots of the equation — 2 pe-\\-q= O. That is, the leaft of the roots of the cubic is lefs than the leaft of the roots of the other ; the fecond root of the cubic is a limit between the two roots of the other; and the greateft root of the cubic is the limit that ex¬ ceeds both the roots of the other. Wc have demonftrated, that the roots of the cubic equation e 3 — pe^+qe — r ~o are limits of the quadratic 3* 1 — 2pe+q ; whence it follows (converfely J that the roots of the quadratic q<? 1 — 2pe-\\-q—o are the limits be¬ tween the firft . and fecond, and between the fecond and third roots of the cubic e 3 — pe' l +qe — r— o. So that if ybu find the limit that exceeds the greateft root of the cubic, by die beginning of this chapter you will haye (with o. 5 B R A. which is the limit lefs than any of the roots) four li¬ mits for the threeroots of the propofed cubic. It was demonftrated in chap 17. §3. how the quadratic 3 e % — 2 pe-\\-q is deduced from the propofed cubic e 3 —. pe'+qe-^rzio, viz. by multiplying each term by the index of e in it* and then dividing the whole by e ; and what we have demonftrated of cubic equations is eafily extended to all others; fo that we conclude “ that the “ laft term but one. of the transformed equation is the “ equation for determining the limits of the propofed “ (equation.” Or, that the equation arifing by multi¬ plying each term by the index of the unknown quantity in it, is the equation whofc roots give the limits of the propofed equation; if you add to them the two mention¬ ed in p. 109. col. 2. par. 4. For the fame reafon, it is plain that the root of the Ample equation 3<?—/>—o, (/. e. \\p) is the limit be¬ tween the two roots of the quadratic q,? 2 — 2pe-\\-q—o. And, as. 4/? J — 3/>r 1 + 2?t’— r—o gives, three limits of the equation. e*-rrpe'+qs'—re + s=o, fq the quadratic 6e 1 — q ,pe-\\-qzzo gives two limits that are betwixt the roots of the cubic 4? 3 — 3/e- 1 4 - 2 ye— r — o ; and 44— p=o gives one limit that is.betwixt the two roots of the quadratic 6e*—q/v 4 -y—o. So that we have a complete feries of thefe equations arifing from a fimple equation to the propofed, each of which determines the limits of the following equation. . If two roots in the propofed equation are e-;u d, then “ the limit that ought to be betwixt them muft, “ in this cafe, bbcome equal to one of the equal roots “ themfelves.” . Which perfectly agrees with what was demonftrated in the laft chapter, concerning the rule for finding the equal roots of equations. Apd, the lame equation that gives the limits, giving alfo one of the equal roots, when two or more are equal, it appears, that “ if you fubftitute a limit in place of “ the unknown quantity in an equation,” and, inftead of a pofitive or negative refult, it be found =0, then you may conclude, that “ not only the limit itfelf is a root “ of the equation, but that there are two roots in that “ equation equal to it and to one another.” It having been demonftrated, that the roots of the equation x 3 — px x +qx — r=z o are the limits of the roots of the equation qx 1 —2/>x-f q=o, the three roots of the cubic equation, which fuppofe to be a, b. c, fubftituted for x in the quadratic 3.x 1 — -j2px-\\-q, muft give the re¬ fults pofitive and negative alternately.

In the fame manner pb z —2yH\"3^=— MXb, and pc 1 — 2 y c 4 - 3 > — 4 * LXe. Therefore px* —27.4-3 r is fuch a quantity, that if, for x, you fubftitute in it fucceflively a, b, c, tlie re¬ fults will be 4 -AX ,— M Xb, 4 -LXc. Whence a, b, c, are limits of the equation p *— 2qx-\\-^r=o, by p. 109. cpl. 2. par. 8. and, c^nve’fely, the roots of the equation px 2 — 2qx-{-^r~o are limits between the firft and fecond, and between the fecond and third roots of the cubic x 3 — px l +qx —r=o.

And “ from this obfervation rules may be deduced for ** difeovering when there are impoffible roots in equa- “ tions.” Of wlych we fhall treat afterwards. Befides the method already explained, there are others by which limits may be determined which the root of sin equation cannot exceed. Since the fquares of all real quantities are affirmative, it follows, that “ the fum of the fquares of the roots of 44 any equation muft be greater than the fqp.are of the “ greateft root.” And the fquare root of that fum will therefore be a limit that muft exceed the greateft root of the equation. If the equation propofed is x” — px n — 1 4 ~qx” 7 — rx n — 3 4-, &c. ~o, then the fum of the fquarps of the roots (p. 103. col. 1. par. 1.) will be p 1 —2 q . So that —2 q will exceed the greateft root of that equation. Or if you find, by p. 103. col. 1. par. 4. the fum of the 4th powers of the roots of the equation, and extract the biquadratic root of that fum, it will alfo exceed the greateft root of the equation. If you find'a meat) proportional between the fum of the fquares of any two roots, a, b, and the fum of their E B R A. biquadrates (a 4 -\\-b 4 , ) this mean proportional will be iya c '-\\-a x b 4 -\\-a 4 b'-\\-b i . And the fum of the cubes is a % -\\-b % . Now, fince a 1 — 2ab-\\-b x is the fquare of a— b, it muft be always pofitive ; and if you multiply it by a x b x , the produd a 4 b x - — 2a 1 b y -\\-a x b 4 will alfo be pofitive; and confequently a 4 b x - \\-a x b 4 will be always greater than 2 a i b ' 1 . Add a 6 +b s and we have a 6 -\\-a 4 b x - \\-a x b 4 +b 6 greater than a 6 -\\-2a l b 3 +b 6 ; and extrading the root ya 6 -\\-a 4 ’b x -\\-a l b A - \\-b 6 greater than And the fame may be demonftrated of any number of roots what¬ ever. Now, if you add the fum of all the cubes taken affir - ■ motively to their fum w'ith their proper fig ns,, they will give double the fum of the cubes of the affirmative roots. And if you fubtrad the fecond fum from the firft, there will remain double, the ium of the cubes of the negative roots. Whence it follows, that “ half the fum of the “ mean proportional betwixt the fum of the fquares “ and the fum of the biquadrates, and of the fum “ of the cubes of the roots with their proper figns, ex- “ ceeds the fum of the cubes of the affirmative roots and .** half their difference exceeds the fum of the cubes of the negative roots.” And, by extrading the cube root of that fum and difference, you will obtain limits that fhall exceed the fums of the affirmative and of the negative roots And fines it is eaiy,. from what bus been already explained, to diminilh the roots of an equa¬ tion fo that they all may become negative but one, it ap¬ pears how, by this means, you may approximate very near to that root. But this does not ferve when there are impoilible roots. Several other rules like thefe might be given for limi¬ ting the roots of equations. We fhall give one not men¬ tioned by other authors. ■ In a cubic x 3 — f\\ x -\\-qx —r=o, find q x — 2pr, and call it e 4 ; then fhall the greateft ropt of the equation always be greater than 4 3, or £L.

It was demonftrated in chap. 15. that the laft term of any equation is the produd of its roots : from which it follows, that the roots of an equation, when commenfu-r rable quantities, will be found among thedivifors of the laft term. And hence we have, for the refolution of e- quations, this Rule. Bring all the terms to one fide of the equation, find all the divifors of the laft term,\" and fubftitute them fucceffively for the unknown quantity in the equa¬ tion. So fhall that divifor which, fubftituted in this manner."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"£12 A L (? E manner, gives the refalt =o, be the root of the pro- pofed equation. For example, fuppofe this equation is to be refolved, R A. t 3 — 3*tx 1 + 2*t*x— bx'+$abx where the laft term is 2 a ' b , whofe fimple literal divifors are a, b, 2 a, 2 b, each of which may be taken either pofitively or negatively i but as here we find there are variations of figns in the equation, we need only take them pofitively. Suppofe x=« the firft of the divifors, and fubftituting a for x, the equation becomes a 3 — 3*3+2* — a'b +3*1 So that, the whole vanifhing, it follows, that a is one of the roots of the equation. dace from the root already found, and the quotient (hall give an equation of a degree lower than the propofed; whofe roots will give the remaining roots required.

Again, if you fubftitute 2 a for x, you will find all the terms deftroy one another’fo as to make the fum =0. For it will then be 8*z *—12*3-3 1 — 2 a*bi —4«*£+6a*'£ 5 Whence we find, that 2« is the third root of the equa¬ tion. Which, after the firft two (+a, +£,) had been found, might have been collefted from this, that the laft term being the product of the three roots, +*, +£, be¬ ing known, the third muft necefiarily be equal to the laft term divided by the prodqft ab, that is, Let the roots of the cubic equation x 5 —2 x 1 —33 *+90=0 be required. And firft the divifors of 90 are found to be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90. If you fubftitute 1 for x, you will find x J — 2X 1 —33 x +90=j 6; fo that 1 is not a root of the equation. If you fubftitute 2 for x, the refult will be 24: but, putting x=3, you have x 3 — 2X 1 —3 3x+9o=2 7—18—99+90=1 17—117=0. So that three is one of the roots of the propofed equa¬ tion. The other affirmative root is +5 ; nnd after you find it, as it is manifeft from the equation,, that the other root is negative, you are not - to try any mqre divifors ta¬ ken pofitively, but to fubftitute. them, negatively taken, for x: and thus you find, that —6 is the third root. For putting x=— -6, you have x 3 — 2x 1 — 33x+9<o=—216—72+198+90=0. This laft root might have been found by dividing the laft term 90, having its lign changed by r5, the product of the two roots already found. , When one of the roots of an equation is found, in order to find the reft with lefs trouble, divide the propo¬ fed equation by the fimple equation which you are to de- : 4 +x= 3 0 ■ *-h*+i - 3 ?_+{== L 4 ~ 4=+j or —6. After the fame manner, if the biquadratic x 4 —2* 3 —. 2£x*+26 x+I20=o is to be refolved; by fubftituting the divifors of 120 for x, you will find, that +3, one of thofe divifors, is one of the roots; the fubftitutiou o£ 3 for x giving 81—54—223+78+120=279—279=0. And therefore, dividing the propofed equation by x —3, you muft inquire for the roots of the cubic x 3 + * 1 — 2 2 x —40=0, and finding that +3, one of the divifors of 40, is one of the roots, you divide that cubic by x —3, and the quotient gives the quadratic x*+6x+8=o, whofe two roots are —2, —4. So that the four roots of the. biquadratic are+3, +3, —2, ■ —4. This rule fuppofes that you can find all the divifors of 'the laft term; which you may always do thus. “ If it is a fimple quantity, divide it by its leaft divi- “ for that exceeds unit, and the quotient again by its “ leaft divifor, proceeding thus till you have a quotient “ that is not divifible by any number greater than unit.. “ This quotient, with thefe divifors, are the firft or. “ Jimple divifors of the quantity.

But as the laft term may have very many divifors, and the labour maybe very great to fubftitute them all for the unknown quantity, we lhall now fhew how it may be abridged, by limiting to afmall number the divifors you are to try And, firft, it is plain, from p. 109.. col. 1. P«r. 4. that “ any divifor that exceeds the greateft nega- * tive coefficient by unity is to be negledled.” Thus, in refolving the equation x 4 —2* 3 —2 5x i + 26x+I20=o, as 25 is the'greateft negative coefficient, we conclude, that the divifors of 120 that exceed 26' may.be negleftcd. But the labour may be ftill abridged, if we make ufe of the rule in the beginning of ch. 18.; that is, if wc find the number which fubftituted in thefe following expreffions, X* - 2 . r’— 2 $ .V 1 + 26 H -I 2 0 , 2*’—3* 1 —25* +13, 6 x* —6 x —25, 2X —I, will give in them all a pofitive refalt: for that number will be greater than the greateft root, and all the divifors of 120 that exceed it may be neglofted. That this inveftigation may be eafier, we_pught to be¬ gin always with that expreffion where the negative roots feem to prevail moll; as here in the quadratic expreffion 6x*—6 x —2;; where finding that 6 fubftituted for x {rives that expreffion pofitive, and gives all the other ex¬ preffions at the fame time pofitive, I conclude', that 6 is greater than any of the Toots, and that all the divifors of 120 that exceed 6 may be negle&ed. If the equation jr’-f-i ix*-f-iox—72=0 is propofed, the rule of p. 109. col. i, par. 4. does not help to abridge the operation; the laft term itfelf being the greateft nega¬ tive term. But, by chap. 18. we inquire'what number fubftituted for x will give all thefe expreffions pofitive. * 3 + i ix*+iox—72 3**+22x-f-io' 3 *-f-n. E B R A. 113 Where the labour is very Ihort, fince We need only at¬ tend to the fiift expreffion; and we fee immediately that 4 fubftituted for x gives a pofitive r.efult, whence all the divifors of 72 that exceed 4 are to be rejected ; and thus by a few trials, we find, that +2 is the'pofitive roat of the equation'. Then dividing the equation by x—2, and refolving the quadratic equation that is the quotient of the divilion, you find the other two roots to be —9, and But there is another method that reduces the divifors of the laft term, that can be ufeful, ftill to more narrow limits. Suppofe the cubic equation x 3 — px'-\\-qx — r—o is pro¬ pofed to be refolved. Transform it to an equation whole roots (hall be lefs than the values of x by. unity, aftu- ming >=u—1. And the laft term of the transformed equation will be 1— p-\\-q — 'r; .which is found by fubfti- tutiog unit, the difference of * and y, for x, in the pro¬ pofed equation; as will eafily appear from p. 106. col. 1 par. 4. where, when ys=x- — e, the laft term of the tranf- forihed equation was <t — r. Transform again the equation x 3 —/> *+7-— r=z 0, by affuming/^-hi, into an equation whofe roots lhall ex¬ ceed the values of x by unit, and the laft term of thft transformed equation will be —1— p~ — q — r, the fame that arifes by fubftituting — t, the difference betwixt x and y , for x, in the propofed equation. Now the values of x are fome of the divifors of r, which is’thfe term left when you fuppofe x=o a nd the values of the y’s are fome of the divikirs of +1— p-\\-q — r, and of —1— p — q —r, refpectiveiy. And thefe values are in arithmetical progreffion increafing by the common difference unit; becaufe y—1, x, x-fi, are in that progreilion. And it is obvious the fame reafonirig may be extended to any'equation of whatever degree. So that this gives a general method for the refolution of equations whofe roots are commenfurable. Role. Subftitutc, in place of the unknown quantity, fucceffively the terms of the prof^effion, 1, 0, —1, See. and find all the divifors of the fums that refult; then take out all the arithmetical progreffions you can find among thefe divifors, whofe common difference is unit; and the values of x will be among the divifors arifiug from the fubftitutions of x=o that belong to thefe progrefiions.

Chap. XX. Of the Refolutlon of Equations by finding the Equal tom of a lower Degree that are their Divifors, To find the roots of an equation is the fame thing as to find the ftuple equations, by the multiplication of which into one another it is produced, or, to find the fimple equations that divide it without a remainder. If fuch Ample equations' cannot be found, yet if we can find the qu dratic equations from which the propofed equation is produced, we may difeover its roots after¬ wards by the refolutlon of thefe quadratic equations. Or, if neither thefe fimple equations, nor thefe quadra¬ tic equations can be found,, yet, by finding a cubic or biquadratic' that is a divifor of the propofed equation, we may deprefs it lower,, and make the folution more eafy. Now, in order to find the rules by which thefe divi¬ fors may be difeover ed; we fliali fuppofe, that mx — n T (^firhple tux 1 — nx-\\-r C are the X quadratic # mx % — nx 1 -+-rx — ( cubic divifors of the propofed equation; and if E reprefent the quotient arifing by dividing the propofed equation by that divifor, then Ex — Ey hu , '—nx+r. Or, EXmx 3 — »x’-t rx —/, will reprefent the propofed equation itfelf. Where it is plain, that “ fince m is the “ coefficient of the higheft term of the divifors, it muft “ be a divifor of the coefficient of the higheft term of ** the propofed equation.” Next we are to oblerve, that, fuppofing the equation has a fimple divifor mx —«, if we.fubilitute in the equa¬ tion EX?nx —», in place of x, any quantity, as a, then the quantity that will refult from this fubltitution will neceffarily have ma—n f:r one of its divifors: fince, in .this fubftitutjon, mx—n becomes ma — n. • If. we fubftitute fucceffively for x, any arithmetical progreffion, a, a — e, a — ie, &c. the quantities that will refult from thefe fubilitutions will have among tlieir di¬ vifors ma — n, ma—me — n, ma —2 s tie—n, which are alfo in arithmetical pro¬ greffion, having their common difference equal to me. If, for example, we fubftitute for x the terms of this progreffion, 1, o, — 1, the quantities that refult have a- mong their divifors the arithmetical progreffion vi —», — n, —m — n ; or, changing the figns, n — m, n, n+tn ' Where the difference of the terms is m, and the term belonging to the fuppofition of x=o is «. It is manifeft therefore, that when an equation has any fimple divifor, if you^fubftitute for x the progreffion 1, o, —1, there will be found amongft the divifors of the fums that refult from thefe fubfiitutions, one arithmetical progreffion at leaft, whole common difference, will be unit or a divifor tn of the coefficient of the higheft term, and which will be the coefficient of x in the fimple divifor re¬ quit ed: and whofe term, arifing from the fuppofition of x— o, will be », the other member of the fimple di¬ vifor mx — n. From which this rule is deduced for difeovering fuch a fimple divifor, when there is any. Rule. Subftitute for x in the propofed equation fuc- eeffively the numbers 1, o, — 1 . Find all the divi¬ fors of the fums that refult from this fubftitution, and take out all the arithmetical progreffions you can find amongft them, whofe difference is unit, or fome divi¬ for of the coefficient of the higheft term of the equa¬ tion. Then fuppofe n equal to that term of any one progreffion that arifes from the fuppofition of.x'— o, and m— the forefaid divifor of the coefficient of the higheft term of the equation, which m is alfo the dif¬ ference of the terms of this progreffion; lo ffiall you have mx — n for the divifor required. You may find arithmetical progreffions giving divifors that will not fucceed; but if there is any divifor, it will be found thus by means of thefe arithmetical progreffions. If the equation propofed has the coefficient of its • higheft term =1, then' it will be m— 1, and the divifor will be x — n, and the rule will coincide with that given in the end of the laft chapter, which we demonfti ated after a different manner; for the divifor being x— n, the value of x will be -+•», the term of the progreffion that is a divifor of the fum that arifes from fuppofing x=o. Of this cafe we gave examples in the laft chapter; and though it is eafy to reduce an equation whole higheft term has a coefficient different from unit, to-one where that coefficient ffiall be unit, by p. ; o6. col. 1. par. 6. ; yet, without that reduction, the equation maybe refolved by this rule, as in the following Examp."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"B A L G E R A. i *5 Examp.

Chap. XXI. Of the Methods ly which you may approximate to the Roots of Numeri¬ cal Equations by their Limits. When any equation is propofed to be refolved, firft find the limits of die roots (by chap, ry.) as for ex¬ ample, if the roots of the equation x 3 —i6x-Fjj=o are required, you find the limits are 6, 8. and 17, by p. no. col. 2. par. 2.: that is, the lead root is between, o and 8, and the greateft between 8 and 17.

Write down a feries of fractions whofe deno¬ minators are the numbers in this progreffion, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <bc. continued to the number which expref- fes the dimenfion o«f the equation. Divide every fraction in the feries by that which precedes it, and place the quotients in order over the middle terms of the equation. And, if the fquare of any term mul¬ tiplied into the fraction that ftands over it gives a product greater than the reCtangle of the two adjacent . terms, write under the term the fign +, but if that , product is not greater than the reCtangle, write —; and tha- figns under the extreme terms being +, there will be as many imaginary roots as there are changes of the figns from + to —, and from — to +.

When two or more terms are. wanting in the equation, under the firft of fuch terms place the fign —, under the fecond +, under the third —, and fo on alternately; on¬ ly when the two terms to the right and left of the defi¬ cient terms have contrary figns, you are always to write the fign -f under the laft deficient term.

ALLEGORY, in compofmon, confifts in chufing a Se¬ condary fubjeft, having all its properties and circum- ftances refembling thofe of the principal fubjeft, and deferibing the former in fuch a manner 1 as to reprefent the latter. The principal fubject is thus kept out . of view, and we are left to difcQver it by reflexion. In other words, an allegory is, in every refpeA, fimilavto an hieroglyphical painting, excepting only that words are ufed inftead of colours. Their effects are precife- ly the fame: An hieroglyphic Vaifes two images in the mind; one feen, that reprefents one that is not feen : An allegory does the fame; the reprefentative fubjeft is deferibed; and the refemblance leads us to apply the defeription to the fubject reprefented. . There cannot be a finer or -more correct allegory than the following, in which a vineyard is made to re ptefent God’s own people the Jews “ Thou haft brought a vine out of Egypt; thou “ haft cafb out the heathen, and planted it. Thou “ didft caufe it to take deep root, and it filled the “ land. The hills were covered with its Ihadow, and “ the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. “ Why halt thou then broken down her hedges, fo “ that all that pafs do pluck her ? The boar out of V the wood doth wafte it, and the wild beaft doth de-. “ vour it. Return, we befeech thee, O God of hofts: “ Jook down from heaven, and behold, and vifit this “ vine and the vineyard thy right hand hath planted, “ and the branch thou madeft ftrong for thyfelf.” Ffal. lxxx. Nothing gives greater pleafure than an allegory, when the reprefentative fubjedl bears a ftrong analogy, in all its circumftances, to that which is reprefented. But molt writers are unlucky in their choice, the ana¬ logy being generally fo faint and obfeure, as rather to puzzle than to pleafe. Allegories, as well as meta¬ phors and Emilies, are unnatural in expreffing any fe- vere paifion which totally occupies the mind. For this reafon, the following fpeech of Macbeth is juftly condemned by the learned author of the Elements of Criticifm: Methought I heard a voice cry. Sleep no more !

Alligation Alternate. Alligation alternate, .being the conVerfe of alligation medial, from the rates of the fimpjes, and rate of the mixture given, finds the quantities of thefimples. RULES. I. Place the rate of the mixture on the left fide of a brace, as the root; and on the right fide of the brace fet the rates of the feveral fimples, under one another, as the branches. II. Link or alligate the branches, fo as one greater, and another lefs than the root may be linked or yoked together.. III. Set the difference betwixt the root and the fe¬ veral branches, right againft their refpefitive yoke-fel¬ lows. Thefe alternate differences are the quantities re¬ quired. Note 1. If any branch happen to have two or more yoke-fellows,' the difference ketwixt the root and thefe yoke-fellows muff be placed right againft the faid branch, one after another, and added into one fum. A Note 2. In fome queftions, the branches maybe al- ligated more ways than one; and a queftion will always admit of fo many anfwers, as there are different ways of linking the branches. Alligation alternate admits of three varieties, viz. 1. The queftion may be unlimited, with refpedt both to the quantity of the fimples, and that of the mixture. 2. The queftion may be limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the fimples. 3. The queftion may be li¬ mited to a certain quantity of the mixture. Variety I. When the queftion is unlimited, with refpefit both to the quantity of the fimples, and that of the mixture, this is called Alligation Simple. Examp. A grocer would mix fugars, at yd. 7 d. and 10 d. per 16 . fo as to fell the mixture or compound at 8-d. per 16 .- What quantity of each muft he take ? ! ~Y 7> J 2 10^3, I lb. 1 2 2 I 4 fide of the brace, as the root; and on the right fide of the fame brace are fet the rates of the feveral fimples, viz. 5, 7, 10, under one another, as the branches; according to Rule I. The branch 10 being greater than the root, is alligated or linked with 7 and 5, both thefe being lefs than the root; as direfted in Rule II. The difference, between the root-8 and the branch 4, viz. 3, is fet right againft this branch’s yoke-fellow 10. The difference between' 8 and 7 is likewife fet right a- gainft the yoke-fellow 10. And the difference betwixt 8 and 10, viz. 2, is fet right againft the two yoke-fel¬ lows 7 and 5; as prefcribed by Rule III. As the branch 10 has two differences on the right, viz. 3 and 1, they are added; and the anfwer to'the queftion is, that 2 16 . at 5 d. 2 16 . at 7 d.and 416. at 10 d. will make the mixture required. The truth and reafon of the rules will appear by con- fidering, that whatever is loft upon any one branch is gained upon its yoke-fellow. Thus, in the above ex¬ ample, by felling 4 16 . of 10 d. fugar at 8 d. per 16 . there is 8 d. loft: but the like fum is gained upon its two yoke-fellows; for by felling 2 16 . of y d. fugar at 8 d. per 16 . there is 6 d. gained; and by felling 2 16 . of 7 d. fugar at 8 d. there is 2 d. gained; and 6 d. and 2 d. make 8 d. Hence it follows, that the rate of the mixture muft always be mean or middle with refped to the rates of the fimples; that is, it muft be lefs than the greateft, and greater than the leaft; otherwife a folution would be impolliblc. And the price of the total quantity mix¬ ed, computed at the rate of the mixture, will always be equal to the fum of the prices of the feveral quantities caft up at the refpe&ive rates of the fimples. Variety II. When the queftion is limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the fimples, this is called Alligation Partial. If the quantity of one of the fimples only be limited, s’ligate the branches,, and take their differences, as if there had been no fuch limitation ; and then work by the following proportion. h\\ the difference right againft the rate of the Ample whofe quantity is given, To the other differences refpeflively; So the quantity given, To the feveral quantities fought. Examp. A diftiller would, with 40 gallons of bran¬ dy at 12 s. per gallon,' mix rum at '7 s. per gallon, and gin at 4 s. per gallon: How much of the rum and gia muft he take, to fell the mixture at 8 s. per gallon ?

Eut the queftion limits the quantity of brandy to 40 gallons; therefore fay. If 5 : 4 : : 40 : 32 The quantity of gin, by the operation, being alfo 4, the proportion needs not be repeated. Variety III. When the queftion is limited to a certain quantity of the mixture, this is called Alligation Total. After linking the branches, and taking the differences, work by the proportion following, As the fum of the differences. To each particular difference; So the given total of the mixture.

ALTAMURA, a city in the kingdom of Naples, at the foot of the Apennines. E. long. 17 0 . N. lat. 41 °. .ALTAR, a place upon which lacrifices were anciently offered to fotne deity. The heathens at firft made their altars only turf; afterwards they were made of done, of marble, of wood, and even of horn, as that of Apollo in Dtelos. Altars differed in figure as well as in materials. Some were round, others fquare, and others oval. All of them were turned towards the eaft, and flood lower than the flatues of the gods, and were generally ad¬ orned with fculpture, inferiptions, and the leaves and flowers of the particular tree confecrated to the deity. Thus, the altars of Jupiter were decked with oak,, thofe of Apollo with-laurel, thofe of Venus with myr¬ tle, and thofe of Minerva with olive. The height of altars alfo differed according to the different gods to whom they facrificed. Thole of the celeftisl gpds were raided to a great height above the ground; thofe appointed, for the terreflrial, were al- mofi on a level with the furface of the earth. On the contrary, they dug a hole for the altars of the in¬ fernal gods. Before temples were in ufe, altars were. eredled fometimes in groves, fometiffies in the highways, and fometimes on the tops of mountains ; and it was a cuftom to engrave upon them the name, enfign, or character of the deity to whom they were confe¬ crated. In the great temples of ancient Rome, there were ordinarily three altars: The firfl was placed in the, fan&uary, at the foot of the ffatue of the divinity, upon which incenfe was burnt, and libations offered ; the fecond was before the gate of the temple, and upon it they facrificed the victims ; and the third was • a portable altar, upon which were placed the offering and the facred veflels. Befides thefe ufes of altars, the ancients fwore upon them, and fwore by them, in making alliances, confirming treaties of peace, and other folemn occa- fions. Altars alfo ferved as places of refuge to all thofe who fled to them, whatever crime they had committed. Among the Jews, altars in the patriarchal times were very rude. The altar which Jacob fet up at Bethel was nothing but a ftone, which ferved him inftead of a bolder; that of Gideon, a done before his houfe; and the firft which God commanded Mofes to eredt yas probably of earth, or unpolifhed dones, without any iron ; for if any ufe was made of that metal, the altar was declared impure. The principal altars of the Jews were thofe of in¬ cenfe, of burnt-offering, and the altar, or table, for the Jheou-bread. The altar of incenfe was a fmall table of fhittim- wood, covered with plates of gold, of one cubit in length, another in Width, and two in height. 7 ) ALT At the four corners, were four kinds of horns, and all round a little border or crown over it. This was the altar hidden by Jeremiah before the captivity ; and upon it the officiating pried offered, every morning and evening, incenfe of a particular compofition. See plate XI. fig. 2. The altar of burnt-offerings was made of Shittim- wood, and carried upon the moulders of the prieds by daves of the fame wood, overlaid with brafs. In the time of Mofes, this altar was five cubits fquare, and three high ; but in Solomon’s temple it was much lar¬ ger, being twenty.cubits fquare, and ten in height. It was covered with brafs; and at each corner was a horn or fpire wrought out of the fame wood with the altar, to which the facrififces were tied. Within the hollow v/as a grate of brafs, Qn which the fire was made ; through it fell the afhes, and were received in a pan below. At the four corners of the grate were four rifigs, and four chains, which kept it up at the horns. This altar was placed in the open air, that the fmoke of the burnt-offerings might not fully the infide of the tabernacle. See plate XI. fig. 3. The altar, orjable for the fhew-bread, was like- wife of fhittim-wood, covered \\fith plates of gold, having a little border round it, adorned with fculp- ture.- It was two cubits long, one wide, and one and an half in height. Upon this table, which dood in the holy of holies, were put, every fabbath-day, twelve loaves, with fait and incenfe. The Jewifh altars, after the return from the capti¬ vity, and the building of the fecond temple, were in fome refpedts different from thpfe deferibed above. That of bumt-offerings was a large pile, built of unliewn /tones, thirty-two cubits fquare at the bot¬ tom, and twenty-four fquare at the top. The afeent was by a gentle rifing, thirty-two cubits, in length, and fix teen in breadth. Altar is alfo ufed among Chriffians for the commu¬ nion-table. See Communion-table.

At Whitby, in Yorkfhire, alum is made thus : Having burnt a quantity of the ore with whins, or wood, till it becomes white, then they barrow it in a pit, where it is deeped in water for eight or ten hours. This liquor, or lixivium, is conveyed by troughs to the alum-houfe, into cilterns, and from them into the pans, where it is boiled about 24 hours. They add a certain quantity of the Ice of kelp ; the whole is drawn off into a fetder ; whete having remained about an hour, that the fulphnr and. other dregs may have time to fettle to the bottom, it is conveyed into coolers. This done, to every tun of the liquor they add about eight gallons of mine; and having Hood four days and nights, till quite cool, the alum begins to crydallize on the fides of the vef- fel, from which being feraped off* it is waflied with fair water, and then thrown in a bing, to let the water drain off After this it is thrown into a pan, called the roching pan, and there melted; in which date it is conveyed by troughs into tuns, where it Hands about 10 days, till perfectly condenfed. Then Having the tuns, the alum is taken.out, chipped, and carried to the dore-houfes.

AMBARVALJA, in antiquity, a ceremony among the Romans, when, in order to procure from the gods an happy harveft, they conducted the victims thrice round the corn-fields in proceflion, before facrificing them. Ambarvaiia were either of a private or pu¬ blic nature : the private were performed by the mafter of a family ; and the public by the priefts who offici¬ ated at the folemnity, called fratres arvales. The prayer preferred on this occafion, the formula of which we have in Cato, de Re Ruff. cap. .cxlii. was called carmen ambarvale. At thefe fealts they facrificed to Ceres a fow, a Iheep, and a bull, or heifer, whence they take the name of fuovetaurilia. The method of celebrating them, was to lead a viCHm round the fields, while the peafants accompa¬ nied it, and one of their number, crowned with oak, hymned forth the praifes of Ceres, in verfes compo- fed on purpofe.

When fubjedted to a chemical analyfis, it firlt yields a fubacid water, afterwards .a yellow fetid oil, and a vo¬ latile fait; what remains in the retort, is a black, light, friable matter, refembling the bitumen Judai- cum. Amber is chiefly found in Pruffia, and in the Bal¬ tic fea, near the fhore of Sudavia, where it is found fwimming on the furface of the water, and is taken in nets.

ANABAPTISTS, a fed! or denomination of Chriftians, who deduce their original from the apoftolic age. This name was given them by their opponents, foon af¬ ter the Reformation, by way of fcorn, and imports re- baptizing ; but this charge they difclaim, by denying that the fprinkling, or pouring of water, upon infants has any relation at.all to the fcripture-ordinance of baptifm, either as to its fubjefls or mode. Though they believe the falvation of eledt infants ; yet they deny their being the proper fubjedls of bap¬ tifm : Becaufe they can find neither precept nor ex¬ ample for fuch a pradtice in the N.

Mark xvi. 16.: Becaufe the apoftles, in execu¬ ting Chrift’s commiflion, never baptized any but thofe who were firft inftrudted in the Chriftian faith, andpro- fefl’ed their belief of it, Adis ii. 41. viii.-12. xviii. 8,: And becaufe the nature and defign of the ordinance is fuch as can be of no advantage to infants, it being a fign and reprefentation of fpiritual bleflings, intended to imprefs the mind of the perfon baptized with a com¬ fortable fenfe of what is figniffed thereby, 1 Pet, iii. 21.; and as infants can neither difeern the fign nor the thing fignified, fo they think they can reap no be¬ nefit from it, any more than from the Lord’s fupper, or any other ordinance of the gofpdl. They repell the argument drawn from circumcifion, by diftinguifhing betwixt the Old and New Teftament difpenfations, and betwixt the natural and fpiritual feed of Abraham, Rom. ix. 8. Gal. iv. 22, 23, 28,31. and maintain, that as circumcifion belonged to the car¬ nal birth, fo baptifm belongs only to the fpiritual birth, or thefe nuho are of faith , Gal. iii 7. Our Lord’s words in Mark x. 13, 14. they corfider as having no relation to infant-baptifm, as lie there nei¬ ther injoins nor exemplifies it; and they diltinguifli be¬ twixt thofe who may be fubjedls of the kingdom of heaven in God s fight, and thefe whom he points out to us as proper vilible fubjedls of gofpel-ordinanccs.

The internal layer is every where nearly of a fimilar ftruCture, and has its fibres in the fame direction with thofe of the bone to which they are contiguous. Except where mufcles, cartilages, or ligaments, are inferted into the periofteum, its external furface is con¬ nected to the furrounding parts by thin cellular mem¬ branes,, which can eauly be ftretched confiderably, but Vol. I.

Of iuch parts of the body as are not comprehended in any of the above, e. g. The Brain, Thorax, Abdomen, &r<± ire. T I. BONES. Ihorten themfelves whenever the ftretching force is re moved. When the periofteum is torn off from bones, we fee a great number of white threads produced from that mem-, brane into them; and after a fuccefsful injection of the arteries with a red liquor, numerous veffels are not only feen on the periofteum, but moft of the fibres fent from the membrane to the bone fliew themfelves to be, veffels entering it, with the injected liquor in them; and when they are broken, by tearing off the periofteum, the fur- face of the bone is almoft covered with red points. The great fenfibility of die periofteum in the deep- feated fpecies of paronychia, in exoftofes, nodi, tophi, and guriimata, from a lues venerea, or whenever this membrane is in an inflamed ftate, is a fufficient proof that it is well provided with nerves; though they are perhaps too final 1 to be traced. The chief ufes of the periofteum are: 1. To allow the mufcles, when they contract or are ftretched, to move O 0 and"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"1 4 6 A N A T a nd flideeafily upon the bones. 2. To keep in due or¬ der,. and ta .'fupport the veffels in their paffage to the bones. 3. By being firmly braced on the bones, to afi- fid in fetting limits to their increafe, and to check their overgrowth. 4. To ftrengthen the CQnkiiidtion of the bones with their; epiphyfes, ligaments, and cartilages, which are eafily feparated in young creatures, when this membrane is taken away.. 5. To afford'convenient ori¬ gin and infertion to feveral mufcles which are fixed to this membrane. And,, laftly, to warn us when any in¬ jury is offered to the parts it covers. The Bones are the mod hard and folid parts of the body, and generally of a white colour • only in a living creature they are bluifh, which is owing to the blood in the fmall veffels under their fur face. Bones are compofed of a great many plates, each of which is made up of fibres or ftrings united by fmaller fi¬ brils; which being irregularly difpofed and interwoven with the other larger fibres, make a reticular work.- This texture is plainly feen in the bones^of fcetufes, which have not their parts clofely compared, and in the ' bones of adults, which have been burnt, long expofed to the weather, or whofe compofition has been made loofe by difeafes. The plates are faid to be firmly joined to each other by a great number of claviculi, or fmall bony procefles, which, rifing from the inner plates, pierce through fome, and are fixed into the more external ones. Though the exterior part-of bones is compofed of firm compact plates, yet they are all more or lefs cavernous internally. In fome, the folid fides are brought fo near, that little cavity can be feen ; and in others, the cavities are fo large, that fuch bones are generally efteemed to be hollow or fiflular. But the internal fpongy texture is mod evident in young animals. This fpongy, cavernous, internal part of bones, is ge¬ nerally called their cancelli or lattice-work. The twilling and windings which thefe cancelli make, and the interfaces which they leave, differ confiderably in figure, number, and fize; and therefore form little cells, which are as different, but communicate with each other. The cancelli fuftain the membranous bags of the mar¬ row which are flretched upon them, and thereby hinder thefe membranous parts from being torn or removed out of their proper places, in the violent motions and dif¬ ferent po(lures which the bones are employed in. The depteflions between the fibres of the external plates of bones appear like fo many furrows on their fur- face, into each of which the periofleum enters. Both on the ridges and furrows, numerous little pits or orifices of canals are to be feen, by which the ve ffels pafs to and from the bones. After a fuccefsful injection, the arteries can be traced in their courfe from the pits to the plates and fibres. We may conclude, from arteries being accompanied with veins, fo far as we can trace them in every other part of the body, that there are alfo veins in the bones. The bones of a living animal are fo infenfible that they can - b e cut, tafped, or burnt, without putting the crea¬ ture to pain, and the nerves diflributed in their fubftance O M Y. Part I. Cannot be (hewn by diffe&ion; from \\viijch it mlghti be inferred, that they have.no nerves diflributed to them : But the general tenor of nature, which beftows ner.ve3 to all the other parts, fhould prevent our drawing fuch a conclufion. The vafcular texture of bones mull make them fubjeft to obflrudtions, ecchymofes, ulcers, gangrenes, and mod Other difeafes which the fofter parts are affe&ed with ; and therefore there may be a greater variety of caries than is commonly deferibed. On the internal fnrface of the folid parts of bones, there are orifices of canals, which pafs outwards through the plates to open into other canals that are in a longitu¬ dinal direction, from which other tranfverfe pafTages go cut to terminate in other longitudinal canals.; and this flrudlure is continued through the whole fubflance of bones, both thefe kinds of canals becoming fmaller gradually as they approach the outer furface.—Thefe canals arc to be feen to the bed advantage in a bone burnt till it is white: When it is broken tranfverfely, the orifices of the longitudinal canals are in view; and when we fepa- rate the plates, the tranfverfe ones are to be obferved. Mod bones have one or more large oblique canals formed through their fides for the pafiage of the medul¬ lary veffels. The bones fuflain and defend the other parts of the body Bones are lined within, as well as covered externally, with a membrane; which is therefore commonly called periofleum. internum, The internal periodeum is an extremely fine mem¬ brane ; nay, frequently it has a loofe reticular texture; and therefore it is compared by fome to the arachnoide coat of the fpir.al marrow: fo that we cannot expedl to divide it into layers as we can divide the external perio¬ deum. We can, however, obferve its procefTes enter- ing into the tranfverfe pores of the bones, where proba-. bly they are continued to form the immediate canals for the marrow diflributed through the fubdance of the bones; and along with them veffels are fent, as from the external periodetim, into the bone. Thefe procefles being of a very delicate texture, the adhefion of this membrane to the bone is fo fmall, that it feparates com¬ monly more eafily from the bone than from the marrow which it contains. From the internal furface of the internal periodeum, a great number of thin membranes are produced ; which, palling acrofs the cavity, unite with others of the fame kind, and form fb many diftindt bags, which communi¬ cate with each other; and thefe again are fubdivided into communicating veficular cells, in which the marrow is ■ contained. The Marrow is the oily part of the blood, feparated by fmall arteries, and depofited in thefe cells. Its co¬ lour and confidence may therefore vary according to the date of the veffels, and their diftribution on the mem¬ branes of the cells. Befides the arteries already mentioned as being fent from the bones to the marrow, there'is at lead one ar¬ tery for each bone; feveral bones have mere, whofe prin¬ cipal ufe is to convey and fecern this oily matter. The"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Part I. A N A 1 The blood, which remains after the fecrstion of the marrow, is returned by proper veins, which are collected from the membranes into one or two large trunks, to pafs out at the fame holes at which the arteries enter. The veflels of the marrow, wrapt up in one common coat from the periofteum, pafs through the bones by pro¬ per canals ; the moll confiderable of which are about the middle of each bone, and are very oblique. From the flrudhtre of the contents of the bones, we may judge how thefe parts, as well as others, may be fubjeft to oidema, phlegrpon, eryfipelas, fchirrhus, <bc. and may thence be led to a cure of each, before the com¬ mon confequence, putrefaction, takes place, and fre¬ quently occafions the lofs of the limb, if not of the pa¬ tient. The marrow is of very confiderable ufe to the bones; for by entering their tranfverfe canals, and palling from them into the longitudinal ones, it is communicated to all the plates, to foften and connect their fibres, whereby they are preforved from becoming too brittle. When the marrow, after having ferved the ufes men¬ tioned, is reaflumed into the mafs of blood, ir correds the too great acrimony communicated to the faline particles of our fluids by their circulation and heat; in the fame manner as lixivial falts are blunted by oil in making foap. Since it is the nature of all oil to become thin and rancid when expofed long to heat, and bones have much oil in their firm hard fubftance, we may know why an ungrateful fmell, and dark-coloured thin ichor, proceed more from corrupted bones than from other parts of' the body; and we can underhand the reafon of the changes of colour which bones undergo, according to thtir differ¬ ent degrees of mortification. Though bones fo far agree in their flrttchire and an¬ nexed parts, yet we may obferve a confiderable differ¬ ence among them in their magnitude, figure, flotation, fubftance, connexion, ufes, <bc. Of thefe we Ihall only mention two, viz. that fomc bones are broad and fiat, while others are long and round. The broad bones have thin fidcs, by the plates being foon and equally fent off to form the lattice-work; which therefore is thicker, and nearly of an equal form all through. By this ftru&urc, they are' well adapted to their ufes, of affording a large enough furface for the mufcles to rife from, .and move upon, and of defending fufficiently the parts which they inclofe. The round bones have thick ftrong walls in the mid¬ dle, and become very thin towards their ends, which - is owing to very few plates feparating at their middle-; where. On that account, the cancelli are fo.lme and fmall that they are not taken notice of: But fuch bones are faid to have a large refer voir of oil in this place. Towards their ends the lattice -wot k becomes very thick, and ra¬ ther more complete than in the other fort of bones. — ' Thefe round bones having ftrong forces naturally arplied to them, and being otherwife expefed to violent i r'-juries, have need of a cylindrical figure to refill external pref- fure, and of a confiderable quantity of oil to preferve them from bee ming too brittle. Bcfides which, they are advantage-cully provided with thick lides towards their middle, where tire greateft forces are applied to injure O M Y. 147 them; while their hollownefs increafes th?ir diameter, and confequently their ftrength, to refill forces applied to break them tranfverfely. Many bones have protuberances, or procefles, riling out from them. If a procefs Hands out in a roundilh ball, it is called caput , or head .—If the head is flatted, it obtains the appellation of condyle.- -A rough une¬ qual protuberance is called tuleroftty. -When a pro- cels rifes narrow, and then becomes large, the narrow or fmall part is named cervix, or neck. -Long ridges of bones are called fpines. -Such procefles as termi¬ nate in a Iharp point, have the general name of corona, or coronoid, bellowed on them, though moll of them receive particular names from the refemblance they have, or are imagined to have, to other fubftances, e. g. ma- Jloid, Jlyloid, &c.-Such procefles as form brims of cavities, are called fupercilia. Procefles ferve for the advantageous origin and infer- tion of mufcles, and render the articulations firm and liable. In children thefe procefles are real epiphyfes, or di- flinht bones, which are afterwards united to the other arts ; fuch are the ftyloid procefles of the temporal ones, procefles of the vertebras, trochanters of the thigh, &c. On the furfaces of a great many of the bones there are cavities, or depreflions: If thefe are deep, with large brims, authors name them cotyla; if they are fuperficial, they obtain the defignation of glen a, or gle¬ noid. Thefe general claffes are again divided into feve- ral fpecLs Of which pits are fmall roundilh channels funk perpendicularly into the bone ; —-furrows are long narrow canals, formed in the furface ;—nitches or notches, fmall breaches in the bone; \\~ftnucfttics, broad, but fu¬ perficial depreflions without brims ',—fojja, large deep cavities, which are not equally furrounded by high brims ; / unifies, large cavities within the fubftance of the bones, with filial 1 apertures foramina, or holes, canals that pierce quite through the fubftance of the bones.-When this laft fort of cavity is extended any long way within a bone, the middle part retains the name of canal, and its ends are called holes . • The cavities allow the heads of bones to play in them ; they lodge and defend other parts ; they afford fafe paf- fage to veflels, muldes, <bc. To far the greater number of bones, whofe ends are not joined to other bones by an immoveable articula¬ tion, there are fmaller ones annexed, which afterwards become fcarce diftinguifliable from the fubftance of the bone itfeif. Thefe are called epiphyfes, or appendices. Some bones have one, others have two, three, or four of thefe appendices annexed by the means of cartilages, which are of a confiderable thicknefs in children, but by age become thinner. Several procefles (e. g. trochanters of the thigh, fpine of the fcupula. See.) have epiphyfes; and procefles fre¬ quently rife ont from epiphyfes ; for example, at the lower end of the femur, ulna, tibia, dr. The epiphyfes are united chiefly to fueh bones as are deftined for frequent and violent motion ; and for this purpofe they are wifely framed of a larger diameter than the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"’'148 A N A the bone they belong to; for by this means, the furface ■ of contact between the- two bones of' any articulation be¬ ing, increafed, -their ccnjunftiori becomes'firmer, and the muffles inlerted iiito t hem aft with greater force, byrea- fon of their axes being further removed from the center of motion. The foftnefs of the ends of bones maybe of fome advantage in the womb, and at birth, after which the of- fification begins at different points to form epiphyfes, before the offification can extend from the middle to the ends of the bones. However folid and compaft adult bones are, yet they were once cartilages, membranes, nay, a mere jelly. This needs no further proof, than repeated obfervations of embryos when diflefted: And how much more tender ■ fcuft the bones be before that time, when neither knife nor eye is capable to difeover the lea/1: rudiments of them ? By degrees they become more folid, then affume the nature of griftles, and at laft ofiify ; the cohefion of their plates and fibres always increafing in proportion to their inereafed folidities ; as is evident from the time necefiary to unravel the texture of bones of people of different ages, or of denfe and of fpongy bones, or of the different parts of the fame bone, and from the more tedious exfoliations of the bones of adults than of children. The offification of bones depends principally on their veffels being fo difpofed, and of fuch diameters,* as to fe- parate a liquor, which may eafily turn into a bony fub¬ ftance, when it is deprived of its thinner parts; as feems plain from the obfervation of the callous matter feparated after fraftures and ulcers, where part of the bone is taken out: For in thefe cafes, the veffels extend¬ ing themfelves, and the liquors added to them, are gradually formed into granulated fifth; which fills up all the fpace where the bone is taken from, then hardens, till it becomes as firm as any other part of the bone. This happens frequently, even when the ends of the difeafed bone are at ,a confiderable diftance from each other. The induration of bones is alfo greatly affifted by their being expofed, more,than any other parts, to the ftrong preffure of the great weights they fupport, to the violent contraction of the mufcles fixed to them, and to the force of the parts they contain, which endeavour to make way for their own further growth. By all this prefiing force, the folid fibres and veffels of bones are ^ thru ft clofer ; and fuch particles of the fluids coqveyed in thefe veffels as are fit to be united to the fibres, are fooner and more firmly incorporated with them, while the re¬ maining fluids are forcibly driven out by the veins, to be mixed with the mafs of blood. In confequence of this, the veffels gradually diminifh as the bones harden. From which again we can underftarid one reafon, why the bones of young anipials fooner re-unite after a frac¬ ture than thofe of old ; and why cattle that are put too foon to hard labour, feldom are of fuch large fize as others of the fame brood, who are longer kept from labour. From the e hefts of preffure only it is, that we can ac¬ count for the bones of old people having their fidgs T O M Y. Part I. much thinner, yet more denfe and folid, while the cavi¬ ties are much larger than in thofe of young people; and for the prints of mufcles, vftfels, fisc. being fo much more flrongly marked on the furfaces of the former than of the latter, if they belong to people of near the fame condition in life.—Preffure muff likewife be the caufe, which, in people of equal ages, makes thefe prints ftronger in the bones of thofe who had much labour and exercife, than they are in people who have led an indo¬ lent unaftive life. Having thus confldered the bones when Angle, we /hall next /hew the different manner of their conjunc¬ tions. To exprefs thefe, anatomifts have contrived a great number of technical terms; about the meaning, propriety, and clafling of which, there has been a variety of opinions. Some of thefe terms it is neceffary to re¬ tain, fince they ferve to exprefs the various circumftan- ces of the articulations, and to underffand the writers on this fubjeft. The Articulations are moft commonly divided into three claffes, viz. fymphyfis, fynarthrofis, and diar- throGs. Symphyfis, which properly fignifies the concretion or growing together of parts, tVhen ufed to exprefs the ar¬ ticulations of bones, does not feem to comprehend, un¬ der the meaning generally given to it, any thing relating to the form or motion of the conjoined bones ; but by it moft authors only denote the bones to be connefted by fome other fubftance ; and as there are different fubftan- ces which ferve this purpofe, therefore they divide it in¬ to the three following fpecies: 1. Sytiebondrojir, when a cartilage is the Connefting fubftance: Thus the ribs are joined to the fternum; thus the bodies of the vertebra are connefted to each other; as are likewife the ofla pubis. 2. Synneurofu , or fyndefmojts, when ligaments are the connefting bodies, as they are in all the moveable articulations. 3. Syjfarcojii, when mufcles are ftretched from one bone to another, as they muft be where there are move¬ able joints. ’ x The fond clafs of articulations, the fynarthrofis, which is faid to be the general term by which the im¬ moveable conjunftion of bones is expreffed, is divided into three kinds. 1. The future is that articulation where two bones are mutually indented into each other, or as if they were fewed together. Thus the bones of the head are joined - thus epiphyfes are joined to the bones, before their full conneftion and union with them. 2. Gomphojis is the fixing one bone into anothjr, as a nail is fixed in a board : Thus the teeth are fecured in their fockets. 3. Schindylejis, or ploughing, when a thin lamella of one bone is received into a long narrow furrow of ano¬ ther : Thus the proceffus azygos of the fphenoid, and the nafal procefs of the ethmoid bone; are received by the vomer. The third clafs, or diarthroJtSj is the articulation where the bones are fo loofely connefted as to allow large motion. This is fubdivided into three kinds. The"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Part T. ANA' • The firft is enarthrofss, or the ball and focket, when a large head is received into a deep cavity; as the head of the os femoris is ir\\to the acetabulum coxen- dicis. The fecond is arthrodia, when a round head is re¬ ceived into a fuperficial cavity; as in the articulation of the arm-bone and fctipula. Thefe two Ipecies of diar- throfis allow motion to all fides. The third is ginglimus, which properly fignifies the hinge of a door or window; in-it the parts of the bones mutually receive and are received, and allow of motion two ways : Workmen call it charnal. *The ginglimus is generally divided into three kinds, to which fome give the names of contiguous, dijiant, and compound. ■ The firft kind of ginglimus is, when a bone has feve- ral protuberances and cavities, which anfwer to as many cavities and procefles of the other bone, with which it is articulated; as in the conjunction of the femur with the tibia. The fecond Ipecies is, when a bone receives another at one end, and is received by the fame bone at the other end ; as in the radius and ulna. The laft fort is, when a bone receives another, and is received by a third; as in the oblique procefles of the vertebrae. If the nwveable bones are not connected and kept firm by fome ftrong fubftance, they would be luxated at every motion of the joints: and if their hard, roogh, unequal., liirfaces were to play on each other,, their motion would not only be difficult, but the lofs of fubftance from attri¬ tion would be great. Therefore ligaments are made to obviate the firft, and cartilages to prevent the other in- convenieney. But becaufe ligaments and cartilages turn rigid, inflexible, and rough, unlefs they are kept moift, a fufficient quantity oT proper liquor is fupplied for their lubrication, and to preferve them in a flexible ftate. Seeing then thefe parts are fo ncceflary to the articula¬ tions, we fliall next’ conlider their ftrudurc, fituation, and ufes, fo far as they are fubfervient to the bones, and their motions. \\ Ligaments are white flexible bodies, thicker and firm¬ er than membranes, and not fo hard or firm as cartilages, without anyreniarkable cavityin their fubftance, difficult¬ ly ftrctched, and with little elafticity ; Serving to conned one part to another, or to prevent the parts to which they are-fixed from being removed out of that fituation which is ufeful and fafe. . After maceration in water, the ligaments can cafily be divided; and each ligamentous layer appears compofed of fibres, the largeft of which are difpofed in a longitu- ** tiinal dire£i-«m. The arteries of ligaments arc very confpicuous after a tolerable injection, and the larger trunks of their veins arc fome times, to be iecn full of blood Such ligaments as form the fidcs of cavities, have nu¬ merous orifices of their arteries opening upon their inter- nal.furface, which keep it always moift: If wc rub off, that moiftnre, and then prefs the ligament, wc can fee the liquor ouzing out from fmall pores; and we can Von. I. Ko. 7. \"3 O M Y. 149 .force thin liquors, injeded by tqe arteries, into the - cavi¬ ties farmed by ligaments. Thefe exhalent arteries muft have correfponding ab- forbent veins, otherwife the cavities would foon be too full of liquor. Ligaments then muft be fubjed to the difeafes com¬ mon to other parts, where there if a circulation of fluids, allowance always being made for the fize of vcffels, na¬ ture of the fluids, and firmnefs of the texture of each part. Some authors have alledged, that ligaments are infen- fible, and confequently that they have no nerves. But the violent racking pain felt on the leaft motion of a joint labouring under a rheumatifm, the feat of which difeafe feems often to be in the ligaments, and the infuf- ferable torture occafioned by inckions of ligaments, and by a collection of acrid matter in a joint, or by tophi in the gout, would perfuade us, that they are abundantly fupplied with nerves. The ligaments which conned the moveable bones commonly rife from the conjunction of the epiphyfes of the one bone, and are inferted into the lame place of the other; or where epiphyfes are not, they come out from the cervix, and beyond the fupercilia of the arti¬ culated bones; and after fuch a manner, in both cafes, as to include the articulation in a purfe or bag; with this difference, depending on their different motions, that where the motion is only to be in two diredions, the li¬ gaments are ftrongeft on thofe Tides towards which the bones are' not moved; and when a great variety of mo¬ tions is defigned to be allowed, the ligaments are weak¬ er than in the former fort of articulations, and are near¬ ly of the fame ftrength all round. Part of the capful ;>r ligaments is compofed of' the pe- riofteum, continued from one bone to another, and their internal layer is continued- on the parts of the bone or cartilage which the ligament includes. _ Befides thefe common capfular ligaments of the joints* there are particular ones in feveral places, either for the firmer connedion of the articulated bones, or for reftraining and.confining the motion to fome one fide; fuch are the crofs and lateral ligaments of the knee, the round one of the thigh, &c. From this account of the ligaments, we may conclude, that, ceeteris paribus, in whatever articulation the liga-. ments are few, long, and weak, the motion is more free and quick; but luxations happen frequently: And, on the contrary, where the ligaments are numerous, Ihort,. and ftrong, the motion is more confined ; but fuch a joint is lefs expofed to luxations.—Whence we may judge'how neccffary it is to attend to the different liga¬ ments, and the changes which have been made on therm by a luxation, when it is to be reduced. Ligaments alfo fupply the. place of bones in feveral ca¬ fes to advantage : Thus the parts in the pelvis are more fafely fupported below by ligaments, than they could, have been by bone.—The ligaments placed in the great holes of the offa innominata, and between the bones of the fore-arm and leg, afford convenient origin to muf- cles.—Immoveable bones are firmly conneded bv them Pp ' off"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"15© A N A T of which the conjunction of the os facrum and innomi- natum is an example.—They afford a focket for move¬ able bones to play in, as we fee part of the aftraga- 'lus does on the ligament ftretched from the heel-bone to the fcaphoid. Numerous inconveniencies may arife from too long or fhort, ftrong or weak, lax or rigid ligaments. Cartilages are foiid, fmooth, white elaftic fub- flances, between the hardnefs of bones and ligaments, and covered with a membrane, named perichondrium , which is of the fame ftrudurc and ufe to them as the pe- riofleum is to the bones. Cartilages are compofed of plates, which are formed of fibres, difpofed much in the fame way as thofe of bones are ; as might be reafonably concluded from obfer- ving bones in a cartilaginous ftate before they oflify, and from feeing, on the other hand, fo many cartilages be¬ come bony. This may be fill further confirmed, by the exfoliation which cartilages are fubjed to, as well as bones. The perichondrium of feveral cartilages, for example, thofe of the ribs and larynx, has arteries which can be equally well injeded with thofe of the perioftcum. The grannlated fldh which rifes from the ends of me¬ tacarpal or metatarfal bones, when the cartilage exfoli¬ ates, after a finger or toe has been taken off at the firft joint, is very fenfible, from which the exigence of nerves in cartilages may be inferred. While cartilages are in a natural ftate, it is to be re¬ marked, firft, That they have no cavity in their middle fur marrow. Secondly, That their outer furface is foft- eft, which renders them more flexible. Thirdly, That they do not appear to change their texture near fo much by acids as bones do. And, laftly, That as the fpecific gravity of cartilages is near a third lefs than that of bones, fo the cohefion of their feveral plates is not fo ftrong as in bones ; whence cartilages laid bare in wounds ©r ulcers, are not only more liable to corrupt, but exfo¬ liate much fooner than bones do. Cartilages feem to be principally kept from oflifying, either by being fubjeded to alternate motions of flexion and extenfion, the effects cf which are very different from any kind of Ample preflure, or by being conftantly moif- tened: Thus, the cartilages on the articulated ends of •tfie great bones cf the limbs, and the moveable ones placed between the moving bones in fame articulations, which are obliged to fuffer many and different flexions, and are plentifully moiftened, fcarce ever change into bone ; while thofe of the ribs and larynx are often of- fified. \"The cartilages fubfervient to bones, are fometimes found on the ends of bones which are joined to no other; but are never wanting on the ends, and in the cavities of fuch bones as are defigned for motion. The ufes of cartilages, fo far as they regard bones, are, to allow, by their fmoothnefs, fuch bones as are de¬ figned for motion, to Aide eafily without detrition, while, by their flexibility, they accommodate themfelvcs to the feveral figures ncceffary in different motions, and, by their elafticity, they recover their natural pofition. and fhape as foon as the preflure is removed.- -» O M Y. Part I, This fpringy force may alfo afiift the motion of the joint to be more expeditious, and may render (hocks i* Tunning, jumping, he. left.-To thefe cartilages we chiefly owe the fecurity of the moveable articulations : For without them the bony fibres would fprout out, and intimately coalefce with the adjoining bone; whence a true anchylofis muft neceffarily follow ; which never fails to happen when the cartilages are eroded by acrid mat¬ ter, or oflified from want of motion or defed of liquor, as we fee often happens after wounds of the joints, pai- dartlirocece, fcrophula, and fpina ventofa, or from old age, and long immobility of joints. The moveable car¬ tilages interpofed in joints, ferve to make the motions both freer and more fafe than they would otherWife be, -Thofe placed on the ends of bones that are not ar¬ ticulated, as on the fpijie of the os illinm, bafe of the fcapula, 6r. ferve to prevent the bony fibres from grow¬ ing out too far.——‘Cartilages fometimes ferve as liga¬ ments, either to fallen together bones that are immove- ably joined, fuch are the cartilages between the os fa* crum and offa illium, the offa pubis, he. or to conned bones that er/joy manifeft motion, as thofe do which are placed between the bodies of the true vertebrae, he .— Cartilages very often do the office of bones to greater advantage, than thefe laft could, as in the -cartilages of the ribs, thofe which fupply brims to cavities, he. Too great thicknefs or thinnefs, length or fhortnefs, hardnefs or fupplenefs of cartilages, may therefore caufe great diforders in the body. The liquor, which principally ferves to moiften the li¬ gaments and cartilages of the articulations, is fupplied by glands, which are commonly fituated in the joint, after fuch a manner as to be gently prefled, but not deftroyed by its motion. By this means, when there is the great- eft neceffity for this liquor, that is, when the moft fre- 1 quent motions are performed, the greateft quantity of it muft be feparated. Thefe glands are foft and pappy,but not friable: In Tome of the large joints they are of the conglomerate kind, or a great number of fmall glandules are wrapt up in one common membrane. Their excre¬ tory duds are long, and hang loofe, like fo many frin¬ ges, within the articulation; which, by its motion and preflure, prevents obftrudions in the body of the gland or its excretories, and promotes the return of this li¬ quor, when fit to be taken up by the abforbent veffels, which muft be in the joints, as well as in the other cavi¬ ties of the body ; and, at the fame time, the preflure on the excretory duds hinders a fuperfluous unnecefiary fe* cretion, while the fimbriated difpofition of thefe excre¬ tories does not allow any of the fecreted liquor to be pufhed back again by thefe canals towards the glands. Very often thefe fountains of flimy liquor appear only as a net-work of veffels.-Frequently they are almoft concealed by cellular membranes containing the fat;—and fometimes fmall fimple mucous folliculi may be feen. The different joints have thefe organs in different numbers and fizes; the conglomerate ones don’t vary much, efpecially as to fituation, in the fimilar joints of different bodies ; but the others are more uncer¬ tain. Upon prefling any of thefe glands with the finger, one"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Parti. A N A T O M Y. T51 ean fqueeze oat of their excretori.es a mucilaginous li¬ quor, which fomewhat refembles the white of an egg, or feram of the blcocl; but it is manifeftly fait to the tafte. It does not coagulate by acids or by heat, as the ferum does, but by the latter turns firft thinner, and, when evaporated, leaves only a thin fait him. The veffels which fupply liquors for making the fc- eretion of this mucilage, and the veins which bring back, the blood remaining after the fecretion, are to be feen without any preparation; and, after a tolerable injection of the arteries, the glands are covered with them. In a found ftate, we are not confcious of any fenfibili- ty in thofe glands ; but, in fome cafes, when they in¬ flame and fuppurate, the molt racking pain is felt in them : a melancholy, though a fure proof that they have nerves. Thefe mucilaginous glands are commonly lodged in a cellular fubftaace ; which is alfo to be obferved in other parts of the bag formed by the ligaments of the articu¬ lation ; and contains a fatty matter, that mull neceflari- ly be attenuated, and forced through the including mem¬ branes into the cavity of the joint, by the preflure which it fuffers from the moving bones. After the liquor of the articulations becomes too thin and unfervieeable, by being conftantly pounded and rub¬ bed between the moving bones, it is reaflumed into the mafs of .blood by the abforhent vellels. S E C T. II. Of the S K E L E T O N. Among anatomifls, Skeleton is univerfaliy underflood to fignify the bones of animals connt&cd together, after the teguments, rnufdes, bowels, glands, nerves, and vef¬ fels are taken away. A fkeleton is faid to be a natural one, when the bones are kept together by their own ligaments; .and it is cal¬ led artificial, when the bones are joined with wire, or any other fubfiance which is not part of the creature to which they belonged. The human fkeleton is generally divided into the Head, die Trunk, the Superior, and the Inferior Extremities. OF THE HEAD. By the Head is meant all that fpheroidal part whieh is placed above the firft bone of the neck. It therefore comprehends the cranium and bones of the face. The cranium, helmet, or brain-cafe, eonfifts of feveral pieces, which form a vaulted cavity, for lodging and de¬ fending the brain and cerebellum, v/ith their membranes, veffels, and nerves. The cavity of the cranium is proportioned to its con¬ tents. Henee fuch a variety of \"its fize is obferved in different fubjedts ; and hence it is neither fo broad nor fo deep at its fore-part, in which the anterior lobes of the brain are lodged, as it is behind, where the large poflerior lohes of the brain, and the whole cerebellum, arc contained. The external furfaee of the upper part of the cranium is very fmooth, and equal, being only covered with the periofleum, (common to all the bones; but in the fkull, diflinguiflied by the name of pericranium), the thin front - tal and occipital mufcles, their tendinous aponeurofis, and with the common teguments of the body; while the external furfaee of its lower part has numerous rifings, depreiTions, and holes, whieh afford convenient origin and infertion to the mufcles that are connedled to it, and allow fafe paflage for the veffels and nerves that run through and near it. The internal furfaee of the upper part of the fkull is commonly fmooth, except where the veffels of the dura mater have made furrows in it, while the bones were foft.-Surgeons fhould be cautious when they trepan here, left, in fawing or railing the bone where fuch fur¬ rows are, they wound thefe veffels.-In the upper part of the internal furfaee of feveral fkulls, there are likc- wife,pits of different magnitudes and figures, which feem to be formed by fome parts of the brain being more luxu¬ riant and prominent than others. Where thefe pits are, the fkull is fo mueh thinner than any where elfe, that it is often rendered diaphanous, the two tables be¬ ing clofely compared without a diploe; the want of which is fupplied by veffels going from the dura mater into a great many fmall holes obfervable in the pits.-* The knowledge of thefe pits fhould teach furgeons to faw cautioufly and flowly through the external table of the fltull, when they are performing the operation of the tre¬ pan; fince, in a patient whofe cranium has thefe pits, the dura mater and brain may be injured, before the in- ftrument has piereed near the ordinary thicknefs of a table of the fkull.-The internal bafe of the fltull is extremely unequal for lodging the feveral parts and ap¬ pendices of the brain and cerebellum, and allowing paf-> fage and defence to the veffels and nerves that go into, or come out from thefe parts. The bones of the cranium are compofed of two tables, and intermediate cancclli, commonly called their diploe .. The external table is thickeft; the inner, from its thin- nefs and confequent brittlenefs, has got the name of vi~ trea. The diploe has much the fame texture and ufes in the. fkull, as the caneelli have in other bones. The diploe of feveral old fubjedts is fo obliterated,, thatfcarce any veftige of it can be feen; neitheris itob- fervablin fome of the hard'craggy bones at the hafe of the fkull. Hence an ufeful eaution to furgeons who truft to the bleeding, want of refiftance, and change of found,- as certain marks, in the operation cf the trepan, fon knowing when their inftrumer.t has fawed through the firft table, and reached the diploe. The cranium confifts of eight bones, fix of whieh arc faid to be proper, and the other two are reckoned com¬ mon to it and to the face.—The fix proper are, the os frontis, two cfla pnrietalia, two ofTa temporum, and the os occipitis.-The common are, the cs ethmoides, and fphenoides. The os frontis forms the whole fore-part of the vault; the two offa parietalia form the upper and middle part of it; the ofta temporum compofe the lower part of the fides;"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"152 A N A 1 fides ; the'os occipitis makes the whole hinder-part, and dome of the bafe ; the os ethmoidcs is placed in the fore¬ part of the bafe; and the os fphenoides is in the middle -of it. Thefe bones are joined to each other by five futures; the names of which aie, the coronal, lambdoid, fagittal, and two fquamous. The coronal future is extended over the head, from within an inch or fo of the external canthus of one eye, to the like diftance from the - other; which being near the plaee where the ancients wore their vittae, coronas, or garlands, this future has hence got its nime.—-Though the indentations, of this future are confpicuous in its up¬ per part, yet an inch or more of its end on each fide has none of them ; for it is fquamous and fmooth there. - The lamb'doidal future begins fome way below, and farther back than the vertex or crown of the head, whence its two legs are ftretched obliquely downwards, and to each fide; in the form of the Greek letter a, and are generally faid to extend themfelves to the bafe of the fitul I. This future is fometimes very irregular, being made lip of a great many fmall futures, whieh furround fo many little bones that are generally larger and more con¬ fpicuous on the external fur face of the flcull than inter¬ nally. Thefe bones are generally called triquetra, or Wormiana. The fagittal future is placed longitudinally, in the middle of the upper part of the fkull, and commonly ter¬ minates at the middle of the coronal, and of the lamb¬ doid futures; between which it is faid to be placed, as an arrow is between the firing and bow.—However, this future is frequently continued through the middle of the os frohtis, down to the root of the nofe; which oft- ener happens in women than men. The fquamous agglutinations, or falfe futures, are one on each fide, a little above the ear, of a femicircular fi¬ gure, formed by the overlopping (like one feale upon an¬ other) of the upper part of the temporal bones, on the lower part of the parietal, where, in both bones, there are a great many fmall rifings and furrows, which are in¬ dented into each other; though thefe inequalities do not appear till the bones are feparated The bones of the fkull are joined to thofe of the face by fchyndekfis and futures.—The fchyndclefis is in the partition of the nofe.—-—The futures faid to be common to the cranium and face are five, viz. the ethmoidal, fphencidal, tranfverfe, and two zygomatic.—Parts how¬ ever of thefe futures are at the junction of only the bones of the fkull. The ethmoidal and fphenoidal futures furround the bones of thefe names ; and in fohie places help to make up other futures, particularly the fquamous and trarif- verfe ; and, in other parts, there is but one future com¬ mon to thefe two bones.. The tranfverfe future is extended quite crofs the face, from the external canthus of.one orbit, to the fame place of the other. The zygomatic futures are one on each fide, being fiiort, and flaming from above obliquely, downwards and backwards, to join a procefs of the cheek-bone to one of O M Y. Parti. the temporal bones, which advances towards the face; fo that the two procefles thus united, form a fort of bridge or jugum, under whieh the temporal mufele paflfes; on which account the procefles, and futures joining them, have been called zygomatic. The advantages of the futures of the cranium are thefe: i. That this capfula is more eafily formed and ex¬ tended into a fpherical figure, than if ithad-been one conti¬ nued bone. 2. That the bones which are .at fome difiance from each other at birth might then yield, and allow to the head a change of Ihape, accommodated to the paflage it is engaged in. Whence, in hard labour of child-bed, the bones of the cranium, inftead of being only brought into contadt, are fometimes made to mount one upon the o- ther. 3. That the dura mater may be more firmly fu- fpended by its procefles, which infinuate themfelves into this conjunction of -the bones; for doing this equally, and where the greateft neceflity of adhefion is, the fu¬ tures are difpofed at nearly equal diftanees, and the large refervoirs of blood, the finales, are under or near them. 4. That fradtures might be prevented from reaching fo far as they would in a continued bony fubftance. 5. That the connection at the futures being capable of yielding, the bones might'be allowed to feparate ; which has given great relief to patients from the violent fymptoms which they, had before this feparation happened. Having gone through the general ftruCture of the cra¬ nium, we now proceed to examine each bone of which that brain-cafe confifts.. The Os Frontis has its name from its being the on¬ ly bone of that part of the face we call' the forehead, though it reaches a good deal further. It has fome re- femblance in Ihape to the Ihell of the concha bivalvis, commonly called the cockle ; for the greatefl-part of it is convex externally, and concave internally, with a ferra- ted circular edge; while the fmaller part has procefles and depreflions, whieh make it of an Irregular figure. The external furface of the os frontis is fmooth at its upper convex part; but feveral procefles and cavities are obfervable below: for, at each angle of each orbit, the bone jutts put to form four procefles, two internal, and as many external; which, from this fituation, may well enough be named angular. Between the internal and external angular procefles of each-fide, an arched ridge is extended, on which the eye-brows are placed.—Very little above the internal end of each of thefe fuperciiiary ridges, a protuberance may be remarked, in mod fknlls, where there are large cavities, ealled Jhuifei, within the bone.—Betwixt the internal angular procefles, a fmall proeefs rifes y which forms fome fhare of the nofe, and thence is named nafal '.—-—-Some obferve a protuberant part on the edge of the bone, behind each external an¬ gular procefs, which they call temporal procefles; but thefe are ineonfidtrable.-From the under part of the fuperciiiary ridges, the frontal bone runs a great way backwards ; which parts may juftly enough be called or¬ bit ar procefles. Thefe, contrary to the refi of this bone, are concave externally, for receiving-the globes of the eyes, with their mufcles, fat, <bc. ■ In each of the orbitar procefles, behind the middle of the fuperciiiary ridges, a confiderable finuofityis obferved, where"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Part I.

The foramina , or holes, obfervable on the external furface of the frontal bone, are three in each fide.'- One in each fuperciliary ridge, a little removed from its middle towards the nofe; through which a twig of the ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair of nerves paffes out of the orbit, with a fmall artery, from the internal carotid, to be diflributed to the teguments and mufcles of the forehead.—Thefe veffels in fome fculls make furrows in the os frontis, efpecially in the bones of children ; and therefore we ought to beware of tranfverfe incifions on either fide of the Os frontis, which might either open thefe veffels or hurt the nerves, while they are yet in part within the bone; for, when veffels are thus wounded, it is difficult to Hop the haemorrhagy, becaufe the adhe- fion of a part of the artery to the bone hinders its con¬ traction, and confequently fiyptics can have, little ef¬ fect ; the fides of the furrow keep off compreffing fub- ftances from the artery; and we would wiih to ffiun cau¬ teries or efcharotics, becaufe they make the bone cari¬ ous ; and nerves, when thus hurt, fometimes produce violent fymptoms.—<-But we mull: remark, that often, inftead of a hole, a notch only is to be feen: Nay, in fome fkulls, fcarce a veftige even*of this is left ; in others, both hole and notch are obfervable, when the nerve and artery run feparately.. Frequently a hole is found on one fide, and a notch on the other; at other times we fee two holes; or there is a common hole without, and two diftinCt entries internally. Near the middle of..the infide of each orbit,, hard by, or in the tranfverfe future, there is a fmall hole for the paffage of the nafal twig of the firft branch of the fifth «.pair of nerves, and of a ■ branch of the ophthalmic artery v This hole is fometimes entirely formed in the os frontis ; in other ikulls, the fides of it are compofed of this laft bone, and of the os planum. It is commonly known by the name of orbitarium internum, though anterius fhould be ad¬ ded, becaufe of the next, which is commonly omitted. —This, which niay be called orbitarium internum po- Jierius, is fuch another as the former ; only fmallcr, and about an inch deeper in the orbit: through it a fmall branch of the ocular artery paffes to the nofe.—Befides thefe fix, there are a great number of fmall holes obfervable on the outer furface of this bone, particularly in the two protuberances above the. eye-brows. Molt of thefe pe¬ netrate no further than the finufes, or than the diploe, if the finufes are wanting. The place, fizc, and number of them, are however uncertain: They generally ferve for the tranfmiflion of fmall arteries or nerves. The internal furface of the os frontis is concave, ex¬ cept at the orbitar proceffes, which arc convex, to fup- Vol. I. No. 7. ' '3 port the anterior lobes of the brain. This furface is not fo fmooth as the external; for the larger branches of the arteries of the dura mater make fome furrows in its fides and back-parts. The finuofities from the luxuri¬ ant rifings of the brain, mentioned when deferibing the general ftru&ure of the cranium, are often very obfer¬ vable on its upper part; and its lower and fore parts are marked with the contorfions of the anterior lobes of the brain.-Through the middle of this internal furface, where always in children, and fometimes in old people, the bone is divided, either a ridge (lands out, to which the upper edge of the falx is faftened, or a furrow runs, in which the upper fide of the fuperior longitudinal finus is lodged; on both thefe accounts chirurgical authors juftly difeharge the application of the trepan here. Immediately at the root of this ridge or furrow there is a fmall hole, which fometimes pierces through the firfi: table, and, in other ikulls, opens into the fuperior finus of the ethmoid bone within the nofe. In it a little pro¬ cefs of the falx is lodged, and a fmall artery, and fome¬ times a vein, runs ; and the fuperior longitudinal finus. begins here.—This hole, however, is often not entirely proper to the os frontis; for in feveral (kulls, the lower part of it is formed in the upper part of the bafe of the crifta galli, which is a procefs of the ethmoid bone. The-cs frontis is compofed of two tables, and an in¬ termediate diploe, as the other bones of the cranium are, and in a middle degree of thickaefs between the os ocr cipitis and the parietal bones. The diploe is alfo exhaufied in that part above the eye-brows, where the two tables of the bone feparate, by the external being protruded outwards, to form two targe cavities, called Jinus fron tales .—Thefe are divided by a middle perpendicular bony partition.—In fome Ikulls, befides the large perpendicular feptum, there are feveral bony pillars, or (hort partitions, found in each finus; in others thefe are wanting.—For the moft part; the feptum is entire ; at other times it is difeontinued, and the two finufes communicate.—Each finus com¬ monly opens by a roundiffi fmall hole, at the inner and lower part of the internal angular proceffes, into a finus formed in the nofe, at the upper and back part of the os unguis; near to which there are alfo fome other fmall finufes of this bone, the greater part of which open fe¬ parately nearer the feptum naritim, and often they termi¬ nate in the fame common canal with the large ones. In a natural and found ftate, thefe cavities are of con- fiderable advantage ; for the organ of fmciling being thus enlarged, the effluvia of odorous bodies more difficultly efcape it; and their imprefiions being more numerous, are therefore ftronger, and affeC. the organ more.- Thefe and the other cavities which open.into the nofe, inereafe the found of cur voice, and render it more me¬ lodious, by ferving as fo many vaults to_ refound the notes.

The upper circular part of the os frontis is joined to the ofla parietalia, from one temple to the other, by the. Coronal future. From the termination of the coronal fu¬ ture to the external angular procefles, this bone is con¬ nected to the fphenoid by the fphenoidal future. At the external canthi of the eyes, its angular procefles are joined by the. trstnfverfe future td the ofla malarum, to which it adheres one third down the outfide of the or¬ bits ; whence to the bottom of thefe cavities, and a little up on their internal fides, thefe orbitar procefles are con¬ nected to the fphenoidal bone by that fame future.—• On the infide of each orbit, the orbitar proccfs is indent¬ ed between the cribriform part of the ethmoid bone, and the os planum and unguis.-The tranfverfe future af¬ terwards joins'the frontal bone to the fuperior nafal pro- cefles of the ofla maxillaria fuperiora, and to the nafal bones. And, laftly, its nafal procefs is Conne'Cted to the nafal lamella of the ethmoid bone. The frontal bone ferves to defend and fupport the an¬ terior lobes of the brain. It forms a confiderable part of the cavities that contain the globes of the eyes, helps to make up the feptum narium, organ of fmelling, dsc. From the defeription of the feveral parts, the other ufes of this bone arc evident. In a ripe child, the frontal bone is divided through the middle ; the fuperciliary holes are not formed ; often a fmall round piece of each orbitar procefs, behind the fu¬ perciliary ridge, is not oflified, and there is no finus to be feen within its fubltance. Each of the two Ossa Parietalia, or bones fer- ving as walls to the encephalon, is an irregular fquare; its upper and fore fides being longer than the one behind of below. The inferior fide is a concave arch; the mid¬ dle part receiving the upper round part of the temporal bone.—The angle formed by this upper fide and the fore one, is io extended, as to have the appearance of a pio- cefs. The external furface of each os parietale is convex. Upon it, fpmewhat below the middle beighrh of the bone, there is a rranfverfe arched ridge, of a whiter co¬ lour generally than any other part of the bone; from which, in bones that have llrong prints of mufcles, we fee a great many converging furrows, like fo many radii drawn from a circumference towards a centre. From this ridge of each bone the temporal mufcle rifes; and, by the preflure of its fibres, occafions the furrows juft now mentioned.—Below thefe, we obferve, near the fe- micircular edges, a great many rifings and depreflions, which are joined to like inequalities on the infide of the temporal bone, to form the fquamous future. The tem¬ poral bone may therefore ferve here as a buttrefs, to prevent the lower fide of the parietal from ftarting out¬ wards when its upper part is prefled or ftruck. Near the upper fides of thefe bones, towards the hind part, is a fmall hole in each, through which a vein pafles from the teguments of the head to the longitudinal finus. —In feveral fltulls, one of the ofla parietalia has not this O M Y. Part I. hole ; in others, there are two in one bone ; and in fome not one in either. Moft frequently this hole is through both tables ; at other times the external table is only perforated.-—The knowledge of the courfe of thefe vef- fels may be of ufe to furgeens, when they make any in- cifion near this part of the head, left, if the veflcls are ralhly cut near the hole, they fhrink within the fubftance of the bone, and fo caufe an obftinate hasmorrhagy, which neither ligatures nor medicines can ftop. On the inner concave furface of the parietal bones, we fee a great many deep furrows, dilpofed fornewhat like the branches of trees: The furrows are larged and deepeft at the lower edge of eacli os parietale, efpecial- ly near its anterior angle, where fometimes a full canal is formed. They afterwards divide into fmall furrows, in their progrefs upwards.—In fome fltulls a large fur¬ row begins at the hole near the upper edge, and divides into brandies, which join with thofe which come upwards, {hewing the communications of the upper and lower vef- fels of the dura mater.—In thefe furrows we frequently fee paflages into the diploe. On the infide of the upper edge of the ofla parietalia, there is a large finuofity, fre¬ quently larger in the bone of cne fide than of the other, where the upper part of the falx is faftened, and the fu¬ perior longitudinal finus is lodged. — Generally part of the lateral finufes makes a depreilion near the angle, formed by the lower and pofterior fides of thefe bones ; and the pits made by the prominent parts of the brain are to be feen in no part of the Ikull more frequent, or more confiderable, than in the internal furface of the parietal bones. The ofla parietalia are among!! tire thinneft bones of the cranium; but enjoy the general ftrudure of two ta¬ bles and diploe the complete!!, and are the moft equal ahd fmooth. Thefe bones are joined at their fore-fide to the os frontis by the coronal future ; at their long inferior an¬ gles, to the fphenofd bone, by part of the future of this name; at their lower edge, to the ofla temporum, by the fquamous future, and its pofterior additamenturrl; be¬ hind, to the os occipitis, or ofla triquetra, by the lamb- doid future; and above, to one another, by the fagittal future. In a child born at. the full time, none of the fides of this bone are completed ; and there never is a hole in the oflified part of it near to the fagittal future. The large unoflified ligamentous part of the cranium obfcrvabJe between the parietal bones,.and the middle of the divided os frontis of new-born children, called by the vulgar the open of the bead, was imagined by the anci¬ ents to ferve for the evacuation of the fuperfluous moi- fture of the brain ; and therefore they named it bregma, or the fountain; fometimes adding the epithet pulfcttiHs. or beating, on account of the puliation of the brain felt through this flexible ligamento-cartilaginous fubftance. Hence very frequently the parietal bones are called offt bregmatis. All the bregma is generally oflified before feven years of age. Several authors fay, they have obferved it un¬ oflified in adults ; and phyficians, who order the applica¬ tion of medicines at the meeting of the coronal and fagit- tell"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Part I.

Ossa Temporum, fo named, fay authors, from the hair’s firft becoming grey on the temples, and thus dif- cov ering peoples ages, are each of them equal and fmooth above, with a very thin femicjrcular edge ; which, from the manner of its connection with the neighbouring bones, is diftinguifhed by the name of os fquamoftim.~- -Behind this, the upper part of the temporal bone is thicker, and more unequal, and is fometimes defenbed as a riiftindt part, under the name of pars ma nimillaris — —Towards the bafe of the Ikull, the temporal bone appears very irregular and unequal; and this part, inftead of being broad, and placed perpendicularly, as the others are, is contracted into an oblong very hard fubftance, extended horizontally forwards and inwards, which in its progrefs becomes frnaller, and is commonly called os petrofum. Three external precedes of each temporal hone are generally deferibed.—Th efirfi, placed at the lower and hind-part of the bone, from its refembhnee to a nip¬ ple, is called mafloides, or mammillaris. It is not folid, but within is compofed of cancelii, or fmall cells, which have a communication with the large cavity of the ear, the drum ; and therefore founds, being multiplied irfthis vaulted labyrinth, are increafed, before they are applied to the immediate organ of hearing. Into the maftoid procefs, the ftenomaftoideus rnufcle is inferted; ar.d to its back-part, where the furface is rough, the trachelo- maftoideus, and part of the fplenius are fixed.—About an inch farther forward, the ftvotld procefs begins to rife out from the bone;. and having its origin continued o- bliquely downwards and forwards for fome way, it be¬ comes fmaller, and is .ftretched forwards to join with the os make; they together forming the bony jugum, under which the temporal rnufcle paffes. Hence this procefs has been named zygomatic. Its upper edge has the flrong aponeurofis of the temporal rnufcle fixed into it; and its lower part gives rife to a fhare of the mafleter.—- The fore part of the bafe of this procefs is an oblong tubercle, which in a recent fubjedf is covered with a fmooth polifhed cartilage, continued from that which lines the cavity immediately behind this tubercle.--- From the under craggy part of the os tempornm, the third procefs Hands, out obliquely forwards. The fhape t>f it is generally faid to refemble the ancient ftylus ferip- torius ; and therefore it is called the fiyloid procefs. Several mufcles have their origin from this procefs, and borrow one half of their name from it; as f iy logic fas, Jlylo-hycideus, Jiyh-pharyngeus : to it a ligament of the os hyoides is fometimes fixed; and another is extended from it to the infide of the angle of the lower jaw. This procefs is often, even in adults, not entirely ofiificd, but is ligamentous at its root, and fometimes is compofed of two or three diftindt pieces.-Round the root of it, efpecially at the fore-part, there is a remarkable riling of the os petrofum, which fome have tfteerned a procefs ; and, from the appearance it makes with the ftyliform, have named it vaginalis. -Others again have, under O M Y. 155 the name of auditory procefs, reckoned among the ex¬ ternal procefles that femicircular ridge, which, running between the root of the maltoid and zygomatic procefles, forms the under part of the external meatus auditorius.

The fore-part of the cavity being lined with the fame cartilage which covers the tubercle before it, receives the condyle of the jaw; and in the back-part a fmall lhare of the parotid gland, and a cellular fatty fubftance, are lodged.—At the infide of the root of the ftyloid apophyfe, there is a thimble-like cavity, where the beginning of the internal jugular vein, or end of the lateral finus, is lodged.—Round the external meatus au¬ ditorius, feveral finuofities are formed for receiving the cartilages and ligaments of the ear, and for their firm adhefion. The holes that commonly appear on the outfide of each of thefe bones, and are proper to each of them, are five.—The firjl, fituated between the zygomatic and raa- ftoid procefies, is the orifice of a large funnel-like canal, which leads to the organ of hearing; therefore is called meatus auditorius ext emus.- -The Jecond gives pafiagfc to the portia dura of the feventh pair of nerves ; and, from its fituation between the maftoid and ftyloid procefles, is called foramen fly to mafioideum. —Some way before, and to the infide of the ftyloid procefs, is the third hole; the canal from which runs firft upwards, then forwards, ar.d receives into it the internal carotid artery, and the beginning of the intercoftal nerve; where this canal is about to make the turn forwards, one, or fometimes two #ery fmall holes go off towards the cavity of the ear.

Tlie ufe of it, when found, is for the tranfmiiEon of a vein from the external teguments to the lateral finus :.But, in fome fiibje&s, a branch of the occipital artery paffes through this hole, to ferve the. back-part of the dura mater. The internal furface of the ofTa temporum is unequal; the upper circular edge of the fquamous part having nu¬ merous fmall ridges and furrows for its conjunction with the parietal bones ; and the reft of it is irregularly mark¬ ed with the convolutions of the middle part of the brain, and with furrows made by the branches of the arteries of the dura mater. From the under part of this internal furface, a larger tranfverfe, hard, craggy protuberance runs horizontally inwards and forwards, with a Iharp edge above, and two flat fides, one facing obliquely, forwards and outwards, and the other as much backwards and inwards. To .the ridge between thefe two fides, the large lateral procefs of the dura mater is fixed.

At the bafe of this triangular procefs, on each fide of the great hole, but more advanced forwards than the middle of it, the large oblong protuberances, named the condyles , appear, to ferve for the articulation of this bone with the firft ver¬ tebra of the neck. The fmooth furface of each of thefe condyloid procefles is longeft from behind forwards, where, by their oblique fituation, they come much near¬ er to each other than they are at their back-part. Their inner fides are lower than the external, by which they are prevented from Aiding to either fide out of the cavi¬ ties of the firft vertebra.— Round their root a fmall de- preflion and fpongy roughnefs is obfervable, where the ligaments .for furreunding and fecuring their articulations adhere.—Though the motion of the head is performed on the condyles, yet the centre of gravity of that globe does, not fall between them, but is a good way further forward; from which mechanifm it is evident, that ,the mufcles which pull the head back muft be in a conftant ftate of contraction: which is ftronger than the natural contraction of the proper flexors, elfe the head would always fall forwards, as it does when a man-is afleep, or labours under a palfy, as well as in infants, where the weight of the head far exceeds the proportional ftreogth of thefe mufcles. All round the great foramen the edges are unequal, for the firmer adhefion of the ftrong circular ligament which goes thence to the firft vertebra.—One end of each lateral or moderator ligament of the head, is fixed to a rough furface at the fore-part of each condyle, and the perpendicular one is connected to a rough part of the edge of the great hole between the two condyles. On the inner furface of the os occipitis we fee two ridges; one ftanding perpendicular, the other running horizontally acrofs the firft. The upper part of the per¬ pendicular limb of the crofs, to which the falx is fixed, is hollowed in the middle, or often on one fide, for the reception of the fuperior longitudinal finus, and the low¬ er part of it has the fmall or third procefs of the dura mater fattened to it, and is fometimes hollowed by the occipital finus. Each fide of the horizontal limb is made hollow .by the lateral fiuufes inclofed in the tranfverfe procefs of the dura mater ; the fofla in the right fide be¬ ing generally a continuation of the one made by the lon¬ gitudinal finus in the perpendicula r limb, and therefore is larger than the left one.--—Round the middle of the crofs there are four large deprelTions feparated by its limbs; the. two upper ones being formed by the back- part of the brain, and the two lower ones by the cere¬ bellum.-Farther forward than the laft mentioned de- prefiipns."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Part I.

The holes of this bone are commonly five proper, and .two common to it and to the temporal bones.—The firft of the proper holes, called foramen magnum, from its fize, is immediately behind the wedge-like-procefs, and allows a paflage to the medulla oblongata, nervi acceflo- rii, to the vertebral arteries, and fometimes to the ver¬ tebral veins.-At each fide of this great hole, near its fore-part, and immediately above the condyles, we always find a hole, fometimes two, which foon unite a- gain into one that opens externally; through thefe the ninth pair of nerves go out of the Ikull.—The fourth and fifth holes pierce from behind the condyle of each fide, into the folfie of the lateral finufes; they ferve for the paflage of the cervical veins to thefe finufes. Oft¬ en one of thefe holes is wanting, fometimes both, when the veins pafs through the great foramen.-Befides thefe five, we frequently meet with other h6les near the edges of this bone, for the tranfmiffion of veins; but the:-\" number and diameter are very uncertain. The two common foramina are the large irregular holes, one in each fide, between, the fides of the cuneiform procefs, and the edges of the petrous bones. In a recent fubjeCt, a ftrong membrane runs crofs from one fide to the other of each of thefe holes. The occipital bone is among the thickeft of the cra¬ nium, though unequally fo; for it is ftronger above, where it has no other defence than the common tegu¬ ments, than it is below, where, being prefled by the lobes of the brain and cerebellum on one fide, and, by the aCtion of the mufcles on the other, it is fo very thin, as to be diaphanous in many flculls. The occipital bone is joined above to the ofla parieta- lia and triquetra when prefent, by the lambdoid future; —laterally to the temporal bones, by the additamenta of the lambdoid future;—below to the fphenoid bone, by the end of its cuneiform procefs, in the fame way that epiphyfes and their bones are joined-The os occipi- tis is joined by a double articulation to the firft: vertebra of the neck, each condyle being received into a fuperior oblique procels of that vertebra. Os Ethmoides, or the fieve-like bone, has got its name from the great number of fmall holes with which that part of it firft taken notice of is pierced. When this bone is entire, the figure of it is not eafily deferi- bed ; but, by a detail of its feveral parts, fome idea may be afforded of the whole; and therefore we fhall diftin- guifti it into the cribriform lamella with its procefs, the n a fill lamella, cellule, and ofla fpongiofa. The thin horizontal lamella, is all (except its back- part) pierced obliquely by a great number of fmall holes, through which the filaments of the olfaCtory nerves pafs. -From tile middle of the internal fide of this plate, a thick procefs rifes upwards, and, being higheft at the fore part, gradually becomes lower, as it. is extended . Mol. I. No. 7. 3 r O M Y. 157 backwards. From fpme refemblance which this procefs was imagined to have to a cock’s comb, it has been call¬ ed crijia galli. The falx is connected to its ridge, and to the unperforated part of the cribriform plate.- When the crifta is broke, its bafe is fometimes found to be hollow, with its cavity opening into the nofe. From the middle of the outer furface of the cribri¬ form lamella, a thin folid plate is extended downwards and- forwards, having the fame common bafe with the crifta galli. Generally it is not exactly perpendicular, but is inclined to one fide or other, and therefore divides the cavity of the nofe unequally. Its inclination to one fide, and flexure in the middle, is fometimes fo great, that it fills up a large ftiare of one of the noftrils, and has been miftook for a polypus there.—It is thin at its rife, and rather rtill thinner in its middle; yet after¬ wards, towards its lower edge, it becomes thicker, that its conjunction with the bones and middle cartilage of the pofe might be firmer. At a little diftance from each fide of this external pro¬ cefs, a cellular and fpongy bony fubftance depends from the cribriform plate. The number and figure of the cells in this irregular procefs of each fide, are very uncertain; only the cells open into each other, and into the cavity of the nofe: The uppermoft, which are below the aper¬ ture of the frontal finufes, are formed like funnels.——- The outer furface of thofe cells is fmooth and plain, where this bone aflifts in compofing the orbit; at which place, on each fide, it has got the name of os planum; on the upper edge of which, a fmall notch or two may fometimes be obfierved, which go to the formation of the internal orbitar holes. Below the cells of each fide, a thin plate is extended inwards, and then bending down, it becomes thick, and of a fpongy texture.-This fpongy part is triangular, with a (freight upper edge placed horizontally, an ante¬ rior one flanting from above, downwards and forwards, and with a pendulous convex one below.—The upper and lower edges terminate in a'(harp point behind.—The fide of this pendulous fpongy part next to the feptum narium is convex, and its external fide is concave.-Thefe two procefles of the ethmoid bone have got the name of off a fpongiofa, or turbinata fuperiora , from their fubftance, figure, and fituation.

From all which the ufes of this bone are evident, viz. to fuftain the anterior lobes of the brain ; to give paflage to the olfaftory nerves, and attachment to the falx; to enlarge the organ of fuelling, by allowing the membrane of the nofe a great extent; to ftraiten the paflage of the air through the nofe, by leaving only a narrow winding canal, on the fenfible membranous Tides of which the fub- flances conveyed along with the air mud fhike, to form part of the orbit of the eyes and feptum narium; while all its parts are fo light as hot to be in hazard of fepara'- ting by their weight; and they are fo thin, as to florin a large furface, without occupying much fpace. Os Sphenoides, or wedge-like bone, fo called be* caufe of its fituation in the middle of the bones of the cranium and face, is of an irregular figure, and bears fome faint refemblance to a bat with its wings extended. When we view the external furface of the os fphenoi* des, two or three remarkable procelfes from each fide of it may be obferved; whieh are all of them again fubdivi- ded.-The fir ft pair is the two large lateral procelles or wings; the upper part of each of Which is called the ■ temporal procef, became they join with the temporal bones in Arming the temples, and the feat for fome {hare of the crotaphite mufcles. That part of the wings which jutts out towards the infide, fomewhat lower than the temporal apophyfes, and is Imooth and hollowed, where it makes up part of the orbit, is thence named or¬ bit or procej/es. Behind the edge feparating thefe two procelfes, there is often a fmall groove, made by a branch of the fuperior maxillary nerve, in its paflage to the temporal raufele. The lowed and back-part of each wing, which runs out lharp to meet the ofla petrofa, has been Hyled the fpinous procefs: from near the point of which a lharp pointed procefs is frequently produced downwards, which fome call flyliform , that affords ori¬ gin to the ptery-llaphylinus externus mufcle. From this ilyloid procefs a very fmall groove is extended along the edge of the bone to the hollow at the root of the inter¬ nal plate of the following procelfes, which forms part of the Euftachian tube.—The fecond pair of external pro- celfes of the cuneiform bone is the two which (land out almoft perpendicular to the bafe of the fkull. Each of them has two plates, and a middle folfa facing backwards, and are named pterygoid or aliform proeelfes. The ex¬ ternal plates are breaded, and the internal are longed. From each fide of the external plates, the pterygoid mufcles take their rife. At the root of each internal plate, a fmall hollow may be remarked, where the muf- culus ptery-daphyjinus internus, or circumflexus palati, rifes, and fome lhare of the cartilaginous end of the Eu- llaciiian tube reds; and, at the lower end of the fame plate, is a hook-like riling or procefs, round which the tendon of the lad named mufcle plays, as on a pulley. ■ -To thefe another pair may be added, to wit, the little triangular thin procefs, which comes from each fide O M Y.

The lower part of this procefs, where it is received into the vomer, is thick, and often not quite perpendicular, but inclining more to one fide than the other. The fore¬ part of this procefs, where it joins the nafal plate of the os cthmoides, is thin and dreight. The depreflions, finuofixies, and foflae, on the exter¬ nal furface of this fphenoid bone, may be reckoned up to a great number, viz. two on the temporal apophyfes where the crotaphite mufcles lodge.-^Two on the orbitar procelfes, to make'way for the globes of the eyes.-- Two between the temporal and fpinous procelles, for re¬ ceiving the temporal bones.-Two between the plates of the pterygoid procelfes, where the mnfculi pterygoidei intern! and ptery-daphylini interni are placed.—-—Two between the pterygoid and orbitar procelfes, for forming the holes common to this and to the cheek and maxillary bones.-Two on the lower ends of the aliform pro- cefles, which the palate-bones enter into.—-—Two at the roots of the temporal and pterygoid procelfes, where the larged fliare of the external ptecygoid mufeles have their rife.-Two at the lides of the procelfus azygos, for forming part of the nofe, <bc.

The three are called clinoid, from fome refemblance which they were thought to have to the fupporters < 5 f a bed.- — From the roots of the anterior clinoid procelfes, the bone is extended on each fide outwards and forwards, till it ends in a lharp point, which may have the name of the tranfverf fpinous pro- celfes.-Between, but a little farther back than the two anterior clinoid procelfes, we fee a protuberance con- fidefably fmaller than the pofierior clinoid procefs, but of its lhape.—Another procefs from between the tranf- verfe procelfes, often forces itfelf forwards into the os ethmoides. Within the Ikull, there are two finuofities in the in¬ ternal part of each wing of the fphenoid bone, for re¬ ceiving the middle part of the brain.-—One between the tranfverle fpinous procelfes, for lodging the p art of the brain where the crura medullas oblongata; are.—Im¬ mediately before the third .or middle clinoid procefs, a fingle pit generally may be remarked, from which a folfa goes out on each fide to the holes through which the op¬ tic nerves pafs. The pit is formed by the conjoined op¬ tic nerves ; and in the folia: thefe nerves are lodged, as"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Part I. A N A T they run divided within the fkull.—Between that third protuberance and the pofterior clinoid procefs, the larger pit for the glandula pituitaria may be remarked.

Sometimes a fmall branch of the external carotid enters near its end, to be diftributed to the dura mater, and. a vein, fome call it the venous duft, or Nuck’s aqueeduft, returns through it to the cavernous finus.--The third hole, fituated a little below the one juft now defcribed, is called rotun- dum, from its fhape. It allows paflage to the fecond branch of the fifth pair of nerves, or fuperior maxillary nerve, into the bottom of the orbit.-The fourth is the foramen ovale , about half an inch behind the round hole. Through it the third branch of the fifth pair, or inferior maxillary nerve, goes out; and fometimes a vein from the dura mater pafles out here.-Very near the point of the fpinous proccfs is the fifth hole of this bone : It is fmall and round\", for a paflage to the largeft artery of the dura mater, which often is accompanied with a vein.-The fixth proper hole cannot be well feen, till the cuneiform bone is feparated from all the other bones of the cranium ; for one end of it is hid by a fmall pro¬ tuberance of the internal plate, of the pterygoid procefs, and by the point of the proceflus petrofus of the temporal bone. Its canal is extended above the inner plate of the pterygoid procefs ; and where it opens into the cavity of the nofe, it is concealed by the thin laminous part of the palate-bone. Through it a confiderable branch of the fecond branch of the fifth p air of nerves is reflected. --Often in the middle of the fella Turcica , a fmall hole or two pierce as far as the cellular fubftance of the bone; and fometimes at the fides of this fella, one or more fmall holes penetrate into the fphenoidal finufes. The />/? of the common holes is that unequal fiflure at the fide of the fella Turcica, between the extreme point of tile os petrofum and the fpinous procefs of the cuneiform bone.-The fecond common hole is the large difeontinuation of the external fide of the orbit, left between the orbitar procefles of the cuneiform bone, the os maxillare, malic, and palati. In this large hole the fat for lubricating the globe of the eye and \"temporal mnfcle is lodged, and branches of the fuperior maxillary nerve, with fmall arteries from the carotid and Veins, pafs. O M Y. 159 --The third hole is formed between the bafe of this bone and the root of the orbitar procefs of the palate- bone of,each fide. Through this a branch of the exter¬ nal carotid artery, and of the fecond branch of the fifth pair of nerves, are allowed a paflage to the noftrils, and a returning vein accompanies them. Under the fella Turcica, and fome way farther for¬ ward, but within the fubftance of the fphenoid bone, are two finufes, feparated by a bony plate. Each of them is lined with a membrane, and opens into the upper and back part of each noftril by a round hole, which is at their upper fore-part. This hole is not formed only by the os fphenoides, which has an aperture near as large as any tranfverfe fedtion of the finus, but alfo by the palate- bones which are applied to the fore-part of thefe finufes, and clofe them up, that hole only excepted, which was already mentioned. Frequently the two finufes are of unequal dimenfions, and fometimes there is only one large cavity, with an opening into one noftril. As this bone is extremely ragged and unequal, fo its fubftance is of very different thicknefs, being in fome places diaphanous; in others it is of a middle thicknefs, and its middle back-part furpafles the greateft fliare of the cranium .in thicknefs. The os fphenoides is joined, by its wings, to the pa¬ rietal bones above, to the os frontis and ofla malarutn before, to the temporal bones behind;—by the fore-part of its body and fpinous procefles, to the frontal and eth¬ moid bones ;—by its back-part, behind the two finufes, to the occipital, where it looks like a bone with the epi- phyfes taken off;—to the palate-bones, by the ends of the pterygoid procefles, and ftill more by the fore¬ part of the internal plates of the pterygoid procefles, and of the finufes ;—to the maxillary bones, by the fore-part of the external pterygoid plates ;-—to the vomer and na- fal plate of the os ethmoides, by the proceflus azygos. All thefe conjundtions, except the laft, which is a Ichin* dylefis, are faid to be by the future proper to this bone; though it is at firft fight evident, that feveral other fu¬ tures, as the tranfveife, ethmoidal, <bc. are confot/nded with it. We fee now how this bone is joined to all the bones of the cranium, and to irioft of the upper jaw-; 'and therefore obtained the name of the nnedge-like bone. The Face is the irregular pile of bones, conipofing the fore and under part of the head, which is divided into the upper and lower maxillas or jaws. The fuperior maxilla is the common defignation given to the upper immoveable fhare of the face. The fhape of the fuperior jaw cannot eafily be exprefied ; nor is it neceflary, provided the fhape and fituation of all the bones which compofe it are defcribed. It is bounded above by the tranfverfe future, behind by the fore-part of the fphenoid bone, and below by the mouth. The upper jaw confifts of fix bones on each fide, of a thirteenth bone which has no fellow, placed in the mid¬ dle, and of fixteen teeth. The thirteen bones are, wo ojfa naji, two cjfa unguis , two ojfa malarum, two oftfa maxillaria , two ojfa palati, two ojfa fpongiofa inferior a, and the vomer.

The bones of the upper jaw are joined to the bones of the fkull-by the fchindylefi s and futures already de- feribed as common to the cranium and face, and they are connected to each other by gomphofis and fifteen fu¬ tures. The gomphofis only is where the teeth are fixed in .their dockets, and the fchindylcfis is only, where the edges of the vomer are joined to other- bones. The firft is the anterior nafal, which is ftreight, and placed longitudinally in the middle fore-part of the nofe. The facond and third are the lateral nafal , which are at each fide of the nofe, and almoft parallel to the firft future. Each of the two lacrymal is almoft femicircular, and is placed round the lacrymal •groove. The fixth and feventh are the internal orbitar: each of which is extended obliquely from the middle of the lower fide of an orbit to the edge of its bafe. The two external orbitars ar.e continued, each from the end of the internal orbitar, to the under and fore¬ part of the cheek. The tenth is the myjlachial , which reaches only from the lower part of the feptum narium to between the two middle dentes incifores. The longitudinal palate future ftretches from the middle of the foremoft teeth through the middle of all the palate.

They contain fixteen teeth, give rife to mufcles, tranfmifiion to nerves, <bc. as mentioned in the defcrip- tion of their feveral parts. Ossa Palati are commonly deferibed as two fmall fquare bones, at the back-part of the palate or roof of the mouth, though they are of much greater extent, being continued up the back-part of the noflrds to the orbit. Each palate-bone may therefore be divided into four parts, the palate fquare bone, the pterygoid pro* ccfs, nafal lamella, and orbitar procefs. The fquare bone is unequally concave, for enlarging both the mouth and cavity of the nofe. The upper part of its internal edge fifes in a fpine, after the fame mam ner as.the palate-plate of the maxillary bone does, to be joiped with the vomer.-Its anterior edge is unequally ragged, for its firmer connexion with the palate-procefs of the os maxillare.:—The internal edge is thicker than the reft, and of an.equal furface, fox its conjunction with its fellow of the other fide.-Behind, this bone is fomewhat in form of a crefcent, and thick, for the firm connection of the velum pendulum palati; the internal point being produced backwards, to afford origin to the palato-ftaphylinus, or azygos-mufcle.-This fquare bone is well diftinguilhed from the pterygoid procefs by a perpendicular fofla, which, applied to fuch another in the maxillary bone, forms a paflage for the palatine branch of the fifth pair of nerves ; and by another fmall hole behind this, through which a twig of the fame nerve paflesi The pterygoid procefs is fomewhat triangular, having a broadbbafe, ar.d ending fmaller above. The back-part of this procefs has three foflae formed in it; the two la¬ teral receive the ends of the two plates of the fphenoid bone, that are commonly compared to a bat’s wing ; the middle fofla makes up a part of what is commonly called the fojj'u pterygoidea ; the fore-fide of this palatine pte¬ rygoid procefs is aD irregular concave, where it receives the back-part of the great tuberofity of the maxillary bone.-^Frequently feveral fmall holes may be obferved in this triangular procefs, particularly one near the ir.id- • die of its bafe, which, a little above, communicates with the common and proper holes of this bone already taken notice of. The nafal lamella of this bone is extremely thin and brittle, and rifes upwards from the upper fide of the ex¬ ternal edge of the fquare bone, and from the narrow ex¬ tremity of the pterygoid procefs; where it is fo weak, and at the fame time fo firmly fixed to the maxillary bone, as to be very liable to be broken in feparating the bones.-From the part where the plate rifes, it runs up broad on the infide of the tuberofity of the maxillary bone, to form a conliderable lhare of the fides of the maxillary finus, and to clofe up the fpace between the fphenoid and the great bulge of the maxillary bone, where there would otherwife be a large flit opening into the noftrils.

They are joined to the offa maxillaria, palati, and un • guis, efpedally in old fubjeAs.

Its fituation is not always perpendicular, but often in¬ clined and bended to one fide, as well as the nafal plate of the ethmoid-bone. The vomer is convex at its upper part, and then is ftreight as it is extended downwards and forwards, where it is compofcd of two plates ; the edges of which have a great nuhiber of fmall proceffes, difpofed fomewhat like the teeth of a law, but more irregularly, and federal of them are refleAed back. Between thefe plates, a deep folia is left, which, fo far as the top of the curvature, is wide, and has ftrong fides, for receiving the proceffus azygos of the fphenoid-bone. Beyond the arch for¬ wards, the foffa is narrower and fhsdlower gradually to the point of the bone, receiving for fome way the nafal lamella ethmoidea, which is fo cloftly united to the vo¬ mer, by the little proceffes piercing into its fubftance, as to prevent any reparation.

Maxilla Inferior, the lower jaw, confifts only of one moveable bone, and fixteen teeth incafed into it. This bone, which is fomewhat of the figure of the Greek letter v, is fituated at the lower part of the face, fo as its convex middle part is forwards, and its legs are ftretched back. It is commonly divided into the chin, fides, and procefles.—The chin is the middle fore-part, the extent of which to each fide is marked on the exter¬ nal furface by the holes obfervable there, and internally, by the beginning of an oblique ridge.—Beyond thefe, the fides appear, and are continued till the bone, by bending upwards, begins to form the procefles. On the fore-part of the chin, a tranfverfe ridge appears in the middle, Qn each fide of which the mufculi quadra- ti, or deprefiores labii inferioris, and the levatores labii inferioris, deprefs the bone: And below thefe prints, a fmall rifing may be obferved, where the deprefiores com¬ mence.—On the back-part of the chin, fometimes three, always two, fmall protuberances appear in the middle. To the uppermoft, when it is feen, the froenum of the tongue is connefled. From the middle one, the mufculi gemoglofii rife ; and from the lowed, the geniohyoidei have their origin. At the lower and fore-part of the external furface of each fide of the lower jaw, a fmall eminence may be obferved, where the depreflor labioruin communis rifes. Near the upper edge of the fide a ridge runs length-ways, to which the under part of the mufculus buccinator is connedted.-Internally, towards the upper edge of each fide, another ridge appears, from which the mylo- hyoidei have their origin, and to which the internal mem¬ brane of the gums adheres. In the upper edge of both chin and fides are a great many deep pits or fockets, for receiving the roots, of the teeth. The number and magnitude of thefe fockets are various, becaufe of the different number, as well of the teeth themfelves, as of their roots, in different people. Thefe fockets in this lower jaw, as well as in the upper one, are lefs deep as old age comes on; when freed from the teeth by any means, they are fome time after filled up with an ofieous net-work,, which at laft becomes en¬ tirely folid, and as fmooth as any other part of the bone; fo that in a great many old jaws one cannot obferve a veftige of the fockets,: But then the jaw becomes lefs, and much narrower.—Hence we may know why thp chin and nofe of edentulous people are much nearer than be¬ fore the teeth were-loft ; while their lips either fall in towards the mouth, or ftand prominent forwards.- When new teeth are protruded, new fockets are formed. ——The lower edge of ths chin \"and fides is fmooth. and equal, and is commonly called the bafe of the lower jaw. _iThe ends of the bafe, where the jaw turns upwards, are called its angles ; the external furface of each of which has feveral inequalities upon it, where the mafle- ter mufcle is inferted ; as the internal furface alfo has, where the ptervgoideus internus is inferted, and a liga- O M Y. Part I. ment, extended from the ftyloid procefs of the temporal bone, is fixed. The procefles are two on each fide.-The anterior ftiarp thin coronoid ones have the crotaphyte mufcles in¬ ferted into them.-The pofterior procefles, or con¬ dyles, terminate in an oblong fmooth head, fupported by a cervix. The heads, whofe greateft length is tranfverfe, and whofe convexity is turned forwards, are tipped with a cartilage, as the articulated parts of all other moved bones are.—The fore-part of the root and neck of thefe condyloid procefles are a little hollow and rough, where the external pterygoid mufcles are inferted. The holes of the lower jaw are two on each fide; one at the root of the procefles internally, where a large branch of the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves en¬ ters with an .artery, and a vein returns 7 . A fmall /harp procefs frequently jutts out backwards from the edge at the fore-part of this hole, to which a ligament, extended from the temporal bone, is fixed, which faves the nerve and veflels from being too much prefled by the ptery¬ goid mufcles.-From the lower fide of this hole, ei¬ ther a fmall fuperficial canal or a furrow defcends, where a branch of the nerve is lodged, in its way to the mylo- hyoideus mufcle and fublingual jftand.-The other hole is external, at the confines of the chin, where branches of the nerve and veflels conie out.-The ca¬ nal betwixt thefe two holes is formed in the middle of the fubftance of the bone, and is pierced by a great num¬ ber of fmall holes by which the nerves and blood-vefiels of the cancelli and teeth pafs. The lower jaw generally receives the roots of fixteen teeth into its fockets, by gomphofis ; and its condyloid procefles, covered with cartilage, are articulated with the temporal bones. The Teeth are the hard white bodies placed in the fockets of both jaws. Their number is generally fix- teen above, and as many below ; though fome people have more, others have fewer. The btoad thick part of each tooth which appears without the focket, is the bafe, or body.-The fmall- er procefles funk into the maxillae, are the roots or fangs, which become gradually-fmaller towards the end fartheft from the bafe, or are nearly conical, by which the fur¬ face of their fides divides the prefliire made on the bafes, to prevent the foft parts, which are at the fmall points of the fockets, to be hurt by fuch prefiure. Without the gums the teeth are covered with no mem¬ brane, and they are faid to have no proper periofteum within the fockets; but that is fupplied by the refledted membrane of the gums ; which, after a good injection, may beievidently feen in a young fubjedt, with the veflels from it penetrating into the fubftance of the teeth ; and it may be difeovered in any tooth recently pulled, by ma¬ cerating it in water. The x adhefioji of this membrane to thefe roots is ftrengthened by the fmall furrows obfer¬ vable on them. Each tooth is compofed of its cortex, or enamel, and an internal bony fubftance. The cortex has no cavity or place for marrow; and is fo folid and hard, that faws or files can with difficulty make impreflion on it. It is thicFeft"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Part I. ANA' thickeft upon the bafe, and gradually, as the roots turn fmaller, becomes thinner.-The fibres of this enamel nre all perpendicular to the internal fubftance, and are ftreight on the bafe, but at the fides are arched with a convex part towards the roots; which makes the teeth refill the compreflion of any hard body between the jaws, with lefs danger of breaking thefe fibres, than if they Had been fituated tranfverfely. The Ipongy fockets in which the teeth are placed likewife ferve better to_prevent fuch jan injury, than a more folid bafe would have done. The bony part of the teeth has its fibres running ftreight, according to the length of the teeth. When it is expofed to the air, by the breaking or falling off of the hJtrd cortex, it foon corrupts. And thence carious teeth are often all hollow within, when a very fmall hole appears only .externally. ■ The teeth have canals formed in their middle, where¬ in their nerves and blood-veflels are lodged; which they certainly need, being conftantly wafted by the attrition they are fubjedled to in manducatipn, and for their fur¬ ther growth, not'only after they firft appear, but even in -adults; as is evident when a tooth is taken out: For then the oppofite one becomes longer, and thofe on each :fide of the empty focket turn broader; fo that when the jaws are brought together, it is fcarce obfervabl.e where the tooth is wanting. The veffels are eafily traced fo long as they are in the large canal, hut can fcarce be obferved in their diftribu- tion from that to the fubftance of the teeth of adults. -This plentiful fupply of veffels mult expofe the teeth to the fame diforders that attack other vafcular parts. Every root of each tooth has fuch a diftinft canal, with veffels and nerves in it. Thefe canals in the teeth with more than one root, come nearer each other, as they approach the bafe of the tooth : and at laft are only feparated by -very thin plates, which being general¬ ly incomplete, allow a communication of all the canals; and frequently one common cavity only appears within the bafe, in v/hich a pulpy fubftance, compofed of nerves and veffels, is lodged. The entry of the canals for thefe veffels is a fmall hole placed a little to a fide of the extreme point of each root,;. fometimes, cfpeciall^ in old people, this hole is entirely clofed up, and consequently the nerves and blood-veffels are deftroyed. The teeth are feen for a confiderable time in form of mucus contained in a membrane; afterwards a thin cor¬ tical plate, and fome few offeous layers appear within the membrane, with a large cavity filled with mucus in the middle ; and gradually this exterior fhell turns thick¬ er, the cavity decreafes, the quantity of mucus is leffen- ed, and this induration proceeds till all the body is formed ; from wh'ich the roots are afterwards produced. In young fubjetfls, different ftamina, or rudiments of tqcth, are to be obferved. Thofe next the gums hinder ordinarily the deeper-feated ones from making their way out, while thefe prevent the former from fending out roots, or from entering deep into the bony fockets of the jaws; by which they come to be lefs fixed. Children are Itldom born with teeth ; but at two Vol. I. No. 7. 3 r O M Y. 16$ years of age they have twenty ; and their number does not increafe till they are about feven years old, when the teeth that firft made their way through the gums are thruft out by others that have been formed deeper in the jaw, and fome more of the teeth begin to difeover them- felves farther back in the mouth. About fourteen years of age, fome more of the firft crop are fhed, and the number is increafed.-This ihedding of the teeth is of good ufe; for if the firft had remained, they would have ftood at a great diftance one from another ; becanfe the teeth are too hard in their outer cruft, to increafe fo fait as the jaws do. Whereas both the fecond layer, and the teeth that come out late, meeting, while they are foft, with a confiderable refiftance to their growth in length, from thofe fituated upon them, neceffarily come out broad, and fit tp make that clofe guard to the mouth, which they now form. The teeth are joined to the fockets by gomphofis, and the gums contribute to fix them there ; as is evident by the teeth falling out when the gums are any way de¬ ftroyed, or made too fpongy; as in the feurvy or fali- vations : Whence fome clals this articulation with the fyffarcolis. The ufes of the teeth are to mafticate our ali¬ ment, and to afiift us in the pronunciation of fcveral letters. Though the teeth fo far agree in their ftrudlure, yet, .becaufe of fome things wherein they differ, they are generally divided into three claffes, viz. incifores, canini-, and mala res. The incifores, are the four fore-teeth in each jaw, re¬ ceiving their name from their office of cutting our ali¬ ment ; for which they are excellently adapted, being each formed into a (harp-cutting edge at their bale, by their fore-fide turning inwards there, while' they are flopped down and hollowed behind; fo that they have the form of wedges; and therefore their power of ailing mult be confiderably increafed. The incifores of the upper jaw, efpecially. the two middle ones, are broader and longer generally than thofe of the under jaw. Canini, from the refemblance to dogs tulks, are one on each fide of the incifores in each jaw.-The two in the upper jaw are called eye-teeib, from the commu¬ nication of nerves which is faid to be betwixt them and the eyes.-The two in the lower jaw are named an¬ gular, or voike-teeth, becaufe they fupport the angles of the mouth. The canini are broader, longer, and ftronger, than the incifores.-Their bales are formed into a lharp edge, as the incifores are ; only that the edge rifes into a point in the middle.——Each of them has generally but one long root, though fometimes they have two. The roots are crooked towards the end.——The canini of the up¬ per jaw are larger, longer, and with more crooked roots, than thofe of the under jaw. The dentes mol ares, or grinders, which have got their name becaufe they grind our food, ate generally five in each fide of each jaw; in all twenty.

The numerous roots of the dentes molares prevent their loofening by the lateral preiTure they fuffer in grind¬ ing ; and as the fockets in the upper jaw are more fpon- gv, and the teeth are more liable, by their fituation, to fall out, the grinders thefe have more numerous and more Separated roots than in the lower jaw. According to the divifion made of the lkeleton, we fhould now proceed to the defeription of the trunk of the body. But muft ffrft confider a bone, which cannot well be faid to belong to either the head or the trunk; nor is it Immediately joined to any other, and therefore is very feldom preferved with fkeletons. The Os Hyoides, which is fituated horizontally between the root of the tongue and the larynx. It is properly enough named hyoides, from the refemblance it bears to the Greek letter v, and may, for a clearer de- monftration of its ftru&ure, be diftinguifhed into its body, cornua, and appendices. The body is the middle broad part, convex before, and hollow behind.-The convex fore-part is divided into two, by a ridge, into the middle of which the mylo- liyoidei, and into the fides the ‘ftylo-hyoidei, mufcles are inferted.-Above the ridge, the bone is horizontal, but pitted in the middle by the infertion of the two ge- liio-hyoidei mufcles, and a little hollowed more laterally by the bafioglofli.-Below the ridge, it is convex, but a little flatted in tile middle by the fterno-hyoidei, and pitted more externally by the coraco-hyoidei-The concavity behind faces backwards and downwards to re¬ ceive the fhyroid cartilage, when the larynx and the os hyoides are pulled towards each other by the station of the fterno-hyoidei and hyothyroidei mufcles ; and to its upper edge, the ligamentous membranes of the epiglotis, tongue, and thyroid cartilage, are fixed. The cornua of the os hyoides are ftretched backwards from each fide of its body, where often a fmall furrow points out the former reparation.-Thefe cornua are rot always flreight, nor of equal length ; their two plain furfaces ftand obliquely Hooping from above, out¬ wards and downwards.-Into the external, the cerato gloffus is inferted above, and the thyro-hyoideus mufcle below ; and to the one behind, the ligamentous mem¬ brane of the tongue and larynx adheres. Each of the cornua becomes gradually fmaller, as it is extended from the bafe; but ends in a round tubercle, from which a moveable cartilage Hands out, which is connected to the upper procefs of the cartilago thyroidea. Where the body of the os hyoides joins on each fide with its cornua, a fmall ftyliform procefs, called appen¬ dix, rifes upwards and backwards, into which the muf- culi ftylo-hyoidei alteri, and part of the hyo-gloffi muf¬ cles are fixed. The fubftance of the os hyoides is cellular, but cover¬ ed with a firm external plate, which is of fufficient ftrength to bear the adtions of fo many mufcles as are in¬ ferted into it. It is not articulated with any bone of the body, ex¬ cept by means of the mufcles and ligaments men¬ tioned. The ufe of the os hyoides, is to ferve as a folid lever for die mufcles to ad with, indfaifing or depreffing the tongue and larynx, or in enlarging and diminilhing the capacity of the fauces, OF THE TRUNK. The Trunk confifts of the fpine, pelvis, and thorax. The Spine is the long pile of bones extended from the condyles of the occiput to the end of the rump. - It fomewhat refembles two unequal pyramids joined in a common bafe. It is not, however, ftreight; for its up¬ per part being drawn backwards by ftrong mufcles, it gradually advances forwards, to fupport the oefophagns, veffels of the head, <bc. Then it turns backwards, to make place enough for the heart and lungs. It is next bended forwards, to fupport the vifcera of the abdomen. It afterwards turns backwards, for the enlargement of the pelvis. And, laftly, it is refleded forwards, for fu- ftaining the lowed: great gut. The fpine is commonly divided into true and falfe vertebrae; the former conftituting the long upper .pyra¬ mid, which has its bafe bafe below, while the falfe ver¬ tebrae make the fhorter lower pyramid, whofe bafe is above. The True Vertebrae are the twenty-four upper bones of the fpine, on which the fcveral motions of the trunk of our bodies are performed; from which ufe they have juftly got their name. Each of thefe vertebras is compofed of its body and proceffes. The body is the thick fpongy fore-part, which is con¬ vex before, concave backwards, horizontal and plain in mod of them above and below.-Numerous fmall holes, efpeeially oh the fore and back-part of their fur- face, give paffage to their veffels, and allow the ligaments to enter their fubftance.-The edges of the body of each vertebra are covered, efpeeially at the fore-part, with a ring of bone firmer and mote folid than the fub- ftance of the body any where elfe. Thefe rings are of great ufe in preventing the fpongy bodies from being broken in the motions of the trunk. Between the bodies of each tw'o adjoining vertebrae, a fubftance between the nature of ligament and. cartilage is interpofed; which feems to confift of concentrical curve fibres, when it is cut horizontally; but when it is divided perpendicularly, the fibres appear oblique and de- cuffating each other.-The outer part of the interver¬ tebral ligaments is the moll folid and hard ; and they gra¬ dually become fofter till they arc almoft in the form of a glairy liquor in the centre ; and therefore thefe fub- ftances were not improperly called mucous ligaments by the ancients. The external fibrous part of each is capa¬ ble of being greatly extended, and of being compreffedinto a very fmall fpace, whilft the middle fluid part is'incom- preflible, or nearly fo ; and the parts of this ligament between the circumference and centre approach in their properties to either, in proportion to their more folid"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Part 1. A N A T or more fluid texture. The middle point is therefore a fulcrum or pivot, on which the motion of a ball and focket may be made, with fuch a gradual yielding of the fubftance of the ligament, in whichever direction our fpines are moved, as faves the body from violent Ihocks, and their dangerous confequences.-This ligamento- cartilaginous fubftance is firmly fixed to the horizontal furfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, to connect them, in which it is aflifted by a flrong membranou^igament, which lines all their concave furface, and oy ftill a ftronger ligament, that covers all their anterior convex furface. From each fide of the body of each vertebra, a bony bridge is produced backwards, and to a fide ; from the pofterior end of which, one flanting procefs riles and an¬ other defeends ; the fmooth, and what is generally thfi\" flatted: fide of each of thefe four procefles, which are called the oblique, is covered with a fmooth cartilage; and the two lower ones of each vertebra, are fitted to, and articulated with the two upper or afeending oblique procefles of the vertebra below, having their articular ligaments fixed into the rough line round their edges. From between the oblique procefles of each fide the vertebra is ftretched out laterally into a procefs that is named tranfverfe. From the back-part of the roots of the two oblique, and of the tranfverfe procefs of each fide, a broad ob¬ lique bony plate is extended backwards, where thefe meet, the feventh procefs of the vertebrae takes its rife, and Hands out backwards: This being generally fharp pointed, and narrow edged, has therefore been called fpinal procefs ; from which this whole chain of bones has got its name. Befides the common ligament which lines all the in¬ ternal furface of the fpinal procefles, as well as of the bodies, there are particular ligaments that conned the bony bridges and procefles of the contiguous vertebrae to¬ gether. The fubftance of the procefles is confiderably ftronger and firmer, and has a thicker external plate than the bo¬ dies of the vertebrae have. The feven procefles form a concavity at their fore¬ part, which, joined to the one at the back-part of the bodies, makes a great hole, and the holes of all the ver¬ tebrae form a long large conduit, for containing the fpi¬ nal marrow.-In the upper and lower edge of each la¬ teral bridge, there is a notch. Thefe are fo adapted to each other in the contiguous vertebrae, as to form a round hole in each fide between each two vertebrae, through which the nerves that proceed from the fpinal ■ marrow and its blood-vefi'els pafs. The articulations then of thefe true vertebrae are plainly double ; for their bodies are joined by the inter¬ vening cartilage above deferibed, and their oblique pro¬ cefles being tipped with cartilages, are fo conncded by their ligaments, as to allow a fmall degree of motion to all fides. The true vertebrae ferve to give us an ered pofture ; to allow fuflicient and fecure motion to the head, neck, and trunk of the body, and to fupport and defend the bowels, and other foft parts. O M Y. 167 Though the true vertebra agree in the general ftruc- ture which we have hitherto deferibed ; yet becaufe of feveral fpecialities proper to a particular number, they are commonly divided into three clafles, viz. cervical, dorfal, and lumbar. The cervical are the feven uppermoft vertebrae; which are diftinguilhed frpm the reft by thefe marks.-Their bodies arc fmallcr and more folid than any others, and flatted on the fore-part, to make way for the celophagus ; or rather this flat figure is owing to the prefl'ure of that pipe, and to the action of the longi colli and anterior redi mufcles.-They are alfo flat behind, where fmall procefles rife, to which the internal ligaments are fixed. -The upper furface of the body of each vertebra is made hollow, by a flanting thin procefs which is raifed on each fide:—The lower furface is alfo excavated, but in a different manner; for here the polterior edge is rai¬ fed a little, and the orie before is produced a confider- able way.-Hence we fee how the cartilages between thofe bones are firmly connected, and their articulations are fccure. The cartilages between thefe vertebra are thick, e- fpecially at their fore-part; which is one reafon why the vertebra advance forward as they defeend, and have larger motion. The oblique procefles of thefe bones of the neck more juftly deferve that name than thofe of any other vertebra. They are fituated flanting; the upper ones having their fmooth and almoft flat furfaces facing obliquely back¬ wards and upwards, while the inferior oblique procefles have their furfaces facing obliquely forwards and down¬ wards. The tranfverfe. procefles of thefe vertebra are framed in a different manner from thole of any other bones of the fpine: For befides the common tranfverfe procefs rifing from between the oblique procefles of each fide, there is a fecond one that comes out from the fide of the body of each vertebra; and thefe two procefles, after leaving a circular hole for the paflage of the cervical ar¬ tery and vein, unite, and are confiderably hollowed at their upper part, with rifing fides, to prote< 5 l the nerves that pafs in the hollow; and at laft each fide terminates in an obtufe point, for the infertion of mufcles. The fpinal procefles of thefe cervical bones Hand nearly llreight backwards, are Ihorter than thofe of any other vertebra, and are forked or double at their ends ; and hence allow a more convenient infertion to mufcles. So far molt of the cervical vertebra agree ; but they have fome particular differences, which oblige us to con- fider them feparately. The firft, from its ufe of fupporting the head, has the name of atlas and is alfo calicd epijlropbea, from the motion it performs cn the fecond. The atlas, contrary to all the other vertebra of the fpine, has no body; but, inftead of it, there is a bony arch.-In the convex fore-part of which,., a fmall rifing appears, wht'g the muiculi longi colli are infert- ed ; and, on each fide of this protuberance, a fmall ca¬ vity may be obferved, where the refti interni minores take their rife.-The upper and lower parts of the arch are rough and unequal, where the ligaments that council:"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"168 conned this vertebra to the os occipitis, and to the fe- cond vertebra, are fixed.-The back-part of the arch is conCave, fmooth, and covered with a cartilage, in a recent fubjeft, to receive the tooth-like procefs of the fecond vertebra.—-In a fir ft vertebra, from which the ■ fecond has been feparated, this hollow makes the paf- fage for the fpinal marrow to feem much larger than it really is : On each fide of it a fmall rough finuofity may be remarked, where the ligaments going to the fides of tire tooth-like procefs of the following vertebra are faft- ened ; and on each fide, a fmall rough protuberance and depreftion is obfervable,, where the tranfverfe ligament, which fecurcs the tooth-like procefs in the finuofity, is fixed, and hinders that procefs from injuring the medul¬ la fpinalis in the fleftions of the head. The atlas has as little fpinal procefs as body ; but in- ftead thereof, there is a large bony arch, that the muf- clcs which pafs over this vertebra at that place might not be hurt in extending the head. The fuperior oblique proceftes of this atlas are large, oblong, hollow, and more horizontal than in any other vertebra;--They rife more in their external than in¬ ternal brim; by which their articulations with the con¬ dyloid of the os occipitis are firmer;-Under the ex¬ ternal edge of each of thefe oblique proceiTes, is the fof- fa, or deep open channel, in which the vetebral arte¬ ries make the circular turn, as they are about to enter the great foremen of the occipital bone, and where the tenth pair of nerves goes out.-—The inferior oblique proceftes extending from within outwards and down¬ wards, are large, concave, and circular. So that this vertebra, contrary to the other fix, receives the bones with which it is articulated both above and below'. The tranfverfe proceftes here arc not much hollowed or forked, but are longer and larger than thofe of any other vertebra of the neck, for the origin and infertion of feveral mufcles. The hole for the fpinal marrow is larger in this than in any other vertebra, not only on account of the mar¬ row being largcft here, but alfo to prevent its being hurt by the motions of this vertebra on the fecond one.- This large hole, and the long traverfe proceftes, make this the broadeft vertebra of the neck. The condyles of the os occipitis move forwards and backwards in the fuperior oblique proceftes of this verte¬ bra; but from the figure of the bones forming thefe joints, it appears, that very little motion can here be al¬ lowed to either fide ; and there muft be ftill lefs circular motion. The fecond vertebra colli is called dentata, from the tooth-like procefs on the upper part of its body. The body of this vertebra is fomewhat pyramidical, being large, and produced downwards, efpecially at its fore-fide, to enter into a hollow of the vertebra below ; while the upper part has a fquare procefs with a fmall point Handing out from it. This it is that is imagined to refemble a tooth, and has given name to the verte¬ bra.—The fide of this procefs, on which the hollow of the anterior arch of the firft - vertebra plays, is convex, fmooth, and covered with a cartilage; and it is of the fame form behind, for the ligament, which is extended Part I. tranfverfely from one rough protuberance of the firft ver¬ tebra to the other, and is cartilaginous in the middle, to move on it. The fuperior oblique proceftes of this vertebra den- tata are large, circular, very nearly in an horizontal po- fition, and flightly convex, to be adapted to the inferior oblique proceftes of the firft. vertebra. The tranfverfe proceftes of the vertebra dentata are fliort, vj|y little hollowed at their upper part, and not forked at their ends; and the canals through which the cervical arteries pafs, are reflected outwards about the middle fubftance of each procefs ; fo that the epurfe of thefe veftels may tye directed towards the tranfverfe pro- cefles of the firft vertebra. The fpinal proeefs of this vertebra tendata is thick, ftrong, and fhort, to give fuffieient origin to the mufeuli redti majores, and obliqui inferiores, and to prevent the contufion of thefe and other mulcles. in pulling the head back. The third vertebra of the neck is by fome called axis ; but this name is applied to it with much lefs reafon than to the fecond.-This third, and the three below, have nothing particular in their ftrndture; but all their parts come under the general defeription formerly given, each of them being larger as they defeend. The feventh vertebra of the neek is near to the form of thofe of the back, having the upper and lower furfaces of its body lefs hollow than the others:—The oblique proceftes are more perpendicular;—neither fpinal nor tranfverfe proceftes are forked.—This feventh and the fixth vertebra of the neck have the hole in each of their # tranfverfe proceftes, more fr§quently divided by a fmall crofs bridge, that goes between the cervical vein and arr tery, than any of the other vertebras. The twelve dorfal may be diftinguifhed from the. other vertebrae of the fpine by the following marks. Their bodies are of a middle fize, betwixt thofe of the neck and loinsthey are more convex before than either of the other two forts; and are flatted laterally by the preflure of the ribs, which are inferted into fmall cavities formed in their fidcs. This flatting on their fides, which makes the figure of thefe vertebrae almoft an half oval, is of good ufe; as it affords a firm articulation to the ribs, allows the trachea arteria to divide at a fmall angle, and the other large veftels to run fecure from the ariion of the vital organs.-Thefe bodies are more concave behind than any of the other two claftes.—- Their upper and lower furfaces are horizontal. The cartilages interpofed between the bodies of thefe vertebrafare thinner than in any other of the true verte¬ bras ; and contribute to the concavity of the •fpine in the thorax, by .being thinneft at their fore-part. The oblique proceftes are placed almoft perpendicular ; the upper ones flaming but a Kttie forwards, and the low¬ er ones flanting as much backwards.—They have not as much convexity or concavity as is worth remarking.- Between the oblique proceftes of oppofite fidcs, feveral fharp proceftes Hand out from the upper and lower parts of the plates which join to form the fpinal procefs ; into thefe fharp proceftes ftrong ligaments are fixed, for\" con¬ necting the vertebras. ANATOMY. The"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Part T. ANA The tranfverfe proceffes of the dorfal vertebrae are long, thicker at their ends than in the middle, and turn¬ ed obliquely backwards. The fpinal precedes are long, fimll pointed, and flo- ing downwards and backwards; from their upper and ack-part a ridge rifes, which is received by a fmall channel in the fore-part of the fpinal procefs immediate¬ ly above, which is here connc&ed to it by a ligament. The conduit of the fpinal marrow is here more circu¬ lar, but, correfponding to the fize of that cord, is fmall- er than in any of the other vertebrae, and a larger (hare of the holes in the bony bridges, for the tranfmiffion of the nerves, is formed in the vertebra above, than in the one below. The connexion of the dorfal vertebrae to the ribs, the thinnefs of their cartilages, the eredl fituation of the o- blique proceffes, thelength, Hoping, and connexion of the fpinal proceffes, all contribute to reftrain thefe vertebrae from much motion, which might diffurb the adtions of the heart and lungs;, and, in confequence of the little motion allowed here, the intervertebral cartilages fooner (hrivel, by becoming more folid: And therefore, the ffrft remarkable curvature of the fpine obferved, as people advance to old age, is in the leaft llretched vertebrae of the back ; or old people firft become round-ihouldered. The bodies of the four uppermoft dorfal vertebrae de¬ viate from the rule of the vertebrae, becoming larger as they defeend; for the firft of the four is the largeft, and the other three below gradually become fmaller, to allow the trachea and large veffels to divide at fmaller angles. The two uppermoft vertebrae of the .back, inftead of being very prominent forwards, are flatted by the adtion of the mufeuli longi colli and redti majores. The proportional fize of the two little depreflions in the body of each vertebra, for receiving the heads of the ribs, feems to vary in the following manner ; the de- preffion on the upper edge of each vertebra decreafes as far down as the fourth, and after that increafes. The tranfverfe proceffes are longer in each lower ver¬ tebra to the feventh or eighth, with their fmooth fur- faces, for the tubercles of the ribs, facing gradually more downwards; but afterwards, as they defeend, they become ihorter, and the fmooth furfaces are diredted more upwards. . The fpinous proceffes of the vertebrae of the back be? come gradually longer and more flanting from the firft, as far down as the eighth or ninth vertebra; from which they manifeilly turn ihorter and more eredl. The firft vertebra, befides an oblong hollow in its low¬ er edge, that affifts in forming the cavity wherein the fe- cond rtb is received, has the whole cavity for the head of the firft rib forrj/d in it/ The fecond has the name of axillary, without any thing particular in its ftrudture. The eleventh often has the whole cavity for the ele¬ venth ri£> in its body, and wants the fmooth lurface on each tranfverfe procefs. The twelfth always receives the whole head of the laft rib, and has no fmooth furface on its tranfverfe proceffes, which are very fhort.-The fmooth furfaces of its in¬ ferior oblique proceffes face outwards as the lumbar do. Vol. I. No. 8. 3 T O M Y. 169 --And we may fay in general, that the upper vertebras of the back lofe gradually their refemblance to thofe of the neck, and the lower ones come nearer to the figure of the lumbar. The loweft order of the true vertebrae is the lumbar, which are five bones, that may be diftinguifhed from any others by thefe marks : i. Their bodies, though of a circular form at their fore-part, are fomewhat oblong from one fide to the other ; which may be occafioned by the preffure of the large veffels, the aorta and cava, and of the vifeera. The epiphyfes on their edges are larger, and therefore the upper and lower furfaces of their bo¬ dies are more concave than in the vertebrae of the back. 2. The cartilages between thefe vertebrae are much the thickeft of any, and render the fpine convex within the abdomen, by their greateft thicknefs being at-their fore¬ part. 3. The oblique proceffes are ftrong and deep; thofe in oppofite fides being almoft placed in parallel planes; the fuperior, which are concave, facing in¬ wards, and the convex inferior ones facing outwards: and therefore each of thefe vertebras receives the one a- bove it, and is received by the one below ; which is not fo evident in the other two claffes already deferibed. 4. Their tranfverfe proceffes are fmall, long, and al¬ moft eredt, for allowing large motion to each bone, and fufficient infertion to mufcles, and for fupporting and de¬ fending the internal parts. 5. Betwixt the roots of the fuperior oblique and tranfverfe proceffes, a fmall protu¬ berance may be obferved, where fome of the mufcles that raife the trunk of the body are inferted. 6. Their fpinal proceffes are ftrong, ftreight, and horizontal, with broad flat fides, and a narrow edge above and below; this laft being depreffed on each fide by mufcles. And at the root cf thefe edges, we fee rough furfaces for fix¬ ing the ligaments. 7. The canid for the numerous cords, called cauda equina, into which the fpinal mar¬ row divides, is rather larger in thefe bones than what contains that marrow in the vertebrae of the back. 8. The holes for the paffage of the nerves are more e- qually formed out of both the contiguous vertebrae than in the other claffcs; the upper one furniflies however the larger (hare of each hole. The thick cartilages between thefe lumbar vertebrae, their deep oblique proceffes, and their eredt fpinal pro¬ ceffes, are all fit for allowing large motion; though it is not fo great'as what is performed in the neck; which appears from comparing the arches which the head de- (cribes when moving on the neck, or the loins only. The lumbar vertebrae, as they defeend, have their ob¬ lique proceffes at a greater diftance from each other, iyid facing more backwards and forwards. Both tranfverfe. and fpinal proceffes of the middlemoft vertebrae of the loins are longeft and thickeft; in the ver¬ tebrae above and below they are lels: fo that thefe pro¬ ceffes of the firft and fifth are the leaft, to prevent their ftriking on the ribs or ofl’a ilium, or their bruifing the mufcles in the motions of the fpine. The ephiphyfes round the edges of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae are moil raifed in the two loweft, which confequently make them appear hollower in the middle than the others are. U u The"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"l 7 o A N A T The body of the fifth vertebra is rather thinner than that of the fourth.-The fpinal proccfs of this fifth is fmaller, and the oblique proceffes face more backwards and forwards than in any other lumbar vertebra. The False Vertebr* compofe the under pyramid of the fpine. They are diflinguifhed from the bones al¬ ready defcribed juftl.y enough by this epithet of falfe ; becaufe, though each bone into which they can be di¬ vided in young people, refembles the true vertebrae ill figure, yet none of them contribute to the motion of the trunk of the body ; they being intimately united to each other in adults, except at their lower part, where they are moveable; whence they are commonly divided into two bones, os facrum and eoccygis. Os Sacrum, is fo called from being offered in facri- fice by the ancients, is of an irregular triangular fhape, broad above, narrow below, convex behind, for the ad¬ vantageous origin of the mufcles that move the fpine and thigh backwards; and concave behind, for enlar¬ ging the cavity of the pelvis.-Four tranfverfe lines of a colour different from the reft of the bone, which are feen on its fore-part, are the marks of divifion of the five different bones of which it confifts in young per- fons. The fore-part of the os facrum is fmooth and flat, to allow a larger fpace for the contained bowels, without a- ny danger of hurting them.—The back-part of it is al- moft flreight, without fo large a cavity as the vertebrae have.—The bridges between the bodies and proceffes of this bone, are much thicker, and in proportion fhorter, than in the former clafs of bones.—The firength of thefe crofs-bridges is very remarkable in the three tipper bones, and is well-proportioned to the incumbent weight of the trunk of the body, which thefe bridges fuflain in a tranfverfe, confequently an unfavourable, fituation, when the body is ereft. There are only two oblique proceffes of the os facrum \\ one {landing out on each fide from the upper part of the firfl bone.-Their plain ereifl furfaces face backwards, and are articulated with the inferior oblique proceffes of the lafl vertebra of the loins, to which each of thefe pro¬ ceffes is connected by a flrong ligament, which rifes from a fcabrous cavity round their roots, where mucilaginous glands are alfo lodged.—Inflead of the other oblique proceffes of this bone, four rough tubercles are to be feen on each fide of its furface behind, from which the mufculus facer has its origin. The tranfverfe proceffes here are Ul grown together into one large firong oblong proccfs on'each fide ; which, fo far as it anfwers to the firfl three bones, is very thick, and divided into two irregular cavities, by a long perpen¬ dicular ridge.-The foremofl of the two cavities has commonly a thin cartilaginous fkin covering it in the re¬ cent fubjeifl, and is adapted to the unequal protuberance of the os ilium, and a flrong ligament connects the cir¬ cumference of thefe furfaces of the two bones.-The cavity behind is divided by a tranfverfe ridge into two, where flrong ligamentous firings that go from this bone to the os ilium, with a cellular fubflance containing mu¬ cus, are lodged. The tranfverfe proceffes of the two lafl bones of the O M Y. Part I. os facrum are much fmaller than the former.-At their back-part, near their edge, a knob and oblong flat furface give rife to two flrong ligaments which are ex¬ tended to the os ifehium ; and are therefore called facro- fciatic. The fpinal proceffes of the three uppermofl bones of the os facrum appear fhort, fharp, and almofl ereft, while the two lower ones are open behind; and fome- times a little knob is to be feen on the fourth, though generally it is bifurcated, without the two legs meeting into a fpine; in which condition alfo the firfl is often to be feen. The mufculus latiflimus, and longiffimus dorfi, facrolumbalis, and glut as us maximus, have part of their origins from thefe fpinal proceffes. The canal between the bodies and proceffes of this bone, for the cauda equina, is triangular ; and becomes fmaller as it defeends, as the cauda alfo does.-Be¬ low the third bone, this paffage is no more a complete bony canal, but is open behind ; and is only there de¬ fended by a flrong ligamentous membrane flretched over it, which, with the mufcles that cover it, and are very prominent on each fide, is a fufficicnt defence for the bundle of nerves within. At the root of each oblique procefs of this bone, the notch is confpicuous, by which, and fuch another in the lafl vertebra of the loins, a paffage is left for the twenty- fourth fpinal nerve; and, in viewing the os facrum, either before or behind, four large holes appear in each fide, in much the fame height., as where the marks of the union of its feveral.bones remain. Some of the lar- gefl nerves of the body pafs through the anterior holes; and fuperficial grooves running outwards from them in different directions, fhew the courfe of thefe nerves.- From the intervals of thefe grooves, the pyriformis muf- cle chiefly rifes.-The holes in the back-part -of the bone are covered by membranes which allow fmall nerves to pafs through them.-The two uppermofl of thefe holes, efpecially on the fore-fide, are the largefl; and as the bone defeends, the holes turn fmaller. Some¬ times a notch is only formed at the lower part in each fide of this bone; and in other fubjefts there is a hole common to it and the os coccygis, through which the twenty-ninth pair of fpinal nerves paffes ; and frequently a bony bridge is formed on the back-part of each fide by a procefs.fent up from the back-part of the os coccygis, and joined to the little knobs which the lafl bone of the os facrum has inflead of a fpinal procefs. Under this bridge or jugum, the twenty-ninth pair of fpinal nerves runs in its courfe to the common holes jufl now de¬ fcribed. The fubflance of the os facrum is very fpongy, with¬ out any confiderable folid external plates, and is lighter proportionally to its bulk than any other bone in the bo¬ dy; but is fecured from injuries by the thick mufdes that cover it behind, and by the flrong ligamentous membranes that clofely adhere to it. This bone is articulated above to the lafl vertebra of ’ the loins, in the manner that the lumbar vertebrae are joined; and therefore the fame motions may be perform¬ ed here.-The articulation of the lower part of the os facrum to the os coccygis feems well enough adapted for allowing"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Part I.

The os coccygis is convex behind, and con¬ cave before ; from which crooked pyramidal figure, which was thought to refemble a cuckow’s beak, it has got its name. This bone confifts of four pieces in people of middle ageIn children, very near the whole of it is carti¬ lage : In old fubjefts, all the bones are united, and become frequently one continued bone with the os fa¬ crum. The higheft of the four bones is the largeft, with mufcje of the abdomen is inferted; and from it the in¬ ternal afcending oblique and the tranfverfe mufcles of the belly, with the glutasus maximus, quadratus lumborum, and latiflimus dorfi,.have their origin.—The ends of the fpine are more prominent than the furface of the bone be¬ low them; therefore are reckoned procefles.-From the anterior fpinal procefs, the fartorius and fafcialis mufcles have their rife, and the outer end of the doubled tendon of the external oblique mufcle of the abdomen, commonly called Fallopius ' s or Poupart 's ligament, is fixed to it.-The infide of the pofterior fpinal pro¬ fhoulders extended farther to each fide than the end of cefs, and of part of the fpine forward from that, is made the os facrum;—the upper furface of this bone is a little hollow.-From the back of that bulbous part called its Jhoulders, a procefs often rifcs up on each fide, to join with the bifurcated fpine of the fourth and fifth bones of the os facrum, to form the bony bridge mentioned in the defeription of the os facrum.-Immediately below the fhoulders of the os coccygis, a notch may be remark¬ ed in each fide, where the thirtieth pair of the fpinal nerves pafles.-The lower end of this bone is form¬ ed into a fmall head, which very often is hollow in the middle. The three lower bones gradually become fmaller, and are fpongy; but are ftrengthened by a ftrong ligament which covers and connects them.-Their ends, by which they are articulated, are formed in the fame man¬ ner as thofc of the iirft bone are. The lower end of the fourth bone terminates in a rough point, to which a cartilage is appended. To the fides of thefe oones of the os coccygis, the coccygaei mufcles, and part of the levatores ani, and of the glutari maxirni, are fixed. The os coccygis ferves to fu'ftain the inteftinum rec¬ tum ; and, in order to perform this office more effectu¬ ally, it is made to turn with a curve forwards; by which alfo the bone itfelf, as well as the mufcles and tegu¬ ments, is preferred from any injury, when we fit with our body reclined back. The fecond part of the trunk of the fkeleton, the fiat and rough where the facro-lumbalis and lopgiflimus dorfi rife ; and to its outfide ligaments, extended to the os facrum and tranfverfe procefles of the fifth and fourth. vertebrae of the loins, are fixed.-Below the anterior fpinal procefs another protuberance ftands out, which, by its fituation, may be diftinguifhed. from the former, by adding the epithet of inferior, where the mufculus. reftus tibiae has its origin.—Betwixt thefe two anterior procefles the bone is hollowed where the beginning of the fartorius mufcle is lodged.-Below the pofterior fpinal procefles, a fecond protuberance of the edge of this bone is in like manner obfervable, which is clofely applied to the os facrum.-Under this laft procefs a confiderable large niche is obfervable in the os ilium ; between the fides of which and the ftrong ligament that is ftretched over from the os facrum to the fharp-pointed procefs of the os ifchium of the recent fubjeft, a large hole is formed, through which the mufculus pyriformis, the great fciatic nerve, and the pofterior crural veflels, pafs, and are protected from compreffion. The external broad fide, or dorfum of the os ilium, is:' a little hollow towards the fore part; farther back it is as much raifed; then is confiderably concave ; and, laftly, it is convex. Thele inequalities are occafioned by the aft ions of the mufcles that are fituated on this furface.—From behind the upperraoft of the two anterior fpinal procefles, in fuch bones as are ftrongly marked by the mufcles, a femicircular ridge is extended to the hollow paflage of Pelvis, is the cylindrical cavity at the lower part of the fciatic nerve.

Part T. large cavity with high hriras, to afiift in compofing the great acetabulum. The internal furface <lf the os ilium is concave in its brcadefl fore part, where the internal iliac mufcle has its origin, and feme (hare of the inteftuium ilium and. colon is lodged.---From this large hollow, a fmall finuofity is continued obliquely forwards, at the infide of the anterior inferior fpinal procefs, where part of the pfoas and iliacus mufcles, with the crural velfela and nerves, paf3.—.—r The large concavity is bounded below by a {harp ridge, which runs from behind forwards , and, being continued with fuch another ridge of the os pubis, forms a line of partition between the abdomen and pelvis.-Into this ridge the broad tendon of the pfoas parvus is inferted. All the internal furface of the os ilium, Sehind this ridge, is very ufiequal : For the upper partis flat, but fpongy, where the facro-lumbalis and longifflnlhs dorfi rife.-Lower down, there is a tranfverfe ridge from which ligaments go out to the os facrum.-Immedi¬ ately below this ridge, the rough unequal cavities and prominences are placed, which are exactly adapted to thofe deferibed on the fide of the os facrum. — -In the fame manner, the upper part of this rough furface is po¬ rous, for the firmer adhdion of the ligamentous cellular fubflance ; while the.lower part is more folid, and co¬ vered with a thin cartilaginous {kin, for its immoveable articulation with the os facrum. Os Ischium, or hip-bone, is of a middle bulk between the two other parts of the os innominatum, is fituated loweft of the three, and is of a very irregular figure.— Its extent might be marked by an horizontal line drawn near through the middle of the acetabulum; for the up¬ per bulbous part of this bone forms fome lefs than the lower half of that great cavity, and the fmall leg of it rifes to much the fame height on the other fide of the great hole common to this bone and the os pubis. From the upper thick part of the os ifehium, a (harp procefs, called by fome fpi nous, {lands out backwards, from which chiefly the mufculus coccygaeus and fuperior gemellus, and part of the levator ani, rife; and the an¬ terior or internal facrofciatic ligament is fixed to it.-- Immediately below this procefs, a finuofity is formed for the tendon of the mufculus obturator internus.-In a recent fubjeft, this part of the bone, which ferves as a pully on which the obturator mufcle plays, is co¬ vered with a ligamentous cartilage, that, by two or three fmall ridges, points out the interllices of the fibres in the tendon of this mufcle.-The outer fur¬ face of the bone at the root of this fpinous procefs is made hollow by the pyriformis, or iliacus externus mufcle. Below the finuofity for the obturator mufcle, is the great knob or tuberofity, covered with cartilage or ten¬ don.-The upper part of the tuberofity gives rife to the inferior gemellus mufcle.'-To a ridge at the infide of this, the external or pofterior facrofciatic ligament is fo fixed, that between it, the internal ligament, and the finuofity of the os ifehium, a paflage is left for the inter¬ nal obturator mufcle.-The upper thick fmooth part of the tuber, called by fome its dorfum, has two ob¬ lique impreffions on it. The inner one gives origin to the long head of the biceps flexor tibise and feminervofus mufcles, and the femimembranofus riles from the exte¬ rior one, which reaches higher and nearer the acetabu¬ lum than the other.-The lower, thinner, more fca- braiis part of the kaob which bends forwards, is alfo marked with two flat furfaces, whereof the internal is what we lean upon in fitting, and the external gives rife to the largeft head of the triceps adaudlor femoris.---Be¬ tween the external margin of the tuberofity, and the great hole of the os innominatum, there is frequently an obtufe ridge extended down from the acetabulum, which gives origin to rhe quadratus femoris.—As the tuber advances forwards, it becomes fmaller, and is rough, for the ori¬ gin of the mufculus traWverfalis and eredor penis — • ■ The fmall leg of it, wnich mounts upwards to join the os pubis, is rough and prominent at its edge, where the two lower heads of the triceps or quadriceps addudor femoris take their rife. The upper and back part of the os ifehium is broad and thick; but its lower and fore-part is narrower and thinner. The os ilium and pubis of the fame fide are the only bones which are contiguous to the os ifehium. The Os Pubis, or Jhare-bone, is the leaft of the three parts of the os innominatum, and is placed at the upper fore-part of it.——The thick largeft part of this bone is employed in forming the acetabulum; from which, becoming much fmaller, it is ftretched inwards to its fel¬ low of the other fide, where again it grows larger, and fends a fmall branch downwards to join the end of the fmall leg of the os ifehium.—The upper fore-part of each os pubis is tubgrous and rough where the mufculus redus and pyramidalis are inferted.-From this a ridge is ex¬ tended along the upper edge of the bone, in a continued line with fuch another of the os ilium, which divides the abdomen and pelvis. The ligament of Fallopius is fixed to the internal end of this ridge, and the fmooth hollow below it is made by the pfoas and iliacus internus mufcles palling with the anterior crural veflels and nerves behind the ligament.--Some way below the former ridge,\" another is extended from the tuberous part of the os pubis downwards, and outwards towards the acetabu¬ lum ; between thefe two ridges the bone is hollow and fmooth, for lodging the head of the pedtineus mufcle.- Immediately belotfr, where the lower ridge is to take the turn downwards, a winding nitch is made, which is com¬ prehended in the great foramen of a Ikeleton, but is formed into a hole by a fubtended ligament in the re¬ cent fubjedt, for the paflage of the pofterior crural nerve, an artery, and a vein-The internal end of the os pubis is rough and unequal, for the firmer adliefion of the thick ligamentous cartilage that corme&s it to its fel¬ low of the other fide:—The procefs which goes down from that to the os ifehium is broad and rough before, where the gracilis and upper heads of the triceps, or ra¬ ther quadriceps addudtor femoris, have their origin. Betwixt the os ifehium and pubis a very large irregu¬ lar hole is left, which, from its refemblance jo a door or {hield, has been called thyroides. This hole is all, except the nitch for the pofterior crural nerve, filled up, in a recent fubjedt, with a llrong ligamentous membrane, that"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Part I. A N A T that adheres very firmly to its circumference. From this membrane chiefly the two obturator mufcles, exter¬ nal and internal, take their rife.-The great defign of this hole, befides rendering the.bone lighter, is to allow a ftrong enough origin to the obturator mufcles, and fufficient fpace for lodging their bellies, that there may be no danger of diflurbing the functions of the contained vifcera of the pelvis by the actions of the internal, nor of the external being bruifed by the thigh-bone, efpecial- ly by its lefl'cr trochanter, in the motions of the thigh inwards..——The bowels fometimes* make their way through the nitch for the veflels, at the upper, part of this thyroid hole, which caufes a hernia in this place. In the external furface of the offa innominata, near the outfide of the great hole, a large deep cavity is form¬ ed by all the three bones conjundly: For the os pubis conftitutes about one fifth ; the os ilium makes fomethkng lefs than two fifths, and the os ifchium*as much more than two fifths. The brims of this cavity are very high, and are {till much more enlarged by the ligamentous car¬ tilage, with which $ey are tipped in a recent fubjeft. From this form of the cavity it has been called acetabu¬ lum ;; and, for a diftinguiftiing character, the name of the bone that conllitutes the large!! lhare of it is added; therefore acetabulum oflis ifebii is the name this cavity commonly bears.——Round the bafe of the fuperciha the bone is rough and unequal, where the capfular liga¬ ment of the articulation is fixed.-The brims at the upper and back-part of the acetabulum are much larger and higher than any where elfe ; which is very nccefl’ary to prevent the head of the femur frorti flipping out of its cavity at this place, where the whole weight of the bo¬ dy bears upon it, and confequently would otherwife be conftantly in danger of thrufting it out.-As thefe brims are extended downwards and forwards,, they be¬ come lefs; ana at their internal lower part a breach is made in them; from the one fide of which to the other, a ligament is placed in the recent fubjed ; under which a large hole is left, which contains a fatty cellular fubftance and veffds.——Befides this difference in the height of ■ \" the brims, the acetabulum i^ otherwife unequal: For the lower internal part of it is deprefled below the carti¬ laginous furface of the upper-part, and is not covered with cartilage; into the upper-part of this particular de- preflion, where it is deepeit and of a femilunar form, the ligament of the thigh-bone, commonly called the round one, is inferted; while in its more fuperficial lower part the large mucilaginous gland of this joint is lodged. The large!! fhare of this feparate depreflion is formed in the os ifehium. * The ofla innominata are joined at their back-part to each fide of the os facrum by a fort of future, with a Very thin intervening cartilage, which ferves as fo much glue to cement thefe bones together ; and ftrong ligaments go from the circumference of this unequal furface to con¬ ned them more firmjy. The ofla innominata are con- neded together at their fore-part by the ligamentous car¬ tilage interpofed between the two ofla pubis.—Thefebones can therefore have no, motion in a natural ftate, except what is common to the trunk of the body, or to the os facrum. * Voi.. I. No. 8. o m y. 173 Each os innominatum affords a focket (the acetabu¬ lum) for the thigh-bones to move in, and the trunk of the body rolls here fo mnch on the heads of the thigh¬ bones, as to allow the moft confpicuous motions of the trunk, which are commonly thought to be performed by the bones of the fpine. The pelvis then has a large opep above where it is continued with the abdomen, is ftrongly fenced by bones on the fides, back, and fore-part, and appears with a wide opening below, in the Ikeleton ; but, in the recent fubjed, a confiderable part of the opening is filled by the facrofciatic' ligaments, pyriform, internal obturator, levatores ani, gemini, and coccyg-xi mufcles, which fup- port and proted the contained parts better than bones could have done; fo that fpace is only left at the loweft part of it, for th 4 large excretories, the vefica urinaria, inteftinum redum, and in females, the uterus, to dis¬ charge themfelves. The Thorax, or chefl , reaches from below the neck to the belly; and, by means of<the bones that guard it, is formed into a large cavity : The figure of which is fomewhat conoidal. The bones which form the thorax are the twelve dor- fal vertebra: behind, the ribs on the fides, and the Jler- num before. The vertebra have already been deferibed as part of the fpine. The' Ribs, or ctfla, (as if they v/ere cufiodes, or guards, to thofe principal organs of the animal machine, the heart and lungs), are the long crooked bones placed at the fide of the chert, *in an oblique diredion down¬ wards in refped of the back-bone.-Their number Is generally twelve on each fide; though frequently eleven or thirteen have been found. The ribs are all concave internally ; where they are alfo made finooth by the adion of the contain¬ ed parts, which, on this account, are in no danger of being hurt by them; and they are convex externally, that they might refift that part of the preffure of the at- mofphere, which, is not balanced by the air within the lungs, during infpiration.——The ends of the ribs next the vertebrae are rounder than they are after thefe bones have advanced forwards, when they become flatter and broader, and have an upper and lower edge, each of which is made rough by the adion of the intercoftal muf¬ cles, inferted into them.—The upper edge of the ribs is moreiobtufe and rounder than the lower, which isdepref- fed on its internal fide by a long foffa, for lodging the intercoftal veflels and nerves; on each fide of which there is a ridge, to which the intercoftal mufcles are fixed. The fofl'a is not obfervable however at either end of the ribs: for, at the pofterior or root, the veflels have not yet reached the ribs; and, at the fore-end, they are fplit away into branches, to ferve the parts between the ribs. At the pofterior end of each rib, a little head is formed, which is divided by a middle ridge into two plain or hollow furfaces ; the loweft of which is the broadeft and deepeft in moft of them. The two plains are joined to the bodies of two different vertebra:, and the ridge forces itfelf into the intervening cartilage.— X x A 3"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"174 A N A T A little way from this head, we find, on the external furface, a fmall cavity, where mucilaginous glands are lodged ; and round the head, the bone appears fpongy, where the capfular ligament of the articulation is fixed. •-Immediately beyond this a flatted tubercle rifes, with a fmall carvity at, and roughnefs about its root, for the articulation of the rib with the tranfverfe procefs of the loweft of the two vertebrae, with the bodies of which the head of the rib is joined.—Advancing further on this external furface, we obferve in mod of the ribs an¬ other fmaller tubercle, into which ligaments which con¬ ned! the ribs to each other, and to the tranfverfe prccef- fes of the vertebras, and portions of the longiflimus dorfi, are inferted.——Beyond this the ribs are made flat by the facro-lumbalis mufcle, which is inferted into the part of this flat furface fartheft from the lpine, where each rib makes a confiderable curve, called by fome its angle. -Then the rib begins to turn broad, and con¬ tinues fo to its anterior end, which is hollow and fpongy, for the reception of, and firm coalition with the carti¬ lage that runs thence to be inferted into the fternum, or to be joined with fome other cartilage. To the fore-end of each rib a long broad and ftrong cartilage is fixed, and readies thence to the fternum, or is joined to the cartilage of the next rib. This courfe, however, is not in a ftreight line with the rib; for gene; t ally the cartilages make a confiderable curve, the con¬ cave part of which is upwards; therefore, at their infer- tion into the flernum, they make an obtufe angle above, and an acute one below.—Thefe cartilages, as all others, are firmer and harder internally, than they are on their external furface. The ribs then are articulated at each end, of which the one behind is doubly joined to the vertebrae; for the head is received into the cavities of two bodies of the vertebrae, and the larger tubercle is received into the de- preflion in the tranfverfe procefs of the lower vertebra. Hitherto we have laid down the general ftruCture and connexion of the ribs, and fhall next mark their differ¬ ences. In viewing the ribs from above downwards, their fi¬ gure is Hill (freighter; the uppermoft being the moft crooked of any.—Their obliquity, in refpeCt of the fpine, incrcafes as they defeend; fo that though their diftan- ces from each other is very little different at their back- part, yet at their fore-ends the diftances between the lower ones muft increafe. The length of the ribs increafes from the firft and nppermoft rib, as far down as the feventh ; and from that to the twelfth, as gradually diminifhes.-The fu- perior of the two plain, or rather hollow furfaces, by which the ribs are articulated to the bodies of the ver¬ tebrae, gradually increafes from the firft to the fourth rib, and is diminifhed after that in each lower rib.- The diftance of their angles from the heads always in¬ creafes as they defeend to the ninth, becaufe of the greater breadth of the facro-lumbalis mufcle. The ribs are commonly divided into true and falfe. The true coftae are the feven upper ones of each fide, whofe cartilages are all gradually longer as the ribs defeend, and are joined to the breaft-hone; fo that being prefled O M Y. Part I. conftantly between two bones, they are flatted at both ends, and are thicker, harder, and more liable to offify, than the other cartilages that are not fubjeet to fo much preflure. Thefe ribs include the heart and lungs; and therefore are the proper or true cuftodes of life. The five inferior l ibs of each fide are the falfe or ba- flarii , whofe cartilages do net reach to the fternum ; and therefore, wanting the refiftance at their fore-part, they are there pointed; and, on this account, having lefs preflure, their fubflance is fofter.--The cartilages of thefe falfe ribs are lhorter as the ribs defeend.- To all thefe five ribs the circular edge of the diaphragm is connected; and its fibres, inftead of being ftretched immediately tranfverfely, and fo running perpendicular to the ribs, are prefled fo as to be often, efpecially in expiration, parallel to the plane in which the ribs lie. The firft rib of each fide is fo fituated, that the flat fides are above and below, while one edge is placed in¬ wards, and the other outwards, or neatly fo; there¬ fore fufficient fpace is left above it for the fubclavian vef- lels and mufcle; and the broad concave furface is oppo- led to the lungs : But then, in confequence of this fitu- ation, the channel for the intercoftal vefiels is not to be found, and the edges are differently formed from all the other, except the fecohd; the lower one being rounded, and the other (harp.-The head of this rib is not di¬ vided into two plain furfaces by a middle ridge, becaufe it is only articulated with the firft vertebra of the tho¬ rax.-Its cartilage is oflified in adults, and is united to the fternum at right angles.—Frequently this firft 1 b has a ridge rifing near the middle of its pofterior edge, where one of the heads of the fealenus mufcle rifes.-f ar¬ ther forward it is flatted, or fometimes depreffed by the clavicle. The fifth, fixth, and feventh, or rather the fixth, feventh, eighth, and fometimes the fifth, fixth, feventh, eighth, ninth ribs, have their cartilages at leaft contigu¬ ous ; and frequently they are joined to each other by crofs cartilages; and moft commonly the cartilages of the eighth, ninth, tenth, are connected n to the former, and to each other, by firm ligaments. The eleventh, and fometimes the tenth rib, has no tu¬ bercle for its articulation with the tranfverfe procefs of the vertebra, to which it is only loofely fixed by liga¬ ments.—The foffa in its lower edge is not fo deep as in the upper, ribs, becaufe the vefiels run more towards the interftice between the ribs.—Its fore-end is fmaller than its body, and its fhort finall cartilage is but loofely con¬ nected to the cartilage of the lib above. The twelfth rib is the fhorteft and ftreighteft.—Its head is only articulated with the laft vertebra of the thorax ; therefore is not divided into two furfaces.— This rib is not joined to the tranfverfe procefs of the vertebra, and therefore has no tubercle, being often pul¬ led neceffarily inwards by the diaphragm, which an arti¬ culation with the tranfverfe procefs would not have al¬ lowed.—-The foffa is not found at its under edge, be¬ caufe the vefiels run below it.—The fore-part of this rib is fmaller than its middle, and has only a very fmfill- pointed cartilage fixed to it.—To its whole internal fide the diaphragm is connected."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Part I. A N A 1 The Sternum, or breaft-bone, is the broad flat bona or pile of bones, at the fore-part of the thorax.—In adults of a middle age, it is compofed of three bones, which eafily feparate after the cartilages connecting them are deftroyed. Frequently the two lower banes are found intimately united; and very often in old people, the fternum is a continued bony fubftance from one end to the other; though we flill obferve two, fometimes three, tranfverfc lines on its furface; which are marks of the former divisions. When we coufidcr the fternum as one bone, we find it broadeft and thicket!: above, and becoming fmaller as ft defeends. The internal furface of this bone is fomewhat hollowed for enlarging the thorax; but the convexity on the external furface is not fo confpicuous, becaufc the fides are prefiecL outwards by the true ribs; the round heads of whofe cartilages are received into feven fmooth pits, formed in each fide of the fternum, and are kept firm there by ftrong ligaments, which, on the external furface, have a particular radiated texture.—The pits at, the upper part of the fternum are at the greateft diftance one from another, and, as they defeend, are nearer; fo that the two lowed are contiguous. The firft of the three bones that compofe the fternum, all agree, is fomewhat of the figure of a heart, as it is commonly painted; only it does not terminate in a lharp poirn.-This is the uppermoft thickcft part of the fternum. The upper middle part of this firft bone, where it is thickeft, is hollowed, to make place for the trachea ar- teria; though this cavity is principally formed by the bone being raifed on each fide of it, partly by the cla¬ vicles thrufting it inwards, and partly by the fterno-ma- ftoidei mufcles pulling it upwards.-On the outfide of each tubercle, there is an oblong cavity, that, in view¬ ing it tranfverfely from before backwards, appears a little convex : Into thefe glena: the ends of the clavicles are re¬ ceived.—In the fide of the under end of this firft bone, the half of the pit for the fecond rib on each fide is formed.-The upper part of the furface behind is co¬ vered with a ftiong ligament, which fecures the cla¬ vicles. The fecond or middle divifion of this bone, is much longer, narrower, and thinner than the fiift; but, ex¬ cepting that it is a little narrower above than below, it is nearly equal all over in its dimenfions of breadth cr thicknefs.'-In the fides of it are complete pits for the third, fourth, fifth, and fixth ribs, and an half of the pits for the fecond and feventh. The third bone is much lefs than the other two, and has only one half of the pit for the feventh rib formed in it; wherefore it might be reckoned oniy an appendix of the fternum.-In young fubje&s it is always carti¬ laginous, and is better known by the name of cartilago xiphoides, or enfiformis , than any other; though the an¬ cients often called the whole fternum etijifomte.- —This third bone is feldom of the fame figure, magnitude, cr lituation in any two fubje&s; for fometimes it is a plain triangular bone, with one of the angles below, and per¬ pendicular to the middle of the upper fide, by which it is coi.nedted to the feccnd bone.— ■ —In ether people, the O M Y. 175 point is turned to one fide, or obliquely forwards or back¬ wards.—Frequently it is all-nearly of an equal breadth, and in feveral fubjedls it is bifurcated; whence fome wri¬ ters give it the name of fturcella, or furcula inferior ; or elfc it is unoflified in the middle.-In the greateft number of adults it is oflified, and tipped with a carti¬ lage ; in fome, one half of it is cartilaginous; and in o- thers, it is all in a cartilaginous ftate.—Generally feveral oLlique ligaments, fixed at one end to the cartilages of the ribs, and by the other to the outer furface of the xi¬ phoid-bone, connerdt it firmly to thofe cartilages. The ufes of the fternum are, to afford origin and in- iertion to feveral mufcles; to fuftain the mediaftintim, to defend the vital organs, the heart and lungs, at the fore-part; and, laftly, by ferving as a moveable fulcrum of the ribs, to aflift confiderably in refpiration. OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. Each fuperior extremity is divided into the ftooulder, arm, fore-arm , and band. The Shoulder confifts of the clavicle and fcapula Clavicula, or collar-bone, is the long crooked bone, in figure like like an Italic /, placed almoft horizontally between the upper lateral part of the fternum, and what is commonly called the top of the fhoulder, which, as a clavisor beam, it bears off from the trunk of the body. The clavicle, a3 well as other long round bones, is larger at its two ends than in the middle.

From this internal end the clavicle, for about two fifths of its length, is bended obliquely forwards and down¬ wards.

The medullary arteries, having their direction oblique¬ ly outwards, enter the clavicles by one or more fmall paflages in the midale of their back-part.

The ufes of the clavicles are, to keep the fcapulae, and confequently all the fuperior extremities, from falling in and forward upon the thorax. Scapula, or Jhoulder-blade, is the triangular bone fituated on the outfide of the ribs, with its longed fide, called its bafe, towards the fpinal procefles of the verte¬ brae, and with the angle at the upper part of this fide about three inches, and 'the lower angle at a greater di¬ ftance from thefe procefles.—The back-part of the fca¬ pula has nothing but the thin ends of the ferratus anticus major, and fubfcapularis mufcles, between it and the ribs: But as this bone advances forwards, its diftance from the ribs increafes.—The upper, orfhorteft fide, call¬ ed the fuperior cofta of the fcapula, is nearly horizontal, and parallel with the fecond rib.—The lower fide, which is named the inferior cojia, is extended obliquely from the third to the eighth rib.-The inferior angle of the fcapula is very acute; and the upper one is near to a right angle.—•—The body of this bone is concave towards the ribs, and convex behind, where it has the name of dor - fum. -Three procefles are generally reckoned to pro¬ ceed from the fcapula.-The firft is the. large fpine that rifes from its convex furface behind, and divides it unequally.-The fecond procefs (lands out from the fore-part of the upper fide ; and, from its imaginary re- femblance to a crow’s beak, is named coracoides. - The third procefs is the whole thick bulbous fore-part of the bone.

The back-part of the inferior angle is made fmooth by the latiflimus dorfi pafling over it. This mufcle alfo af¬ ters the dire&ion of the inferior cofta, fome way forwards from this angle: and fo far it is flatted behind by the o- rigin of the teres major.-As the inferior cofta ad¬ vances forwards, it is of confiderable thicknefs, is (light¬ ly hollowed and made fmooth behind by the teres minor, while it has a fofla formed into it below by part of the fubfcapularis ; and between the two a ridge, with a fmall depreflion, appears, where the longus extenfor cubiti has its origin. The fuperior cofta is very thin; and near its fore-part there is a femilunar nitch, from one end of which to the other a ligament is ftretched; and fometimes the bone is continued, to form one, or fometimes two holes, for the paflage of the fcapular blood-vcflels and nerves. -Immediately behind this femilunar cavity,.- the cora- co-hyoid mufcle has its rife.-From the nitch, to the termination of the fofla for the teres minor, the fcapula is narrower than any where elfe, and fupports the third procefs. This part has the name of cervix. The whole dorfum of the fcapula is always faid to be convex; but, by reafon of the raifed edges that furround it, it is divided into two cavities by the fpine, which is ftretched from behind forwards, much nearer to the fu¬ perior than to the inferior cofta..-The cavity above the fpine is concave where the fupra-fpinatus mufcle is lodged ; while the furface of this bone below the fpine, on which the infra-fpinatus mufcle is placed, is convex, except a foflTa that runs at the fide of the inferior cofta. The internal or anterior furface of this bone is hollow, except in the part above the fpine, which is convex.- The fubfcapularis mufcle is extended over this furface, where it forms feveral ridges and intermediate depref- fions, commonly miftaken for prints of the ribs; they point out the interftices of the bundles of fibres of which the fubfcapularis mufcle is compofed. The fpine rifes fmall at the bafe of the fcapula, and becomes higher and broader as it advances forwards.- On the fides it is unequally hollowed and crooked, by the actions of the adjacent mufcles.-Its ridge is di¬ vided into two rough flat furfaces: Into the upper one, the trapezius mufcle is inferted; and the lower one has part of the deltoid fixed to it.-The end of the fpine, called acromion, or top of the (houlder, is broad and flat, and is fometimes only joined to the fpine by a car¬ tilage.-The anterior edge of the acromion is flat, fmooth, and covered with a cartilage, for its articulation with the external end of the clavicle; and it is hollowed below, to allow a paflage to the infra and fupra-fpinati mufefes, and free motion to the os humeri.

Into the internal, the ferratus minor anticus is inferted: From the external, one head of the biceps flexor cubiti rifes ; and from the lower one, the coraco- brachialis has its origin.-At the upper part of the root of this procefs, immediately before the femilunar cavity, a fmooth tubercle appears, where a ligament from the clavicle is fixed. From all the external fide of this coracoid apophyfe, a broad ligament goes out, which be¬ comes narrower where it is fixed to the acromion. From the cervix fcapulac the third procefs is produced. The fore-part of this is formed into a glenoid cavity, which is of the fhape of the longitudinal fedtion of an egg, being broad below, and narrow above,.—Between the brims of this hollow, and the fore-part of the root of the fpine, a large' finuofity is left, for the tranfmiflion of the fupra and infra-fpinati mufcles ; and, on the upper part of thefe brims, we may remark a fmooth furface, where the fecond head of the biceps flexor cubiti has its origin.-- The root of the fupercilii is rough all round, for the firmer adhefion .of the. capfular ligament of the articu¬ lation, and of the cartilage which is placed on thefe brims, where it is thick, but becomes very thin as it is continued towards the middle of the cavity, which it lines all over.

The exterior of thefe two flat furfaces is the largeft; behind it a fuperficial fpiral channel, formed by the mufcular nerve and the veflels that accompany it, runs from behind forwards and downwards.—The body of the os humeri is flatted behind by the extenfors of the fore-arm.-Near the lower end of this bone, a large lharp ridge is extended on its outfidc, from which the mufeulqs fpinator radii longus, and the longeft head of the extenfor carpi radialis rife.—Oppofite to this, there is another fmall ridge, to which the aponeurotic tendon, that gives origin to the fibres of the internal and external brachioei mufcles, is fixed ; and from a little depreflion on the fore-fide of it, the pronator radii teres rifes. The body of the os humeri becomes gradually broader towards the lower end, where it has feveral procefles •„ at the roots of which there is a cavity before, and ano¬ ther behind. The anterior is divided, by a ridge, into two; the external, which is the leaft, receives the end of the radius; and the. internal receives the coronoid procefs of the ulna in the fleftion of the fore-arm, while the pofterior deep triangular cavity lodges the ole¬ cranon in the extenfions of that member.—The fides of Y y the 3"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"178 A N A T the pofterior cavity are ftretched out into two procefles, one on each fide: Tliefe are called condyles; from each of which a ftrong ligament goes out to the bones of the fore-arm.—The external condyle, which has an oblique dire&ion alfo forwards in refpeift of the internal, when the arm is in the molt natural pofture, is equally broad, and has an obtufe fmootli head ’rifing from it forwards.— From the rough part of the condyle, the inferior head of the bicornis, the extenfor digitorum communis, ex- tenfor carpi ulnaris, anconceus, and fome part of the fu- pinator radii brevis, take their rife; and on the fmooth head the upper end of the radius plays.—Immediately on the outfide of this, there is a finuofity made by the fhorter head of the bicornis niufcle, upon which the muf- cular nerve is placed.--The internal condyle is more pointed and protuberant than the external, to give origin to fome part of the flexor carpi radialis, pronator radii teres, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum fublimis, and flexor carpi ulnaris.—Between the two condyles, is the trochlea or pully, which confifts of two lateral protube¬ rances, and a* middle cavity, that are fmooth, and co¬ vered with cartilage.—Wheij the fore-arm is extended, the tendon of the internal brachioeus mufcle is lodged in the fore-part of the cavity of this pully.—The external protuberance, which is left than the other, has a Iharp edge behind; but forwards, this ridge is obtufe, and on¬ ly feparated from the little head, already defcribed, by a fmall fofla, in which the joined edges of the ulna and radius move.—The internal protuberance of the pully is largeft and higheft; and therefore, in the motions of the ulna upon it, that bone would be inclined outwards, was it not fupported by the radius on that fide.-Between this internal protuberance and condyle, a finuofity may be remarked, where the ulnar nerve pafles. The round head at the upper end of this bone is arti¬ culated with the glenoid cavity of the fcapula; which being fuperficial, and having long ligaments, allows the arm a free and extenfive motion. The motions which the arm enjoys by this articulation, are to every fide; and by the fucceflion of thefe differ¬ ent motions, a circle may be defcribed. Befides which, the bone performs a fmall rotation round its own axis. The Fore-arm confills of two long bones, the ulna and radius; whofe fituation, in refpedt of each other, is oblique in the leaft (training or moll natural pofture; that is, the ulna is not dir edify behind, nor on the outfide of the radius, but in a middle fituation between thefe two, and the radius erodes it.—In the following defcription, by the term pojlerior is meant that part which is in the fame direction with the back of the hand; by anterior, that anfwering to the palm; by internal, that on the fame fide with the thumb; by external , the fide neareft the little finger. Ulna, fo named from its being ufed as a meafure, is the longed of the two bones of the fore-arm, and fitua- ted on the outfide of the radius. At the upper end of the ulna are two procefles.—The pofterior is the largeft, and formed like a hook, whofe concave furface moves upon the pully of the os humeri, and is called olecranon, or top of the cubit.—The con¬ vex back-part of it is rough and fcabrous, where the lon- O M Y.

Radius, fo called from its imagined refemblance to a fpoke of a wheel, is the bone placed at the infide of the fore-arm. Its upper end is formed into a circular little head, which is hollowed for an articulation with the tu¬ bercle at the fide of the pully of the os humeri; and the half of the round circumference of the head next to the ulna is fmooth, and covered with a cartilage, in order to be received into the femilunated cavity of that bone. -Below the head, the radius is much fmaller; there¬ fore this part is named its cervix , which is made round by the aCtion of the fupinator radii brevis.-At the external root of this neck, a tuberous procefs rifes ; in¬ to the outer part of which the biceps flexor cubiti is in¬ ferted.'—•—From this a ridge runs downwards and in¬ wards, where the fupinator radii brevis is inferted; and a little below, and behind this ridge, there is a rough fcabrous furface, where the pronator radii teres is fixed.

The ends of both the bones of the fore-arm being thicker than the middle, there is a confiderable dillance between the bodies of thefe bones ; in the larger part of which a flrong tendinous, but thin ligament, is extend¬ ed, to give a large enough furface for the origin of the numerous fibres of the mufcles fituated here, that are fo much funk between the bones, as to be protected from injuries, which they would otherwife be expofed to. As the head of the radius receives the tubercle of the os humeri, it is not only bended and extended along, with the ulna, but may be moved round its axis in any po« fition; and that this motion round its axis may be fuffi- ciently large, the ligament of the articulation is extended farther down than ordinary on the neck of this bone, be¬ fore it is connected to it; and it is very thin at its upper and lower part, but makes a firm ring in the middle.— This bone is alfo joined to the ulna by a double articu¬ lation ; for above, a tubercle of the radius plays in a focket of the ulna; whilft below, the radius gives the foc- ket, and the ulna the tubercle: But then the motion per¬ formed in thefe two is very different; for, at the upper end, the radius does no more than turn round its axis ; while, at the lower end, it moves in a fort of cycloid upon the round part of the ulna; and as the hand is arti¬ culated and firmly connected here with the radius, they mull move together.— When the palm is turned upper- moft, the radius is faid to perform the fupination; when the back of the hand is above, it is faid to be prone.

Trapezium has four unequal fides and angles in its back-part, from which it has got its name.-Above, its furface is fmooth; (lightly hollowed, and femicir- cular, for its conjunction with the os fcaphoides.-Its external fide is an oblong concave fquare, for recei¬ ving the following bone.-The inferior furface is formed into a pulley ; the two protuberant fides of which are external and internal. On this pulley the firft bone of the thumb is moved.-At the exter¬ nal lide of the external protuberance, a fmall oblong fmooth furface is formed by the os metacarpi indicis. -—The fore-part of the trapezium is prominent in the palm, and, near to the external fide, has a finuofity in it, where the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is lod¬ ged ; on the ligamentous (heath of which the tendon of the flexor tertii internodii pollicis plays : And ftill more externally the bone is fcabrous, where the tranfverfe li¬ gament of the wrift is connected, the abduCtor and flexor primi internodii pollicis have their origin, and ligaments go out to the firft bone of the thumb. Os trapezoides, fo called from the irregular quadran¬ gular figure of its back-part, is the fmalleft bone of the wrift, except the pififorme.—The figure of it is an irre¬ gular cube.—It has a fmall hollow furface above, by which it joins the fcaphoides; a long convex one inter¬ nally, where it is contiguous to the trapezium ; a fmall external one, for its conjunction with the os magnum ; and an inferior convex furface, the edges of which are however fo raifed before and behind, that a fort of pul¬ ley is formed, where it fuftains the os metacarpi indicis. Os magnum, fo called becaufe it is the largeft bone of the carpus, is oblong, having four quadrangular fides, with a round upper end, and a triangular plain one be¬ low.—The round head is'divided by a fmall riling, op- pofite to the connection of the os fcaphoides and lunare, which together form the cavity for receiving it.—On the infide, a (hort plain furface joins the os magnum to the trapezoides.—On the outfide is a long narrow concave furface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme.- The lower end, which fuftains the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, is triangular, (lightly hollowed, and farther advanced on the internal fide than on the external, having a c'onfiderable oblong depreflion made on the advanced infide by the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger; and generally there is a fmall mark of the os metacarpi digiti annularis on its external fide. Os unciforme has got its name from a thin broad pro¬ cefs that (lands out from it forwards into the palm, and is hollow on its infide, for affording paffage to the ten¬ dons of the flexors of the fingers. To this procefs alfo the tranfverfe ligament is fixed, that binds down and defends thefe tendons; and the flexor and abduCtor mulcles of the little finger have part of their origin from it.—The upper plain furface is fmall, convex, and join¬ ed with the os Junare:—The internal fide is long, and llightly convex, adapted to the contiguous os magnum:"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Part I. * A N A T O M Y. 181 The external furface is oblique, and irregularly convex, to be articulated with the cuneiform bone :—The lower end is divided into two concave furfaces ; the external is joined with the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and the internal one is fitted to the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger. The ufes of the carpus are, to ferve as a bafe to the hand, to protect its tendons, and to afford it a free large motion.

The concavity on the fore-part of thefe metacarpal bones, and the placing their bafis on the arched carpus, caufe them to form a hollow in the palm of the hand, which is ufeful often to us.—The fpaces between them lodge mufcles, and their fmall motion makes them fit fupporters for the fingers to play on. Though the ofla metacarpi fo far agree, yet they, may be diftinguifhed from each other by the following marks.

The anterior ridge of its body is fituated more to the out than to the in-fide.—^ The tubercles near the head are equal.—The motion of this third metacarpal bone is greater than the motion of the fecond. Os metacarpi minimi digiti is the fmallel! and (harp¬ ed:.—Its bafe is . irregularly convex, and rifes llanting outwards.—Its internal fide is exaClly adapted to the third metacarpal bone.—The external has no fmooth furface, becaule it is not contiguous to any other bone; but it is prominent where the extenfor carpi ulnaris is inferted.—As this metacarpal bone is furnilbed with a proper moving mufcle, has the plainefl articulation, is molt loofely connected and leal! confined, it not only enjoys a much larger motion than any“of the reft, but draws the third bone with it, when the palm of the hand is to be made hollow by its advancement forwards, and by the prominence of the thumb oppofite to it. The Thumb and four Fingers are each compofed of three long bones. The thumb is fituated obliquely in refpeCt of the fin¬ gers, neither oppofite direCHy to them, nor in the fame plane with them,—All its bones are much thicker and ftronger in proportion to their length, than the bones of the fingers are: Which was extremely neccflary, fince the thumb counteracts all the fingers. The firll bone of the thumb has its bafe adapted to the double pulley of the trapezium.—The edge at the fore-part of this bafe is produced farther than any other part; and round the back-part of the bafe a rough fofla may be leen, for the connection of the ligaments of this joint.—The body and head of this bone are of the fame lhape as the ofla metacarpi: only that the body is Ihort¬ er, and the head flatter, with the tubercles at the fore¬ part of its root larger.

The fecond bone of the thumb has a large bafe form¬ ed into an oblong cavity, whofe greateft length is from one fide to the other.—Round it feveral tubercles may be remarked, for the infertion of ligaments.—Its body is convex, or a half-round behind; but flat before, for lodging the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb, which is tied down by ligamentous (heaths that are fixed on each fide to the angle at the edge of this flat furface. The articulation and motion of the upper end of this fecond bone is as lingular as that of the former.!—For its cavity being joined to the round head of the firft bone, it would feem at firft view to enjoy motion in all di- reftions; yet, becaufe of the ftrength of its lateral liga¬ ments, oblong figure of the joint itfelf, and mobility of the .firft joint, it only allows fledtion and exienfion; and thefe are generally much confined. The third bone of the thumb is the fmalleft, with a large bafe, whofe greateft extent is from one fide to the other.--This bafe is formed into two -cavities and a middle protuberance, to be adapted to the pulley of the forfner bone.-Its body is rounded behind; but is flatter than in the former bone, for fuftaining the nail.— It is flat and rough before, by the infertion of the flexor tertii internodii.-This bone becomes gradually fmal- ler, till near the lower end, where it is a little enlarged, and has an oval fcabrous edge. The motion of this third bone is confined to fleftion and extenfion. The orderly difpofition of the bones of the fingers, in¬ to three rows, has made them generally obtain the name of three phalanges.— -All of them have half-round convex furfaces, covered with an aponeuroiis, formed by the tendons of the extenfors, lumbricales, and interoflei, and placed diredtly backwards, for their greater ftrength ; and their flat concave part is forwards, for taking hold more furcly, and for lodging the tendons of the flexor mufcles.-The ligaments for keeping down thefe tendons are fixed to the angles that arc between the con¬ vex and concave fides. The bones of the firft phalanx of the fingers anfwer to the defeription of the fecond bone of the thumb: on¬ ly that the cavity in their bafe is not fo oblong; nor is their motion on the metacarpal bones fo much confi¬ ned ; for they can be moved laterally or circularly, but have no rotation, or a very fmall degree of it, round their axis. The fecond bone of the fingers has its bafe formed into two lateral cavities, and a middle protuberance; while the lower end has two lateral protuberances, and a middle cavity; therefore it is joined at both ends in the fame manner, which none of the bones of the thumb are. The third bone differs nothing from the defeription of the third bone of the thumb, excepting in the general diftinguifhing marks ; and therefore the fecond and third phalanx of the fingers enjoy only flection and extenfion. All the difference of the phalanges of the feveral fin¬ gers confifts in their magnitude.-The bones of the O M Y. Parti. middle-finger being the longeft and largeft.—Thofe of the fore-finger come next to that in thicknefs, but not in length, for thofe of the ring-finger are a little longer. The little finger has the fmalleft bones. Which difphfi- tion is the bell contrivance for holding the largeft bodies; becaufe the longeft ringers are applied to the middle lar¬ ge ft periphery of fuch fubftances as are of a fperical fi¬ gure. ' The ufes of all the parts of our fuperior extremities are fo evident in the common actions,of life, that it is needlefs to enumerate them here; and therefore we fhafl proceed to the laft part of the fkeleton. OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. The Inferior Extremities depend from the a- cctabula of the ofla innominata; are commonly divided into three parts, viz. the thigh, leg s and foot,. The Thigh -has only one bone ; which is the longeft of the body. The fituation of it is not perpendicular ; for the lower end i% inclined confiderably inwards: So that the knees are almoft contiguous, while there is a confiderable diftance between the thigh-boDes above : Which is of good ufe. to us, fince fufficient fpace is there¬ by left for the external parts of generation, the two great cloaca of urine and fceces, and for the large thick mufr clcs that move the thigh inwards : And, at the fame time, this fituation. of the thigh-bones renders our pro- greflion quicker, furer, ftreighter, and in lefs room. The upper end of the thigh-bone is not continued in a ftreight line with the body of it, but is fet oflf obliquely inwards and upwards, whereby the diftance here between thefe two bones at their upper part is confiderably in- creafed.--This end is formed into a large fmooth round head, which is the greater portion of afphere-un- equally divided.-Towards its lower internal part, a round rough fpongy pit is obfervable, where the ftrong ligament, commonly called the round one, is fixed, to be extended from thence to the lower internal part of the receiving cavity, where it is confiderably broader than near to the head of the thigh-bone.-The fmall part below the head, called the cervix, of the osfemoris, has a great many large holes, into which the fibres of the ftrong ligament, continuEd from the capfular, enter, and are thereby furcly united to it; and round the root of the neck, where it rifes from the bone, a rough ridge is found, where the capfular ligament of the articulation it¬ felf is connected.-Below the back-part of this root, the large unequal protuberance, called trochanter major, ftands out; the external convex part of which is diftin- guifhed into three different furfaces, w hereof the one on the fore-part is fcabrous and rough, for the infertion of the glutseus minimus; the fuperior one is fmooth, and has the glutasus medius inferted into it; and the one be¬ hind is made flat and fmooth by the tendon of the glur taeus maximus paffing over it.-The upper edge of this procefs is (harp and pointed at its back-part, where .the glutieus medius is fixed; but forwards it is more'ob- tufe, and has tw o fuperficial pits formed in it: Into the fuperior of thefe, the piriformis is implanted; and the obturator interims and gemini are fixed into the lower one."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Part I. A N A T one.-From the backmoft prominent part of this great- trochanter, a rough ridge runs‘backwards and downwards, into which the quadratus is inferted.- In the deep hollow, at the internal upper fide of this ridge, the obturator externus is implanted.-More in¬ ternally, a conoid procefs, called trochanter minor , rifes, for the infertion of the mufculus pfoas and iliacus inter- nus, and the pedtineus is implanted into a rough hol¬ low below its internal root.— ■ —The mufcles inferted in¬ to thefe two procefies being the principal inltruments of the rotatory motion of the thigh, have occafioned the name of trochanters to the proceffes. The body of the os fcmoris is convex on the fore-part, and made hollow behind, by the aCtion of the mufcles that move it and the leg, and for the conveniency of fit¬ ting, without bearing too much on thefe mufcles.- The fcre-part of the thigh-bone is a little flatted above by the beginning^of the crurseus mufcle, as it is alfo be¬ low. by the fame mufcle and the reCtus.—-Its external furface is likewife made flat below by the vaftus externus, where it is feparated from the former by an obtufe ridge. —-r-The valtus internus deprefies a little the lower part of the internal furface.-The pofterior concave fur- face has a ridge rifing in its middle, commonly called ti¬ nea afpera, into which the triceps is inferted, and the fttort head of the biceps flexor tibiee riles from it.- At the upper part of it, the medullary vellels enter by a fmall hole that runs obliquely upwards.—A little above which, there is a rough fofia or two, where the tendon of the glutaeus maximus is fixed.-The lower end of the linea afpera divides into two, which defeend towards each fide.-The two valli mufcles have part of their ( origin from thefe ridges ; and the long tendon of the tri¬ ceps is fixed to the internal, by means of part of the fafeia aponeurotica of the thigh.-Near the beginning of the internal ridge, there is a difeontinuation of the ridge, where the crural artery pafles through the apo- neurofis.--Between thefe two rough lines, the bone is made flat by the large blood-Yeflels and nerves which pafs upon it; and near the end of each of thefe ridges, a fmall fmooth protuberance may often be remarked, where the two heads of the external gaftrocnemius muf- clc take their rife ; and from the fore-part of the inter¬ nal tubercle, a ftrong ligament is extended to the infide of tire tibia. The lower end of the os femoris is larger than any o- ther part of it, and is formed into a great protuberance on each fide, called its condyles', between which a confi- derable cavity is found, eipecially at the back-part, in which the crural veflels and nerves lie immerfed .in fat. -The internal condyle is longer than the external.— Each of thefe procefies feems to be divided in its plain fmooth furface. The mark of divifion on the external is a notch, and on the internal a fmall protuberance. The fore-part of this divifion, on which the rotula moves, is formed like a pulley, the external fide of which is higheft.-Behind, there are two oblong large heads, whofe greateft extent is backwards, for the motion of the tibia; and from the rough cavity between them, but near to the bafe of the internal condyle, the ftrong ligament, commonly called the crcfs one, has its rife.-A little O M Y. 183 above which, a rough protuberance gives infertion to the tendon of the triceps.-The condyles, both on the outer and inner fide of the knee, are made flat by the muf¬ cles palling along them.-On the back part of the in¬ ternal, a flight depreffion is made by the tendons of the gracilis and fartorius ; and on the external, fuch another is formed by the biceps flexor cruris ; behind which, a deep folia is to be obferved, where the poplitaeus mufcle has its origin.-From the tubercle immediately before this cavity, a ftrong round ligament goes out to the up¬ per part of the fibula.-Round this lower end of the thigh-bone, large holes are found, into which the liga¬ ments for the lecurity of the joint are fixed., and blood- veflels pafs to the internal fubftance of the bone. The thigh-bone being articulated above with the aceta¬ bulum of the ofla innominata, which affords its round head a fecure and extenfive play, can be moved to every fide; but is reftrained in its motion outwards by the high brims of the cavity, and by the round ligament; for o- therwife the head of the -bone would have been frequent¬ ly thruft out at the breach of the brims on the infide, which allows the thigh to move conliderably inwards. -The body of this bone enjoys little or no rotatory motion, though the head molt commonly moves round its own axis; becaufe the oblique progrefs of the neck and head from the bone is fuch, that the rotatory nlotion of the head can only bring the body of the bone for¬ wards and backwards.-The os femoris is articulated below to the tibia and rotula in the manner afterwards to be deferibed. The nearnefs of the fmall neck to the round head of the thigh-bone, and its upper end being covered with very thick mufcles, make greater difficulty in diftinguilhing between a luxation and fraCture here, than in any other part of the body. The Leg is compofed of three bones, tibia , fibula, and rotula . Tibia, fo called from its refemblance to an old mufi- cal pipe or flute, is the long, thick, triangular bone, Ac¬ tuated at the internal part of the leg, and continued in almoft a ftreight line from the thigh-bone. The upper end of the tibia is large, bulbous, and fpongy, and is divided into two cavities by a rough irre.- gular protuberance, which is hollow at its moft prominent part, as well as before and behind. The anterior of the two ligaments that compofe the great crofs one, is ir.» ferted into the middle cavity, and the depreffion behind receives the pofterior ligament.—The two broad cavities at the fides of this protuberance are not equal; for the inte'rnal is oblong and deep, to receive the internal con¬ dyle of the thigh-bone; while the-external is more fu- perficial and rounder, for the external condyle.-In each of thefe two cavities of a recent fubjeCt, a femilu- nar cartilage is placed, which is thick at its convex edge, and becomes gradually thinner towards the concave or interior edge.-The middle of each of thefe cartilages is broad, and the ends of them turn narrower and thin¬ ner, as they approach the middle protuberance of the ti¬ bia.—-—The thick convex edge of each cartilage is con¬ nected to the capfular and other ligaments of the articu¬ lation, but fo near to their rife from the tibia, that the cartilages"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"1B4 A N A 1 cartilages arc not allowed to change place far*, while the narrow ends of the cartilages, becoming almoft ligaments, are fixed at the inferticn of the ftrong crofs ligament in¬ to the tibia, and feem to have their fubftance united with it; therefore a circular hole is left between each cartilage and the ligament, in which the moft prominent convex part of each condyle of the thigh-bone moves.-The circumference of thefe cavities is rough and unequal, for the firm connexion of the ligaments of the joint.-Im¬ mediately below the edge, at its back-part, two rough flatted protuberances ftand out: Into the internal, the tendon of the femimembranofus mufcle is inferted ; and a part of the crofs ligament is fixed to the external.- On the outfide of this laft tubercle, a fmooth (lightly- hollowed furface is formed by the action of the poplitaeus mufcle. Below the fore-part of the upper end of the tibia, a confiderable rough protuberance rifes, to which the llrOng tendinous ligament of the rotula is fixed.-On the in¬ ternal fide of this, tire re is a broad, fcabrous, (lightly- hollowed furface, to which the internal long ligament of the joint, the aponeurofis of the vaftus internus, and the tendons of the feminervofus, gracilis, and fartorius, are fixed.—Below the external edge of the upper end of the tibia, there is a circular flat furface, covered, in a recent fubjeft, with cartilage, for the articulation of the fibula; —between which and the anterior knob, there is a rough hollow, from which the tibialis anticus, and extenfor di¬ gitorum longus, take their origin.—From the fmooth flat furface, a ridge runs obliquely downwards and inwards, to give rife to part of the folaeus, tibialis pofticus, and flexor digitorum longus, and infertion tp the aponeurofis of the femimembranofus which covers the poplitaeus, and to fome of the external fibres of this lafi named mufcle. —At the infide of this ridge an oblique plain furface is left, where the greateft part of the mufculus poplitaeus is inferted.—The remaining body of the tibia is triangu- gular.—The anterior angle is very (harp, and is com¬ monly called the fpine or Jbin. This ridge is not (freight; but turns fir A inwards, then outwards, and laftly inwards again.—The plain internal fide is fmooth ■ and equal, being little fubje&ed to the aftions of muf- cles ; but the external fide is hollowed above by the tibi¬ alis anticus, and below by the extenfor digitorum longus, and extenfor pollicis longus.—The two angles behind thefe fides are rounded by the action of the mufcles ;— the pofterior fide comprehended between them is not fo broad as thofe already mentioned, but is more oblique and flatted by the adtion of the tibialis pofticus and flexor digitorum longus.—Some way above the middle of the bone, the internal angle terminates, and the bone is made round by the preffure of the mufculus folaeus.— Near to this, the paffage of the medullary veffels is feen (lanting obliquely downwards. The lower end of the tibia is made hollow, but fo as a fmall protuberance rifes in the middle.—The internal fide of this cavity, which is fmooth, and, in a recent fubjedl, is covered with cartilage, is produced into a con¬ fiderable procefs, commonly named malleolus internus ; the point of which is divided by a notch, and from it li¬ gaments are feat out to the feot>-The external fide O M Y. Part I. of this end of the tibia has a rough irregular fern i lunar cavity formed in it, for receiving the lower end of the fi¬ bula.-The pofterior fide has two lateral grooves, and a fmall middle protuberance. In the internal depreflion, the tendons of the mufculus tibialis pofticus, and flexor digitorum longus, are lodged ; and in the external, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis plays.-From the middle protuberance, ligamentous (heaths go out, for tying down thefe tendons. Fibula is the fmall long bone, placed on the outfide of the leg, oppofite to the external angle of the tibia ; the (hape of it is irregularly triangular. The head of the fibula has a fuperficial circular cavity formed on its infide, which, in a recent fubjedt, is cover¬ ed with a cartilage, but fo clofely connedted to the tibia by ligaments, as to allow only a fmall motion backwards and forwards.—This head is protuberant and rough on its outfide, where a ftrong round ligament, and the mufculus biceps, are inferted; and, below the back-part of its in¬ ternal fide, a tubercle may be remarked, that gives rife to the ftrong tendinous part of the folaeus mufcle. The body of this bone is a little crooked inwards and backwards, which figure is owing to the adtions of the mufclcs; but is (hill further increafed by nurfes, who oft¬ en hold'children carelefsly by the legs.--The Iharpeft angle of the fibula is forwards, on each fide of which the bone is confiderably, but unequally, dcpreffed by the bellies of the feveral mufcles that rife from, or adt upon it; and, in old people, thefe mufcles make diftimft finuo- fities for themfeives.-The external furface of the fi¬ bula is depreffed obliquely from above downwards and backwards, by the two peronaei.——Its internal (urface is unequally divided into two narrow longitudinal planes, by an oblique ridge extended from the upper part of the anterior angle, to join with the lower end of the inter¬ nal angle. To this ridge the ligament ftretched between the two bones of the leg is connedted.-The anterior pf the two planes is very narrow above, where the ex¬ tenfor longus digitorum, and extenfor longus pollicis, a rife from it; but is broader below, where it has the print of the nonus Vefalii.—The pofterior plane is broad and hollow, giving origin to the larger (hare of the tibialis pofticus—The internal angle of this bone has a tendi¬ nous membrane fixed to it, from which fibres of the flexor digitorum longus take their rife.—The pofterior furface of the fibula is the plaineft and fmootheft, but is made flat above by the folaeus, and is hollowed below by the flexor pollicis longus.—In the middle of this furface the canal for the medullary veffels may be feen (lanting down¬ wards. The lower end of the fibula is extended into a fpongy oblong head, on the infide of which is a convex, irre¬ gular, and frequently a fcabrous furface,. that is recei¬ ved by the external hollow of the tibia, and fo firmly joined to it by a very thin intermediate cartilage and ftrong ligaments, that it fcarce can move.—Below this, the fi¬ bula is ftretched out into a coronoid procefs, that is fmooth, covered with cartilage on its internal fide, and is there contiguous to the outfide of the firft bone of the foot, the aftragalus, to fecure the articulation.

Rotula is the fmall flat bone fituared at the fore-part of the joint of the knee.--Its lhape refembles the common figure of the heart with its point downwards.— The anterior convex furface of the rotula is pierced by a great number of holes, into which fibres of the ftrong li¬ gament that is fpread over it enter.-Behind, its fur- face is fmooth, covered with cartilage, and divided by a middle convex ridge into two cavities, of which the ex¬ ternal is largeft, and both are exactly adapted to the pul¬ ley of the os femoris, on which they are placed in the mod ordinary unftraining poftures of the leg; but when the leg is much bended, the rotula defeends far down on the condyles; and when the leg .is fully extended, the rotula rifes higher, in its upper part, than the pulley of the thigh-bone.-The plain fmooth furface is fur- rounded by a rough prominent edge, to which the c-apfu- lar ligament adheres :—Below, the point of the bone is Scabrous, where the ftrong tendinous ligament from the tubercle of the tibia is fixed.—The upper horizontal part of this bone is flatted and unequal, where the tendons of the extenfors of the leg are inferted. The fubftance of the rotula is cellular, with very thin external firm plates: But then thefe cells are fo fmall, and fuch a quantity of bone is employed in their forma¬ tion, that fcarce any bone of its bulk is fo ftrong. Be- lides, it is covered all over with a thick ligament, to con¬ ned its fubftance, and is moveable to one fide or other; therefore is fufficiently ftrong to refill the ordinary adions of the large mufdes that are inferted intoit, or any com¬ mon external force applied to it. The parts which conftitute the joint of the knee being now deferibed, let us examine what are its motions, and how performed.-The two principal motions are flec¬ tion and extenfion.-In the former of thefe, the leg may be brought to a very acute angle with the thigh, by the condyles of the thigh-bones being round and made i Vol. I. No. 8. 3 O M Y. 185 fmooth far backwards. In performing this, the rotula is pulled down by the tibia.-When the leg is to he extended, the rotula is drawn upwards, confequently the tibia forwards, by the extenfor mufcles; which, by means of the protuberant joint, and of this thick bone with its ligament, have in effed the chord, with which they ad, fixed to the tibia at a confiderable angle, there¬ fore ad with advantage; but are reftrained from pulling the leg farther than to a ftreight line with the thigh, by the pofterior part of the crofs ligament, that the body might be fupported by a firm perpendicular column : For at this time the thigh and leg are as little moveable in a rotatory way, or to either fide, as if they were one con¬ tinued bone.-But when the joint is a little bended, the rotula is not tightly braced, and the pofterior liga¬ ment is relaxed; therefore this bone may be moved a lit¬ tle to either fide, or with a fmall rotation in the fuperfi- cial cavities of the tibia; which is done by the motion of the external cavity backwards and forwards, the in¬ ternal fervingas a fort of axis. Seeing then one part of the crofs ligament is fituated perpendicularly, and the pofterior part is ftretched obliquely from the internal condyle of the thigh outwards, that pofterior part of the crofs ^ligament prevents the leg’s being turned at all inwards; but it could not hinder it from turning out¬ wards aimoft round, was not that motion confined by the lateral ligaments of this joint, which can yield little. The Foot is divided into three parts, viz. tarfut, metatarfus , and toes : In the defeription of which, the broad of the foot rtiali be called fuperior ; the foie, in¬ ferior ; the fide on which the great toe is, internal ; that where the little toe is, external The tarfus confifts of feven fpongy bones ; to wit, the aftragalus, os calcis, naviculare, cuhoidss, cuneiform# externum, cuneiforme medium, and cuneiforme in¬ ternum. The aftragalus is the uppermoft of thefe bones.-~ The os calcis is below the aftragalus, and is confiderably prominent backwards beyond the other bones, to form the heel.-The os naviculare is in the middle of the internal fide of the tarfus.-The os .cuboides is the molt external of the row of four bones at its fore-part. -The os cuneiforme externum is placed at the infide of the cuboid.-The cuneiforme medium is between the external and internal cuneiform bones, and the inters nal cuneiform is put at the internal fide of the foot. In the defeription of thefe bones, let it be obferved, That where-ever a ridge is mentioned, without a parti¬ cular ufe afligned, a ligament is underftood to be fixed to it: or where a fpongy rough cavity, depreflion, or Jofla, is remarked, without naming its ufe, a ligament is ia- ferted, and mucilaginous glands are lodged. The upper part of the aftragalus is formed into a large fmooth head, which is flightly hollowed in the middle ; and therefore refembles a luperfioai pulley, by which it is fitted to the lower end of the tibia.-The 1 ternal fide of this head is flat and fmooth, to play on the inter¬ nal malleolus.-,-The external fide has alfo fuch a fur- face, but larger, for its articulation with the external malleolus.-Round the bafe of this head there is a rough folia; and, immediately before the head, as alfo 3 A below"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"186 A N A T below its internal finooth furface, we find a confiderable rough cavity. The lower furface of the aftragalus is divided by an irregular, deep, rough fofla; which, at its internal end, is narrow, but gradually widens, as it ftretches obliquely outwards and forwards.—The fmooth furface, covered with cartilage, behind this folia, is large, oblong, ex¬ tended in the fame oblique fituation with the folia, and concave, for its conjunction with the os calcis.-The back-part of the edge of this cavity is produced into two lharp-pointed rough procelfes, between which is a depref- fion, made by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. —The lower furface before th& fofla is convex, and coro- pofed of three diftindt fmooth planes. The long one behind, and the,exterior or fliortelt, are articulated with the heel-bone ; while the internal, which is the mod con¬ vex of the three, refts and moves upon a cartilaginous ligament, that is continued from the calcaneum to the os fcaphoides. The fore-part of this bone is formed into a convex oblong fmooth head, which is received by the os navi- culaie.—Round the root of this head, efpecially on the upper furface, a rough fofla may be remarked. The aftragalus is articulated above to the tibia and fi¬ bula, which together form one cavity. Though, in this articulation, the bones have prominences and cavities fo fmall, as might allow motions in all directions; yet the fleCtion and extenfion are the molt confiderable, the o- ther motions being confined by the malleoli, and by the ltrong ligaments which go out from the points of thefe procelfes to the aftragalus and os calcis. The aftragalus is joined below to the os calcis; and before, to the os naviculare, in the manner to be explained when thefe bones are deferibed. Calcaneum is the largeft bone of the feven-—Behind, it is formed into a large knob, commonly called the heel: The furface of which is rough behind, where the tendo Achillis is inferted into it; and above, it is hollow and fpongy. Farther forwards, on the upper furface of the calcaneum, there is an irregular, oblong, fmooth con¬ vexity, adapted to the concavity at the back-part of the aftragalus : And beyond this a narrow fofla is leen, which divides it from two fmall concave fmooth furfaces, that are joined to the fore-part of the aftragalus.—Behind the pofterior of thefe fmooth furfaces, which is the lar¬ geft, a fmall finuofity is made by the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus •, at the fore-part of which a fmall rough protuberance appears, that gives rife to the muf¬ culus extenfor digitorum brevis. The external fide of this bone is flat, with a fuperfi- cial fofla running horizontally, in which the tendon of the mufculus peronseus longus is lodged.—The internal fide of the heel-bone is hollowed, for lodging the origin of the mafia cornea Jac. Sylvii, and for the fafe paflage of tendons, nerves, and arteries.—Under the fide of the internal fmooth concavity, a particular groove is made by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus; and from the thin protuberance on this internal fide, the cartilagi¬ nous ligament that fuppoits the aftragalus, goes out to the os naviculare; on which ligament, and on the edge of this bone to which it is fixed, the groove is form- O M Y. Part f. ed for the tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus. The lower furface of this bone is prefled flat at the back-part, by the weight of our bodies; and immedir ately before this plane, there are two tubercles, from the internal of which the mufculus abdudtor pollicis, flexor digitorum fublimis, as alfo part of the aponeurofis plantaris, and of the abdudtor minimi digiti, have their •origin; and the other part of the abdudtor minimi digiti and aponeurofis plantaris, rifes from the external.-- Before thefe protuberances this bone is concave, for lodging the flexor mufcles ; and at its fore part we may obferve a rough depreflion, from which, and a tubercle behind it, the ligament goes out that prevents this hone to be feparated from the os cuboides. The fore-part of the os calcis is formed into an ob¬ long, pulley-like, fmooth furface, which is circular at its upper external end, hut is pointed below. This fmooth furface is fitted to the os cuboides. Though the furfaces by which the aftragalus and os calcis are articulated, feem fit enough for motion; yet the very ftrong ligaments by which thefe bones are con- nedted, prevent it, and render this principal part of our bafe, which refts on the ground, to wit, the os calcis, firm. Os naviculare, is fomewhat circular.—It is formed in¬ to an oblong concavity behind, for receiving the anterior head of the aftragalus.—On the upper furface, there is a rough fofla.—Below, the os naviculare is very unequal and rough; but hollow for the fafety of the mufcles.— On its infide, a large knob rifes out, from which the abdudtor pollicis takes in part its origin, the tendon of the tibialis pofticus is inferted into it, and to it two re¬ markable ligaments are fixed; the firft is the ftrong one, formerly mentioned, which fupports the aftragalus; the fecond is ftretched from this bone obliquely crofs the foot, to the metatarfal bones of the middle toe, and of the toe next to the little one.—On the outfide of the os naviculare, there is a femicircular fmooth furface, where it is joined to the os cuboides.—The fore-part of this bone is all covered with cartilage, and is divided into three fmooth planes, fitted to the three ofla cunei- formia. The os naviculare and aftragalus are joined as a ball and focket, and the. naviculare moves in all diredtions in turning the toes inwards, or in railing or deprefling either fide of the foot, though the motions are greatly reftrain.- ed by the ligaments which conned! this to the other bones of the tarfus. Os cuboides is a very irregular cube.-Behind, it is formed into an oblong unequal concavity, adapted to the fore-part of the os calcis.—On its internal fide* there is a fmall femicircular fmooth cavity, to join the os naviculare.—Immediately before which, an oblong fmooth plane is made by the os cuneiforme externum.--Be¬ low this, the bone is hollow and rough.—On the internal fide of the lower furface, a round protuberance and fofla are found, where the mufculus sddudtor pollicis has its origin. On the external fide of this fame furface, there is a round knob, covered with cartilage; immediately before which, a fmooth fofla may be obferved, in which the tendon of the peronseus primus runs obliquely crofs"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Part I. ANA the foot; and on the knob, the thin flat cartilage proper to this mufcle plays; in place of which, fometiines a bone is found :—More externally than the knob, a rough hollow is made, for the ftrong ligaments ftretched be¬ twixt this bone and the os calcis.—Before, the furface of the os cuboides is flat, fmooth, and flightly divided into two planes, for fultaining the os metatarfi of the little toe, and of the toe next to it. The form of the back-part of the os cuboides, and the ligaments connecting the joint there with the os cal¬ cis, both concur in allowing little motion in this part. Os cuneiforme externum, is much of the Ihape of a wedge, being broad and flat above, with long fides run¬ ning obliquely downwards, and terminating in a fliarp edge.—The upper furface of this bone is an oblong fquare.—The one behind is nearly a triangle, but not complete at the inferior angle, and is joined to the os na- viculare.—Tiie external fide is an oblong fquare, divided as it were by a diagonal: The upper half of it is fmooth, for its conjun&ion with the os cuboides: The other is a fcabrous hollow ; and in its fuperior anterior angle, a fmall fmooth impreflion is made by the os metatarfi of the toe next to the little one.—The internal fide of this bone is alfo quadrangular, with the fore-part of its edge made flat and fmooth by the os metatarfi of the toe next to the great one; and the back-part is alfo flat and fmooth, where the os cuneiforme medium is contiguous to it.— The fore-part of this bone is an oblong triangle, for fu- ftaining the os metatarfi of the middle toe. Os cuneiforme medium, or minimum, is Hill more ex¬ actly the Ihape of a wedge than the former.-Its up¬ per part is fquare.;—its internal fide has a flat fmooth furface above and behind, for its conjunction with the following bone; with a fmall rough fofia below; and a confiderable fhare of it is rough and hollow.—The ex¬ ternal fide is fmooth and a little hollowed, where it is contiguous to the laft deferibed bone.—Behind, this bone is triangular, where it is articulated with the os na viculare; and it is alfo triangular at its fore-part, where it is conti¬ guous to the os metatarfi of the toe next to the great one. Os cuneiforme maximum, or internum, differs from . the two former in its fituation, which is more oblique than theirs.—Befides, it's broad thick part is placed be¬ low, and the fmall thin point is above and outwards; while its under broad furface is concave, for allowing a fafe paflage to the flexors of the great toe.—The fur¬ face of this os' cuneiforme behind, where it is join.d to the os naviculare, is hollow, fmooth, and of a circular figure below, but pointed above.—The external fide confifts of two fmooth and flat furfaces, whofe direction is nearly at right angles with each other. With the po- fterior, that runs obliquely from below forwards and up¬ wards, the os cuneiforme minimum is joined; and with the anterior, whofe direction is longitudinal, the os me- tatarfi of the toe next to the great one is connected.— The fore-part of this bone is femilunar, but flat and fmooth, for fuftaining the os metatarfi of the great toe. —The internal fide is fcabrous, with two remarkable tubercles below, from which the mufculus abduCtor pol- licis rifes, and the tibialis anticus is inferted into its up¬ per part. P O M Y. i3 7 The three cuneiform bones are all fo fecured by liga¬ ments, that very little motion is allowed in any of them. Thefe {even bones of the tarfus, when joined, are convex above, ahd leave a concavity below, for lodging fafely the feveral mufcles, tendons, vcflels, and nerves that lie in the foie of the foot. —In the recent fubjeCl, their upper and lower furfaces are covered with {hong ligaments, which adhere firmly to them ; and all the bones are fo tightly c mneCled, by thefe and the other liga¬ ments, which are fixed to the rough ridges and fofise formerly mentioned, that, notw'itliftanding the many furfaces covered with cartilage, fome of which are of the form of the very moveable articulations, no more motion is here allowed, than only to prevent too great a {hock of the fabric of the body in walking, leaping, <&c. by falling on too folid a bafe. Metatarsus is compofed of five bones, which, in their general characters, agree with the metacarpal bones ; but may be diftinguifhed from them by the following marks : i. They are longer, thicker, and ftronger. 2. Their anterior round ends are not fo broad, and are lefs in proportion to their bafes. 3. Their bodies are {harper above and flatter on the fidcs, with their inferior ridge inclined more to the outfide. 4. The tubercles at the lower parts of the round head arc larger. The firrt or internal metataifal bone is eafily diftin- guilhed from the reft by its thicknefs.—The one next to it is-, the longeft, and with its {harp edge almoft perpen¬ dicular.-The others are fliorter and more oblique, as their fituation is more external. Os metatarfi pollicis is by far the thickeft and ftrong- eft, as having much the greatell weight to fnftain. Its bafe is oblong, irregularly concave, and of a femilunar figure, to be adapted to the os cuneiforme maximum. — The inferior edge of this bafe is a little prominent and rough, where the tendon of the peronseus primus muf¬ cle is inferted.-On its outfide, an oblique circular de- preflion is made by the fecond metataifal bone. - Its- round head has generally on its fore-part a middle ridge, and two oblong cavities, for the ofla fefamoidea; and on the external fide, a depreflion is made by the following bone. Os metatarfi of the fccond toe, is die longeft of the five, with a triangular bafe fupported by the os cunci- forme medium and the external fide produced into a pra- cefs; the end of w hich is an oblique fmooth plane, join¬ ed to the os cuneiforme externum. - Near the internal edge of the bafe, this bone has two fmall depreffions, made by the os. cuneiforme maximum* between which is a rough cavity.—Farther forwards, we may obferve a fmooth protuberance, which is joined to the foregoing. bone.-On the outfide of the bafe are two oblong fmooth furfaces, for its articulation with the following bone; the fuperior fmooth furface being extended longi¬ tudinally, and the inferior perpendicularly ; between which there is a rough folia. Os metatarfi of the middle toe, is the fccond in length. —Its bafe, fupported by the os cuneiforme externum, is triangular, but flanting outwards, where it ends in a {harp-pointed little prcctfs ; and the angle below is not completed. The"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The internal fide of this bafe is adapted to the pre¬ ceding bone ; and the external fide has alfo two fmooth furfaces covered with cartilage, but of a different figure; for the upper one is concave, and, being round behind, turns fmaller as it advances forewards; and the lower furface is little, fmooth, convex, and very near the edge of the bafe. Os metatarfi of the fourth toe, is near as long as the former, with a triangular flanting bafe, joined to the os cu¬ be ides, and made round at its external angle, having one hollow fmooth furface on the outfide, where it is prefled upon by the following bone, and two on the internal fide, correfponding to the former bone ; behind which is a long narrow furface imprefled by the os cuneiforme externum. Os metatarfi of the little toe, is the fhortefl, fituated with its two flat fides above and below, and with the ridges laterally.-The bafe of it, part of which refls on the os cuboidcs, is very large, tuberous, and produ¬ ced intp a long-pointed procefs externally, where part of the abdudtor minimi digiti is fixed; and into its up¬ per part the peronaeus fecundus is inferted.-Its infide has a flat conoidal furface, where it is contiguous to the preceding bone. When we (land, the fore-ends of thefe metatarfal bones, and the os ealcis, are our only fupporters; and therefore it is neceflary they fhould be ftrong, and fhould have a confined motion. The bones of the Toes are much akin to thofe of the thumb and fingers; particularly the two of tire great toe are precifely formed as the two laft of the thumb; only their pofition, in refpedt of the other toes, is not oblique; and they are proportionally much ftronger, be- caufe they are fabjetfed to a greater force; for they fu- ftain the force with which our bodies are puihed forwards by the foot behind at every ftep we make; and on them principally the weight of the body is fupported, when we are raifed on our tiptoes.. The three bones in each of the other four toes, com¬ pared to' thofe of the fingers, differ from them in thefe particulars.--They are lefs, and fmaller in proportion to their lengths: — Their Safes are much larger than their anterior ends: Their bodies are more narrow above and below, and flatter on the fides.—The firft phalanx Part 1. is proportionally much longer than the bones of the fe- cond and third, which are very (hort. Of the four, the toe next to the great one has the largeft bones in all dimenfions, and more externally the toes are lefs.—The little toe, and frequently that next to it, have the fecond and third bones intimately uni¬ ted into one; w'hich may be ow ing to their little motion, and the great preflure they are fubje&ed to. The toes are of good ufe to us in walking; for, when the fide is raifed, they bring our body, with its centre of gravity, perpendicular to the advanced foot. The only bones now remaining to complete the de- feription of the fkeleton, are the finall ones, which are found at the joints of the fingers and toes, and in fome other parts, called Ossa Sesamoidea, which are of very different fi¬ gures and fizes, though they are generally faid to refem- ble the feed of the fefamum.--They feem to be no¬ thing elfe than the ligaments of the articulations, or the firm tendons of ttrong mufcles, or both, become bony, by the compreflion which they fuffer. Thus the fefa- moid bones at the beginning of the gaftrocnemii mufcles, are evidently compofed of the tendinous fibres only.— Thefe, at the firft joint of the gteat toe, are' as plainly the fame continued fubftance with the ligaments and thfe tendons of the addudtor, flexor, brevis, and abdu&or.—*- That which is fometimes double at the fecond joint of that .toe, is part of tbe'capfular ligament; and if we e- numerate the other fefamoid bones that are at any time found, we may obferve all of them formed in this man¬ ner.-Their number, figure, fituation, and magnitude, are fo uncertain, that it were in vain to infill on the dif¬ ferences of each ; and therefore we lhall only in general remark, 1. That where-ever the tendons and ligaments are firmeft, the actions of the mufcles flrongeft, and the compreflion greateft, there fuch bones' are moll common¬ ly found. 2. That, cateris paribus, the older the fu'ojeifl is in which they are fought, their number is greater, and their fize is larger. 3. The more labour any perfon is inured to, he has, cater is paribus, the mofl numerous and largeft ofla fefa- moidea. ANATOMY. EXPLANATION of PLATE XIII. Figure I. A Male Skeleton. A, Os frontis.

P A R T If. OF THE MUSCLES. Sect. I. Of the Muscles in general. r T , HE mufcles are bundles of fibres of different figures JL and fizes, and for the moft part confifting of two different portions ; one whereof is thick, foft, and more or lefs red, forming what is called the body, flefhy fub¬ ftance, or belly of the mufde. The other is thin and fmall, of a clofe contexture, and very white, forming the extremities, termed by anatomiils tendins or aponen- rofes. Botii portions are coveted by a particular mem¬ brane. The fibres are, for the meft part, ranked in fafei- culi, in a lateral lituation w ith refpedt to each other, and dilbnguifhed by membranous, cellular, cr adipefe fepta, sis by ij many particular vaginae. Thefe fibres are connected to each other, and to the intermediate fepta, by a great number of very fmall fine filaments, the capillary extremities of arteries, veins, and nerves running over them; and they are inclofed in a thin membranous, cellular covering, called the proper membrane of the raufcle, being a continuation of the fepta or vaginas already mentioned. The difpolition of the fibres is various: fomc are dif- pofed like radii; others form planes more or lefs incurva- ted; and fome form complete circumferences, the two extremities meeting and uniting together. The difference of mufcles is very confiderable, and depends on many circumftances; the chief of which are, the fize, figure, direction, lituation, ftrudture, connec¬ tion, and uie; and it is from thefe differences that the names of the gi cat-eft part of the mufcles are taken. V"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Part I. 192 A N A T From their fize they are'termed great, middle, finall, long, broad, thin -: FVom their figure, •triangular, fca- lenous, fquare, See. From their direction, f rail, ob¬ lique, tranfverfe. From their fituation , fuperior, infe¬ rior, external, &e. ■ ; With refpeX to their ftruXure, mufcles are either fimple or compound. Simple mufcles are thofe whofe flefhy fibres, or rather the flefhy portions of their mo¬ ving fibres, are'all uniformly difpofed, and terminate in tendons lying either in a (trait or oblique line. ; Compound mufcles are thofe whole flefhy fibres are difpofed obliquely in’feveral particular ranks, reprefent- ing the fame number of fimple mufcles, with their fibres, lying in oppofite directions. In proportion to the num¬ ber of thefe ranks or ftries, the mufcle is faidto be more or lefs compounded, Wheh the compound mufcle is. made up of two fimple mufcles only, thefe are fo difpofed as to reprefent a fea¬ ther, and the compound mufcle is from thence termed penniform. Some are made up of two mufcles more or lefs, in a lateral fituation with refpeX to each other, and united at one extremity : others are made up of three or four muf- cles, fituated in the fame manner ; and if they are united at that extremity which thejmeients called the head of the mufcle, they are called bicipit.es, tricipites, £cc.- accord¬ ing to the number of thefe heads ; but if they are joined at the other extremity, they are termed bicornes, tricor¬ nes, See. The mufcles are fixed by their extremities to different parts, and in different places of the human body. The greateft jiart of them are inferted in bones alone. Some ate fixed partly to bones, and partly to cartilages; as thofe of the ear and nofe: fome partly to bones, and partly to-the integuments; as feveral mufcles of the face. The names taken from the connexions and infertions mufcles are generally of two kinds; one common, and referred to fome confiderable part of the body; as W'hen we fay, the mufcles of the head, of the thorax, abdomen, (he .; the other proper, fpecifying more par¬ ticularly the infertions of each mufcle, as the maftoidcus, fterno-maftoideus, &c. The general ufe of the mufcles is to move all the parts of the body, whether hard, left, or fluid. Mod of the hju'd and foft parts are mdved by thefe powers being fix¬ ed to them, and they move the reft without any fuch in- fertion. The aXlon of the mufcles in. general, confifts chiefly in the contraXion or fhortening of their flefhy portion; by which the extremities of the mufcle are brought near¬ er to each other, and confeqnently the parts are moved to which thefe extremities are fixed. The principal phenomena of mufcular aXion are thefe : The flefhy portion appears harder and more fwell- gd in the t me of action than of inaXion, as may be rea¬ dily perceived by touching it in both ftates : The hard- nefs of this {welling increafes in proportion as the mo¬ tion is continued, as is likewife evident by the touch; and it likewife increafes by merely adding to the weight ,or refiftance of the part moved, though its fituation docs not continue to be changed. O M Y. Sect. II. The Muscles of the Abdomen. By the mufcles of the abdomen, or lower belly, we mean thofe which form principally the fides or circum¬ ference of that cavity. They, are commonly ten in num¬ ber, five on each fide * eight whereof arc very large, the other two very fmall. OBLIQJJUS EXTERNUS. The obliquus externus is a broad thin mufcle, flefhy on its upper and back-part, and tendinous on the ante¬ rior and greateft portion of the lower part. It reaches from half the lateral and inferior part of the thorax, to almoft half the lateral and fuperior part of the pelvis; and from the back-part of the regio lumbaris to the linea alba. It is fixed, by its upper part, to the ribs; by the lower, to the os ilium, ligamentum Fallopii, and o§ pu¬ bis;, and, by the fore-part, to the linea alba. . Thepo- fterior portion next the vertebras of the loins has com¬ monly no true mufcular infertions. OBLIQJL 7 U S INTERNUS. The internal oblique is a broad thin mufcle like the former, having neaily the fame extent and infertions; that is, in the lower ribs above; in the crifta of the os ilium and ligamentum Fallopii, below; and in the linea alba, before; but it differs from it in this, that its low¬ er part is more flefhy than the upper. One portion of its lower extremity, which is entirely flefhy, is fixed, by very fhort tendinous fibres, in the middle fpacc between the two labia of the crifta offis ili¬ um, from the back-part of the tuberofity o- that crifta, near the fymphyfis of the os facrum, almoft all the way to the fuperior and anterior fpine of the os ilium; fo that its infsrtion reaches farther back than that of the external oblique. The flefhy fibres thus fixed, run up firft a little oblique¬ ly from behind forward, and then this obliquity increafes proporticnably as the fibres he more anterioily, and they crofs thofe of the flefhy portion of the external oblique, - being afterwards inferted exterioify in the lower edges of the cartilages of all the falfe ribs, and thofe of the two lowefl true ribs,' reaching to the extremity of the carti- lago enfiformis. This mufcle is likewife called obliquus defeendens', for the fame reafon that the former is termed cfa-ndens , ob- liquus inferior, and obliquus minor, bccatife it does not reach fo high, and is not quite fo large as the external oblique. MUSCULI RECTI. The reXi-are long narrow mufcles, thicker than the obliqui.

Their bread* nifhes, and their taicknefs increafes gradually from above downward. • . The"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Tla te2\\ r I _1."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Part II. A N A f The fuperior extremity of eacli mufcle is fixed to a •part of the lower extremity of the fternum, to the three lowed true ribs, and to the firft: fahe rib, by the lame number of digitations, of which that which is fartheft from the fternum is the broadeft. The body of the mufcle lies in the vagina, formed by the aponeurofis of the broad mufcles of the abdomen. Exteriorly, it is divided into feveral portions, refembling diftinft mufcles placed endways, by tranfverfe tendons, termed enervations , which commonly are all above the umbilicus, very fcldom below it, and they adhere very clofe to the vagina. The lower extremity of this mufcle is narrower than the upper, and ends in a thin tendon fixed in the inter¬ nal labium of the upper edge of the os pubis, near the fymphylis, and there it touches the tendon of the other jreftus. MUSCULI PYRAMIDALES. At the lower part of the refti, we meet commonly with two fmall mufcles, which at firft feem to be a por¬ tion or appendix of the former. They are named pyra¬ midales from their figure; and by Fallopius, fuccentu- riati. « At the lower extremity, they are broad and thick, being there fixed to the upper edge of the olfa pubis, immediately before the recti. They decreafe gradually in breadth and thicknefs as they afeend, and end by a point in the lir.ea alba, a little way below the umbilicus. TRANS VERSALES. The tranfverfe mufcles are nearly of the fame breadth with the obliques. Each of them is fixed to the ribs a- bove ; below, to the os ilium, and ligamentum Fallo- pii; before, to the linea alba; and behind, to the ver¬ tebras. The upper part of this mufcle is fixed to the lower part of the inner furface of the cartilages of the two loweft true ribs, and of all the five falfe ribs, by fleftiy digitations, the fibres of which run more or lefs tranf- verfely toward the linea alba, at fome diftance from which they become tendinous. The middle part is fixed to the three firft vertebras of the loins, by a double aponeurofis, or two tendinous planes, one internal or anterior, the other external or pofterior. ? The inferior part.of this mufcle is fixed by an infer- tion wholly fleftiy to the internal labium of the crifta of- fis ilium, and to a great part of the ligamentum Fallopii. From thence many of its fibres run towards the linea al¬ ba, the reft to the os pubis, all of them becoming more or lefs -tendinous before their infertion. USES of the ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. The common ules are, to fuftain the vifeera of the ab¬ domen, and to counterbalance the perpetual motions of -ordinary refpiration, and thereby gently and continually to alt on the vifeera; which aft ion may be. reckoned a Vol. I.

They Comprefs the abdomen, in order to clear it of what ought to pafs off by tbe natural outlets ; to relieve the ftctmacli,- by vomiting, from whatever might be hurtful to it; and, laftly, to drive out, by a violent expiration, whatever may incommode the organs contain¬ ed in the thorax. The mufeuli refti ferve to fupport the trunk of the body when inclined backward, and to bend or bring it forward again; to raife the body up when lying; and, laftly, to climb. The pyramidales feem only to aflift the aftion of the refti; though, when we confider the oblique direftion of their fibres toward the linea alba, there may be fome reafon to think that they comprefs the bladder, efpecially when very full of urine. The tranfverfales feem to have no other ufc than that of bracing of girding the abdomen in different degrees. Sect. III. The Muscles which move the Bones of the Shoulder upon the Trunk. TRAPEZIUS. The trapezius is a large, broad, thin, fleftiy plane, fituated between the occ'put and lower part of the back, and frdm thence extending to the (boulder, in the figure of a large irregular fquare. From this figure the ancient Greeks took its name, and, together with the trapezius of the other fide, it forms a kind of lozenge. Above, it is fixed in the fuperior tranfverfe line of the os occipitis, by a thin feries - of fleftiy fibres, reach¬ ing to the mufculus occipitalis, and appearing to cover that mufcle by a kind of aponeurofis. Behind, it is fix¬ ed to the five fuperior fpinal apophyfes of the neck, by means of the pofterior cervical ligament, and immediate¬ ly to the extremities-of the two loweft fpinal apophyfes of the neck, and of all thofe of the back. This mufcle covers immediately the fplenius or maftoi- dffius fuperior, part of the complexus major, the angula- ris, rhomboides, and part of the latiffimus dorfi. RHOMBOIDES. This mufcle is a thin, broad, and obliquely fquare fleftiy plane, fituated between the balls of the fcapula and the fpina dorfi; and it is from its figure that-it has been termed rhomboides . It may be divided into two portions, one fuperior, the other inferior, which fometimes appear feparate. The fuperior portion is fixed, by an infertion wholly flefhy, in the two or three loweft fpinal apophyfes of the neck; and partly in the pofterior cervical ligament. The infet- rior portion is fixed, by a tendinous plane, in the three or four uppermoft fpinal apophyfes of the back. Thefe two portions, of which the inferior is by much the broadeft, being united, are infected in the edge of the balls fcapulae, from the fmall triangular fpace to the inferior angle, the fuperior portion covering a fmall part of the infertion of the angularis. 3 C This"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"194 ANATOMY.

Angularis, vulGo Levator Scapulje Proprius. This is a long, and pretty thick mufcle, about two fingers in breadth, lying above the fuperior angle of the fcapula, along the posterior lateral part of the neck of that bone. It is inferted above in the extremities of the tranfverfe apophyfes of the four firft vertebrae of the neck, by four flefliy branches, ending in fiiort tendons; fometimes the fecond, fometimes the third, or both, and fometimes the fourth of thefe branches, is wanting; thefe defects being made up by the largenefs of the reft. • From thence thefe branches run down a little oblique¬ ly, and then uniting together, they are inferted in the fuperior angle of the fcapula, and in the edge of its ba¬ lls, from thence to the finall triangular fpace, being there covered a little by the rhomboides. This mufcle is eafily divided into two through its whole length. It is covered by the trapezius, and its infertions in the neck are fometimes mixed with thofe of the neighbouring mufcles. PECTORALIS MINOR. This is a fmall flefhy mufcle, fomething of a triangu¬ lar fhape, fituated at the fuperior, lateral, and anterior 'part of the thorax. By its bafis it is inferted in the external labium of the upper edge of the fecond, third, fourth, and fifth true ribs; near their union with the cartilages, by the fame number of digitations or feparate flefhy portions, becaufe of the intervals between the ribs ; and for that reafon it has been called ferratus minor ant tens. From thence thefe portions run up, more or lefs, ob¬ liquely toward the fhoulder, and form a flefhy belly, which contrafts as it paffes before the two firft ribs, and tjien becoming a fhort, flat, and broad tendon, is infert- t d in the upper part of the apophyfis coracoides of the fcapula, reaching all the way to the point of that procefs. This mufcle is covered by the peftoralis major, and adheres very dofdy to the external interccftal mufcles. SERRATUS MAJOR. This is a broad, flefhy, and pretty thick mufcle, ly¬ ing on the lateral part of the thorax, between the ribs apd fcapula, hy which it is covered. Its figure is that of an irregular fquare, its greateft breadth being in the back-part, where it terminates by digitations of unequal lengths, in a radiated difpofition, their extremities <fe- feribing an arch or curve; and from thefe digifations its name is taken. It is inferted backward in the internal labium of all the bafis of the fcapula, from the fuperior to the inferior angle. From thence running forward wholly flefhy, it SUBCLAVIU S. This is a fmall oblong mufcle, lying between the cla- vide and firft rib. It is fixed by one end in all the mid¬ dle lower portion of the clavicle, at the diftance of about an inch from each extremity; and by the other in the cartilage and a finall part of the bone of the firft rib. It feems likewife to adhere to the extremity of the cla¬ vicle next the fternum, by a kind of broad thin ligament. Uses of the Muscles which move the Bones of the Shoulder on the Trunk. The mechanifm of the fcapula, in relation to its mo¬ tions and changes of fituation, is very different from that of all the other bones of the body, except the os hy- oides. All the other bones have folid fulcra or fixed points, on which they are either moved or fixed by the mufcles; but the motions of the fcapula, its changes of fituation, and its continuance in any one given attitude, are brought about without the help of any folid fulcrum. The mufcles alone fuftain it and brace it down, in all its different motions and fituations. The fcapula has this peculiarity likewife belonging to it, that it is the fulcrum and bafis of all the motions of the os humeri, of fome motions of the fore-arm, and even of all the moft violent efforts made with thefe bones, without being itfelf either moved or fixed on any folid bafis. The ufe of the trapezius is to raife the fhoulder, and to keep it from finking. The ferratus major raifes the fhoulder or top of the fcapula, brings it forward, and hinders it from finking. In all thefe, it is the principal aftor; and it is impoflible to conceive how labourers raife and fupport, by the fhoulder alone, the heavy burdens with which they are loaded, without the affiftance of this mufcle. According to the infertions and direftion of the rhom¬ boides, its general ufe muft be, to draw backward and upward the fub-fpinal portion of the bafis fcapulas. It is likewife a moderator to the trapezius and ferratus major, when they raife the fhoulder, or carry the aero* mium upward; and it brings the fcapula back to its na¬ tural fituation, when the aftion of thefe mufcles ceafes. The angularis, by its infertion in the fuperior angle of the fcapula, moderates the defeent of that angle, while the trapezius and ferratus major raife the acrominm. Afterwards, when thefe two mufcles ceafe to aft, the angularis raifes the fuperior angle, and by that means de- preffes the acromium. The peftoralis minor aflifts the rhomboides and angu¬ laris, as moderators of the aftion of the trapezius and ferratus major, in turning the point of the acromium up¬ ward, the fuperior angle downward, anci the inferior angle forward. It is likewife an afliftant to the rhomboides and angu¬ laris, in reftoring the fcapula to its natural fituation, when"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Part II. ANA when the trapezius and ferratus major ceafe to' aft ; by drawing downward the apophyfis coracoides, in which it is inferted. The fubclavius can have no other ordinary ufe, but to bring down the clavicula, after it has been raifed, toge¬ ther with the acromium, by the adtion of the trapezius and ferratus major. Sect. IV. The Muscles which move the Os Humeri on the Scapula. DELTOIDES. Th i s is 3 very thick mufcle, covering the upper part of the arm, and forming what is termed the dump of the Ihoulder. It is broad above, and narrow below, in a triangular form; and its name is taken from the refem- blance it bears to the Greek letter A delta. It is made up of eighteen or twenty fmall Angle muf- cles, in an oppofite fituation with refped to each other, •and united by middle tendons ; fo that, taken all together, they form feveral pennifcim mufcles. The outerTurface appears aim of wholly flelhy, but on the inner furface we fee the feveral tendons. Above, it is fixed in the whole inferior labidm of the fpina fcapula:, in the convex or long edge of the acro- mium, and in the third part of the anterior edge of the clavicle next that apophyfis. It furrounds the angle formed by the articulation of thefe two bones, by a par¬ ticular Hope and fold contrived for that purpofe. From thence it runs down above one third of the length of the os humeri, where it is inferted, by a thick tendon, in- the large mufcular rough impreffion below the bony ridge which goes from the great tuberofity of the head of the bone. PECTORALIS MAJOR. This is a large, thick, and flelhy mufcle, covering the fore-part of the bread, from the f ernum, where it is very broad, to the axilla, where it contrails in its paf- fage to the arm. The infertions in the f ernum end by a great number of very Ihort tendons which run toward the middle of the bone,* meeting and decuflating thofe from the fame mufcle on the other fide. The lower Infertions are mod didinilly digitated, and they mix with thofe belong¬ ing to the reiliis and obliquus externus of the abdomen, there being likewife feveral fafciculi of fibres common to the peiloralis with thefe mufcles. This portion is alio fix¬ ed to the ribs by internal flelhy drata. covered by the ex¬ ternal infertions, and forming, together with them, the thicknefs of the mufcle. From thence all the flelhy fibres contrail in breadth, and apptoach each other, in their paflage to- the arm. Tire fuperior fibres run downward, joining thofe of the clavicular portion ; thofe next them run lefs obliquely ; the following more or lefs tranfverfely ; and the inferior run upward, in the fame manner. This mufcle, together with the deltoides, fends off T O M Y. 195 an aponeurofis, which, joining that of the biceps, is fpread over the mufcles of the arm. LATISSIMUS DORSI. This is a broad, thin, and modly flelhy mufcle, lying between the axilla, where it is very narrow, and the back on which it expands itfelf by radiated fibres, both in length and breadth, from the middle of the back all the way to the lower part of the regio lumbaris; and from this fituation it has its name. Its infertions are partly tendinous, and partly flelhy. In the fird place, it is fometimes, but not always, fixed in the inferior coda of the fcapula near the angle, by a fafciculus of flelhy fibres. In the next place, it is fixed by an aponeurofis, in the fpinal apophyfes of the fix or feven, and lometimes eight lowed vertebras of the back, in thole of all the vertebras of the loins, in the fuperior fpines and lateral parts of the os facrum, and in the ex¬ ternal labium of the poderior part of the os ilium. TERES MAJOR. This is a long, thick, flat mufcle, fituated a little obliquely between the inferior angle of the fcapula, and the upper part of the arm. It is fixed by its poderior flelhy extremity in all the large angular furface on the outfide of the fcapula, in the inferior coda of that bone, and near the. angle. From thence it advances with longitudinal fibres toward the up>- per quarter of the os humeri, terminating in a broad flat tendon intermixed with fome flelhy fibres, which .at the upper edge are continued all the way to the infertion, lying in the fame place with the tendon. It is inferted, by its anterior extremity, at the lower, part of the bony ridge of the fmall tuberofity, along the edge of the channel, almofl oppofite to, and fometimes a little lower than the inlertion of the pedloralis major. It lines the cavity of the channel by a tendinous elongation, which joins that from the peftoralis, and feems to be continued with it. TERES MINOR. This is. a very flelhy mufcle, refembling the t^res major, but narrower and lhorter. It lies above the lad named mufcle,. between the coda inferior of the fcapula, and the head of the os humeri. It is fixed by one end to all the middle part of the in¬ ferior coda of the fcapula, and to the long particular fur¬ face immediately above that coda, reaching from the. great angular furface near the neck of the bone. From thence it runs wholly flelhy, till it changes into a.flat tern- don, which is inferted in the poderior or inferior furface of the great tuberofity of the head of the bone, and like¬ wife a little lower down.

There the fibres leave the furface of the bone, and pafs between the acromium and neck of the fcapula, under the arch formed by the acromium and ex¬ tremity of the clavicle, and under the ligament between the acromium and apophyfis coracoides ; being afterwards inferted in the fuperior furface of the great tuberofity of the head of the os humeri, very near the bony channel. CO RAC O-B R A C FI I ALI S. This is a long mufcle lying on the infide of the up- .pcr half of the os humeri. It is fixed above to the point of the coracoid apophy¬ fis, between the infertions of the biceps and pedoralis minor, by a tendon, which, as it defeends, adheres for a good way to the tendons of thefe two mufcles. Af¬ terwards it becomes flefliy, and is inferted by a broad thin extremity, with a fmall mixture of tendinous fibres, in the middle part of the os humeri. SUBSCAPULARIS. This mufcle is of the fame breadth and length with the fcapula, of which it occupies all the inner or con¬ cave fide ; and from this fituation it has its name. It is thick, and made up of feveral penniform portions nearly in the fame manner with the deltoides. It is fixed in the internal labium of the whole bafis, and in almoft the whole internal furface of the fcapula; its flefliy portions lying in the intervals between the bony lines, when thefe are found. Near the neck, they leave the bone, and form a very broad tendon which is infert¬ ed in the furface of the fmall tuberofity of the head of the os humeri. Uses of ^ Muscles which move the Os Humeri on the Scapula. The deltoides, from the difpofition of its infertions in the fcapula and clavicle, may raife the arm, or fepa- M Y -Part It. rate it from the ribs, not only dire&ly, but likwife ob¬ liquely in many different ways. The arm being lifted directly upward, the lateral, anterior, and pofterior por¬ tions of this mufcle may bring the arm, fo raifed, for¬ ward and backward. The latiflimus dorfi ferves in general to bring down the arm when raifed; it alfo ferves to deprefs the fhoul- dcr, or to maintain it in that fituation againft any force that endeavours to raife it; as when we lean upon the elbow in fitting, or walk upon crutches. The pefforalis major ferves in general to bring the arm near the ribs, to prefs it ftrongly againft them, and to carry it towards the fore-part of the thorax. The teres .major, by being inferted in the os humeri in a dire&icn parallel to the latiflimus dorfi, becomes a congener to the fuperior and pofterior portion of that mufcle; and accordingly moves the os humeri in the fame manner with it. It turns the bone round its axis, when the fore-arm is carried behind the back. It likewife pulls the arm direftly backward, without moving it round its axis. The coraco-brachialis brings the arm to the forefide of the thorax, rafting it at the fame time; and, in this cafe, it may be reckoned a congener or afliftant to the pec- toralis major in great efforts; and may perform the fame motion by itfclf, when no great force is neceflary; as when the whole arm hangs down, and is moved back¬ ward and forward like a pendulum, the motion forward being performed by the cOraco-brachialis, and the mo¬ tion backward by the teres major, its antagonift. This mufcle may likewife move the fcapula on the os humeri kept firmly depreffed, as when fitting in a chair we take faft hold of the edge of it with the hand. In this cafe the coraco-brachialis may bring die arcromium downward, and the inferior angle of the fcapula, near the vertebras. It ferves likewife to bring the arm to its former fituation, after it has been turned by the latifli- mus dorfi, in order to apply the hand to the back; and then it turns the os humeri upOD its axis in a contrary,di¬ rection to that given it by the other mufcle. . The fupra-fpinatus joins with the deltoides in lifting up the arm; this mufcle beginning that aCtion, and the deltoides continuing it. The infra-fpinatus being inferted by its tendon in the middle furface of the great tuberofity of the os humeri, muft perform (Afferent motions according to the different Situations of that bone. If it afts while the arm hangs down, parallel to the trunk of the body, it may move the os humeri round its axis, from before outward; and confequently, if the fore-arm be at the fame time bent, it will turn the hand from the body, isc. When the arm hangs down in its natural fituation, the fubfcapularis may turn it round its axis, from with¬ out forward, as it happens when in this fituation v/e beat the breaft with the fore-arm bent; and it likewife ftrong¬ ly alfifts the latiflimus dorfi, when we turn the hand be¬ hind the back. When the arm being raifed, we move it backward, as in giving a back-ftroke with the elbow or fift, the fub¬ fcapularis hinders the head of the os humeri from being luxated forward.

Sect. V. The Muscles which move the Bones of th& Fore-arm on the Os Humeri. BICEPS fve CORACO-R ADI ALIS. Th i s is a double mufcle made up of two long flefhy bodies, more or left round, lying by the fide of each o- ther, on the middle anterior part, and a little toward the infide of the arm. Thefe two bodies are feparated above, each of them ending in a fraall tendon. As they run down they become contiguous, and afterwards dofe- ly united by one common broad tendon. It is fixed by one of the fuperior tendons, in the apex of the coracoid apophyfis of the feapula. The other fuperior tendon is frnaller and longer tl an the former, and the flelhy body belonging to it Ihorter and more compounded. This tendon is lodged in the bony channel of the os humeri, being furrounded by a membranous vagina continued from ■ the capfular liga¬ ment, and ending at the flefhy body where it is entirely cfofed. B R ACHI.EU S. This is an oblong, thick, and broad mufde, lying immediately on the anterior part of the lower half of the os humeri. The upper part of it is- forked or floped, and at the-bending of the joint of the elbow the lower part contra&s. It is fixed to the furface of the os humeri by a great number of flefhy fibres, from the lower infertion of the deltoides, alraoft down to the two foflas at the lower ex¬ tremity of the bone, and from one edge of the forefide of this lower extremity to the other.* The fibres are for the moft part longitudinal, thofe neareft the furface of the mufcle being longeft, the more internal growing gradually Ihorter. ANCON 2 EUS MAJOR. This- is a long flefhy mufcle lying on the backfide of the os humeri. It is fixed above by a fhort tendon to the inferior im- preflion in the neck of the feapula, and to a fmall part of the inferior cofla of that bone. From thence it-paf- fes between the extremities of the fubfcapularis and te¬ res minor, and, having reached the backfide of the low¬ er extremity of the os humeri, it ends obliquely in a ftrong broad tendon, which, adhering clofely in the cap¬ fular ligament, is afterwards fixed by a bread infertion in the rough tuberofity on the upper fide of the olecranum. ANCON AS US EXTERNUS. This is a long mufcle lying on the outer part of the Vol. I. No. 9. 3 O M Y. 197 backfide of the os humeri, from its neck to the external condyle. It is fixed above in the neck of the os humeri under the inferior furface of the great tuberofity, and under the infertion of the teres minor, but a little more back¬ ward. Jt is likewife fixed by fome oblique fibres in the external inter-mufcular ligament. ANCONEUS INTERN US. This mufcle is Ihorter and more flefhy than the an- conaeus externus, and lies toward the inner part of the lower half of the os humeri. It is fixed above, under the lower extremity of the teres major, but a little more backward, and to the in¬ ternal inter-mufcular ligament, which makes a kind of feptum between this mufcle and the -brachireus. From thence the fibres contrafting in breadth, paft toward the tendon of the anconreus major, fomc of them running in between it and the bone, and are inferted in the edge and inner fide of that tendon. AN CONTE US MINOR. This is a final! mufcle obliquely triangular, lying in the oblong foflula on the outfide of the olecranum. It is fixed by afinall, but pretty ftrong tendon, in the lower part of the external condyle of the os humeri. From thence the flelhy fibres run down obliquely in a ra¬ diated form, and are inferted in the bottom and whole pofterior edge of the foflula already mentioned. Uses of the Mufcles *which move the Bones of the Fore¬ arm on the Os Humeri. The biceps, or coraco-radialis, bends both bones of the Fore-arm, and turns the radius upon the ulna ; per¬ forming both motions by its infertion in the radius alone. It likewife moves the os humeri cn the fore-aim, the feapula on the os humeri, and the os humeri on the fca- pula. The brachiaeus ferves to bend the fore-arm on the os humeri, by its infertion in the ulna, and by the con- neftion of that bone with the radius. It ferves alfo to move the os humeri on the fore-arm. The anconaeus maximus ferves to extend the fore-arm, by bringing the ulna to a ftraight line with the os hu¬ meri. It ferves likewife to extend the os humeri on the ulna, when the laft named bone is fixed by fome exte¬ rior refiftance, as when, being laid upon the ground, we rife by fnpporting ourfelves on our hand. In this cafe likewife, the feapula muft be kept fteady by the coraco- brachialis. The two lateral anconaei co-cperate with, and aflift the anconaeus maximus, in extending the fore-arm on the os humeri, and the os humeri on the fore-arm. The anconaeus minimus may concur with the other mufcles of that name, in extending the fore-arm on the os humeri, and the os humeri on the fore-arm; but its aftion does not reach to all the degrees of flection of thefe bones; for when the fore-arm is very much, bent, if we 3 D examine"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"198 A N A T examine carefully the fituation of this mufcle, we will find it more difpofed to maintain thefe bones in that po- jfture, by co-operating with the brachialis, than to-ex¬ tend them by a flirting the other anconaei. Sect. VI. The Muscles which move the Radius upon the Ulna. SUPINATOR LONGUS Jive MAJOR. This is a long flat mufcle, lying arv the external condyle of the os humeri, and on the convex fide of the radius from one end to the other. It is fixed by flelhy fibres to the external inter-mufca- lar ligament,, and to the crifta of the external condyle of the os humeri, for five or fix fingers breadth above the condyle, between the brachiaeus and anconaeus externus. From thence it runs along the whole convex fide of the radius, and is inferted by a flat narrow tendon, a little above the ftyloid apophyfis in the angle between the concave and flat fides of the extremity of this bone. SUPINATOR BREVIS five MINOR. Th l s is a fmall thin flelhy mufcle, furroundinga great portion of the upper third part of the radius. It is fixed by one end to the lower part of the exter¬ nal condyle of the os humeri, to the external lateral li¬ gament of the joint, to the annular ligament of the radi¬ us, and to. part of the lateral eminence in the head of the ulna. From thence it paflfes obliquely over the head of the radius, covering fome part of it; and running down up¬ on, and in fome meafure furrounding the neck, it turns in under the bicipital tuberofity, and is inferted by the fide of the interofleous ligament in the infide of the fu- perior quarter of the bone, and even a little lower. PRONATOR TERES five OBLIQUUS. This is a fmall mufcle, broader than it is thick, fitu- ated on the upper part of the ulna oppofite to the fupina- tor brevis. It i? fixed to the internal condyle of the os humeri, partly by flelhy fibres, and partly by a tendon common to it with the ulnaris intetnus. From thence it pafles obliquely before the extremity of the tendon of the bra- chiasus, and reaches to the middle part of the convex fide of the\" radius, where it becomes flat, and is inferted below the fupinator brevis by an extremity almoft wholly flelhy. Pronator Quadratus five Tkansversus. This is a fmall flelhy mufcle nearly as broad as it is long, lying tranfverfely on the infide of the lower extre¬ mity of the fore-arm. It is fixed by one fide or edge in the long eminence at the lower part of the internal angle of the ulna, and by O M Y.

It has a ligamentary or tendinous fraenum belonging to it, one end of which is fixed in the interofleous ligament, the other in the inner edge of the bafis of the radius. The Uses of the Mufcles •which move the Radius on the Ulna. The fupinator longus aflifls in the motion of fupina- tion, and is alfo a flexor of the fore-arm. The fupinator brevis feems to have no other ufe than what is exprefled by its name; and as it is a Ihort fmall mufcle, it mull be very weak. The pronator teres can have no other adion but that of pronation, in the different fituations of the radius, whe¬ ther that bone be in a middle Hate between pronation and fupination, or in the greateft degree of fupination ; and, in this cafe, though it is but a fmall weak mufcle, it overcomes the fupinator longus. The pronator quadratus is capable of no other motion but pronation, and it ads with much more force than its congener the pronator teres. Sect. VII. The Muscles which move the Carpus upon the Fore-arm. ULNARIS. This is a long mufcle, flelhy at its upper extremity, and tendinous at the other, fituated on the outer part of the ulna. It is fixed by its upper part in the backfide of the long or internal condyle of the os humeri, in that part of the olecranum which is next the condyle, along the upper half o^the ulna very nearly; and to the middle common tendon of the neighbouring mufcle, termed commonly profundus. It runs in the diredion of the external angle of the ulna, and ends by a long tendon, in the os pififorme or orbiculare of the carpus, reaching likewife to the os ua- ciforme, being united to the ligament common to thefe two bones. RADIAL IS INTERNU S. This is a long mufcle very like the foregoing, but fituated more obliquely. Its flelhy portion is fixed, by a Ihort tendon, to the outer and upper fide of the inner condyle of the os hume¬ ri. From thence it pafles obliquely toward the radius ; and running along about two thirds of that bone, it forms a long tendon, which pafles under a particular annular li¬ gament, and under the infertion of the mufculus thenar. This tendon is at length inferted chiefly in the inliae of the bafis of the firlt metacarpal bone, and often in the fecond likewife, and a little in the firft phalanx of the thumb, having firft parted through the channel of the os trapezium, which fuftains the thumb. ULNARIS."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Part II. A N A 1 ULNARIS EXTERNUS. This is a long mufcle lying on the outfide of the fore-arm, fleihy toward the os humeri, and tendinous to¬ ward the carpus. It is fixed above to the external condyle of the os hu¬ meri, being there united to the anconaeus minor, to the annular ligament of the head of the radius, and to the upper half of the external angle of the ulna. From thence it advances, and forms a tendon, which palfes through the external notch at the lower extremity of this bone, on one fide of the ftyloid apophyfis. The tendon, having afterward paffed under a particu¬ lar ligament fituated near the os cuneiforme of the car¬ pus, is inferted in the outfide of the balls of the fourth metacarpal bone, fending fome tendinous filaments to the bafis of the little finger. Radialis Externus, Primus & Secundus. These are two mufcles clofely united together, lying along the external angle of the radius, between the os humeri and the carpus, being fleihy near the former, and tendinous near the latter. The firfl: is inferted above, in the crilla of the exter¬ nal condyle of the os humeri, below the infertion of the lupinator longus. The fecond is inferted in the fame condyle below the infertion of the firft; and in the neighbouring articular ligament. From thence the two flefhy bodies run down very clofe together ; and having reached the middle of the outfide of the radius, each of them terminates in a long tendon. The two tendons accompany each other to the extre¬ mity of the radius; and, having palled under a particu¬ lar annular ligament, they are divided as it were into two cornua ; from whence the ancients, who looked up¬ on them as one mufcle, gave it the name of bicornis . One of thefe tendons is inferted anteriorly in t.ie bafis of the firfl metacarpal bone, the other nearly in the fame place of the fecond bone. Ulnaris Gracilis, vu/go Palmaris Longus. This is a fmal'l mufcle, lying between the os humeri and the carpus, on the infide of the fore-arm; its body being fmall and llender, its tendon very long and flat. It is fixed by its fleihy portion, in the fmall crifta of the inner condyle of the os humeri, fometimes clole- ly united to the ulnaris interims. From thence it runs down fleihy for fome fpace, turning a little obliquely towards the middle of the fore-arm, and ends in a long, narrow, thin tendon. This tendon palfes dawn the middle of the fore-arm, over all the other mufcles to which it flightly adheres, and advancing over the large internal annular or tranfverfe liga¬ ment of the carpus, is inferted in the furface thereof, fend¬ ing off fofne radiated filaments to the aponeurofis palmaris. PALMARIS CUTANEUS. This mufcle is a fmall thin plane of fleihy fibres, fitu¬ ated tranfverfely, or more or lefs obliquely, under the O M Y. 199 Ikin of the large eminence in the palm of the hand, be¬ tween. the carpus and the little finger; its fibres adhering to the lkin, and being in fome meafure interwoven with the membrana adipofa. Thefe fibres are fixed along the edge of the aponeuro¬ fis palmaris, from the large ligament of the carpus to¬ ward the little finger; and they run in for fome fpace on the plane of the aponeurofis, hut without any connexion with the bones of the metacarpus. Near the aponeurofis, thefe fibres are more or lefs tendinous, and fome of them often crofs each other. METAC ARpluS. This is a very fmall fleihy mufcle, fituated obliquely between the large internal annular or tranfverfe ligament of the carpus, and the whole infide of the fourth meta¬ carpal bone. It is fixed by a fmall fliort tendon to the os orbiculare, and to the neighbouring part of the large ligament of the carpus. From thence its fibres run more or lefs oblique¬ ly toward the infide of the fourth metacarpal bone, in the outer edge of which they are inferted. The fibres of this mufcle are of unequal lengths, and extend all the way to the articulation of the firll phalanx of the little finger with the fourth metacarpal bone, but they have no manner of relation to that finger. Uses of the Mufcles which move the Carpus on the Fore~arm. When the ulnarus interims afts alone, or as the prin¬ cipal mover, it brings the hand obliquely toward the in¬ ternal condyle, and toward the olecranum, though with difficulty. When it ads together with the radialis internus, it turns the hand equally towards the two extremities of the bones of the fore-arm ; and thereby moves not only the carpus in general on the fore-arm, but alfo the fe¬ cond row of the carpus on the firlt, and the metacarpal bones on the fecond. When it ads with the ulnaris externus, it turns the outer edge of the hand toward the olecranum. When the ulnarus externus ads with the ulnaris in¬ ternus, it turns the outer edge of the hand toward the- olecranum, as already faid. With the radiales externi, it turns: the back of the hand toward the outer condyle. When this mufcle ads alone, it brings the outer edge of the hand obliquely toward the olecranum and the ex¬ ternal condyle at the fame time. With the radialis externus, the internus carries the in¬ ner edge of the hand, or that next the thumb, toward the extremity of the radius, and toward the fold made by the ulna and os humeri. Alone, k moves that part of the hand which is next the thumb obliquely, toward the internal angle of the. radius. The radialis externus, together with the radialis in¬ ternus, turns the inner edge of the hand diredly toward the llyloid apophyfis of the radius.

The ulnaris gracilis, commonly called palrnaris longus , feems to be an alSftant to the ulnaris and tadialis intemi in bending the wrift; and it feems likewife particularly to aflift the radialis internus in the motion of pronation. The metacarpius ferves to turn the fourth bone of the metacarpus toward the thumb, and at the fame time to increafe the convexity of the back of the hand, which is called making Dicgcnet's cup. The fourth bone thus moved carries the third along with it by reafon of their connexion, which ftill augments the hollow on one fide, and the convexity on the other. Sect. VIII. The Muscles which move the Fingers. FLEXOR POLLICIS LONGUS. This is a long mufcle, fixed by'fhort and oblique fleftiy fibres to the infide of the upper part of the inter- offeous ligament, near the radius, and along that bone all the way down to the pronator quadratus. There it terminates ia a flat tepdon. This tendon havingpafted under a particular ligament, runs in between the two portions of the thenar, and then into a fort of groove left between the two fefamoide bones fixed to the bafis of the fecond phalanx of the thumb, on that fide which is turned to the palm of the hand. Afterwards the tendon ends in the fiat fide of the third phalanx, near its bafis. It is inclofed in a li¬ gamentary vagina, from the annular ligament to its in- fertion, and it is divided or flit, fo. that it appears to be inferted. by two extremities adhering together by their edges. EXTENSORES POLLICIS. These are two very diftinft mufcles, the firft or long- eft of which is fometimes more, fometimes lefs, and fometimes altogether divided into two, in which cafe thefe mufcles are three in number. They are fituated obliquely between the ulna and convex fide of the thumb. The extenfor primus is a long mufcle, more or lefs double, in the manner already laid. It is fixed above by fiefliy fibres, firft to the outfide of the ulna, near its up¬ per extremity, below the anconasus minor and infertion of the ulnaris externus ; next, to the interoffeous ligament under the fupinator brevis; and, laftly, to the middle part of the outfide of the radius. From thence it runs down and pafles anteriorly over the lower part of the radius, and tendons of the fupina¬ tor longus and radialis externus, and being gradually di- O M Y. Fart II. vided, it terminates in two long flat tendons, more or lefs fubdivided, which pals together under a particular annular ligament, being only parted by fepta or fraena' be¬ longing to that ligament. The firft of thefe two principal tendons is inferted in the edge of the bafis of the'firft phalanx, near the large, tranfverfe ligament of the carpus. When this tendon is fubdivided, the other portion of 'it is fixed in that bone of the carpus which fuftains the thumb. The other principal tendon, which often belongs to a mufele entire¬ ly diftinft from the former, is fixed in the convex fide of the bafis. of the fecond phalanx, where it joins the ten¬ don of the extenfor fecundus. The extenfor fecundus is Ihorter than die firft. It is fixed to the ulna, below the former, and above the in¬ fertion of the extenfor indicis proprius, and likewife to the neighbouring part of the interoileous ligament. From thence it runs down obliquely on the middle part of the radius, where it has likewife a fmall adhefion. After¬ wards it pafles through the fmall channel in the ftyloid apophyfis of the radius, through the annular ligament belonging to the tendons of the radialis externus, and over thefe tendons, being parted from them by a fmall li¬ gamentary feptum. It is inferted in the convex pait of the third phalanx, near its bafis, THENAR. This is a very thick flefhy mufcle, in fome meafure pyriform, lying on the firft phalanx of the thumb to¬ ward the palm of the hand, the large eminence in which is chiefly formed by it. It is fixed to the bone which fupports the thumb,, and to the neighbouring part of the great internal annular ligament of the carpus. It is in fome meafure bicipital, two diftintt portions anfwering to the two infertions al¬ ready mentioned. As it runs along the firft phalanx, thefe two portions unite, and, diminishing in thicknef?, are both inferted by one tendon in the lateral internal part of the head of the firft phalanx, in the lateral pan of the bafis of the fecond, and in the lateral ligament of that joint.

This is a mufcle of a confiderable volume, lying along the infide of the fore-arm, flelhy for the greateft part near the articulation of the fore-arm with the os humeri, and near the carpus, terminating in four diftinft portions, which become the fame number of long fmall tendons. The name of fublimit has been given to it, becaufe it lies almoft oifthe furface of the fore-aim; and that of perforatus, from the flits found near the extremities of its tendons. It is commonly made up of four mufcles, clofely uni¬ ted by their flelhy portions. It is fixed above to the fu- perior internal parts of the ulna and radius, ajid to that of the interofleus ligament. A little below the middle of the fore-arm, 'this large flelhy body is divided into four diftind mufclcs, which, on the loweft quarter of the fore-arm, end in four flat tendons of different fizes. Thefe four tendons are inclofed in a common membra¬ nous or mucilaginous vagina, which likewife. fumilhes each tendon with a particular thin vagina. In this man¬ ner they advance to the carpus, and pafs under the large annular tranfverfe ligament. Beyond this ligament, they fpread again in the palm of the hand, ftill retaining their particular vaginae, and run between the aponeurofis pal- maris and metacarpus, toward the fingers, feparating more and more by degrees. Having reached \"the heads <if the metacarpal bones, they pafs under the four arches or fraena formed by the furcae of the aponeurofis palmaris,, and particular fepta of the great tranfverfe ligament of the palm of the hand ; and then each tendon having got beyond the head of one metacarpal bone, and beyond the balls of the firft pha¬ lanx, enters the ligamentary vagina on the flat or inner fide of that phalanx, and is inferted in the flat fide of the fecond phalanx, near its tafis, the membranous va¬ gina accompanying it to its jnlertion. In palling along the infide of the firft phalanx, the tendon is divided by a long flit, which gives paffage to a tendon of the perforans; and from thence the names of thefe two mufcles are taken. PERFORANS vulgo PROFUNDUS. This mufcle Is very like the former, and is fituated much in the fame manner j only it lies lower, and is co- Yol. I. Ro. 9. 3 vered by the perforatus. It is compofed of four mufcles, which at firft feem to make but one mafs, and afterwards terminate in four tendons. The flelhy portions of the firft and largeft, and alfo of the fecond, are fixed in the luperior parts of the ulna and interofleus ligament, down to their middle; the flelhy portion of the third is joined to the tendon of the ulna- ris internus, by a fort of common aponeurofis ; and that of the fourth is fixed along the ulna. The four teqdons have often feveral fmall collateral tendons, fometimes five in number,' united to the ten¬ dons of the neighbouring mufcle, as they pafs under the large annular ligament of the carpus; but the tendons themfelves are feparated from the others by thin fepta, which form a kind of particular rings. Being thus ftrengthened,. they feparate; and running along the palm of the hand in diftindl membranous vaginae, likethofe of the perforatus, by which they are covered, they enter the ligamentary vaginae of the firft phalanges together with the former; and having pafled through the fiflures thereof, and through the ligamentary vaginae of the fe¬ cond phalanges, they are inferted in the flat inner fide of the third, near their balls. EXTENSOR DIGITORUM COMMUNIS. This is a compound mufcle, very much refembling the perforatus and perforans, lying on the outfide of die fore-arm, between the ulnaris externus and radialis ex¬ ternus. It is fixed above, by a tendinous extremity, to the po- fterior and lower part of the External or great condyle of the os humeri, and, by a tendinous adhefion on each fide, to the ulnaris and radialis externus. It has like¬ wife fometimes a fmall infertion in the radius. It is di¬ vided into four mufcles, like the perforatus and perfo- xans, and four long, (lender, fmall tendons. Three of thefe tendons pafs through the common ex¬ ternal annular ligament of the carpus; and the fourth. Which goes to the little finger, pafl’es through a particular ring of the fame ligament. Afterwards thefe four tendons feparate as they go to the fingers, and in their paflage communicate with each other, by oblique tendinous feries, chiefly near the heads of the metacarpal bones. Each tendon having reached the bafis of the firft pha¬ lanx, is (lightly inferted therein by fome lateral expanfions fixed in each (ideof the bafis. From thence it advances to the head of the fame phalanx, where it is divided in¬ to two flat portions, which, at the articulation of the firft phalanx with the fecond, leave fome diftance be¬ tween them. About the head of the fecond phalanx, they unite again, and are fixed in the convex fide of the third phalanx, near its bafis. EXTENSOR INDICIS PROPRIUS. Th is is a fmall long mufcle, with a long (lender ten¬ don, lying a little obliquely on the lower and outer half of the fore-arm, between the ulna and fore-fipger. It is fixed, by its fleftiy body, a little higher than the 3 E loweft"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"202 Part If. ANATOMY. loweft third part of the outfide of the ulna, below the infertion of the extenfor pollicis, and it has likevvife a fmall adhefion to the interofleus ligament. From thence it runs down, ending in a diftindl tendon, without any communications, which having pafled through the annu¬ lar ligament of the extenfor communis, afterwards joins that tendon which goes to the index. EXTENSOR MINIMI DIGITI PROPRIUS, This is a kind of collateral or auxiliary mufcle of the extenfor communis, of which it appears almoll al¬ ways to be more or lefs a portion. It is fixed along the fuperior external half of the ul¬ na, from whence its long fmall tendon runs down in company with the fourth tendon of the extenfor commu¬ nis, ali the way to die little finger, where it joins it, and is inferted with it. LUMBRICALES. These are four very fmall flender mufcles, lying in the hollow of the hand, in the fame direction with the perforatus and perforans. They aie fixed, by their flelhy bodies, to the tendons of the perforatus on the fide next the thumb, near the large annular ligament of the carpus. Near the heads cf the metacarpal bones, they become very thin tendons, which accompany thofe of the perforans through the fur- ca» of the aponeurofis palmaris. Then they pafs on to the fame fides of the firft phalanges, and join the ten¬ dons of the extenfor communis; each of them being connected with the neareft portion thereof, at the articu¬ lation of the firft phalanx with the fecond. INTEROSSEI. These are fmall mufcles, lying between the metacar¬ pal bones, and filling the three interdices left between them, both exteriorly, or towards the back of the hand, and interiorly, or toward the palm of the hand. From this fituation tliey have the name of inUroJfei, and have been divided into external and internal. They are com¬ monly reckoned fix in number, three external, and three internal. The firft two external interoflei are for the moll part inferted in the middle finger. They fill the interftices between the three firft metacarpal bones, and furround the middle bone all the way to the hollow of the hand. Their tendons are fixed in both fides of the firft phalanx, and in both fides of the fecond tendon of the extenfor communis. The third external interofleus lies in the interftice be¬ twixt the two laft metacarpal bones, and is moll com¬ monly inferted in the ring finger; its tendon being fixed in that fide of the firft phalanx fartheft from the thumb, and in the correfpanding edge of the third tendon of the extenfor communis. The flelhy body of this mufcle runs in between the two bones toward the hollow of the hand. The internal interoflei are more Ample than, the former. and do not lie fo much between the bones. The tendon of the firft is inferted in the fide of the firft phalanx of the fore-finger, next the little finger, and in the corre- fponding edge of the extenfor communis. The tendon of the fecond goes in the fame manner to the fide of the ring-finger next to the thumb; and the third, to the fame fide of the little finger. There are therefore two external interoflei for the middle finger, one for the ring finger, but none for the fore and little finger. The middle finger has no internal interofleus; but the index, ring finger, and little finger, have each of them one. SEMI-INTEROSSEUS INDICIS. This is a fmall, Ihort, flat, flelhy mufcle, very like the antithenar, or internal femi-interofleus of the thumb. It is fituated obliquely on one fide of that of the thumb, between the firft phalanx thereof, and the firft metacar¬ pal bone. It is fixed by one end to the outfide of the balls of the firft phalanx of the thumb, and a little to that bone of the carpus by which this phalanx is fupported; and- by the other end it is fixed near the head of the firft phalanx of the index, on that fide next the thumb. HYPOTHENAR MINIMI DIGITI. This is a fmall and pretty long mufcle, lying on the backfide of the fourth metacarpal bone oppofite to the thnmb, where, together with the metacarpius, or hypo- thenar nietacarpi, it forms that large eminence over-a- gainft the thenar or that of the thumb. It is fixed by one end in the os orbiculare of the car¬ pus, and a little to the neighbouring part of the large an¬ nular ligament. The other end terminates by a Ihort ftattifh tendon, fixed to that fide of the balk of the firft phalanx of the little finger which is turn<& from the thumb. Uses of the Mufcles •which move the Fingers. The perforatus ferves to bend the fecond phalanges of all the fingers except the thumb; and the particular mufcles, of which it is made up, may adt feparately, by reafon of their diftindt infertions in thefe phalanges. They not only bend the fecond phalanges on the firft, but alfo the firft: on the metacarpal bones, and the meta¬ carpus and carpus on the fore-arm. The perforans bends particularly the third phalanges in which it is inferted; and by the fame motion it may likewife bend the firft and fecond phalanges. It may likewife be efteemed an afliftant to the ulnaris and radialis interni in great efforts; and thefe mufcles many reciprocally be looked upon as afliftants to the per¬ foratus and perforans. The extenfor digitorum communis ferves to extend the four fingers, to keep them in any degree of exten- fion, and to moderate their flexion in all the determinate degrees of adiion of the perforatus and perforans. Each tendon ferves to extend a whole finger, that is, all"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Part II. A N A T all the three phalanges together ; and likewife each pha¬ lanx by itfelf, though not wich the fame facility. The proper extenfors of the foie and little fingers are afliftants to two fubaltern mufcles of the extenfor com¬ munis that go to thefe fingers, which confequently we extend feparately with more eafe than either of the o- ther two. Thefe mufcles likewife ferve to bring the fingers, in which they are inferted, near the other fin¬ gers. The flexor pollicis longus ferves chiefly to bend the third phalanx of the thumb, in which it is iifeited by the extremity of its tendon. It likewife bends the fe- cond phalanx, by virtue of the ligamentary vagina, through which it pafles, as through an annular ligament. The firft extenfor of the thumb alone, when there are three, a portion of the firft, when there are but two, ferves to draw the firft phalanx from the palm of the hand, or to keep it at a diflance therefrom. The fecond of thefe mufcles when there are three, or the fecond portion of the firft when there are but two, ferves to extend the fecond phalanx on the firft. The third when there are three, or the fecond when there are but two, extends the third phalanx on die fe¬ cond. When they ad all together, they aflift each other by the graduated infertions of their fmall fubaltern tendons. The thenar, by its infertion in the firft phalanx of the thumb, ferves to draw it from the firft bone of the meta¬ carpus, more or lefs diredly, as one of its portions ads more than the other, or as they both a<ft equally. By the infertion of the large portion in the balls of the fecond phalanx, by the intervention of the fefamoid bone of the fame fide, it may bend this phalanx lateral¬ ly on the firft, and thereby bring the thumb to a great¬ er diftance from the index. The raefothenar moves the firft phalanx of the thumb towards the follow of die hand, more or lefs obliquely, as it ads either alone or with the large portion of the thenar, or even with the antithenar. By its infertion in the fefamoid bone of the fecond phalanx, it likewife moves that phalanx on the firft, and thereby aflifts the flexor longus. The antithenar moves the firft phalanx of the thumb toward the firft bone of the metacarpus, and thereby prefles the thumb laterally againft the index. This mo¬ tion becomes more or lefs oblique by the co-operation of the mefothenar. The hypothenar minor ferves to feparate the little fin¬ ger from the reft; which motion is commonly called ah- duliion. It likewife keeps this finger feparated in all fituations, that is, in all degrees of flexion or extenfion. The interoflei may have two different ufes, according to their different infertion, and the different fituations of the fingers in which they are inferted. In general, they aflift die extenfor conmmunis by their infertions in the lateral angles of the rhomboidal fiffures; for thereby they ad like lateral ropes, which, together with the tendons of the extenfor, ferve to extend the third phalanx of each finger. By the fame lateral infertions they perform the lateral motions of the fingers, that is, they prefs them all clofe O M Y. 20 ? againft each other, but do not feparate them all, nor move each finger in particular toward, or from, the thumb. In a general reparation of all the fingers, the interoflei move only the middle and ring fingers ; the in¬ dex and little finger being feparated by other mufcles. In the motions of the fingers toward the thumb, which is termed i dduttion. they ad only on three fingers, the middle, ring, and little fingers. In the contrary mo¬ tion, or abdudion of the fingers, they move likewife three, viz. die index, middle, and ring fingers. The ufes of the interoflei in particular, whether ex¬ ternal or internal, may be different in different fubjeds, according to the variety of their infertions ; and there¬ fore in living bodies nothing can be determined about them. According to the fituation in which they have been de- feribed, the firft and fecond external interoflei perforin alternately the addudion and abdudion of the middle fin¬ ger ; the third performs the abdudion of t'he ring-finger; that is, moves it toward the little finger. The firft internal interofl’eus makes the abdudion of the index, or moves it toward the middle finger; the fe¬ cond makes the addudion of the ring-finger, by moving it likewife toward the middle finger; and the third per¬ forms the addudion of the little finger, or moves it to¬ ward the middle finger. The ufe of the femi-interoffeus indicis is to move the: firft phalanx of the index, more or lefs diredly, toward the great edge of the metacarpus, by removing it from the middle finger. This motion is not a true addudion of the index toward the thumb. The lumbrieales, by the union of their tendons with thofe of the interoflei, are coadjutors to thefe mufcles, not only in the lateral motions of the four fingers, buj alfo in bending and extending them. In the lateral mo¬ tions, they co-operate according to their fituation- in each fubjed; and it is pofiible that the vaiiety of their infer¬ tions anfwer to that of the interoflei, fo that the reci¬ procal co-operation continues {till to be equal.

Th i s is a long thick mufcle fituated in the abdomen on the lumbar region, adhering Ho the vertebra of the loins, from the pofterior part of the os ilium to the an¬ terior part near the thigh. Tt is fixed above to the laft vetebra of the back, and to all thofe of the loins, that is, to the lateral parts of the bodies of thefe vertebra, and to the roots .pf their tranfverfe apophyfes. The infertions in the bodies of the vertebra are by a kind of digitations, and are very little tendinous. From thence the mufcle runs down laterally over the os ilium, on one fide of the iliac mufcle, and pafles un¬ der the ligamentum Fallopii, between the anterior inferi¬ or fpine of the os ilium, and that eminence which from its lituatioa may be termed iliopetiinea* Before"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"ANATOMY. Part. II. Before it goes oat of die abdomen, it unites with the iliacus, and is fometimes fixed, by a few flefhy fibres, in the outfide of the eminence fait mentioned. It after¬ wards covers the fore-fide of the head of the os femoris, and is infected in the fore-part of the little trochanter by an oblique tendon, which is folded double from behind forward. ILIACUS. This is a broad thick mufcle, lying on the whole in- fide of the os ilium. It is fixed by flefhy fibres to the internal labium of the crilta oflis ilium, to that of the Hope between the two anterior fpines, to the infides of thefe fpines, to the fu- perior half of the infide of this bone, and to the neigh¬ bouring lateral part of the-os facrum. All thefe fibres, contracting by degrees, run obliquely towards the lower part of the mufculus pfoas, uniting therewith, and being fixed by a kind of aponeurofis to the outfide of its tendon all the way to the little tro¬ chanter. They cover the head of the os femoris, and fome of the loweft are inferted in that bone a little above and behind the little trochanter, and others a little lower down. The iliacus and pfoas, thus united, pafs under the li- gamentum Fallopii, over the Hope or channel, between the anterior inferior fpine of the os ilium and cminentia ilio-pe&inca, in a fort of ligamentary capfula very fmooth and polifhed. PECTINEUS. This is a fmall, flat, and pretty long mufcle, broad at the upper part, and narrow at the lower, fituated ob¬ liquely between the Os pubis and upper part of the os fe¬ moris. It is fixed above by flefhy fibres to all the fliarp ridge or crifla of the os pubis, and to a fmall part of the ob¬ long notch or depreflion on the forefide of that crilta, in which the upper extremity of this mufcle is lodged. From thence it runs down obliquely towards the little' trochanter, under and a little behind which, it is infert¬ ed obliquely by a flat tendon, between the fuperior in¬ fection of the vaftus internus, and inferior infertion of the triceps fecundus, with which it is united. GLUTiEUS MAXIMUS. This is a thick broad mufcle, lying on the outfide of the os ilium and upper part of the os femoris. It is fixed wholly flefhy to all the lateral pofterior parts of the os coccygis and os facrum; to the Iigamen- tum facro-fciaticum; to the outfide of the tuberofity of the os ilium; and from thence to the external labium of the crifla cf that bone all the way to its higheft part, where this mufcle mixes fibres with the glutaeus medius. It is likewife fixed to the infide of the fafeia lata, at the places which anfwer to all the infertions already mentioned, but through a much greater fpace, and by a very great number of flefhy fibres, almofl in the fame manner as we fhall fee in the external plane of the muf¬ culus temporalis. The fibres which end in this fafeia be¬ come gradually fhorter, as they are fituated lower. All thefe fibres contract in breadth in a radiated man¬ ner as they approach to the great trochanter, and after¬ wards form a ftrong, flat, pretty broad tendon, about an inch in length, which is inferted a finger’s breadth or a little more bplow the great trochanter, in all that large longitudinal impreffion at the upper part of the li- nea afpera on the back-fide of the os femoris, between the vaftus extgrnus and large!! portion of the triceps. GLUT A! US MEDIUS. This is a radiated mufcle, almoft in the fhape of a fpread fan. It is pretty thick, and almoft as broad as the whole outfide of the os ilium, being fituated between the crifla of that bone and the great trochanter, and co¬ vered anteriorly by the fafeia lata, and pofteriorly by the glutaeus maximus. It is fixed above by flefhy fibres to all that fpace on the outfide of the os ilium, which lies between the external labium of the crifla, and the femicircular im- preflion which goes between the fuperior anterior fpine, and the great pofterior finus. It is likewife fixed in the edge of that ligament which goes between the lower part of the os facrum and os ili¬ um. Laftly, the inifbr part of it, which is covered only by the fafeia lata, is inferted in the infide of that fafeia in the fame manner as the glutaeus maximus. From thence all the fibres contrail in breadth, more of lefs, in a radiated manner, as they advance toward the great trochanter, and form a fhort thick tendon, which mixes a little anteriorly with the tendon of the glutaeus minimus; and the moft pofterior fibres gradual¬ ly join the fide of the tendon of the pyriformis. The tendon is inferted in the upper convex part of the great trochanter, from the apex of the large fuperior external rough furface, all the way to the anterior rough furface, encompafling in a manner all that part of the trochanter. G L U T JE U S MINIMUS. This is a fmall, broad, radiated mufcle, fituated on the outfide of the os ilium, under the other two glutasi. It is fixed above in all that portion of the outfide of the os ilium, which lies between the great femicircular line, and another fmall one, a little above the. fupcrcili- um of the cotyloid cavity or acetabulum, running be¬ tween the anterior inferior fpine and the great pofterior finus. It is - likewife fixed in the edge of that finus, in the fpine of the ifehium, and in the orbicular ligament of the joint of the hip. From thence its fibres, contracting in breadth, form a fhort tendon, by which the mufcle is inferted in the an¬ terior part of the upper edge of the great trochanter, a- bove the great external convex rough furface in which the glutaeus medius is fixed.

This, with the two following tricipital mufcles, are flefny and flat, and of different lengths, fituated between the os pubis and the whole length of the os femoris. The firft and fecond crofs each other in fuch a manner, as that the mufcle, which is the firft on the os pubis, becomes the fecond on the os femoris; and the fecond on the os pubis, is the firft on the os femoris. The third mufcle keeps its rank. The triceps primus is fixed above by a fhort tendon to the tuberofity or fpine of the os pubis, and to the neighbouring part of the fymphyfis, its fibres mixing a a little with thofe of the peftineus. From thence it runs down, increafing in breadth, and is inferted by flefhy fi¬ bres interiorly in the middle portion of the linea femo¬ ris afpera. At the lower part of this infertion, a portion of the mufcle feparates from the reft, and fends off a long ten¬ don, which, together with a like tendon from the triceps tertius, is inferted in the inner condyle of the extremity of the os femoris. , * TRICEPS 3 E C U N D U S .

From thence it runs down, and is inferted in the upper part of the linea afpera, between the pe<ftineus and tri¬ ceps primus, mixing a little with each of tbefe mufcles. TRICEPS TERTIUS. This mufcle is fixed above by flefhy fibres to the an¬ terior part of all the fhort ramus of the ifchium, and to a fmall part of the tuberofity of that bone. From thence it runs down, and is inferted by flefhy fibres in the linea afpera, alrnott from the little trochan¬ ter, down to the middle of*the os femoris. It goes low¬ er down than the firft triceps, fenfling off a feparate por¬ tion like that of the mufcle laft mentioned. Thefe two portions join together, and form a com¬ mon tendon, which, running down to the lower extremi¬ ty of the os femoris, is inferted in the back part of the tuberofity of the inner condyle. PYRIFORMIS PYRAMID A LIS. This is a fmall oblong mufcle, of the figure of a flat pear or pyramid, from whence it has its name. It is fituated almoft tranfverfely, between the os facrum and ifchium, being covered arid hid by the firft two glutasi. It is fixed to the inferior lateral part of the os facrum, by flefhy fibres, and to the neighbouring'part of the an¬ terior or concave fide of that bone, by three digitations lying between the anterior holes.

From thence its fibres, con tracing in breadth, pafs on the forefide of the great ramus of the ifehium, under the acetabulum, where a tendon is formed, which con¬ tinues its courfe behind the neck of the os femoris to¬ ward the great trochanter, and is inferted between the gemelli and quadratus, in a fmall foffula between the apex of the great trochanter, and the bafis of the col- lum femoris. QUADRATUS. This is a fmall, flat, fleihy mufcle, of the figure of an oblong fquare, from whence it has it name. It is fituated tranfverfely between the tuberofity of the ifehium and the great trochanter. It is fixed by one extremity along that obtufe line which runs from under the acetabulum, toward the lower part of the tuberofity of the ifehium. From thence it runs diredly toward the great trochanter, and is infert¬ ed in almoft all the lower half of the oblong eminence in that apophyfis ; but chiefly in the fmall rifing or tubero¬ fity in the middle of that eminence.

By its infertion in the os coccygis, it may on fome occafions bring it forward, and hinder it from being thruft too far backward, as in the excretion of hardened feces, or in difficult births. The glutseus medius is commonly, but falfely, reckon¬ ed an extenfor of the thigh. Its ufe is to feparate one O M Y.

When we fit, the only ufe of this mufcle is to per¬ form the rotation of the os femoris about its axis, in fuch a manner, that if the leg be bent at the fame time, it lhall be feparated from the other. The glutams minimus has likewife been reckoned an extenlor of the thigh, but without any foundation. It affifts the glutseus medius in the abdudion of the thigh when we ftand, and in the rotation when we fit. The ploas bends the thigh on the pelvis, or brings it forward. It may likewife move the pelvis on the thighs, and hinder it from being carried along with the reft of the trank, when the body is inclined backward while we fit, having the lower extremities fixed by fome external force. In this fituation it may likewife move the verte¬ bras of the loins. The iliacus is a congener or affiftant to the pfoas, in bringing the thigh forward and upward. It may likewife move the pelvis in the fame manner with the former. The pedineus is an affiftant tO’ the two former muf- clcs in moving both the thigh and the pelvis. It may likewife affift in bringing the thigh ijjward, or toward the other, whether it be extended or bent at the fame time. The three triceps mufcles join in the fame ufe; that is, to move the thigh inward, and bring the two thighs near each other; as when, in riding, we prefs the thighs cjofe againft the faddle; when, in fitting, we hold any thing clofe between the knees; when we crofs the thighs; or when, in (landing, we bring the legs clofe together, in order to jump. The ufe of thefe mufcles is likewife to hinder the thighs from feparating more than is convenient, efpecial- ly in great efforts and jerks. The pyriformis, gemelli, and quadratus, called like¬ wife by the common name of quadrigemini , are conge- neres in their ufes ; and thefe have been confined by ana- tomifts to the rotation of the os femoris ahout its axis from before outward, when we ftand or lie at full length; likewife in fitting, or when the thigh is bent in any other pofture, they carry the thigh outward, or fe¬ parate the two thighs from each other when bent. All the four co-operate in thefe two ufes of rotation and abdudion; but they co-operate equally or unequally, according to the different degrees of the extenfion or flexion of the thigh. The obturator internus has nearly the fame ufes with the quadrigemini, in making the rotation of the thigh when extended, and the abdudion when bent. The obturator externus concurs with the internus in the fame ufes, though in a more fimple manner, and in a more uniform diredion. It ads chiefly when the thigh is extended more or lefs. The mufculus fafeix latx makes a rotation from be¬ fore inwards, that is, in a contrary diredion to that made by the quadrigemini and obturator internus ; and this rotation is not fo much confined as that of the qua- dr'gemini, becaufe it may have place whether the thigh be bent or extended.

This mufcle is as long as the os femoris; and lies di¬ rectly along the forefide of the thigh, from whence it has the name of rettus anterior. It terminates above, by a pretty ftrong tendon, which is divided into two branches, one Ihort and ftraight, the other long and bent. The Ihort branch, running up in a ftraight line, is inferted in the anterior inferior fpine of the os ilium. The long branch is inflefled backward over the fuper- cilium of the acetabulum, and runs in the direction there¬ of, from the fpine toward the great ifchiatic finus. It is ftrong and flat, adhering very clofely to the bone, and covered by the orbicular ligament and the glutseus mi¬ nimus. From thence the mufcle runs down wholly flefhy, and partly penniform, fome of its fibres meeting above and feparating below. It is narrow at the upper extremity, and grows gradually broader toward the middle. Af¬ terwards it contrafls again in the fame manner, and, at the lower extremity of the os femoiis, ends in a flat broad tendon. VASTUS EXTERNUS. Tfns is a very large flefhy mufcle, almoft as long as the os femoris, broad at the extremities, and thick in the middle, lying on the.outfide of the thigh. Its upper infertion, being fomething tendinous, is in the pofterior or convex rough furface of the great tro¬ chanter. It is likewife fixed by a flelhy infertion along the outfide of the os femoris for above two thirds of its length downward, in the correfponding part of the linea afpera, and in the neighbouring portion of the fafcia lata. From all this extent the flelhy fibres running down¬ ward, and a little obliquely forward toward the reflus anterior, terminate infenfibly in a kind of Ihort aponeuro- fis, which is fixed in all the neareft edge of the tendon of the reflus, in the fide of the patella, in the edge of the ligament of that bone, and in the neighbouring late¬ ral part of the head of the tibia. * VASTUS INTERN US. This mufcle is very like the former, and fituated in the fame manner on the infide of the os femoris. It is fixed above by a fhort flat tendon, in the anterior rough furface of the great trochanter, and by flefhy fi¬ bres in that oblique line which terminates the bafis of the collum femoris anteriorly, on the forefide of the in- fertions of the pfoas and iliacus, in the whole infide of the os femoris, and in the linea afpera on one fide of the infertions of the three tricipites, almoft down to the in¬ ternal dbndyle. 1 From all this extent the fibres run downward, and a little obliquely forward, and the body of the mufcle in- T O M Y. 207 creafes in the fame manner as the vaftus internus. It terminates below in an aponeurofis, which is fixed in the edge of the tendon of the reflus anterior, in the fide of the patella, and of its tendinous ligament, and in the fide of the head or upper extremity of the tibia. , C R U R E U S. This is a flefhy mafs, covering almoft all the forefide of the os femoris between the two vafti, which likewife cover the edges of this mufcle on each fide. It is fixed to the forefide of the os femoris, from the anterior furface of the great trochanter down to the low- eft quarter of the bone, by flefhy fibres which run down fucceflively over each other, between the two vafti, ami are partly united to thefe two mufcles, fo as not to feem to form a diftinfl mufcle. It is not fo thick as the two vafti; and as it is cover¬ ed by them on each fide, a fort of flefhy channel is form¬ ed by all the three, in which the reflus is lodged, co¬ vering the forepart of the crureus. It terminates below in a tendinous aponeurofis, which joins the backfide of the tendon of the reflus anterior, and the neighbouring edges of the extremities of the two vafti. Thus, thefe four mufcles form a common tendon, which is inferted in the places already mentioned. S ARTORIU S. This is the longeft mufcle of the human body. It is flat, and about two fingers in breadth, fituated ob¬ liquely along the infide of. the thigh. It is fixed above by a very fhort tendon, in the lower part of the anterior fuperior fpine of the os ilium, before the mufculus fafcia lata. The beginning of its body lies in the notch between the two anterior fpines of that bone. From thence it runs down obliquely over the vaftus in¬ ternus and other mufcles that lie near it, all the way to the infide of the knee, where it terminates in afmall ten¬ don, which grows broader near its extremity, and is in¬ ferted obliquely and a little tranfverfely in the forepart of the infide of the head of the tibia, near the fpine or tuberofity of that bone, immediately above the infertion of the gracilis interior. Gracilis Interior fve Rectus Interior. This is a long thin mufcle, lying in a ftraight line on the infide of the thigh, between the os pubis and the knee. v It is fixed in the edge of the inferior branch of the os pubis, near the fymphyfis, by a broad and very fhort tendon, on one fide of the infertion of the triceps fecun- dus, but a little lower down. From thence the flefhy fibres contrafling a little in breadth, run down to the internal condyle of the os if> moris, where they terminate in a thin tendon, which af¬ terwards degenerates into a kind of aponeurofis, and is inferted in the fore-part of the infide of the head of the tibia. BICEPS."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"2 oS A N A T O M Y. BICEPS. This mufcle is made up of two portions, crie long, the other Ihort, and they end in a common tendon. Both portions are fleihy and confiderably thick, being G- tuated on the back and outfide of the thigh, between the buttock and ham. The great portion is fixed above, by a ftrong tendon, in the pofterior and lower part of the tuberofity of the ifchium, under the.infection of the inferior gemellus, and clofe behind that of the femi-nervafus. From thence it runs down toward the lower extremity of the thigh, where it meets the other portion, and joins with it in forming a common tendon. The fmall portion is fixed, by fleihy fibres, to the outfide of the linea afpera, below its middle, and to the fafcia lata, where it fcrras a feptum between the triceps and vaftus externus. From thence the fibres run down a little way, and then meeting the great portion, a com¬ mon tendon is formed between them. This ftrong tendon runs down to the outer and back- part of the knee, and is inferted in the lateral ligament of the joint, and in the head of the fibula, by two very Ihort tendinous branches. SEMI-NERVOSUS. This is a long mufcle, half flefhy and half tendinous, or like a- nerve, from whence it has its name. It is fitu- ated a little obliquely, on the pofterior and inner part of the thigh. It is fixed above to the pofterior part of the tuberofity of the ifchium, immediately before, and a little -more in¬ ward than the biceps. It is afterwards fixed, by flefiiy fibres, to the tendon of the biceps, for about the breadth of three fingers, much in the fame manner as the coraco- brachialis is fixed to the biceps of the arm. From thence it runs down fleihy toward the lower part of the infide of the thigh, having a fort of tendinous in- terfediion in the inner part of its fleihy portion. Having reached below the middle of the thigh, it terminates in a fmall, long, round tendon, which runs down to the infide of the knee, behind that of the gracilis, where it expands in breadth. It is inferted in the infide of the upper part of the ti¬ bia, about.two or three fingers breadth below the tube¬ rofity or fpine, immediately under the tendon of the gra¬ cilis internus, with which it communicates. SEMI-MEMBRANOSU'S. This is a long thin mufcle, partly tendinous, from whence it has its name, and fituated on the back-fide of the thigh, a little towards the infide. It is fixed above, by a broad tendon or long aponeu- rofis, in the irregular, obtufe, prominent line which goes from the acetabulum to the tuberofity of the ifchium, a little above the infertion of the femi-nervofus, and be¬ tween thofe of ihe gemellus inferior and quadratus. From thence it runs down flefhy in an oblique direction behind the inner condyle of the os femoris, below which Part II. it terminates in a thick tendon, which is inferted in the pofterior.and interior fide of the inner condyle of the ti¬ bia, by three fhort branches, the .firft or uppermoft of which goes a little toward the infide, the fecond more backward, and the third lower down. POPLITEUS. This is a fmall mufcle, obliquely pyramidal, fituated under the ham. It is fixed above, by a ftrong narrow tendon, to the outer edge of the inner condyle of the os femoris, and to the neighbouring pofterior ligament of the joint. From thence it runs obliquely downward under the inner condyle of fhe os femoris; it is a flat and pretty thick flefhy body, increafing gradually in breadth, till it is fixed in the back-fide of the head of the tibia, all the way to the oblique line or imprgffion obfervable on that fide. Uses of the Mufclet ’which move the Bones of the Leg on the Os Femoris, The two vafti and crureus ought to be looked upon as a true triceps, the ufes of which, in relation to the bones, are only to extend the tibia on the os fenioris, and the os femoris on the tibia. The extenfion of the tibia on the os femoris happens chiefly when we fit or lie, and that of the os femoris on the tibia when we Hand or walk. A li the three mufcles move the patella uni¬ formly in the diredtion of the os femoris, on the pulley at the lower extremity of that bone'. The infertion of both the vafti immediately in the head of the tibia, prevents the patella from being luxated la¬ terally on feme occafioos, in which the mufcles may adt with more force on one fide than on the other, or re¬ main without adtion, in which cafe the patella is loofe and floating. The redlus anterior, by its infertion in the patella, is a congener to the hit three mufcles, and ferves to exteqd the leg. By its infertion in the os ilium, it bends the thigh, and aflifts the pfoas, iliacus, and podlineus, whe¬ ther the leg be extended or bent. It likewife moves the pelvis forward on the os femoris, and hinders it from falling back when we fit. The fartorius performs the rotation of the thigh from before outward, whether extended of bent; beiqg an antagonift to the mufculus fafeise lataz, and a congener to the quadrigemini. It likewife bends the thigh, or rajfes it forward ; it moves the pelvis forward on the femoris ; and when the pelvis refts on the two tuberofities of the ifchium in fit¬ ting, it keeps it in that fituation. Laftly, it bends the leg, whether it performs the ro¬ tation of the thigh at the fame time or not. The gracilis internus bends the leg much in the fame manner with the fartorius, which it affifts in this func¬ tion, but not in that of turning the leg. It may likewife aflift the triceps in the addudlion of the thigh, which it performs with much more facility than it begins the flexion of the leg without the rotation of the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Part II. A N A T The femi-nervofus bends the leg, and may likewife bend the thigh on the leg. By its infertion in the tube- rqfity of the ifchium, it likewife extends the thigh on the pelvis, and carries it backward; and may alfo extend the pelvis on the thigh, when it has been inclined for¬ ward with the reft of the trunk ; and confequently pre¬ vent its being carried too far along with the trdnk, when we (loop forward, either (landing or fitting. The femi-membranofus has the fame ufes with the fe- mi-nervofus. It bends the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the leg; it extends the thigh on the pelvis, and the pelvis on the thigh, and fuflains the pelvis when it is inclined forward. * The two portions of the biceps bend the leg on the thigh, and the thigh oun the leg. The fuperior portion likewife extends the thigh on the pelvis, and the pelvis on the thigh. Thefe four ufes in general are common to this mufcle with the femi-membranofus, and in fome mea- fure with the femi-tendinofus. The particular ufe of the biceps, and which feems to belong more to the fhort portion than to the other, is to perform the rotation of the leg xhen bent, by which motion the toes are turned outward, and the heel inward. The popliteus performs the rotation of the leg when bent, in a direction contrary to that of th,e biceps. The biceps turns the leg from before outward; the popliteus from before inward. Sect. XI.

This is a long mufcle, flefhy at the upper part, and tendinous at the lower, fituated on the fore-fide of the leg, between the tibia and the extenfor digitorum longus. It is fixed above, by flefhy fibres, in the upper third part of the external labium of the crifla tibiae, and of the infide of the aponeurofis tibialis, or of that ligamen¬ tary expanfion which goes between the crifla tibiae and the anterior angle o^ the fibula. It is likewife fixed ob¬ liquely in the upper two thirds of theoutfide of the tibia, or that next the fibula. From thence it runs down and ends in a tendon, which firfl pafl'es through a ring of the common annular liga¬ ment, and then through another feparate ring fituated lower down. Afterwards the tendon is fixed, partly in the upper and inner part of the os cuboides, and pardy in the infide of the firil bone of the metatarfus. Peronjeus Medius vulgo Peronjeus Anticus. This is a long mufcle, fituated anteriorly on the mid¬ dle part of the fibula. It is fixed above, by flefhy fibres, to more than the middle third part of the anterior or outfide of the fibula, and to the neighbouring part of the aponeurofis tibialis. It is likewife fixed to a production from the infide of that aponeurofis which runs to the upper part of the ti- Vol. I. No. 9. O M Y. 209 bia, and there ferves for a middle feptsm between this* mufcle and the extenfor digitorum longus. From thence it runs down and forms a tendon, which going in the direction of the oblique line on the fibula, pafl’es behind the external malleolus, and then through an annular ligament common to it and to the peronaeus maximus, and is afterwards inferted in the tuberofity at the bafis of the fifth metatarfal bone, fending off a fmall tendon to the firfl phalanx of the little toe, PERONaEUS MINIMUS. This is a fmall mufcle, commonly thought to be a portion of the extenfor digitorum longus, though it is eafily feparable from it. It is fixed, by flefhy fibres, in the lower half of the infide of the fibula, between two oblique bony lines, on one fide of the lower part of the extenfor digitorum lon¬ gus, to which mufcle it is (imply contiguous. From thence it runs down contracting in breadth, and pafl'es with the extenfor longus, through the common an¬ nular ligament, forming a flat tendon, which foon fepa- rates from thofe of the extenfor, and is inferted near the bafis of the fifth metatarfal bone. GASTROCNEMII. These are two thick, pretty broad, and oblong muf- cles, fituated laterally with refpeCt to each other, in the fame plane, under the poples, and forming a great part of what is called the calf of the leg. That which lies* next the tibia is called intermit , and that next the fibu¬ la, externus; and becaufe they form, as it were, the belly of the leg, they have been termed in Greek ga- Jtrocnemii. Each mufcle is fixed above, by a flat tendon, to the poflerior part of the lower extremity of the os femoris, behind the lateral tuberofity of each condyle, adhering clofely to the poflerior ligaments of the joint of the knee. From thence they run down, each forming a large and pretty broad flefhy body, irregularly oval. About the middle of the leg, they end in a flrong, broad, common tendon, which contracts a little in breadth as it defeends, and is inferted in the poflerior extremity of the os calcis, together with the tendon of the foleus. SOLE US. This is a large, flefhy, flat mufcle, nearly of an oval figure, and thicker in the middle than at -the edges. It is fituated on the back-fide of the leg, lower down than the gaflrocnemii, by which it is covered; and thefe three mufcles form the calf of the leg. It is fixed above, partly to the tibia, and partly to the fibula. Afterwards leaving thefe two bones, it ends in abroad flrong tendon, which, together with that of the gaflroc¬ nemii, forms what is called tend- Achillis . This flrong tendon contracts a little in its paflage to t'qe os calcis, and then expanding a little, it is inferted obliquely in the back-fide of that bone, all the way to the tuberofity. - 3 G TIBI-"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"2 iO A N A T TIBIALIS GRACILIS vulgo PLANTARIS. Th i s is a fmall pyriform mufcle, fituated obliquely in the ham below the external condyle of the os femoris, between the popliteus and gaftrocnemius externus; and its tendon, which is long, flat, and very fmall, runs down on the fide of the gaftrocnemius internus, ail the way to the heel. The flefhy body, which is only about two inches in length, and one in breadth, is fixed, by a fliort flat ten¬ don, above the outer edge of the exterior condyle of the os femoris, on one fide of the gaflrocnemius externus. From thence the flefhy body runs obliquely over the edge of the poplitetis, and terminates in a very fmall, long, flat tendon. < This tendon runs between the body of the gaftroene- mius externus ami foleus, all the way to the inner edge of the upper part of the tendo Achillis ; and from thence continuing its courfe downward, it joins this tendon, and is inferted, together with it, in the outfide of the pofte- rior part of the os calcis, without communicating with the aponeurofis plantaris. TIBIALIS POSTICUS. This is a long, flefhy, pennifojm mufcle, broader a- bove than below, fituated between the tibia and fibula,, on the back-fide of the leg, and covered by the extenfor digitorum longus. It is fixed above, by flefhy fibres, immediately under the articulation of the tibia and fibula, to the nearefi parts of thefe two bones, chiefly to the tibia, reaching to the lateral parts of that bone, above the interoffeous ligament, which is here wanting. From thence its infertion is extended below the oblique line or imprefiion in the tibia, over all the neighbouring part of the interoffeous ligament, and through more than the upper half of the internal angle of the fibula. After this, it forms a tendon, which runs down behind the inner , malleolus, through a cartilaginous groove and an annular ligament, and, paffing under the malleolus, is in¬ ferted in the tuberofity or lower part of the os fcaphoides. PeronjEUS Maximus vulgo PeroNjEus Posterior. This is a long penniform mufcle, lying on the fibula. It is fixed above to the anterior and outer part of the head of the fibula, and to a fmall portion of the head of the tibia; then to the outfide of the neck of the fibula, to the upper half of the external angle of that bone, and to the aponeurofis tibialis, which at that place makes a feptum between this mufcle and the extenfor pollicis. From thence turning a little backward, according to the direction of the bone, it forms a confiderable tendon, which, running behind the external malleolus, paffes through a kind of hollow groove, and through an annu¬ lar ligament common to it and to the tendon of the pero- nasus medifis, which lies before it. .

This is a thin fingle mufcle, lying between the tibialis anticus and extenfor digitorum longus, by which it is al J moft hid. It is fixed to the infide of the fibula, near the interof¬ feous ligament, from the neck down to the loweft quar¬ ter of that bone; to the interoffeous ligament through the fame fpace, and a little to the lower extremity of the tibia next the fibula. There it ends in a confiderable tendon, which palling through a diflimS ring of the common annular ligament, and then through a membranous vagina, is inferted in the bafis of the firft phalanx of the great toe, and conti¬ nued from thence up to the fecond. FLEXOR POLLICIS LONGUS. This is a pretty long mufcle, fituated in the pofterior and lower part of \"the leg. It is fixed in the lower half of the back-fide of the fibula, its infertion reaching almoft as far as the external malleolus. The flefhy body advances on the infide of that bone towards the tibia, according to the oblique di¬ rection of that fide, and ends in a large tendon. This tendon paffes behind the lower extremity of the tibia, toward the inner ankle, then through a fmall notch in the inner and back-fide of the aftragalus, and through an annular ligament or ligamentary vagina, continued un¬ der the lateral arch of the os calcis. From thence it advances to the great toe, and paffing through the interftice between the two fefamoid bones, in the ligamentary vagina of the firft phalanx, is inferted in the lower part of the fecond. THENAR. This mufcle is made up of feveral portions* and lies on the inner edge of the foie of the foot. It is fixed, by three or four flefhy fafciculi, to the lower and inner part of the os calcis, os fcaphoides, and os cuneiforme majus. It is likewife fixed a little in the annular ligament under the inner ankle, which belongs to the tendon of the flexor longus. From all thefe different infertions, the flefhy fafciculi approach each other as they advance forward under the fiift bone of the metatarfus, and are fixed, partly in the internal fefamoid bone, and partly in the infide of the firft. phalanx, near its bafis.

This is along mufcle, flelhy in the upper part, and tendinous in the lower, lying between the tibialis anticus and peroiKeus maximus. It is fixed above, by flelhy fibres, in the outfide of the head of the tibia, and infide of the head of the fibula; in the upper part of the interofleous ligament, through three fourths of the length of the fibula; and through the fame fpace, in the tendinous feptum belonging to the anterior angle of that bone. It contracts in breadth a little above the annular liga¬ ment, and, in paffing through it, is divided into three tendons; the firft of which is afterwards divided into two. Thefe four tendons are inferted along the upper or convex fide of the.four fmall toes. EXTENSOR DIGITORUM BREVIS. This is a fmall complex mufcle, lying obliquely on the convex fide of the foot, being likewiie termed pe- dieus . It is fixed in the upper and outer fide of the anterior apophyfis of the aftragalus, and in the neighbouring part of the upper fide of that bone. From thence it runs obliquely from without inwards, under the tendons of the perbnxus minimus and extenfor digitorum longus, being divided into four flefhy portions, which terminate in the fame number of tendons. The firfl tendon is inferted in the upper or convex part of the firfl: phalanx oi the great toe. The other three joining with thofe of the extenfor longus, are inferred a- long the convex fides of all the phalanges of the three following toes. FLEXOR DIGITORUM BREVIS Jive PERFORATUS PEDIS. This is the undermoft of all the common mufcles of the toes, being fituated immediately above the aponeuro¬ fis plantaris. It is fixed by flefhy fibres to the anterior and lower part of the great tuberofity of the os calcis; and to the neighbouring part of the upper fide of the aponeurofis plantaris. From thence it runs forward, being divided into four flefhy portions, which terminate in the fame number of tendons, fpiit at their extremities, in the fame manner as thofe of the fublimis or perferatus of the hand, and in¬ ferted in the fecond phalanges cf the four fmall toes. FLEXOR DIGITORUM LONGUS ftve PERFORANS PEDIS. This is along mufcle, flefhy above, and tendinous below, lying on the backfide of the leg between the tibia and the flexor .pollicis longus, covered by.the foleus, and covering the tibialis pofticus. It is fixed above, by flefhy fibres, to a little more than the middle third part of the backfide of the tibia near its external angle, below the infertion of the foleus; and alfo to a kind of ligament which runs down from the middle of the tibia. It afterwards ends in a tendon which pafles behind the inner ankle, on one fide, and a little behind the tibialis pofticus, in a feparate annular li¬ gament. From thence it runs under the foie of.tlie foot, fend¬ ing off a detachment, by which it communicates with, the flexor pollicis longus.

This is a flat and pretty loDg flefhy. mafs, fituated obliquely under the foie of the foot. This mufcle is fixed pofteriorly by one flefhy portion,^ in the lower fide of the os calcis, and in the anterior tu- befofity on that fide, and by the other in the neighbour¬ ing ligament which joins this bone to the aftragalus. From thence the two portions run obliquely to the' middle of the foie of the foot, and there unite in a flat,; long, and irregularly fqnare mufcular mafs, which is fix¬ ed to the outer edge of the fafciculus of tendons of the flexor longus, to which it ferves as a fraenum at thac place.

INTEROSSEI. These are feven fmall mufcles which fill up the four interftices between the metatarfai bones, much after the fame manner as in the hand. The four largeft are fu- perior, the other three inferior. METATARSIUS. This is a flefhy mafs, lying under the foie of the foot. It is fixed, by one end, in the fore-part of the great tuberofity of the os calcis; and running forward from thence, it terminates in a kind of fhort tendon, which is fixed in the tuberofity and pofterior part of the lower fide of the fifth bone of the metatarfus. PAR A THENAR MAJOR. This is a pretty long mufcle, forming part of the outer edge of the foie of the foot. It is fixed backwards by a flefhy body, to the outer part of the lower fide of the os calcis, from the fmall pofteri- or external tuberofity, all the way to the anterior tubero¬ fity. There it joins the metatarfius, and at the bafis of the fifth metatarfai bone feparates from it again, and forms a tendon, which is inferted in the outfide of the firft pha¬ lanx of the little toe, near its bafis, and near the infer- tion of the parathenar minor. PARATHENAR MI NOR¬ TH is is a flefhy mufcle, fixed along the pofterior half of the outer and lower fide of the fifth bone of the metatarfus. It terminates under the head of that bone, in a tendon which is inferted in the lower part of the bafis of the firft phalanx of the little toe. Uses of the Mufcles which move the Tarfus and the other Bones of the Foot. The tibialis anticus bendsthe foot, that is, turns the point of the foot toward the leg ; which motion is per¬ formed by the ginglymoid articulation of the aftragalus with the tibia and fibula. It likewife bends the leg on the foot, or hinders its extenfion. By its lateral infertion in the os cuneiforme maximum, it moves this bone in particular over the anterior extre¬ mity of the os calcis; by which the foie of the foot is turned inward toward the other. The peronseus medius bends the foot, and hinders the leg from falling back in the fame manner as the tibialis apticus. By its infertion in the tuberofity of the fifth metatarfai bone, it turns the foie of the foot outward at Part II. the fame time that it bends it, when it ads without the ailiftance of the tibialis anticus. The peronaeus minimus is an afliftant to the medius in the flexion of the foot, in preferving the oequilibrium of the leg, and in turning the foie of the foot outward. The gaftrocnemii and foleus make a kind of triceps; and, by their common tendon, extend the foot, and keep it extended againft the ftrongeft refiftance. It is by their means that we raife the whole body, even with an addi¬ tional burden, when we ftand a tip-toes j and that we walk, run and jump. The gaftrocnemii, by their infertion in the os femoris, may, in great efforts, move the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the leg, as afliftants to the biceps, femi- membranofus, femi-tendinofus, gracilis internus, and far- torius. The foleus, by the multitude of its flefhy fibres and its penniform ftrudure, is more proper for ftrong than large motions, and feems principally to fuftain the ga¬ ftrocnemii in the motions begun by them. The tendi¬ nous portions of this mufcle and of the gaftrocnemii, tho’ they forma ftrong tendon all together, feem neverthelefs to Aide a little upon each other in the different flexions and extenfions of the foot. Anatomifts are not agreed with regard to the ufe of the tibialis gracilis. When the tibialis pofticus ads alone, it extends the foot obliquely inward. When it ads together with the gaftrocnemii and foleus, it changes the Hreight direction of their motion to an oblique one. When it ads with the tibialis anticus, the foie of the foot is turned more 'diredly inward, or toward the other foot. When the peronseus longus or maximus ads alone, It may extend the foot hanging freely in the air ; but then this extenfion is obliquely outward. Together with the gaftrocnemii and foleus, it likewife changes their direction to an oblique extenfion outward. The extenfor pollicis longus extends the two phalan¬ ges of the great toe; and it may likewife be an afliftant to the tibialis anticus. The flexor pollicis longus not only bends the fecond phalanx of the great toe, but may likewife ferve, in great efforts, as an afliftant to the extenfors of the tarfus. This mufcle is of great ufe in climbing up a fteep place. The thenar bends the firft phalanx of the great toe. When the portion neareft the inner edge of the foot ei¬ ther ads alone, or ads more than the reft, the great toe is feparated from the other toes, efpecially if it be at the fame time extended. ’ The antithenar, ading with the thenar, bends the firft phalanx of the great toe. When it ads alone, efpeci¬ ally if the great toe is bent, it brings it nearer the o- ther toes, in proportion to the degrees of adion of its different portions The two extenfores digitorum communes concur in ex¬ tending the four fmall toes ; and, as the extenfor longus is not near fo flefhy as that of the hand, this difference is made up by the extenfor brevis.

The perforatus or flexor digitorum brevis, bends the fecond phalanges; and the perforans or flexor longus, the third ; the ufe of thefe mufcles being nearly the fame with thofe of the perforatus and perforans of the hand. , The flexor acceflorius is an affiftant to the perforans, increafing its force on fome occalions. It likewife di¬ rects the tendon of that mufcle ; for hy contra&ing, at the fame time that the flefhy belly of the perforans is in adtion, it makes the tendons go in a ftraighter line to the toes than they would otherwife do, becaufe of their obli¬ quity. The lumbricales have nearly^the fame funftions in the foot as in the hand *, and they are pardy aflifted, and partly diredted, by the flexor acceflorius. The interoflei of the foot have the fame ufes as in the hand. The firft fuperior mufcle brings the fecond toe near- the great toe; the other three bring the fecond, third, and fourth toes near the little toe. The three inferior mufcles move the laft three toes toward the other two. The metatarfius moves the laft bone of the metatarfus, much in the fame manner as the metacarpius does that of the metacarpus. The tranfverfalis may aflift the metatarfius in this adtion, which is fuppofed to be of ufe to'tilers ih climb¬ ing. The antithenar may likewife concur, and the pe- ronasus minimus may ferve to counterbalance thefe muf¬ cles, and to bring the metatarfus back, to its natural fi- tuation. The parathenar major ferves particularly to feparate the little toe from the red; and the parathenar minor bends the firft phalanx of that toe. Sect. XIII. The Muscles employed in Refpiration. DIAPHRA G M A. This is a very broad and thin mufcle, fituated at the bafis of the thorax, and ferving as a tranfverfe partition to feparate that cavity from the abdomen'. For this reafon the Greeks termed it diapbragma ; and and the Latins, feptum tranfverfum. It forms an oblique inclined arch, the fore-part of which is higheft, and the pofterior part loweft, making a very acute angle with the back. It is looked upon as a double and digaftric mufcle, made of two different portions, one large and fupe¬ rior, called the great mufcle of the diaphragm; the o- ther fmall and inferior, appearing like an appendix Jo the other, called the final 1 or inferior mufcle of die dia¬ phragm. The great or principal mufcle is flefhy in its circum¬ ference, and tendinous and aponeurotic in the middle, which, for that reafon, is commonly called centrum nervuum Jive tendinofum. The flefhy circumference is radiated, the fibres of which it fs made up being fixed by one extremity to the Voe. I. No. 9. 3 edge of the middle aponeurofis, and by the other to all the bafis of the Cavity of the thorax, being inferted. by digitations in the lower parts of the appendix of the fternum, of the loweft true ribs, of all the falfe ribs, and in the neighbouring vertebrx. We have therefore three kinds of infertions ; one fter- nal ; twelve coftal, fix on each fide ; and two vertebral, one on each fide. Thefe laft are very fmall, and fome- times fcarcely perceivable. The coftal infertions join thofe of the tranfverfalis abdominis, but do not mix with them, as they feem to do before the membrane which covers them is removed. The fibres inferted in the appendix enfiformis, run from behind diredtly forward, and form a fmall parallel plane. The firft coftal infertion runs a little obliqnely to¬ wards the cartilage of the feventh true rib, a triangular fpace being left between this and the fternal infertion, at which the pleura and peritonaeum meet. The infertion of thefe fibres is very broad, taking up about two thirds of the cartilage of the feventh rib, and a fmall part of the bone, from whence it reaches beyond the angle of the cartilage. The fecond infertion is into the whole cartilage of the . firft falfe rib; the third partly in the bone, and partly in the cartilage of the fecond falfe rib; the fourth in the bone, and fometimes a little in the cartilage of the third falfe rib; the fifth in the bone, and a little in the cartilage of the fourth falfe rib, being broader than the reft. The fixth is in the cartilage of the laft falfe rib, and almoft through the whole length of the bone. At the head of this rib, it joins the vertebral infertion, which runs from the lateral part of the laft vertebra of the back, to the firft vertebra of the loins. The fmall mufcle of the diaphragm is thicker than the other, but of much lefs extent. It is fituated along the forefide of the bodies of the laft vertebra of the back and feveral of thofe of the loins, being turned a lit¬ tle to the left hand. It is of an oblong form, reprefent- ing in fome meafure a flefhy collar, the two lateral por¬ tions of which, crofs each other, and afterward become tendinous toward the lower part. The upper part of the body of this mufcle is fixed in the Hope of the middle aponeurofis of the great mufcle. The outer edges of the alae or lateral portions join the pofterior plane of the great mufcle, and thefe portions adhere to the body of the laft vertebra of the back. The extremities, called likewife ptllan or crura , are . inferted by feveral tendinous digitations in tire vertebrx of the loins. The upper part of the flefhy body is formed by a par¬ ticular intertexture of fibres belonging to the two alx. Thefe two alae, whereof that toward the right-hand is ge¬ nerally the mod confiderable, part from each other, and form an oval hole, terminated on the lower part by fibres, detatched from the infide of each ala, immediately above the laft vertebra of the back. Thefe fibres de- cuffate and crofs each other, and afterwards thofe that come from each ala join that on the other fide, fo that each of the crura is a production of both alas. 3 H The"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"214 The fibres that come from the left ala, crofs over thofe from the right ala, and this again fends a fmall fafciculu\\ of fibres over thofe of the left ala; afterwards the two crura part from each other. The right crus is larger and longer than the left, and is always inferted in the four upper vertebrae of the loins, and often in the fifth likewife, by the fame number of digitations, which become more and mere tendinous as they defeend, and at length are expanded in form of an' aponeurofis. This crus lies more on the middle of the . bodies of the vertebrae than on the right fide. The left crus is fmaller and fhorter, and lies more on the fides of the vertebrae. It is fixed by digitations to the three upper vertebrae of the loins, feldom reaching lower. The lower part of it is expanded in the fame manner as the other; and the two expanfions fometimes meet together. The oval opening of this inferior mufcle of the dia¬ phragm, gives paflage to the extremity of the cefopha- gus, and the aorta lies in the interflice between the two crura. Immediately above the opening or hole, a thin fafciculus of fibres is fent off to the ftomach. In the middle aponeurofis of the gieat mufcles, a little to the right of the anterior part of the Hope, near the fmall mufcle, is a round opening, which tranfmits the trunk of the lower vena cava. The border or circum¬ ference of this opening is very artfully formed by an ob¬ lique and fucceffive intertexture of tendinous fibres, al- inoil like the edge of a wicker bafket; and is, confequent- ly, incapable either of dilatation or contra&ion, by the aftion of the diaphragm. We find therefore three confiderable openings in the diaphragm ; one round and tendinous, for the paflage of the vena cava; one oval and flelhy, for the extremity of the cefophagus ; and one forked, partly fielhy, and part¬ ly tendinous, for the aorta. The round opening is to the right-hand, clofe to the upper part of the right ala of the fmall mufcle ; the oval opening is a little to the left; fo that the right ala, which is between thefe two holes, lies almoft diredlly over again!! the middle of the body of the eleventh vertebra of the back; the tendi¬ nous fc #k is under the oval opening, but a little more toward the middle. SCALENI. These are compound mufcles, irregularly triangular. The fealertus primus is fixed to the upper part of the outfide of the firfl rib, by two diftinft portions, called commonly branches; one anterior, the other pofterior. The anterior branch is fixed to the middle portion of the rib, about an inch from the cartilage. From thence it runs obliquely upward, and is inferted in the tranf- verfe apophyfis of the fixth, fifth, and fometimes of the third vertebra of the neck. ■ The pofterior branch is fixed more backward in the firfl rib, an interflice of about an inch being left be¬ tween it and the other branch, through which the axil¬ lary artery und brachial nerves are tranfmitted. From thence it runs up obliquely behind the former, and is in¬ ferted in all the tranfverfe apophyfes of the neck. Part It. The fealenus fecundus is fixed a little more backward in the external labium of the upper edge of the fecond rib, fometimes by two feparate portions, and fometimes without any divifion. The anterior portion is fixed im¬ mediately under the pofterior portion of the firfl feale¬ nus, by a Ihort flat tendon, united a little with the firfl intercoftal mufcle. From thence it runs up over the po¬ fterior portion of the firfl fealenus, communicating like¬ wife with that mufcle, and is fixed by infertions, partly tendinous and partly flefliy, in the tranfverfe apophyfes of the four firfl vertebra of the neck. The pofterior portion is fixed in the fecond rib, more backward than the other. From thence it runs up, be¬ ing divided into two portions, whereof one is inferted in the tranfverfe apophyfes of the three firfl vertebrae of the neck, behind the fealenus primus. The other portion runs up behind the former, and is inferted in the tranf¬ verfe apophyfes of the two firfl vertebra. SERRATUS POSTICUS SUPERIOR. This is a flat thin mufcle, fituated on the upper part of the back. It is fixed on one fide, by a broad a- poneurofis, to the lower part of the pofterior cervical ligament, and to the fpinal apophyfes of the two laft vertebra of tire neck, and two firfl of the back. From thence it runs down a little obliquely forward, and is inferted, by broad flelhy digitations, in tlje pofte¬ rior part of the fecond, third, fourth, and fometimes of the fifth true ribs, neai their angles; but fometimes it has no ipfertiop ifi the fecond rib. SERRATUS POSTICUS INFERIOR. This is a flat thin mufcle, lying on the lower part of the back. It is fixed in the laft fpinal apophyfis of the back, and in the three firfl of the loins, by a broad apo¬ neurofis. From thence it runs up a little obliquely, and is fixed, by fle/hy broad digitations, in the laft four falfe ribs. Its infertions, in the loweft rib, is near the carti¬ lage, and, in the other three, near their angles. INTERCOSTALES. The intercoftal mufcles are thin, flelhy planes, lying in the interftices between the ribs, their fibres running obliquely from one rib to another. In each interflice lie two planes, an external and an internal, clofely joined to¬ gether, nothing but a thin, fine, cellular, membranous web coming between them. According to this natural divifion, there muft be for¬ ty-four intercoftal mufcles in the twenty-two interftices left between the twenty-four ribs ; and of thefe there are eleven external, and eleven internal, on each fide. The fibres of the external intercoftals run down from behind forward, and, thofe of the internal intercoftals from before backward; fo that the fibres of thefe two. feries of mufcles crofs each other. The external intercoftals extend commonly from the vertebra to the extremity of the upper labium of the bony portion of each r.b, and go no further. The in¬ ternal A N A T O M Y."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Part II. ternal begin forward near the Heroum, and end back¬ ward at the angle of each rib. SUPRA-COSTALES. These mufcles are irregularly triangular, and fituated on the back-part of the ribs, near the vertebrae. Each of thefe mufcles is fixed, by one tendinous ex¬ tremity, in the tcajifverfe apophyfis, which lies above tlje articulation of each rib, and to the neighbouring liga-. meht; the fird being inferted in the tranfverfe apophyfis of the lad vertebra of the neck ; and the lad, in that of the eleventh vertebra of the back. From thence theflefhy fibres run down obliquely, in- creafing in breadth as they defeend, and are inferted in the back part of the outfideof the following rib. SUB-CO ST ALES. These are flefhy planes, of different breadths, and very thin, fituated more or lefs obliquely on the infides of the ribs, near the bony angles, and running in the fame dire&ion with the external intercodals. They are fixed by both extremities in the ribs; the inferior extremity being always at a greater diftance from the vertebrae than the fuperior, and feveral ribs lying be¬ tween the two infertions. Sterno-Costales vulgo Triangularis Sterni, These are five pairs of flefliy planes, difpofed more or lefs obliquely on each fide the dernum, and on the in- fide of the cartilages of the fecond, third, fourth, fifth, and fixth true ribs. They are inferted, by one extremity, in the edges of the infide of all the lower half of the dernum. From thence the fird mufcle on each fide runs up obliquely, and is fixed in the cartilage of the fccond rib. The fecond runs lefs obliquely to its infertion in the cartilage of the third rib. The red are inferted, in the fame manner, in the cartilages of the following ribs. This lad mufcle is fixed, by one extremity, in the cartilage of the fixth true rib, near the bone, and feems to pafs the appendix enfiformis, immediately above the infertion of the diaphragm in that appendix, and to join the mufcle on the other fide. Uses of the Mufcles employed in Refpiration. The fealeni are fometimes ranked among thefe which ferve for refpiration; but they ought rather to be rank¬ ed among the mufcles which move the vertebrae of the neck; becaufe the articulation of the fird rib on both fides, with the fird vertebra of the back, feems to ferve only for the motion of that vertebra on the rib, and not of the rib on the vertebra. The feTratus podicus fuperior is difpofed to move up¬ wards the three or four upper ribs next the fird. The ferratus podicus inferior is dill better difpofed for deprefling and keeping down the lad three or four falfe ribs. The poderiox fibres of the external intercodals are 21 $ fixed, by their upper extremities, fo near the articulation of the ribs with the vertebrae, that they cannot deprefs that rib in which they are fo inferted ; whereas the infertions of their lower extremities in the following rib being at a greater didance from the articulation, they may move that rib upward. And from thence it follows, that all the remaining part of each external in- tercoftal which terminates at the bony extremity of each rib, can only ferve to raife the lower tib toward the. upper. The anterior fibres of the internal intercodals are fo near the articulation of the ribs with the dernum, that they cannot deprefs that cartilage in which each of them is inferted; whereas the inferior infertions .of thefe fibres being at a greater didance from the. articulation, they are in a condition to raife the cartilages in which they are fo inferted. From whence it fellows, that all the internal intercodal mufcles have the fame ufc with the external, and that they can have no other. The fupra-codalcs are powerful aflidants to the inter¬ codals in their common adlion, and are therefore very judly termed levatores c oft arum. The derno-codales deprefs the cartilaginous portions, and anterior exti trinities of the ribs, elpecially the fnpe- rior ribs, except the fird; and at the fame time draw the cartilages of the inferior ribs near the dernum, bv reafon of the curvature. They may therefore very well be called depreffores coftarum , as the fupra-codales are named levatores. The fub-codales having the fuperior extremities of their fibres much more didant from the vertebral articu¬ lation of the 1 ribs than the lower extremities, it follows, that they can more eafily move lhe upper than the lower ribs, and confequently that they are aflidants tP the demo-codales. The diaphragm, together with the intercodal mufcles, the ribs, dernum, and vertebrae of the back, forms the cavity of the thorax, and it divides this cavity from that of the abdomen. Its particular ufe is to be the principal organ of refpi¬ ration, that is, of the alternate expaDfion and contra&ion of the thorax. The other mufcles already mentioned are to be confidered only as aflidants and directors, in order to facilitate and regulate thefe motions, which, in the ordinary date, are perpetual, but which may, by the a&ion.of thefe other mufcles, be accelerated, retarded, or even be fufpended for fome fpce of time. The diaphragm may move when the ribs are at red, and confequently without the affidancc of the mufcles. which move the ribs; and this motion may be diffident to keep up the alternate dilatation and contraction of the thorax.

It is in a manner compofed of two mufcles, united at the upper part through their whole breadth, and feparated at the lower. It has two infertions below, both of them flat, and a little tendinous. The firft is in the upper edge of the fterhum, near the articulation of the clavicula; the o- ther in the clavicula, at a fmall diftxnce from the fternum. The fternal portion paffes foremoft, and covers the clavicular, both forming one body or belly, which run¬ ning in the fame oblique dire&ion to the apophyfis ma- ftoidjeus, is inferred in the upper and back-part of that procefs; over which it likewife fends off a very broad aponeurofis, which covers the fplenius, and is inferted in the os occipitis. SPLENIUS five MASTOID ALUS POSTERIOR. This is a flat, broach oblongmufcle, fituated oblique¬ ly, between the back-part of the ear, and the pofterior and lower part of the neck. It is partly fingle, afi^ partly made up of .two portions, one fuperior, the other inferior. The fuperior portion is fixed to the extremities of the three or four loweft fpinal apophyfes.of the neck, ind of the firft, or firft and fecond, of the back. It is likewife fixed to the edge of the inter-fpinal li¬ gaments of the other vertebras. From thence it runs up obliquely toward the maftoid apophyfis, partly under the upper extremity of the fter- no*maftoidseus, and is inferted in the upper part of that procefs, and along the neighbouring curve portion of the tranfverfe ridge of the os occipitis. The inferior portion of the fplenius is fixed to three or four fpinal apophyfes of the back, beginning by the fecond or third. From thence it runs up, being clofely united to the other portion, till it reaches the fuperior and lateral part of the neck, where it feparates from it, and is inferted in the tranfverfe apophyfes of the three or four fuperior vertebras of the neck, by the fame number of extremities, a little tendinous, which, however, are fometimes only two in number. COM PLEXUS. This is a pretty long and broad mufcle, lying on the pofterior lateral part of the neck, all the way to the oc¬ ciput. It is complicated, by reafon of the decuffations of its different portions ; from which it has its name. It is fixed below, by fmall Ihort tendons, to the tranf¬ verfe apophyfes of all the vertebras of the neck, except the firft, to which it is fixed only near the root of its tranfverfe apophyfis. From thence it runs up obliquely backward, croiling under the fplenius, and often commu¬ nicating with it, by fome fafciculi of fibres. It is afterwards inferted above, by a broad flefliy plane, in the pofterior part of the fuperior tranfverfe line of the os occipitis, near the crifta orfpine of that bone. Complexes Minor five Mastoid^us Lateralis. This is a long, (lender, narrow indented mufcle, ly- Part II. ing along all the fide of the neck, up to the ear, where it increafes a little in breadth. It is fixed, by one extremity, in all the tranfverfe a- pophyfes of the neck, except the firft, by the fame num¬ ber of digitations or branches, moftly flefliy, and difpofed obliquely. From thence it afcends, and having reached above the tranfverfe apophyfis of the firft vertebra, it forms a fmall broad plane, by which it is inferted in the pofterior part of the apophyfis maftoidasus. RECTUS MAJOR. This is a fmall, flat, Ihort mufcle, broad at the up¬ per part, and narrow at the lower, fituated obliquely be¬ tween the occiput and fecond vertebra of the neck. It is fixed below to one branch of the bifurcated fpine of the fecond vertebra of the neck, at a tuberofity which is often found at the tipper part of that branch. . From thence it afcends a little obliquely outward, and is infert¬ ed in the pofterior part of the inferior tranfverfe line of the os occipitis, at a fmall diftance from the crifta, being a little covered by the obliquus fuperior. RECTUS MINOR. This mufcle is like the former, and it has alfo a fmall infertion below, in the pofterior eminence of the firft ver¬ tebra.

OBLIQUUS SUPERIOR five MINOR. This mufcle is fituated laterally between the occiput and firft vertebra, being nearly of the fame figure with the two re£H. It is fixed to the end of the tranfverfe apophyfis of the firft vertebra; from whence it runs up¬ ward and very obliquely backward, and is inferted in the tranfverfe line of the os occipitis, almoft at an equal di¬ ftance from the crifta and maftoid apophyfis, between the re&us major and compleftus minor. OBLIQUUS INFERIOR five MAJOR. It is fituated in a contrary direftion to the obliquus fu¬ perior, between the firft and fecond vertebra of the neck, refembling that mufcle in every thing but the fize.

It is fixecf by one extremity, very near the middle of the fe¬ cond apophyfis, and, by the other, near the root or bafis of the firft; and therefore it is a mufcle of the neck, ra¬ ther than of the head. MUSCULI ACCESSORII. We fometimes meet with a fmall mufcle, fixed, by one end, to the extremity of the firft tranfverfe apophy¬ fis of the neck, near the infertions of the two obliqui, from whence, running up obliquely, it is again inferted behind the maftoid apophyfis. This mufcle is commonly thought to be a third fmall tranfverfalis on that, fide where it is found, but it feems rather to be an additional mufcle to the obliquus fuperior. Uses of the Mufcles which move the Head on the Trunk. The aftion of the fterno-maftoidaei is different, accor¬ ding as either both mufcles, or only one, of them, adts, Vol. I, No. io.- 3 O M Y. 217 and according to the different fituation of the head and trunk. When we keep the hqad and trunk ftreight, whether in Handing or fitting, both mufcles preferve the head in that pofture againft any force by which it would othcrv. ife be moved backward. One of thefe' mufcles adting alone, may have the fame ufe, if the force to pufti the head back be applied be¬ tween the anterior and lateral parts of it. They both ferve likewife to perform the rotations of the head, that is, to make it turn to either fide as on a pivot; and, in this cafe, when we turn the head to one fide, the fterno-maftokUeus on the other fide adts, and not that on the fame fide. They both ferve, in the next place, to bring the head near the thorax whence lie on the back, or bend back¬ ward in fitting. In this cafe, the fternum, being the fixed point,, muft remain immoveable; but as its connec¬ tion with'the firft rib, and the inflexibility of the carti¬ lage of that rib, are not always fufficient for this, the mufeuli redti of the abdomen rauft. lend their afliftance in great efforts. The two fplenii ferve to fupport the head in an eredt pofture, whether in (landing or fitting ; to moderate the flexion of the head forward, and to bring it back again to its natural'pofture. They ferve alternately to co-operate with either of the fterno-maftoidaei, for the rotation of the head: Thus when the right fterno-maftoidaeus turns the head, the left fplenius correfpobds with it by its upper part; while the fewer part at the fame time turns the vertebrae of the ' necki The complexi are afliftants to the .fplenii, to keep the head ftreight in fitting or (landing, to hinder it from in¬ clining forward, and to raife'it when inclined. The redli majores, and minores poftici, and obliqui fuperiores, - t urn the head a little backward on the firft vertebra of the neck. The redti majores contribute mod to this motion; and the minores feem likewife to hinder the articular membranes from being pinched between the bones in great motions. The redti majores and minores antici, and the two tranfverfales antici, move the head forward on the firft vertebra; and the redti minores, and tranfverfales breves, likewife defend the capfular ligaments. The obliqui inferiores or majores are true rotators of the head, by turning the firft vertebra upon the Odontoid apophyfis of the fecond; all which alternate motions the head follows, without being hindered in the motions for¬ ward and backward in any degree of rotation. Of the tranfverfales antici, the firft only move the head in the manner above mentioned; neither can they perform any other motions, their infertions being confi¬ ned to the os occipftis and firft vertebra. The tranfver¬ fales antici fecundi have no (hare in the particular motions ' of the head, but ought rather to be ranked among the mufcles which move the vertebrae of the neck. The complexi minores belong to the bead only by their fuperior portions ; the other portions belonging rather to the neck.

LONGUS COLLI, This vertebral mufcle is made up of feveral others, fituated laterally along the fore-fide of all the vertebras of the neek, and fome of the uaper vertebras of the back. •* It may be divided into two portions; one fuperior,. confiding of oblique converging mufcles^ and one infe¬ rior, compofed of oblique diverging mufcles. The fuperior portion is covered by the redtus anticus longus of the head. The mufcles, of which it confifts, are fixed below to all the tranfverfe apophyfes that He between the firft vertebra and the lad. From thence they run up obliquely, and are inferted in the anterior eminence of the firft vertebra, and in the bodies of the three following. The inferior portion appears almoft freight, and yet all the mufcles that comppfe h are diverging, or directed obliquely outward. They are fixed below to the anterior lateral part of the body of the fell vertebra of the neck, and of the firft three of the Back, and fometimes of more. From thence th,ey run upward, and a little ob¬ liquely outward, and are inferted near the tranfverfe a- pophyfes of all the vertebra of the neck, except the firft: and laft. TRANSVERSALIS COLLI MAJOR. This is a long thin rnufcle, placed along all the tranf¬ verfe apophyfes of the neck, and the four, five, or-fix upper apophyfes of the back, between the complexus major and minor. It is compofed of feveral fmall niufcular fafciculi, which run dire&ly from one or more tranfverfe apophy¬ fes, and are inferted fometimes in the apophyfis neareft to thefe, fometimes in others more remote, the feveral fafciculi crofting each other between the infertions of the two coniplexi, which are likewife crofted by them. Transversal is Gracilis fve Collaterals Colli. This is a long thin mufcle, refembKngthe tranfverfa- lis major in every thing but fize, and fituated on the fide of that mufcle. Semi-Spinalis fve Transverso-Sfinalis Colli. This name is given to all that flefny mafs which lies between the tranfverfe and fpinal apophyfes, from the fecond vertebra of the neck, to the middle of the back. It is compofed of feveral oblique converging muf- O M Y. Part II. cles, which may be divided into externa! and internal. The external are fixed below to the tranfverfe apo¬ phyfes of the fix, feven, eight, or nine upper vertebra of the back, by tendinous extremities, which, as they afeend, become flefliy, and mix with each other. Their fuperior infertions in the neck are fix in number, where¬ of the firft, which is tendinous, is in the feventh fpinal a- pophyfis; the reft, which are flefliy, are in the five next lpinal apophyfes. . The internal are ftiorter and more oblique than the ex¬ ternal, and partly covered by them. They affe fixed, by their lower extremities, to the tranfverfe apophyfes of the three of four 'upper vertebras of the back, and to the oblique apophyfes of the four or five lower vertebras of the heck; and, by their other extremities, they are inferted in the fix fpirtarl apophyfes of the neck. S P I NAL E S COLLI MI NOR E S. ThRse mufcles lie between the fix fpinal apophyfes of the neck, arid- betweeir the laft of the beck and firft of the back, being inferted in thefe apophyfes, by both ex¬ tremities, on one fide of the pofterior cervical ligament, which' parts them from thofe -on-life other fide, TRANSVERSALES COLLI MINORES. These are very fmall fhort mufcles, found in the in- terftices of fevdral tranfverfe apophyfes in which they are infected. They are likewife termed inter-iranfverjales. SACRO -LUMBARIS. This fe a long complex mufcle, narrow and thin at the upper part, broad and thick at the lower, reprefenr¬ ing a kind of fiat pyramid. It lies between the fpine and pofterior part of all the ribs, and along the back- pait of the regio lumbaris, all the way to the os facrum. Through all this fpace, it is clofely accompanied by thd longiffunus dorfi, which lies between it and the fpi¬ nal apophyfes of the vertebras, a narrow, fatty, or cel¬ lular line running between them. It is fixed below, by a broad thin tendinous aponeu- rofis, to the fuperior fpines of the os facrum, and to the neighbouring lateral parts of that bone; and, laftly, to the external labium of the pofterior part of the crifta of- fis iliujn> .all the way tojthe great tuberofity. From thence this mufcle runs upward, and a little la¬ terally, over all the regio lumbaris; the aponcurofis fending off, from its infid?, a mafs of fleftiy fibres, which are divided, from below upwards, into feveral large fafciculi, inferted in all the tranfverfe apophyfes of the loins. Afterwards it runs up obliquely over all the ribs, fometimes as high as the two or three loweft vertebras of the neck, fometimes higher, and fometimes it ends at the firft vertebra of the back. LONGISSIMUS DO RSI.

It covers the femi-fpinalis, or tranfverfo-fpinalis dorfi, and the femi-fpinalis lumborum. Its' upper part lies between the facro-lumbaris and tranf- verfalis colli. Its inferior infertions are partly by diftindt tendinous portions, and by a broad aponeurofis common to it with the facro-lumbaris; and partly by a large fafeiculi of flelhy fibres, whichj at firlt fight, feem to compofe one uniform mafs. It is fixed, by the long, flat, tendinous portions of different breadths, to the laft fpinal apophyfis of the back, to all thofe of the loins, and to one or two of the fuperior fpines of the os factum. Thefe portions lie at different distances from each other, but are all con- nedted by a thin aponeurofis fixed to their edges. From thence they run up obliquely, diverging from the apopbyfes ; and, beginning to be flefhy at their inner or anterior fides, they terminate above in fmall roundifh tendons, inferted in the extremities of the feven upper tranfverfe apophyfes of the back, and in the neighbour¬ ing-ligaments of all the true ribs. The other inferior infection wholly flefhy, is partly in the inner or forefide of the aponeurofis of the facro-lum¬ baris, and partly in the upper portion of the os facrum, being from thence continued to the great tuberofity of the os illium. From thence this uniform mafs of flefhy fibres runs up in a courfe almoft diredt, croffing the tendinous portions which are more oblique; and join the inferior fibres of the facro-lumbaris by large fafeiculi inferted in the tranf¬ verfe and oblique apophyfes of the vertebrae of the loins. The fibres of this portion go afterwards to the ribs, be¬ ing inferted by planes more or lefs flefhy, in the lower convex edge of all the falfe ribs, between the condyles or tuberohties and the angles. At the fixth or feventh vertebra of the back, one or more of' the tendinous portions often communicate with fome fafeiculi of the femi-fpinalis, or tranfverfo-fpinalis dorfi. SPINALIS DORSI MAJOR. This is a pretty long and^ flender mufcle, lying up¬ on the lateral part of the extremities of the fpinal apo¬ phyfis of the back. It is compefed of feveral mufcular fafeiculi of diffe¬ rent lengths, which, croffing each other, are inferted la¬ terally by fmall tendons in the fpinal apophyfes from the fecond, third, or fourth vertebra of the back; and fimetimes, though feldom, from the laft of the neck, or firft of the back, all the way to the firft or fecond verte¬ bra of the loins, with feveral irregular decuflations, which vary in different fubjedts. SPINALES DORSI MINORES. These mufcles are of two kinds. Some go laterally from the extremity of cne fpinal apophyfis to another; 2 I y being often mixed with the fhort fafeiculi of the fpinalis major. The reft lie diredtly between the extremities of two neighbouring fpinal apophyfes, being feparated from their fellows on the other fide by the fpinal ligament. They are fmaller and thinner than thofe of the neck, and are properly enough termed inter fpinales. TRANSVERSALES DORSI MINORES. Some, particular mufcles of this kind are found fixed to the extremities of the three loweft tranfverfe apophy¬ fes of the back. The reft are all in fome meafure conti¬ nuations of the tranfverfalis major. Semi-SpinalIs five Transverso-Spinalis Dorsi. This is a flefhy mafs, which, from all the fpinal and tranfverfe apophyfes of the back and loins, is extended into diftindt fafeiculi over the vertebrse themfelves. It is made up, like that of the neck, of feveral oblique converging vertebral mufcles, the uppermoft of which is fixed below to the third tranfverfe apophyfis of the back, and above to the firft fpinal apophyfis. The loweft is fixed below to the third tranfveife apophyfis of the loins, and above to the laft fpinal apophyfis of the back. They may be divided into external, which are firft difeovered; and internal, which lie immediately on the: vertebrae. The external, from the firft vertebra to the feventh, inclufively, appear to be longer than die inter-, nal, which are covered by them. Transverso-Spinalis Lumborum, Sacer VeteriBus. This mufcle is ccmpofed of feveral oblique converging of'tranfverfo-fpinal mufcles, in the fame manner as in the back and neck; and it lies between the fpinal and oblique apophyfes of die loins, reaching to the os fa- cfnm. ■ The loweft of thefe mufcles are fixed to die* fuperior • lateral parts of the os facrum, to the ligamentum facro- iliacum, and to the pofterior fuperior fpine of the os ili¬ um. The reft are fixed to the three loweft tranfverfe apophyfes, and t-o the four loweft oblique apophyfes of the loins, and to their lateral tuberofities. From thence they run up to all the fpinal apophyfes of thefe Vef tebne, the external, or thofe that appear fir ft, being longer than' the internal, which lie immediately on the vertebrae, e- fpecially toward the lower pajrt. Spinales & Transversales Lumborum. There are fome fafeiculi which run up from the fu¬ perior falfe fpines of die os facrum, to the lower fpinal apophyfes of the loins, which may be looked upon as fo many fpinales lumborum majores. There are likewife fome fpinales niinores between the fpinal apophyfes of the loins, and tranfverfales minores between the tranf¬ verfe apophyfes, which are fometimes of a confiderable breadth. - ' Quabratus ANATOM Y."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"22Q ANATOMY. Fart II. Quadratus Lumborum flVS Lumbaris Externus. This is a-fmall, oblong, flat mufcle, irregularly fquare, narrower at its upper than at its lower part, ly¬ ing along the fides of the vertebrae lumborum, between the lad falfe lib and the os ilium. It is fixed below to the external labium of almoft all the pofterior half of the crifta oflis ilium, to the ligamen- tum facro-iliacum, and a little to the os facrum, by a flefiiy plane, the fibres whereof run obliquely backward. From thence it runs up between the facro-lumbaris and pfoas, by both which it is partly hid, and is inferted in the extremities of all the tranfverfe apophyfes of the loins by oblique tendinous digitations. It is likewife fix¬ ed by a bread insertion in the twelfth rib, on the infide of the ligament that lies between it and the longiffimus dorfi, by which that rib is connected to the firft vertebra of the loins. . MUSCULI OS SIS COCCYGIS. -These are fmall, th : n , radiated mufcles, lying on the inner or concave fide of the os facrum, and neigh¬ bouring parts of the pelvis. They are four in number, two on each fide, whereof one- ■ is placed more forward-, the other more backward; for which reafon the firft may be termed coccygceus anterior, five ifchio-coccygceus ; the other coccygceus pofterior, five facro-coccygceus. The coccygceus anterior is fixed by a broad infertion in the anterior portion of the fmall tranfverfe ligament, at the upper part of the foramen ovale of the os innomi- natum, which is no more than a particular fold of the great tranfverfe ligament of the pelvis. From thence it runs between this great ligament and the mufculus obtu¬ rator internus, and, contrading in breadth, it is inferted in the lower part of the os coccygis. The coccygseus poflerior, or facro-coccygseus, is fix¬ ed to the inner or concave edge of the two firft vertebra of the os facrum, to the inner and lower edge of the li- gamentum facro-fciaticum, and to thb fpine of fjreos is¬ chium. From thence, contracting in breadth, it is in¬ ferted in the infide of the os coccygis above the former mufcle. PSOAS PARVUS. This is a long {lender mufcle, lying upon the pfoas major. It is fixed above by a Ihort tendon, fometimes to the laft tranfverfe Itpophyfis of the back, or higher; fometimes to the firft of the loins, and fometimes to both. From thence it runs down wholly flefhy, and more or lefs com¬ plex, on the great pfoas, in a direction a little oblique. Having reached the middle of the regio-lumbaris, or thereabouts, it forms a {lender flat tendon, which gra¬ dually increafing in breadths, like a thin aponeurofis, runs over the pfoas major and iliacus internus, at their union, and from thence down to the fymphyfis of the os pubis •and os ilium, and is inferted chiefly in the crifta of the os pubis, above the infertion of the pedineus, fometimes fending an aponeurotic lamina further down. Uses of the Mufcles 'which move the Vertebra. The fealeni, when they ad on each fide at the fame time, may alfift in bringing the neck forward, when we lean back in any refped. When thofe of one fide ad by themfelves, they make a lateral infledion, either of all the vertebra of the neck together, as in bending the middle of the neck; or of fome only, as in bending the lower part of the neck alone. The longi colli bring the neck forward by the lower part of their inferior portions. When one of them ads alone, or ads more than the other, this motion is more or lefs oblique. By the upper and greateft part of the loweft portion, they counterbalance the pofterior mufcles of thefe verte¬ bra, and hinder the neck from bending backward by the contradion of the fterno-maftoidsei, when, lying on the back, we.raife the head. The tranfverfalis major, tranfverfalis gracilis, and the little tranfverfales, ading on one fide, can have no other ule but to bend the neck laterally, and to hinder thefe inflexions when they ad on both fides. The femi-fpinales or tranfverfo-fpinales of both fides ading together, extend the neck upon the trunk, to keep it from inclining forward in Handing or fitting, and bend it backward. The femi-fpinales of one fide ading alone, produce the fame motions in an oblique diredion; and in that cafe they are aflifted by the inferior or vertebral portion of the neighbouring fplenius, under which they crofs. The femi-fpinales of both fides may likewife fervb for the rotation of the neck, but then the inferior fplenius of the oppofite fide muft aflift them. The inter-fpinales are alfiftants to the femi-fpinales in their mutual adion, and may likewife ferve to bring back the neck to its natural fituation, after fmall motions of rotation. The vertebra of the b3.clq are moved by being bent forward, by being extended or ftraightened, and by being infleded diredly or obliquely toward each fide. The motion of rotation has no place here, becaufe of the par¬ ticular ftrudureof the joints of thefe vertebra, and their connexion with the ribs, which likewife hinder the flexion backward. Flexion and extenfion are the two principal motions, and much more apparent than the others. The flexion of the back forward is not performed by any particular mufcles, but depends, both in Handing and fitting, on the relaxation of the mufcles that extend of ftraighten it, and keep it in that ered pofture. The two facro-lumbares maintain the back and the regio-lumbaris in their natural fituation when we ftand or fit; and by the relaxation of their fibres more or lefs* the trunk is proportionably bent forward by the weight of the head and breaft. They likewife extend the back and loins in all pofturcs, keep them ftcady and fixed un¬ der the weight of burdens, and bend the loins backward. The longiflimus dorfi is an afiiftant to the facro-lumba¬ ris, efpecially to the vertebral portion of that mufcle, which it helps very powerfully, both by the multiplicity and infertion of its fibres, in fuftaining the vertebra of the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"22 I Part II. A N A T the back and loins while extended, whether in fitting or (landing, and' in preventing their finking under the weight of the bod}', or of any additional burden. It alibis in performing and in counterbalancing all the mo¬ tions and inflexions of which thefe vertebrae, efpecially thofe of the loins, are capable in all poftures of the body. All the fpinales and tranfverfales of the back and loins belonging to the clafs of the vertebrales redli, the fpina¬ les to the middle mufcles, and the tranfverfales to the la¬ teral, their chief ufes mud be to affift, moderate, and maintain the motions of extenfion and lateral inflexion, whether fimple and direft, or oblique and compound. The femi-fpinales, or ..tranfverfo-fpinales, being ob¬ lique, converging, vertebral mufcles, are afliitants to the facro-lumbaris andlongiffimus dorfi, which they crofs on each fi<ie. The quadratus lumborum and pfoas parvus are of the fame ufe to the vertebrae of the loins, as the fcaleni to thofe of the neck. When both quadrati a<S, they keep the lumbar pillar ftraight, that is, fo as not to incline to either fide, and then they may alfift the redli of the ab¬ domen in the inflexions forward, and the fuperior por¬ tions of the obliqui in lateral inflexions. T hey may likewife ferve to fupport die haunches al¬ ternately in walking; and, in (landing on one foot, the quadratus of the oppofite fide may fupport the haunch of that fide. The pfoas parvus, ferves to fuftain.the pelvis much in the fame manner with the mufculi redti of the abdomen, in climbing, &c. The coccygaeus anterior may fuftaip the coccyx in asquilibrio, and hinder it from being bent backward, and from being luxated in great drains, as in the excre¬ tion of hardened faeces, &c. The coccygaeus poflerior can only ferve to replace the os coccygis when it has been forced backward, and to hinder it from being luxated backward. Sect. XVI. .The Muscles which move the Lower Jaw. MASSETER. This is a very thick flefny mufcle, fituated at the back part of the cheek. It feems to be made up of three portions, like a triceps, viz. one large and external por¬ tion, one middle, and one fmall and internal. The external portion is fixed by one tendinous extre¬ mity to all the inferior edge of the os malae, and a little to the neighbouring parts of the os maxillare and apo- phyfis zygomatica of the os temporum. From thence it runs down obliquely backward, being wholly fldhy, and is inferted by the other extremity in the rough impreflion on the outfide of the angle of the lower jaw. The middle portion is fixed by one end to the lower edge of the whole apophyfis zygomatica of the os tem¬ porum, and a very little to that of the os malae. From thence it runs down a little obliquely forward in an op¬ pofite direction to the fird portion, under which it crof- Vot. 1. Mo. io. • 3 O M Y. fes, and is inferted by its other extremity in the middle of the infide of the ramus of the lower jaw, near the in- fertion of the external portion with which it mixes. The third portion, which is lead and mod internal, is fixed by one extremity to the inner labium of the low r - er edge, and alfo to the infide of almofl all the zygoma¬ tic arch; and by the other, to the root or bafis of the coronoid apophyfis, where it mixes wholly flefiiy with the infertion of the middle portion. TEMPORALIS. T his is a broad flat mufcle, refembling the quadrant of a circle in figure. It occupies all the femi-circular or fe- mi-oval plane of the lateral region of the cranium, the temporal folia, and part of the zygomatic fofla. From this fituation it has its name. To conceive, judly the infcrtions of this mufcle, it mud be obferved, that the pericranium is divided into two laminae. The internal lamina, fometimes taken for a particular periodeum, covers immediately all the bony parts of this region. The external lamina feparated from the other, is fpread out like an aponeurotic or li¬ gamentary tent, by means of its adhefions to the ex¬ ternal angular apophyfis of the os frontis, to the pofle¬ rior edge of the fuperior apophyfis of the os malae, and to the upper edge of all the zygomatic arch, all the way to the root of the maftoid apophyfis. This mufcle is compofed of two'planes of fle(hy fibres, fixed to the two (ides of a tendinous plane nearly of the fame breadth with them, like a concealed middle tendon; as may be plainly feen by dividing the mufcle all the way to the bone, according to the diregion of its fbres. The body of the mufcle thus formed is inclofed between the two aponeurotic or ligamentary laminae in the follow¬ ing manner. The internal fle(hy plane is fixed, by a broad radia¬ ted infertion, to all the femi-circular plane of the cra¬ nium, by the intervention of the internal lamina of the periodeum. Thus it is fixed to the lateral external part of the os frontis, and to its external angular apophyfis, to the low¬ er part of the os parietale, to the fquamous portion of the os temporis, to the great ala or temporal apophyfis of the fphenoidal bone, by which the temporal fofla is formed; and a little to the backfide of the internal orbi¬ tary apophyfis of the os malae, which forms part of the zygomatic fdfla. PTERYGOIDtEUS MAJOR five INTERNUS. This mufcle lies on the infide of the lower jaw, al- moft in the fame manner as the mafleter does on the out¬ fide, being of the fame figure with that mufcle, only fmaller and narrower. ■ It is fixed above in the pterygoid cavity, chiefly to the infide of the external ala of the apophyfis ptery- goides. It runs down obliquely toward the angle of the lower jaw, and is inferted a little tendinous in the inequali- 3 K ties"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"222 A N A T ties on the infide thereof, oppofite to the infertion of the maffeter. PTERYGOID A 1 US MINOR five EXTERNUS. This is an oblong flelhy mufcle, much fmaller than the other, and fituated almoft horizontally between the outfide of the apophyfis pterygoides, and the condyloid apophyfis of the lower jaw, the fubjedt being eonfidered in an eredt pofture. It is fixed by one extremity to the outfide and edge of the outer ala of the pterygoid apophyfis, filling the fof- fula which is at the bafis ol this apophyfis, near the balls of the temporal apophyfis, of the fphenoidal bone. From thence it runs backward, and a little outward, into the void fpace between the two apophyfes of the low¬ er jay/, and is inferted anteriorly in the condyloid apo¬ phyfis, at a fmall foffula immediately under the inner angle of the condyle. It is alio fixed to the capfular li¬ gament of the joint. DIGASTRICUS. This is a fmall long mufcle, fituated laterally between the whole bafis of the jaw and the throat. It is fieilty at both extremities, and tendinous in the middle, as if it confifted of two fmall mufcles joined endwife by a ten¬ don, and from thence it is called digaflricus in Greek, and biventer in Latin. It is fixed by one fielhy extremity in the fulcus of the maftoid apophyfis. From thence it runs forward, in¬ clining towards the os hyoides, where the firft flelhy bo¬ dy ends in a round tendon, which is connected to the la¬ teral part and root of the cornua of that bone by a kind of aponeurotic ligament, and not by a vagina or pulley. Here the tendon is incurvated, and prefcntly ends in the other flefny body, which is fixed immediately above the internal labium of the bafis of the chin near the fym- phyfi3, in a fmall nnecjual depreflion. This infertion is broader than that of the other extremity. Uses of the Mufcles which move the Lower Jaw. The two tcmporales adting together, raife the lower jaw, prefs the teeth in that jaw again!! the upper teeth, and pull it back when it has been carried fo far forward as that the lower incifores get before the upper. They perform the laft motion by their nsoft pofterior portion, which paffes over the root of the zygomatic apophyfis, and the other motions by the co-operation of all their inufcular radii. The two maffeters ferve to raife the lower jaw, and to pulh the lower teeth again!! the upper, in which ufe they co-operate with the temporalcs. They likewife bring this jaw forward by their external and larged por¬ tion ; draw it back by their middle portion; and move it laterally by their fuperior portions acting alternately. By the co-operation of all the three portions, they prefs the lower teeth again!! the upper. Both pterygoidsei interni ferve to raife the lower jaw, to bring the lower teeth near the upper, and to move the jaw laterally, as in grinding the food. O M Y. Part II. The two pterygoidxi externi bring the lower jaw for¬ ward, in order to fet the lower incifores before the up¬ per; in which adtion they are antagonifts to the polfe- rior portion of the temporales, and the great portion of the maffeters. When one of them adts, it carries the chin obliquely forward, or turns it toward the other fides. This oblique motion is performed alternately by thefe two mufcles adhng fingly. The two digalirriei ferve to deprefs the lower jaw, and to open the mouth. The force of thefe mufcles is very confiderable, as may be fhewn by laying the elbow on a table, and lean¬ ing with the chin on the hand, while we endeavour at the fame time to deprefs the lower jaw; for as in that cafe this jaw cannot defeend, the digaftrici, by their in- fertions in the apophyfis maftoidxa, raife the upper jaw, by bending the head backward on the condyles of the lower jaw. Sect. XVII. The Muscles which move the Os Hyoides. MYLO-HYOIDiEU S. This is a broad, thin, penniform mufcle, fitpated tranfverfely between the internal lateral parts of the ba¬ lls of the lower jaw, and lying on the anterior portions of the two digaftric mufcles. It is made up of two equal flefiiy portions, one lying on the right fide, the other on the left, both in the fame plane, and joined to a fmall middle tendon, which is in¬ ferted anteriorly in the middle of the bafis of the os hy- oidcs, and from thence runs diredtly forward, diminifh- ing gradually ifi its courfe. Each portion is fixed, by flelhy fibres, to the interna! lateral part of the lower jaw, between the oblique pro¬ minent line and the bafis, under the firft four dentes mo- lares and canines. The anterior and greateft part of the other fibres of each portion run obliquely from be¬ fore backward, to the middle tendon, in which they are regularly fixed, the anterior fibres being the ftiorteft, and a fmall triangular void fpace being formed between them, and the fymphyfis of the chin. The pofterior fibres of each portion, which make Si- bout a fourth part of the whole, run likewife on each fide to the bafis of the os hyoides, and are inferted along the lower edge of its anterior or convex fide, and from thence a little upward. GENIO-HYOIDiEUS. This is a fmall and pretty long fleftiy mufcle, fituated between the fymphyfis of the chin and the os hyoides, clofe by its fellow. It is fixed, by its anterior extremity, to a rough, and fometimes prominent furface, on the inner or pofterior fide of the fymphyfis of the lower jaw, a little above the chin. From thence it runs backward, and is inferted anteriorly in the upper edge of the bafis ef the os hyoi¬ des."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Part II.

This is a fmall flelhy mufcle, lying obliquely between the apophyfis ftyloides and os hyoides. It is fixed laterally, by one extremity, to the root or balls of the apophyfis llyloides, and, by the other, to the os hyoides, at the place where the balls and cornu unite, and likewife to the cornu itfelf, from whence it has been called Jlylo-cerato-hyoidxus. OMOPLATO HYOIDAiUS five OMO-HY- OIDiEUS vulgo CORAOO-HYOID AiUS. This is a very long fmall mufcle, much narrower than the Iterno-hyoidaeus, and fituated obliquely on the fide of the neck or throat, between the Icapula and os hyoides. It is commonly fixed, by the lower extremity, to the fuperior colla of the fcapula, between the fmall notch and the angle, and fometimes very near the angle. From thence it paHVs over the coracoid apophyfis, ad¬ hering fometimes to it by a kind of aponeurofis, or mem¬ branous ligament, and from this adhelion the name of co~ raco-hyoidtfus was given it by fome who had not difco- vered its main infertion. It is likewife often fixed to the clavicula by ligamen¬ tary or flelhy fibres ; and has fometimts been leen tnfert- ed in the whole middle portion of that bone, being infe- parably united with the rterno-hyoidaens. ' Having paffed the clavicle, it is bent forward, and runs between the fterno-rnaltoklxus and internal jugular vein, the fmall middle tendon being fituated in this place. From thence it runs up to its infertion in the inferior la¬ teral part of the balls of the os hyoides, near the cornu, and infertion of the fierno-hyoidaeus, which it covers a little. Sterho-Hyoidjeus Jive Ste rko-Ole i do-Ky 01 us. This is a long, thin, flat mufcle, broader at the lower than at the upper part, and fituated, together with its fellow, on the fore-fide of the throat. It is fixed, by its lower extremity, in the fuperior and lateral part of the inner or potterior fide of the ilerpum, in the pofterior part of the fternal extremity of the cla¬ vicula, in the tranfverfe ligament which coftnefts thefe two bones, and in the inner or back-fide of the cartilage of the firft rib. All thefe other infertions are more con- fiderable than that in the fternum, which is fometimes fcarce perceivable. From thence it runs up on the fore-fide of the afpCra arteria, joined to its fellow' by a membrane, which forms a fort olHinea alba, and is inferted laterally in the lower edge of the bafis of the os hyoides. Uses of the Mufcles winch move the Os Hyoides. The mechanifm obfervedin the motions of the os hy- o m • y. 223 oides, as w'ell as in thole of the fcapula, is very particu* lar, and very different from what we find in all the other bones of the human body. All thefe bones have folid fulcra, on which they are either moved or kept fixed by the proper mufcles, after the manner of a lever or other- wife ; whereas the os hyoides is merely fufpended, ha¬ ving nothing to fix it but thefe very mufcles which move it in different manners. The mylo-hyoidseus reprefents a moveable floor or bed, which fultains the tongue with its mufcles and glands, and forms the bottom of the cavity of the mouth. When the two portions of this mufcle aft together, they draw the os hyoides a little forward, and fix it in that fitua- tion, railing the whole tongue at the fame time, and compreffing the glandulse fub-lingualcs. If one lateral portion afts more thah the other, it puts the os hyoides in an oblique fituation, and in a condition to ferve as a fixed point for the motions of the tongue. The genio hypidei pull the os hyoides much more for¬ ward than the mylo-hyoideus ; and as they are very nar¬ row, and clofely united together, there feems to be very little occafion for one of them to aft without the other. The fiylo-hyoidsei move the os hyoides upward and backward in a middle direftion, between thofe in which they lie; and they draw it more upward and backward when they aft freely; that is, without\"being checked or confined by other mafcles, in the manner which we fliall fee hereafter. When one afts more than the other, the bone is moved obliquely. The omo'hyoktei, or coraco-hyoidsei, aft as the llylo- byoid&i, in a middle direftion between the oblique direc¬ tions in W'hjcb they lie, and draw, the os hyoides down¬ ward and backward, when they are not counterbalanced by the ftylo-hyoiacei. When one afts more than the o- ther, the bone is drawn obliquely to the right or left hand. When thefe mufcles and the ftylo-byoidasi aft toge¬ ther, the os hyoides is drawn backward by a direft mo¬ tion compounded of four oblique motions. This com¬ pound motion is direfted more upward or more laterally, according to the degree of aftion of the ftylo-hyoidsei, or omo-hyoidaci, or of any one mufcle of each pair ; and in all thefe motions the four mufeles are counterbalanced by the genio-hyoidsei. * ' The llerno-hyoidsei draw the os hyoides direftly dow n¬ ward, and ferve tp countei balance the different motions of the ftylo-hyoidasi, omo-hyoidad, and genio-hyoideei. They may, in fome cafes, be aflifted by the tlerno-thy- roidafi, and thyro-hyoidsei, as we ill all fee hereafter. According to the method commonly obferved in com¬ plete treatifes of myology, the following mufcles remain to be deferibed, viz. T he mufcles of the forehead, occiput, palpebrae, eye, external ear, nofe, lips, tongue, uvula, duftus Euilacbianus, pharynx, larynx, parts of generation, anus, and bladder; and to thefe we ought even to add the heart, as Mr Cowper has done in the late editiqn of his Myotomy. But the defeription of thefe ■ will he better undeiitood when v'e treat of the parts to which they belong. See Part VI. E X P L A-"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"224 ANA M Y. Part II.

The aorta di[tributes the blood to all the parts of the body, for the nourilhment of the parts, and for the fecre- tion of different fluids. 3 L The 3"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"226 The arteria pulmonalis carries the venal blood through all the capillary veffels of the lungs. Both thefe great or general arteries are fubdivided in¬ to feveial branches, and into a great number of ramifi¬ cations. In this part, we Ihall defcribe the diftributions of the aorta, leaving the pulmonary artery to the parti¬ cular hiftory of the lungs. See Part VI. The bafis of the heart being very much inclined to the fight fide' And turned a little backward, the aorta goes out from it in a direct couffe, nearly over-agairrft the fourth vertebra of the back. Its courfe is diredt with refpedi to the heart; but with refpedl to all the reft of the body, it afcends obliquely from the left to the right hand, and from before backward. Soon after this, it bends obliquely from the right hand to the left, and from before backward, reaching as high as the fecond vertebra of the back; from whence it runs down again in the fame direction, forming an ob¬ lique arch. The middle of this arch is almoft oppofite to the right fide or edge of the fuperior portion of the fternum, between the cartilaginous extremities or fternal .articulations of the firlt two ribs. From thence the aorta defcends in a dire eft courfe a- long the anterior part of the vertebrae, all the way to the -os facrum,. lying a little toward the left hand; and there it terminates in two fubordinate or collateral trunks, cal¬ led arteriae iliacas. The aorta is by anatomifts generally divided into the aorta afcendens and aorta defcendcns, though both are but one and the fame trunk. It is termed afcendens, from where it leaves the heart to the extremity of the great curvature or arch. The remaining part of this trunk from the arch to the os facrum or bifurcation, al¬ ready mentioned, is named defcendens . The aorta defcendens is further divided into the fupe¬ rior and inferior portions ; the firft taking in all that lies above the diaphragm ; the other all that lies between the diaphragm and the bifurcation. The aorta afcendens is chiefly diftributed to part of .the thorax, to the head and upper extremities. The iiiperior portion of the aorta defcendens furnifhes the reft of the thorax; the inferior portion furnifhes the abdo¬ men and lower extremities. The great trunk of the aorta, through its whole length, fends ofF immediately feveral branches, which are after¬ wards differently ramified; and thefe arterial branches may be looked upon as fo many trunks with refpedt to the other ramifications, which again may be confidered as fmall trunks with regard to the ramifications that they fend off. The branches which go out immediately from the trunk of the aorta, may be termed original or capital branches; and of thefe fome are large and others very fmall. The large capital branches of the aorta are thefe: two arteriae fubclavise, two carotides, one caelfaca, one mefenterica fuperior, two renales, formerly termed e- mulgents, one mefenterica inferior, and two iliacae. The fmall capital branches are chiefly the arteriae co- ronarias cordis, bronchiales, oefophagaeae, intercoftales, dia- phragmaticae inferiores, fpermatic®, lumbares, and facrae. Part Ilf. Thefe capital branches or arteries are for the moft part difpofed in pairs; there being none in odd numbers but the caeliaca, the two menfentericae, fome of the oefopha- gaeae, the bronchialis, and fometimes the facrae. The aorta gives rife to two fmall arteries, called co- ronariae cordis, which go to the heart and its auricles; one of which is fituated anteriorly, the other pofteriorly, and fometimes they are three in number. From the upper part of the arch or curvature, the a- orta fends out commonly three, fometimes four large ca¬ pital branches, 'their origins being very near each other. When there are four, the two middle branches are term¬ ed arteriae carotides; the ether two, fubclaviae; and both are diftingUiftied into right and left. When there are but three branches, which is oftepeft the cafe, the firlt is a Ihort trunk, common to the right fubclavian and. carotid, the fecond is the left fubclavian, and the third the left carotid. r The origin of the left fubclavian terminates the aorta afcendens. > , The carotid arteries run up directly to the head, each of them being firft divided into two, ope external, the o- ther internal. The external artery goes chiefly to the outer patts .of the Fead and dura mater, or firft covering of the brain. The internal enters the cranium, through the bony canal of the os petrofum ; and is diftributed through the brain by a great number of ramifications. The fubclavian arteries feparate laterally, and almoft- tranfverfely, each toward that fide on which it lies, be¬ hind and under the clavicular, from whence they have .their name. The fubclavian on each fide terminates at the upper edge of the firft rib, between the lower infertions of the firft fealenus mufcl?; and there, as it goes out of the tho¬ rax, takes the name of arteria axillaris. During this courfe of the fubclavian artery, feveral arteries arife from it, viz the; mammaria interna* me- diaftina, pericardia, diaphragmatic* minor five fuperior, .thymica and tracheahs. The thymica and trachealis on each fide are, in fame iubje&s, only branches of one fmall trunk which fpring from the common trunk of the right fubclavian and ca¬ rotid. They are generally fmall arteries which run fometimes feparate, and fometimes partly feparate and partly joined. The fubclavian fends off likewife the mammaria inter¬ na, vertebrales, cervicales, and fometimes feveral of the upper intercoftales. The axillary artery, which is only a continuation of the fubclavian from where it goes out of the thorax to the axilla, detaches chiefly the mammaria externa, or thoracica fuperior, thoracica inferior, fcapulares externae, fcapularis interna, humeralis or mufcularis, <bc. After¬ wards it is continued by different ramificatiqns, and un¬ der different names, over the whole arm, all the way to the ends of the fingers. The fuperior portion of the aorta defcendens gives off the arteriae bronchiales, which arife fometimes by a fmall common trunk, fometimes feparate, and fometimes do pot pome immediately from the aorta. It next fends off the oefophagaex, which may be looked upon as mediaftinx pofteriores; ANATOMY."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Part III. ANA pofteriores; and then the intercoftales from its pofte- rior part, which in fome fubjedts come ail from this por¬ tion of the aorta, in others only the loweft eight or nine. • • . The inferior portion of the defcending aorta, as it paf¬ fes through the diaphragm, gives off the diaphragm at ica: inferiores, or phrenicas; afterwards it fends off feverai branches,' anteriorly, pofteriorly, and laterally. The anterior branches are the casliaca, which fupplies the Itomach, liver, fpleen, pancreas, <bc. the mefente- rica fuperior, which goes chiefly to the mefentery, to the fmall inteftines, and that part of the great fnteilines which lies on the right fide of the abdomen; the fne- fenterica inferior, which goes to the great inteftines on the left fide, and produces the haemorrhoidalis interna; and laftly, the right and left arteriae fpermaticae. The pofterior branches are the arterke lumbares, of .which there are feverai pairs, and the facrse, which do not always come from the trunk of the aorta. The lateral branches are the c'apfulares and adipofe, the origin of which often varies; the renales, formerly termed emulgents; and the iiiacae, which terminate the aorta by the bifurcation already mentioned. - The iliac artery on each' fide is commonly divided into the external or anterior, and internal or pofterior. The internal iliaca is likewife named arteria hypoga- ftrica; and its ramifications are diftributed to the vifcera contained in the pelvis, and to the neighbouring parts, both internal and external. The iliaca externa, which is the true continuation of the iliac trunk, goes on to the inguen, and then out of the abdomen, under the ligamentum Fullopii; having firft detached the epigaftrica, which goes to the mufeuli ab¬ dominis redti. Having quitted the abdomen, it com¬ mences arteria cruralis, which runs down upon the thigh, and is diftributed by rqany branches and ramification? to all the lower extremity. ' We (hall now go on to examine particularly all the ca¬ pital or original branches of the aorta, from their origin, to the entry of them and of their ramifications into all parts of the body. i The Card iac? or coronary arteries of the heart arife from the aorta immediately on its leaving the heart. They are two in number, and go out Dear the two fides of the pulmonary artery, which having firft furrounded, they afterwards run upon the bafis of the heart in form of a kind of crown, or garland, from whence they are called coronarhe; and then purftie the fuperficial traces of the union of the two ventricles, from the bafis of the heart to the apex, and are afterwards loft in the fubftance of the heart. • The Carotid arteries are two in number, one called the right carotid, the other the left. They arife near each other, from the curvature of the aorta, the left im¬ mediately, the right moil commonly from the trunk of the fubclavia on the fame fide. They run upon each fide of the trachea arteria, be¬ tween it and the internal jugular vein, as high as the la¬ rynx, without any ramification. Each of t'nefe trunks is afterwards ramified in the following manner. The trunk having reached as high as the larynx, is T O M Y. 227 divided into two large branches or particular carotids, one named external, the other internal , becaufe the firft goes chiefly to the external parts of the head, the fecond enters the cranium, and is diftributed to the brain. The external carotid is anterior, the internal pofteri¬ or ; and the external is even fituated more inward, and nearer the larynx, than the other. The external carotid is the fmalleft. It runs infenfi- bly outward, between the external angle of the lower jaw, and the parotid gland, which it fupplies as it paf- Jes. Afterwards it afeends on the fore-fide of the ear, and ends in the temples. In this courfe it fends off feverai branches, which may well enough be divided into anterior or internal, and po* fterior or external; and the principal branches of each kind are thefe: The firft anterior or internal branch goes out from the very origin of the carotid on the infide ; and having pre- fently afterward, taken a little turn, and fent off branches to the jugular glands near it, to the fat and fkin, it runs tranfverfely, and is diftributed to the glandulae thyroi- daiae, and to the mufcles and other parts of the larynx: It likewife fends fome branches to the pharynx and muf¬ cles of the os hyoides. The fecond anterior branch paffes over the neareft cor¬ nu of the os hyoides, to the mufcles of that bone and the tongue, and to the glandulas fublinguales ; afterwards pafling before the cornu of the os hyoides, it lofes itfelf in the tongue, from whence it has been called arteria fublingualis. The third branch, or arteria maxillaris inferior, goes to the maxillary gland, to the ftyloid and maftoid mul- cles, to the parotid and fublingual glands, to the muf¬ cles of the pharynx, and to the fmall flexors of the head. The'fourth branch, arteria maxillaris externa, paffes anteriorly on the maffeter mufcle, and middle of the low¬ er jaw, near the chin. Afterwards it runs under the mufculus triangularis labiorum, which it fupplies as well as the buccinator and the quadratus menti. It fends of a particular branch, very much contorted, which divides at the angular commiffure of the lips, and running in the fame manner along the fuperior and infe¬ rior portions of the mufculus orbicularis, it communicates on both fides with its fellow, and thereby forms a kind of arteria eoronaria labiorum. Afterwards it afeends towards the nares, and is diftri¬ buted to the mufcles, cartilages, and other parts of the nofe, fending down fome twigs which communicate with the coronary artery of the lips. Laftly, it reaches the great angle of the eye, and is ramified and loft on the mufculus orbicularis palpebrarum, fuperciliaris, and fron¬ talis. Through all this courfe,. it is named arteria an- gularis. The fifth branch, maxillaris interna; arifes over-againft the condyle of the lower jaw. It paffes behind the con¬ dyle, and having given off a twig among the mufeuli pterygoidaei, it is divided into three principal branches. T lie firft branch, or fpLcno-maxiliaris, goss through the inferior orbitary, or fphenomaxillary fiffure, to the orbit, after having fupplied the mufeuli periftaphylim, and"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"2 23 ANATOMY. Part lit. and the glandulous. membrane oF the poflerior nares, through the foramen fpheno-palatinum.. It is distributed interiorly and laterally to the parts contained in the orbit, and detaches a fmall fubaltern branch through the extremity of the fuperior orbitary, or fphenoidal fiilure, which enters the cranium, and is fpent upon the dura mater. It fends oiF likewife another fubaltern branch, which paiTes through the. potlerior opening of the orbitary ca¬ nal, and having furnifhed the maxillary finus and the teeth, goes out by the inferior orbitary hole, and on the cheek communicates with the angular artery. Tlie fecond branch runs through the canal of the low¬ er jaw, and being diilributed to the alveoli and teeth, goes out at the hole near the chin, and lofes itfelf in the neighbouring mufclcs. ; The third branch runs up between the internal and ex¬ ternal carotids, pafles through the foramen fpinale of the fphenoidal bone, and is diilributed to the dura mater by feveral ramifications. The lixth anterior or internal branch, which is very fmall, is fpent on the mufculus mafleter. The firft external or pollerior branch is named arteria occipitalis. It pafles obliquely before the internal jugu¬ lar vein, and having twigs to the mufculus ftylo-hyoidseus, ftylo-gloflus, and digaflricus, it runs between the llyloid and malloid apophyfes, along the malloid groove, and goes to the mufcles and integuments which cover the os occipitis, turning feveral times in an undulating manner, as it afeends backwards. The fecond external branch fpreads itfelf on the out¬ ward ear, by a great many fmall twigs on each fide, fe- veral of which run inward, and furnilh the cartilages, meatus auditorius, flein of the tympanum, and internal ear. The trunk of the external carotid afeends afterward above the zygoma, palling between the angle of the low¬ er jaw and parotid gland, and forms the temporal artery, which divides into an anterior, middle, and pollerior branch. The anterior branch of the temporal artery goes to the mufculus frontalis, communicates with the arteria angularis, and fometimes gives off a very fmall artery, which pierces the internal apophyfis of the os mate all the way to the orbit. The middle branch goes partly to the mufculus frontalis, partly to the occipitalis. The po¬ llerior branch goes to the occiput, and communicates with the arteria occipitalis. All thefe branches likewife fur¬ nilh the integuments. , The internal carotid artery, leaving the general trunk, is at firll a little incurvated, appearing as if either it were the only branch of that trunk, or a branch of the trunk of the external carotid. It is fituated a little more backward than the carotis externa, and generally runs up, without any ramification, as high as the lower orifice of the great canal of the apo¬ phyfis petrofa of the os temporis. It enters this orifice direftly from below upward. At the end of this canal it is again incurvated from below upward, and enters the cranium through a notch of the fphenoidal bone. Then it bends from behind for¬ ward, and makes a third angle on the fide of the fella fphenoidalis; and again a fourth, under the clinoid apo¬ phyfis of that fella. As it leaves the bony canal to enter the cranium, it fends off a branch through the fphenoidal fiffure to the orbit and eye, and foon afterwards another through the foramen opticum. Afterwards the internal carotid runs under the bafis of the brain, to the fide of the infundibulum, where it is at a fmall diftance from the internal carotid of the other fide, and there it commonly divides into two principal branches, one anterior, and one pollerior. The anterior Branch runs forward under the brain, firft feparating from that on the other fide, then coming nearer again, it unites with it by an anallomofis, or com¬ munication, in the interlace between the olfadtory nerves. Afterwards having fent off fome fmall arteries, which accompany thefe nerves, it leaves its fellow, and divides into two or three. The firft of thefe branches goes to the anterior lobe of the brain; the fecond, which is fometimes double; is inverted on the corpus callofum, to which it gives fome ramifications, as alfo to the falx of the dura mater, and middle lobe of the brain. The third gods to the po^- fterior lobe of the brain. The pollerior branch communicates firft of all with the vertebral artery of the fame fide, and then divides into feveral rami, which run between the fuperncial cir¬ cumvolutions of the brain, and are ramified in many dif¬ ferent directions on and between thefe circumvolutions, all the way to the bottom of the fulci. All thefe ramifications are covered by the pia mater, in the duplicature of which they are diilributed, and form capillary reticular textures in great numbers ; and after¬ wards are loft in the inner fubftance of the brain. The Subclavian arteries are two in number, one right, the other left; and they arife from the arch of the aorta, on each fide of the left carotid, which commonly lies in the middle between them ; but when both caro¬ tids go out feparately, they both lie between the fub^ cl a vise. The right fubclavian is larger at the beginning than the left, when it produces the fight carotid; its orrgiA is likewife more anterior and higher, becaufe of the ob¬ liquity of the arch of the aorta. Both of them are di* ftributed much in the fame manner, and therefore the defeription of one may likewife be applied to the other; The right fubclavian, the longeft of the two, gives off, firft of all, fmall arteries to the mediaftinum, thy¬ mus, pericardium, afpera arteria, <&c. which are named mediajlinuvi . thymic*, pericardia, and tracheales. Afterward this right fubclavian, at about? a finger’s breadth from its origin, often produces the common ca¬ rotid of the fame fide; and at a fmall finger’s breadth from the carotid, it gives off commonly three confider- able branches, viz. the mammaria interna, cervicalis, and vertebralis, and fometimes an intercoftal artery, which goes to the firft ribs, called intercoftalis fuperior. The arteria thymica communicates with the mammaria interna, and fometimes arifes from the anterior middle part of the common trunk of the fubclavian and carotid. r Tl-r"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Part III. ANA The thymus receives likewife fome rami from the mam- maria interna, and intercoftalis fuperior. The pericardia arifes much in the fame manner with the thymica, and runs down upon the pericardium, all the way to the diaphragm, to which it fends fome Imall ramifications. 'The medialtina arifes fometimes immediately after the thymica, and is diftributed principally to the media- ftinum. The trachealis, which may likewife be named guttu- ralis inferior, runs up from the fubclavia, in a winding courfe, along the afpera arteria, to the glandulae thyroi- daeas and larynx, detaching fmall arteries to both fides, one of which runs to the upper part of the fcapula. The internal mammary artery comes from the anterior and lower fide pf the fubclavia, near the middle of the clavicula, and runs down, for about a finger’s breadth, behind the cartilages of the true ribs, an inch diftant from the fternum. In its paflage, it fends rami to the thymus, mediafti- mim, pericardium, pleura, and intercoftal mufcles. It likewife detaches other branches through thefe mufcles, and between the cartilages of the ribs, to the peftoralis major, and other neighbouring mufcular portions ; to the mammas, membrana adipofa, and ikin. Afterwards it goes out at the thorax, on one fide of the appendix enfiformis, and is loft in the mufculus ab¬ dominis reftus, a little below its upper part. The cervical artery arifes from the upper fide of the fubclavian, and is prefently afterward divided into two, which come out, fometimes feparately, fometimes by a fmall common trunk. The largeft of thefe two arteries is anterior, the other pofterior. The anterior cervicalis, running behind the carotid of the fame fide, is diftributed to the mufculus coraco-hyoi- dseus, maftoidaeus, cutaneus, ftdrno-hyoidaeus, and fter- no-thyroidfeus ; to the jugular glands, the afpera ar¬ teria, the mufcles of the pharynx, bronchia, cefopha- gus; and to the anterior mufcles which move the neck and head. The pofterior cervicalis arifes fometimes a little after the vertebralis, and fometimes from that artery. It paf- fes under the tranfverfe apophyfis of the laft vertebra of the neck, and fometimes through a particular hole in that apophyfis ; and from thence runs up backward in a wind¬ ing courfe, on the vertebral mufcles of the neck, and then returns in the fame mannef. The vertebral artery goes' out from the pofterior and ■ upper fide of the fubclavian, almoft oppcfite to the mam- maria interna and cervicalis. It runs up through all the holes in the tranfverfe apophyfes of the vertebrae of the neck, >nd, in its paflage, fends off little twigs, through the lateral notches of thefe vertebrae, to the medulla fpi- nalis and its coverings. It alfo gives arteries to the ver¬ tebral mufcles, and to other mufcles near them. It fends off a fmall branch, which is ramified on the outer and pofterior parts of the occiput, and communi¬ cates with the cervical and occipital arteries. Having af¬ terwards reached the great foramen of the os occipitis, it enters the cranium, and pierces the dura mater. As foon as it enters the cranium, it fends fe.veral fmall Vol-; I. No. io. 3 T O M Y. 229 ramifications to the back-part of the medulla oblongata, and to the corpora olivaria and pyramidalia, which are likewife lpread on the back fides of the fourth ventricle of the brain, and form the plexus choroides of the ce¬ rebellum. Afterwards it advances on the apophyfis bafilaris of the os occipitis, inclining, by fmall degrees, toward the ver¬ tebral artery of the other fide, all the way to the extre¬ mity of that apophyfis, where they both join in one com? mon trunk. The arteria bafilaris runs forward under the great tranlverfe protuberance of the medulla oblongata, to which it gives ramifications, as well as to the neighbour¬ ing parts of the medulla. The fpinal arteries are two in number, one anterior, and one pofterior; both produced by both vertebrales,. each of which, as foon as it enters the cranium, fends out a fmall branch, by the union of which the pofterior fpinalis is formed. Afterwards the vertebrales advancing on the apophyfis bafilaris, or production of the occipital bone, detach backward two other fmall branches, which likewife meet, and, by their union, form the fpinalis an¬ terior. Thefe fpinal arteries run down on the fore and back fides of the medulla fpinalis, and, by fmall tranf- verfe ramifications, communicate with thofe which the intercoftal and lumbar arteries fend to the fame part. The internal auditory artery goes off from each fide of the arteria bafilaris, to the organ of hearing, accompa? nying the auditory nerve, having firft furnifhed feveral fmall twigs to the membrana arachnoides. The pofterior meningaea arifes from the fame trunk with the auditoria interna, and goes to the back-part of the dura mater, on the occipital and temporal bones, and fupplies the neighbouring lobes of the brain. When the fuperior intercoftal artery does not go ou$ from the trunk of die aorta defeendens, it commonly a- rifes from the lower fide of the fubclavian, and runs down on the infide of the two, three, or four uppermoft true ribs, near their heads, and fends off, under each rib, a branch, which runs along the lower edge, and fupplies th$ intercoftal mufcles and neighbouring parts of the pleura, Thefe branches, or particular intercoftal arteries, com¬ municate with each other at different diftances by fmall rami, which run upward and downward from one to the other, on the intercoftal mufcles. t The dudhis arteriofus, which is found only in the foe¬ tus and in very young children, arifes from the aorta de¬ feendens, immediately below the left fubclavian artery. In adults, this dudt is fhrunk up and clofed, and appears only like a fliort ligament adhering by one end to the a- orta, and by the other to the pulmonary artery, fo that in reality it deferves-no other name than that of ligamen- tum arteriofum. The bronchial art n : go fometimes from the fore-fide of the fuperior defee iding aorta, fometimes from the firft intercoftal, and fo . . s from the arteria cefophagasa. Sometimes they an: : parately from each fide, to goto each lung, and fometimes by a fmall common trunk, which afterwards Separates towards the right and left hand, at the bifurcation of the afpera arteria, and ac¬ company the ramifications of the bronchia. 3 M \" ' ' The"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"230 ANA The bronchialis gives a frnall branch to the neighbour¬ ing auricle of the heart, which communicates with the arteria coronaria. The oefophagajse are generally two or three in number, fometimes but one. They arife anteriorly from the aorta defcendens, and are diftributed to the oefophagus, &c. The inferior intercoftals are commonly feven or eight on each fide, and fometimes ten, when the fuperior in¬ tercoftals .arife likewife from the aorta defcendens; in which cafe thefe run obliquely upward. They arife along the back-fide of the defcending aorta in pairs, all the way to the diaphragm, and run tranf- verfely towards each fide, on the bodies of the vertebrae. Thofe on the right fide pafs behind the vena azygos; and afterwards they all run to the intercoftal mufcles, along the lower edge of the ribs, all the way to the fternum, or near it. They fend branches to the pleura, to the vertebral Snufcles, to thofe mufcles which lie on the outfides of the ribs, and to the upper portions of the mufcles of the ab¬ domen • and they communicate with the arteriae epiga- frricae and lumbares. Before they take their courfe along the ribs, each of them detaches one branch between the tranfverfe apo- phyfes on both fides, to the vertebral mufcles, and ano¬ ther which enters the great canal of the fpina dorfi. Afterwards each intercoftal artery having reached the middle of the rib, or a little more, divides into two prim cipal branches, one internal, the other external. Soon after this divifion, the arteries that run upon the falfe ribs, feparate a little from them, being gradually bent downward one after another, and are fpread upon the abdominal mufcles. The fubclavian artery having left the thorax imme¬ diately above the firft rib, in the interftice left between the portions of the fealenus, there receives the name of axillaris , becaufe it piaffes under the ax.illa, In this courfe it gives off, from its infide, a frnall branch to the infide of the firft rib ; and afterwards four or five principal brandies, viz. the thoracica fuperior, or mammaria externa, thoracica inferior, mufcularis, or fcapularis externa, fcapularis interna, and humeralis. The fuperior thoracica, or external mammary artery, runs down, in a winding courfe, on the lateral parts of the thorax, and croffes the ribs. It gives branches to the two pedtoral mufcles, to the mamma, mufculus fub- clavius, ferratus major, latifiimus dorfi, and to the upper portions of the coraco-brachialis and biceps. The inferior thoracic artery runs along the inferior cofta of the fcapula, to the mufculus fubfcapularis, teres major and minor, infra-fpinatus, latifiimus dorfi, ferratus major, and the neighbouring intercoftal mufcles, commu¬ nicating with the arterix fcapulares. The external fcapulary artery pafles through the notch in the fuperior cofta of the fcapula, to the mufculus fu- pra-fpinatus and infra-fpinatus, teres major and minor, and to the articulation of the fcapula with the os humeri. The internal fcapularis arifes from the axillary artery near the axilla, and runs backward, to be diftributed to the fubfcapularis, giving branches to the ferratus major, to the axillary glands, and to the teres major.. T O M Y. PartllT. The humeral artery arifes from the lower and fore-fide of the axillaris, and runs backward between the head of the os humeri and teres major, furrounding the articula¬ tion, till it reaches the pofterior part of the deltoides, to which it is diftributed. During this courfe, it gives feveral branches to the fu¬ perior portions of the anconaei, to the capfular ligament of the joint of the Ihoulder., and to the os humeri itfelf, through feveral holes immediately below the great tube- rofity of the head of that bone. Oppofite to the origin of this humeral artery, the ax¬ illaris fends off another frnall branch, which runs in a contrary direction, between the head of the os humeri, and the common upper part of the biceps and coraco,- brachialis; and having given branches to the vagina and channel of the biceps, and to the periofteum, afterwards joins the principal humeralis. The axillary artery haying given off thefe branches, pafles immediately behind the tendon of the pe&oralis major, where it changes its former name for that of ar¬ teria brachialis. It runs down on the infide of the arm, over the mufculus coraco-brachialis and anconaeus inter- nus, and along the inner edge of the biceps,, behind the vena bafilica, giving frnall branches on both fides to the neighbouring mufcles, to the periofteum, and to the bone. Between the axilla and middle of the arm, it is co¬ vered only by the fkin and fat; but afterwards it is hid under the biceps, and runs obliquely forward as it de- feends; being at fome diftance from the internal con¬ dyle, but it does not reach the middle of the fold of the arm. Between the axilla and this place, it fends off many branches to the infra-fpinatus, teres major and minor, fubfcapularis, fatiflimus dorfi, ferratus major, and other neighbouring mufcles, to the common integuments, and even to the nerves. Below the fold of the arm, it di¬ vides into two principal branches, one palled arteria cu- bitalis, the other radialis . From its upper and inner part, it fends off a particu¬ lar branch, which runs obliquely downward and back¬ ward over the anconaei, and then turns forward agaiiv, near the external condyle, where it communicates with a branch of the arteria radialis. Immediately below the infertion of the teres major, it gives off another branch, which runs from within out¬ wards, and from behind forward, round the os humeri; and defeends obliquely forward, between the mufculus brachirrus, and anconseus externus, to both which it is diftributed in its paffage. Having afterwards reached the external condyle, it unites with the branch laft men¬ tioned, and likewife communicates with a branch of the arteries of the fore-arm, fo that there is here a triple a- naftomofis. About the breadth of a finger below this fecond branch, the brachial artery fends off a third, which runs down towards the internal condyle, and communicates with other branches of the arteries of the fore-arm, as we (hall fee hereafter. About the middle of the arm, or a little lower, much about the place where the brachial artery begins to be covered by the bic:ps, it feuds off a branch, which is. diftributed"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Part III. ANA diftributed to the' perroftetfm, and penetrates 'the bone, between the mufculus brachiaeus and anconaeus internus. About an inch lower, it gives ofF another branch, which having furnifhed ramifications to the anconaeus in- ternus, runs over the inner condyle, and likewife com¬ municates with branches of the arteries of the fore-arm. Having got below the middle of the arm, the brachial artery detaches another branch, which runs behind the inner condyle, in company with a confiderable nerve; and having palled over the mufcles inferted in this con¬ dyle, it communicates with that branch of the cubital artery which encompafies the fold of the arm. A little lower, it fometimes fends out another branch, which paffbs on the fore-fide of the inner condyle, and then communicates with a branch which runs up from the cubital artery. Thefe three communicating branches are termed collateral arteries. The common trunk of the brachial artery having reached the fold of the arm, runs, together with a vein and a nerve, immediately under the aponeurofis of the biceps, and pafles under the vend medians, detaching branches on each fide to the neighbouring mufcles. About a large finger’s breadth beyond the fold of the arm, this artery divides into two principal branches, one inner or pollerior, named cubitahs ; the other outer or anterior, named radialis. From this bifurcation, the brachial artery fends branches on each fide, to the fupinator longus, pronator teres, fat, and thin. It fometimes, though very rarely, happens, that this artery is divided from its origin into two large branches, which run down on the arm, and af¬ terwards on the fore-arm, where they have the names of cubitalis and radialis. The cubital artery finks in between the mlna and the upper parts of the pronator teres, perforatus, ulnaris gracilis, and radialis internus; then leaving the bone, it runs down between the perforatus and ulnaris internus, all tire way to the carpus and great tranfverfe ligament, and fends out fcveral branches. The firft is k finall artery, which runs inward to the inner Condyle, and then turns upward, like a kind of re¬ current, to communicate by feveral branches with the collateral arteries of the arm, already mentioned, and particularly with the third. A little lower down, ano¬ ther fmall branch goes off, which having run upward a little way, and almoft furrounded the articulation, com¬ municates with the fecond collateral artery of the arm, between the olecranum and inner condyle. Afterwards, the cubital artery having, in its courfe between the heads of the ulna and radius, reached the interoffeous ligaments, fends off two principal branches, one internal, the other external, called the interoffeous arteries of the fore-arm. Tire external artery pierces the ligament about three fingers breadth below the articulation, and prefently af¬ terwards gives off a branch, which runs up, like a recur¬ rent, toward the external condyle of the os humeri, un¬ der the ulnaris externus and anconasus, minimus, to which it is diftributed, as alfo to the fupinator brevis. Afterward, this external interoffeous artery runs down on the outfide of the ligament, and is diftributed to the T O M Y. 231 ulnaris externus, extenfor digitorum communis, and to the extenlores pollicis indicis and minimi digiti; commu¬ nicating with fome branches of the internal interoffeous artery. Having reached the lower extremity of the ulna, it u- nites with a branch of the internal interoffeoijs artery, which, at this place, runs from within outward, and is diftributed, together with it, on the convex fide of the carpus and back of the hand; communicating with the arteria radialis, and with a branch of the cubitalis. By thefe communications, this artery forms a fort of irregular arch, from whence branches are detached to the external interoffeous mufcles, and to the external la¬ teral parts of the fingers. The internal interoffeous artery runs down very clofe to the ligament, till it reaches below the pronator teres, between which and the pronator quadratus, it perforates the ligament, and goes to the convex fide of die carpus and back of the hand, where it communicates with the external interoffeous artery, with the radialis and inter¬ nal branches of the cubitalis. From the origin of the two interoffex, the cubital ar¬ tery runs down between the perforatus, perforans, an<f ulnaris internus, along the ulna, fending branches to the neighbouring parts. Afterward, it paffes over the internal tranfverfe liga¬ ment of the carpus, by the fide of the cs pitiforme, and having furnilhed the (kin, palmaris brevis, and metacar- pius, it flips under the aponeurofis palmaris, giving off one branch to the hypothenar minimi digiti, and another, which runs toward the thumb, between the tendons of the flexors of the fingers, and the bafes of the metacar¬ pal bones. It likewife fends off a branch, which, running betweei) the third and fourth bones of the metacarpus, reaches to the back of the hand, where it communicates with the external interofieous artery. Afterwards, having fup- plied the interoffeous mufcles, it communicates with the radialis; and they both form an arterial arch, in the hoi-, low of the hand. This arch fends from its concave fide, towards the fe¬ cond phalanx of the thumb, a branch for the lateral in¬ ternal part thereof, and then ends near the head of the firft metacarpal bone, by a communication with the ra- dialis, haying firft given a branch to the forefide of thj index, and another to the fide of the thumb next the former. Thefe communicate, at the ends of the fingers, with the neighbouring branches, as in the other fingers. This arch fends likewife fmall twigs to the interofieous mufcles, to the lumbricales, p Jmaris, and to other neigh: bouring parts; and, laftly, to the integuments. The radial artery begins by detaching a fmall branch, which runs upward like a recurrent toward’the fold of the arm, and turns backward round the external condyle, communicating with the neighbouring branches from the trunk of the brachial artery. It runs down along the infide of the radius,, between the fupinator longus, pronator teres, and the integuments, giving branches to thefe mufcles, and likewife to the per¬ foratus, perforans, and fupinator brevis. From thence it runs, in a winding courfe, towards the extremity or the"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"sga A N A T the radius, fupplying the flexors of the thumb and pro¬ nator quadratus. Having reached the extremity of the radius, it runs nearer the fkin, efpecialiy toward the anterior edge of the hone, being the artery which we feel there when we examine the pulfe. At the end of the radius, it gives off a branch to the thenar ; and. after having communicated with the arch of the cubital artery in the palm of the hand, and fet off fome cutaneous branches at that place, it detaches one along the whole internal lateral part of the thumb. Afterwards it runs between the firft phalanx and ten¬ dons of the thumb, to the interftice between the bafis of this firft phalanx, and of the firft metacarpal bone, where it turns to the hollow of the hand. At this turning, it fends off a branch to the external lateral part of the thumb, which having reached the end thereof, communicates, by a fmall arch, with the branch which goes to the internal lateral part. It likewife fends branches outward, which run between the two firft bones of the metacarpus, and the two ten¬ dons of the radialis externus; and it communicates with an oppofite branch of the cubitalis, together with which it furnifhes the external interoffeous mufcles and integu¬ ments of the back of the hand and convex fide of the carpus. Laftly, the radial artery terminates, in its paffage o- ver the femi-interoffeous mufcle of the index, near the bafis of the firft metacarpal bone, and as it runs under the tendons of the flexor mufcles of the fingers, where it is joined to the arch of the cubitalis. It fends off another branch, which runs along the fore-part of the firft bone of the metacarpus, to the con¬ vex fide of the index, where it is loft in the integu¬ ments. The left Diaphragmatic artery goes out commonly from the aorta defeendens, as it paffes between the cru¬ ra of the fmall mufcle of the diaphragm. The right diaphragmatic comes fometimes from the neareft lumbar artery, but molt commonly from the caeliaca. Thefe arteries likewife have the name of arteria phrenic#. They appear almoft always in feveral ramifications on the concave or lou'er fide of the diaphragm, and feldom on the upper or convex fide. They give fmall branches to the glandulae renales, or capfuke atrabilaria. They fend likewife fmall branches to the fat which lies upon the kidneys, from whence they have the name of arteriae adipofae. Befides thefe capital diaphragmatic arteries, there are others of a fubordinate clafs, which come from the in- tercoftales, mammariae internae, mediaftinae, pericardiac, and caeliaca. The caeliac artery arifes anteriorly, and a little to the left hand, from the aorta defeendens, immediately after its paffage through the fmall mufcle of the diaphragm, nearly oppofite to the cartale, between the laft vertebra of the back, and the firft of the loins. The trunk of this artery is very ihort; and near its origin, it fends off from the right fide two fmall diaphragmaticaE, though fometimes there is only one, 1 which goes to the right O M Y. Part III. hand, and is afterwards diftributed both ways ; commu¬ nicating with the other arteries of the fame name, which come from the intercoftales and mammariae. The left branch fends rami to the fuperior orifice of the ftomach, and to the glandula renalis on the fame fide; the right furnifhes the pylorus, and the renal gland on the right fide. Immediately after this, the caeliaca gives off a confi- derable branch, named arteria ventriculi coronaria , and gajhica, of gajlrica fuperior ; and then it prefently di¬ vides into two large branches, one toward the right hand, named arteria hepatica ; the other to the left, called fplenica. The coronary artery of the ftomach goes firft to the left fide of that organ, a little beyond the fuperior ori¬ fice; round which orifice it throws branches, and alfo to every part of the ftomach near it; and thefe branches communicate with thofe which run along the bottom of the ftomach to the pylorus. Afterwards it runs on the right fide of the fuperior orifice, along the fmall curvature of the ftomach, almoft to the pylorus, where it communicates with the arteria pylorica; and turning towards the fmall lobe of the li¬ ver, it gives off fome branches to it. Then it advances, under the dudtus venofus, to the leftdobe of the liver, in which it lofes itfelf near the be¬ ginning of the du«ft, having firft given off fome fmall branches to the neighbouring parts of the diaphragm and omentum. As foon as the hepatic artery leaves the caeliaca, it runs to the upper and inward part of the pylorus, in company with the vena portae, fending off two branches, a fmall one called arteria pylorica, and a large one na¬ med gajlrica dextra , or gajlrica major. The pylorica is ramified on the pylorus, and having diftributed branches to the neighbouring parts of the fto- , mach, which communicate with thofe of the right gaftri- ca, it terminates on the pylorus, by an anaftomofis with the coronary artery of the ftomach. The right gaftric artery having paffed behind and be¬ yond the pylorus, fends out a considerable branch, na¬ med arteria duodenalis, or intejiinalis, which fometimes comes from the trunk of the hepatica, as we (hall fee hereafter. Afterwards this gaftric artery runs along on the right fide of the great curvature of the ftomach, to the neighbouring parts of which, on both fides, it diftri- butes branches. Thefe branches communicate with thofe of the arteria pylorica, and of the coronaria ventriculi, and with the right gaftro-epiploicse, which furnifh the neareft part of the omentum, and communicate with the mefenterica fu¬ perior. After this, the right gaftric artery ends in the left, which is a branch of the fplenica. The duodenal or inteftinal artery runs along the duo¬ denum on the fide next the pancreas ; to both which it furnifhes branches, and alfo to the neighbouring part of the ftomach. The hepatic artery, having fent out the pylorica and right gaftrica, advances behind the dudtus hepaticus, to¬ ward the veficula fellis, to which it gives two principal branches"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Part III. A N A T branches called arteria cyjlica; and another named Ma¬ ria, which isJoft in the great lobe of the liver. Afterwards, this artery enters the fUTure of the liver, and joins the vena portse, with which it runs within a membranous vagina, called capful a Glijfni, and accom¬ panies it through the whole fubftance of the liver by nu¬ merous ramifications, which may be termed arteria he¬ patica propria. Before it enters the liver, it gives fmall branches to the external membrane of this vifcus, and to the capfula GlilToni. Immediately after the origin of thefplenic artery from the cseliaca, it runs toward the left hand, under the fto- raach and pancreas, to the fpleen. It adheres clofely to the pollerior part of the lower fide of the pancreas, to which it gives feveral branches, named arteriapancreatica. Near the extremity of the pancreas, under the left portion of the ftomach, the fplenic artery gives off a principal branch, called gajlrica fitiijlra or minor , which runs from left to right along the left portion of the great curvature of the ftomach, giving branches to both fides of this portion, which communicate with thofe of the coronaria ventriculi. This gaftric artery fends likewife another branch at lead to the extremity of the pancreas, which commu¬ nicates with the other pancreatic arteries. It alfo fup- plies the omentum with branches, termed pajlro-epi- ploica fmijlra ; and then it communicates with the right gaftrica; and from this union, the gaftro-epiploicae mediae are produced. Afterwards, the fplenic artery advances towards the fpleen, in a courfe more or lefs contorted; but before it arrives at that vifcus, it gives two or three branches to the large extremity of the ftomach, commonly called vafa brevia ; and one to the omentum, named epiploica. At the fpleen, this artery divides into four or five branches, which enter that vifcus, after having given I fome fmall twigs to the neighbouring parts of the fto- ' mach and omentum. The fuperior mefenteric artery arifes anteriorly from the lower portion of the defceiiding aorta, a very little jyay below the casliaca, going out a little .towards the right hand, but bending immediately afterwards to the •left; . Near its origin, it gives off a fmall-branch, which dividing into two, goes to the lower fide of the head of the pancreas, and neighbouring part of the duodenum, communicating with the inteftinalis by fmall arches, and areolae or mallies. _ Afterwards it paffes over the duodenum, between this inteftine and the meferaic vein, between the two laminae of the mefentery ; and then bending in an oblique direc¬ tion from left to right, and from above downward, by very fmall degrees, it advances toward the extremity of the ileum. By this incurvation, it forms a kind of long arch, from the convex fide of which a great many branches go out. Thefe branches are fixteen or eighteen in number, or thereabouts, and almoft all of them are bellowed on the final I inteftines, from the lower third part of the duo¬ denum to the caecum and colon. Voi . I. No. 10. 3 O M Y. 233 As they approach the inteftines, all thefe branches communicate, firft by reciprocal arches; then by ariolae and malhes of all kinds of figures; from which is de¬ tached an infinite number of fmall ramifications, which furround the inteftinal canal, like an annular piece of net¬ work. The firft branches from the convex fide of the mefen¬ teric arch, which are very (hort, fupply the pancreas and mefocolon, and communicate with the duodenal artery. The laft branches go to the appendicula vermiformis, and fend a portion of an arch to the beginning of the colon. The confiderable branches from the concave fide of the mefenteric arch, are feldom above two or three in num¬ ber ; but before they arife, a fmall ramus goes out to the duodenum, and gives fome very fmall arteries to the pancreas. The firft confiderable branch from the concave fide of the arch goes into the mefocolon towards the right por¬ tion of the colon. The fecond principal branch, having run for fome fpace through the mefentery, divides into three rami; the firft of which goes to the lower part of the right portion of the colon, the fecond goes to the beginning of the colon and inteftinum caecum. The third ramus of the fecond branch, having com¬ municated with the fecond, gives fmall twigs to the cae¬ cum, appendicula vermiformis, and extremity of the ileum. The lower mefenteric artery goes out anteriorly from the aorta defeendens inferior, about a fingers breadth or more above the bifurcation, and below the fpermatic arteries; and having run about the length of an inch, or fomething more, it is divided into three or four, branches. The firft or fuperior branch, about an inch from its origin, divides into two rami; the firft of which runs along the left portion of the colon. The fecond ramu^ having communicated with the firft, runs down upon the fame portion of the colon. The middle branch divides into two rami; one of which pafl'es upward on the extremity of the colon, com¬ municating by arches with the fecond ramus of the fupe¬ rior branch; the other runs down on the extremity of the fame inteftine. The lower branch goes to the fecond portion of the colon, or to both. It fends another confiderable branch downward, called arteria hamorrhoidalis interna, which runs down behind the inteftinum refium, to which it is diftributed by fe¬ veral ramifications. The renal arteries, commonly called emulgetits , are ordinarily two in number, and go out laterally from the inferior defeending aorta, immediately under the mefen- terica fuperior, one to the right hand, the other to the left. They run commonly without divifion, and almoft hori¬ zontally to the kidneys, into the depreffions of which they enter by feveral branches, which form arches in the inner fubftance of thefe vifeera. From thefe arches, numerous fmall rami go out to- 3 N ward I"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"234 A N A T ward the circumference or outer furface of the kidneys. Ordinarily, the right renal artery paffes behind the vena Cava and renal vein on the other fide ; and the left artery, firfl: behind and then before the vein. The arteries of the renal glands, which may be term¬ ed artcrix capfulares, arife fometimes from the aorta above the arteria renalis, and give out the arterix adipo- fx, which go to the fat of the kidneys. Sometimes' they come from the trunk of the cxliaca. The right capfular artery comes mod commonly from the arteria re- nalis of tha fame fide, near its origin; the left from the- aorta, above the renalis. The fpermatic arteries are commonly two in number, fometimes more. They are very fmall, and go out an¬ teriorly from the aorta defeendens inferior, near each o- ther, about a finger’s breadth below the arterix renales, between the two mefentericx, or between the renales and mefentericx inferiores. They fend off to the common membrane of the kidney fmall branches, named arterix adipojx ; and afterwards they run down upon the pfoas mufcles, on the fore-fide of the ureters, between the two laminx of the perito- lixum. They give fevers 1 confiderable branches to the perito- nseum, and communicate both with the mefentericx and adipofx. They likewife fend fmall arteries to the ureters. Afterwards, they pafs in men through the tendinous Openings of the abdominal mufcles in the vagina of the peritonaeum, and are diftributed to the teflicles and epi¬ didymis, where they communicate with a branch of the iliaca externa. In women they do not go out of the abdomen, but are diflributed to the ovaria and uterus, and communi¬ cate with branches of the hypogallrica, at the jagged ex¬ tremities of the tubx Fallopianx. The lumbar arteries go out pofteriorly from the infe¬ rior defeending aorta, in five or fix pairs, or more, much in the fame manner with the intercoftals. They may be divided into fuperior and inferior. The fuperior fend fmall branches to the neighbouring parts of the diaphragm and intercoftal mufeles, and fupply the place of femi-intercoftal arteries. They are diflributed on each fide to the p r oas mufcles, to the quadrati lnmborum, and to the oblique and tranf- verfie mufcles of the abdomen; and by perforating the oblique mufcles, they become external hypogaftric arte¬ ries. They go likewife to the vertebral mufcles, and to the bodies of the vertebrx, and enter the fpinal canal through the lateral notches, to go to the membranes, t^c. forming rings much in the fame manner with the iptercollals. The arterix facrx go out commonly from the back part of the inferior defeending aorta, at the bifurcation. They are two, three, or four in number, and fometimes but one. They are ramified on the os facrum, and on the neighbouring parts of the peritonxum, inteftinum rectum, fat, fac. and enter the canal of that bone through the an rior holes, being there diflributed toward each fide. They likewife fend fmall arteries to the large fafciculi of nerves, which go out through the holes of the os facrum, and they penetrate the inner fubllance of that bone. O M Y. Part III. The inferior defeending aorta ends at the lalt verte¬ bra of the loins, and fometimes higher, in two large la¬ teral branches, one on the right hand, the other on the left, called arterix iliacx ; each of which is a common trunk to two other arteries of the fame name. This bi¬ furcation lies on the anterior and left fide of that of the vena cava. The primitive iliac arteries divaricate gradually as they defeend, advancing obliquely toward the anterior and low¬ er part of the offa ilium, without any confiderable rami- - fication for about the breadth of three fingers, except z few very fmall arteries that go to the os facrum. They likewife give fmall arteries to the peritonxum, to the coats of the veins, and to the fat and ureters. The right iliac trunk paffes firt on the forefide of the origin of the left iliac vein, and runs down on th# forefide of the right vein, almolt to the place where it goes out of the abdomen, its courfe being there directed more inwardly. The left trunk goes down likewife be¬ fore the left vein, but lies a little toward the infide as it leaves the abdomen. About three fingers breadth from their origin, each iliac trunk is divided into two fecondary arteries, one ex-* ternal, the other internal. The external artery has no particular name; the internal is termed bypogajlrica. The external iliaca on each fide runs down on the ili> ac mufcle to the ligamentum Fallopii, under which it goes out of the abdomen. In this courfe, it gives off only a Few fmall arteries to the peritonxum, and other parts near it; but as it paffes out of the abdomen under the ligament, it detaches two confiderable branches, one internal, the other external . The internal branch is named arteria epigajlrica, and goes out anteriorly from the external iliaca. From thence it runs obliquely upward on the tendon of the tranfverfe mufcle towards the pofterior part of the reft us. Afterwards the epigaftric artery runs up along the po- fterior or inner fide of this mufcle, fending ramifications to the tendons of the neighbouring mufcles, £}c. and then Iofes itfelf by a true anaftomofis of feveral ramifi¬ cations, with the mammaria interna. The external branch of the outer iliaca goes off late¬ rally from the outfide of that artery under the ligamen¬ tum Fallopii, and from thence to the internal labium of the os ilium, where it divides into two, and is ramified on tha oblique and tranfverfe mufcles of the abdomen communicating with the arteria lumbaris. Befides thefe two branches, the external iliaca gives off a fmall ramus internally, under the ligament, which runs to the vagina of the fpermatic rope ; and fometimes another fmall twig goes from the outfide to the os ilium. The internal iliaca or hypogallrica, having run a little more than a finger’s breadth inward and backward, bends by fmall degrees obliquely forward, and toward the out¬ fide ; and afterwards contrasting in its dimensions, it ends in the umbilical artery, which ought to be looked upon as a true continuation of the trunk of the hypogallrica. This arteria umbilicalis afeends on the fide of the bladder, and having detached fmall rami ;to that vifeus and to the neighbouring parts of the peritonxum, <bc. it contrasts, and in adults is quite clofed up above the middle"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Part III. ANA middle of the bladder. It likewife gives branches to the uterus* and to the neighbouring parts in both fexes. Afterwards it c.fcends in form of a ligament to the umbi¬ licus, where it joins the .umbilical artery on the other fide. From the convex fide of the curvature of the hypoga- ftric artery, four or five principal branches commonly go out very near each other, viz. iliaca minor, glutaea, fcia- tica, pudica communis, five pudiea hypogartrica, and ob-* turatrix. ■ The iliaca minor, the moll pofterior of thefe branches, and which is often no more than a ramus of the glutaea, pafles between the laft two lumbar nerves, and divides into two rami, one of which enters the canal of the os facrum through the loweft large anterior holes; the other paf- fes behind the mufculus pfoas, to which it gives twigs, and behind the crural nerve, being afterwards diftributed to- the iliac mufcle, and to the middle part of the infide of the os ilium, penetrating into the fubflance of the bone fometimes by one hole, fometimes by more. The arteria glntasa is fometimes the largeft of all the bypogaftric branches. Near its beginning it fometimes fends out the iliaca minor, and fometimes the fmall ra¬ mus that goes from that artery to the os facrum and o- ther parts fixed to that bone. Afterwards this artery goes out of the pelvis, in company' with the fciatic nerve, through the upper part of the great finus of the 6s innominatum, below the mufculus pyriformis, and is diftributed, in a radiated manner, to the glutaeus maximus and medius. In its paflage, it gives fome branches to the os facrum, os coccygis, mufculus pyriformis, the mufcles of the a- nus, and to the neighbouring parts of the inteftinum return, forming a particular h-aemorrhoidalis interna. It likewife fends twigs to the bladder and parts near it; and detaches a pretty long branch, which runs down with the fciatic nerve. The arteria fciatica gives firft of all fome branches to the mufculus pyriformis, the quadrigemini, the os fa- erum, fee. and even to the inner fide of the os ifehium. It likewife detaches a branch, which runs under the mufculus quadratus, to the articulation of the cs femoris. The pudica communis, called commonly pudica inter¬ na, arifes fometimes by a trunk common to it and to the glut a 5 a, and gives out two principal branches; the firft of which pafles through the great finus of the os ilium, in company with the glutata and fciatica, and then di¬ vides into two rami. The firft ramus goes behind the fpine of the ifehinm, between the two ligaments which lie between that bone and the os facrum ; and runs on the infide of the tuber - culum ifehii, all the way to the origin of the corpus ca- vernofum penis. There it divides into feveral arteries, one of which goes to the fphindler ani, under the name of hannorrhoidal'u externa. The reft are diftributed to the neighbouring integu¬ ments, to the bulb Of the urethra, and to the corpus oavernofum penis ; but the laft of thefe arteries, or ra¬ ther the extremity of this firft ramus, runs from behind foreward, over the neck of the os femoris, and commu¬ nicates with a branch of the. arteria cruralis. T O M Y. 235 The fecond principal ramus, called commonly arteria pudica externa, runs between the bladder and inteftinum return, and is diftributed in men to the veficulas femina- les, neck of the bladder, proftate gland, and neighbour¬ ing parts of tire redtum. Afterwards it runs under the os pubis on the fide of a considerable vein, which lies diredtly under the fympliy- fis; and it runs along the penis between this vein and a nerve, being diftributed in its paflage to the corpus ca- vernofum, and communicating with the pudica minor, which comes from the cruralis. This fecond branch of the pudica major goes off. fometimes feparately from the hypogaftrica, efpecially in women, being diftributed to the lateral parts of the ute¬ rus, where it communicates with the fpermatic artery, near the jagged extremity of the tuba Fallopiana, and to the neighbouring parts of the vagina, fee. The arteria obturatrix perforates the obturator muf- ; cles, and goes out of the pelvis at the upper part of the ligament of the foramen ovale, having firft fent a fmall branch over the fymphyfis of the os ilium and os pubis, to the inguinal glands and integuments. As it pafles by the mufcles, it divides and is diftribu¬ ted to the pcAincus and triceps. It likewife fends out another branch, which communicates with that branch' of the fciatica that goes to the articulation of the os fe¬ moris; and gives fmall arteries to the holes in the neck of that bone. The iliac artery goes out of the abdomen, between the ligamentum Fallopii and tendon of the pfoas, at the u- nion of the os ilium and os pubis, and there it takes the 1 name of arteria cruralis. It fends off, firft of all, three fmall branches ; one of which, called pudica externa, goes over the cruralvcin to the Ikin and ligament of the penis, and to the inguinal glands, communicating with the pudica interna. The fecond goes to the mufculus pedtineus ; and the third to the upper part of the fartorius. All thefe branches fur-’ nifh likewife the neighbouring anterior integuments.^ Afterwards the crural artery runs down on the head of the os femoris; and, by taking a particular turn, gets’ on the infide of the crural vein, about three fingers breadth from where it goes out of the abdomen. In changing its fituaticn, it fends out three confider'- able branches, one external, one middle, and one in¬ ternal. The external branch runs on the upper fide of the thigh to the crureus, vaftus externus, redlus anterior, mufculus fafeia: latje, and glutarns medius; fending up a' ramus to the apex of the great trochanter, which com¬ municates with the firft principal ramus of the pudica major and fciatica. The middle branch runs down on the infide of the thigh between the triceps mufcles, to which it gives fe¬ veral rami, one whereof perforates the fecond mufcle, and is diftributed to the glutaeus maximus, femi-nervo-* fus, femi-membranofus, biceps, and to the neighbouring integuments. ^ The internal branch runs backward on the qiiadri Ge¬ mini, towards the great trochanter; and having detach¬ ed a ramus, which goes into the joint'of the ts femoris."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"2 3 < S A N A T it rnns downward, and gives rami to all the mufcles that lie on the backfide of that bone, one of which enters the bone itfelf on one fide of the linea afpera. Having fent off all thefe three branches, the arteria cruralis runs down between the fartorius, vaftus inter¬ ims, and triceps, giving branches to all the parts near it. It is covered by the fartorius all the way to the lower part of the thigh, where it is infleSed backward over the triceps tertius a little above the internal condyle of the os femoris. Afterwards, continuing its courfe through the hollow of the ham, it is called arteria po¬ plitea. The poplitea, while in the ham, is covered only by the integument, fending off branches toward each fide, which run up upon the condyles, and communicate with the lower ramifications of the arteria cruralis. It fends rami to the joint of the kndfe, one of which at lead paffes between the crucial ligaments. As it runs down, it fends branches to the gaftrocnemii and popli- teus; and having reached the backfide of the head of the tibia, it gives off two branches, one to each fide. The firft or internal branch furrounds the fore-part of the head of the tibia, palling between the bone and in¬ ternal lateral ligament; an.fl befides feveral other ramifi¬ cations, fends u.p a fraall branch, which communicates with the arteries that lie round the condyles of the os fe¬ moris. The fecond or external branch runs over the head of the fibula, and between the head of the tibia and exter¬ nal lateral ligament of the knee, furrounding the articu¬ lation all the way to the ligament of the patella, and communicating with the branches which lie round th§ condyles of the os femoris, together with a branch of .the firft. or internal ramus. Immediately after the origin of thefe two rami, and before the poplitea ends, it fends a fmall artery down on the backfide of the interoffeous ligament, very near the tibia, into which it enters by a particular hole a little a- bove the middle portion of the bone. As the poplitea ends, it divides into two principal branches, one of which runs between the heads of the tibia and fibula, palling from behind forwards on-the in- teroffeous ligament, where it takes the name of arteria tibialis anterior. -The fecond branch divides into two others; one internal and larged, called arteria peronaa anterior; the other pofierior andfmalleft, named arteria peronaa posterior. The tibialis anterior, having palled between the heads of the tibia and fibula, fends finall branches upward and laterally. The fuperior branches communicate with thofe rami of the popliteus which lie round the articulation; and the lateral branches go to the neighbouring parts. Af¬ terwards this tibial artery runs down on the forefide of the interoffeous ligament, toward the outfide of the ti¬ bia, between the mufculus tibialis anticus and extenfor pollicis. Having run laterally on the tibia for about two thirds of the length of that bone, it paffes on the forefide un¬ der the common annular ligament, and extenfor pollicis, to the articulation of the foot; giving off feveral rami both to the right and left hand, which communicate la- O M Y. Part III. terally with the tibialis pofterior and peronaea pofterior, fo that thefe two bones are in a manner .furrounded by arteries. At the joint of the foot, it fends out branches which run between the aftragalus and os calcis, being dillributed to the articulation and to the bones of the tarfus. Having paffed the fold of the foot, it fends off, to¬ ward both fides, other rami, which communicate with the poiterior tibialis and peronaea; all thefe branches making a kind of circles round the tarfus. Afterwards the anterior tibial artery advances on the convex fide of the foot, as far as the interftice between the firll and fecond metatarfal bones; between the heads of which it fends a large branch, which perforates the fuperior interoffeous mufcles, and, joining the tibialis pofterior, forms an arch on the fide of the foot. It likewife fends two or three confiderable branches over the other metatarfal bones, which go to the reft of the interoffeous mufcles, integuments, 6 c. and commu¬ nicate with each other. Laflly, This artery terminates by two principal branches, one of which goes to the thenar and infide of the great toe; the other is fpent upon the outfide of the great toe, and the infide of the fecond toe. The tibialis pofterior, called likewife furalis , runs down between the folei, tibialis pofticus, flexor digito- rum .communis, and flexor pollicis; giving branches to thefe mufcles, to the tibia, and to the marrow of that bone, through a particular canal in its pofterior and up¬ per part. Afterwards it runs behind the inner ankle, communi¬ cating with the tibialis anterior, and furrounded by the neighbouring veins; and paffes to the foie of the foot between the concave fide of the os calcis and thenar miif- cle, where it divides into two branches, one large or ex¬ ternal, the other fmall or internal. The great branch, or arteria plantaris externa, paffes on the concave fide of the os calcis obliquely under the foie of the foot, to the bafis of the fifth metatarfal bone, and from thence runs in a kind of arch toward the great toe, communicating there with the tibialis anterior, which perforates the interoffeous.mufcles. . The convex fide of this arch fupplies both fides of the laft three toes, and the outfide of the fecond toe, form¬ ing fmall communicating arches as in the hand. The iipall branch, or arteria plantaris interna, having reached beyond the middle of the foie of the foot, is di¬ vided into two; one of which goes to the great toe, communicating with the ramus of the tibialis anterior ; the other is diftributed to the firft phalanges of the other toes, communicating with the ramifications from the arch already mentioned. The arteria peronsea runs down on the backfide of the fibula, between the foleus and flexor pollicis, to which, and to the neighbouring parts, it gives rami in its paf- fage. Having reached to the lower third part of the fibula, it fends off a confiderable branch, which runs in between the tibia and that bone, palling between their extremities from behind forward, below the interoffeous ligament, and is diftributed to the integuments of the tarfus.

PART IV. OF THE VEINS. T H E blood, diftributed to all parts of the body by two kinds of arteries, the aorta and arteria pul- monaris, returns by three kinds of veins, called by ana- tomifts vena cava , vena port<e, and vena pulmonaris. The vena cava carries back to the right auricle of the heart, the blood conveyed by the aorta to all parts of the body except what goes by the arteriae coronarise cordis. It receives all this blood from the arterial ramifications in part diredly, and in part indire&ly. The vena portae receives the blood carried to the floating vifcera of the abdomen by the arteria caeliaca and the two mefentericae, and conveys it to the» vena hepatica, and from thence to the vena cava. The vena pulmonaris conveys to the pulmonary Gnus, or left auricle of the heart, the blood carried to the lungs by the arteria pulmonaris. We commonly talk of the ||na cava in general, as if it were but one vein at its origin, or had but one com¬ mon trunk; whereas it goes out from the right auricle of the heart by two large feparate trunks, in a direction almoft perpendicularly oppofite to each other, one run¬ ning upward, called vena cava fuperior; the other down¬ ward, called vena cava inferior. The vena cava fuperior is diftributed chiefly to the thorax, head, and upper extremities, and but very lit¬ tle to the parts below the diaphragm. The vena cava inferior is diftributed chiefly to the ab¬ domen and lower extremities, and but very little to the parts above the diaphragm. The trunk of each of thefe two veins fends off, much in the fame manner with the arteries, a certain number of rincipal or capital branches, which are afterwards rami- ed in different manners. Each trunk terminates after¬ wards by a bifurcation or a divifion into two fubordinate trunks, each of which gives off other principal branches, ending in a great number of fmall trunks, rami, and ra¬ mifications. The fuperior vena cava runs up from the right auri¬ cle of the heart, almoft in a diredt courfe, for about two fingers breadth, lying within the pericardium, in the right fide of the trunk of the aorta, but a little more an¬ teriorly. As it goes out of the pericardium, it is inclined a lit¬ tle to the left hand, and then Tuns up as high as the car¬ tilage of the firft true rib, and a little higher than the Vol. I. No. 10. 3 curvature of the aorta. At this place it terminates by a bifurcation or divifion into two large branches or fub¬ ordinate trunks, one of which runs toward the left hand, the other toward the right. Thefe two branches are named fuiclavia , as lying be¬ hind the claviculs. The trunk of the fuperior cava, from where it leaves the pericardium to the birfurcation, fends out anteriorly feveral fmall branches. Thefe branches are the vena mediaftina, pericardia, diaphragmatica fuperior, thymica, tnammaria interna\", and trachealis. All thefe fmall branches from the trunk of the cava fuperior are termed dexlree ; and their fellows on the o- ther fide, called ftniftree , do not arife from the trunk, but from the left fubclavia. Pofteriorly, a little above the pericardium, the trunk of the fuperior cava fends out a capital branch, called vena azygos , or vena fne pari , which runs down on the right fide of the bodies of the vertebrae dorfi, almoft to the diaphragm ; giving off the greateft part of the venae intercoftales and lumbares fuperiores. The two fubclaviae run laterally or toward each fide, and terminate as they go out of the thorax, between the firft rib and clavicula. The right fubclavian, which is the (horteft of the two, commonly fends out four capital branches; the jugula- ris externa, jugularis interna, vertebralis, and axillaris. The left fubclavian being longer than the right, gives off, firft of all, the fmall veins on the left fide, an- fwering thofe on the right fide that come from the trunk of the fuperior cava, viz. the mediaftina, pericardia, diaphragmatica fuperior, thymica, mammaria interna, and trachealis. Next to thefe fmall veins, called finiflrce, it detaches another mall branch, called intercoflalis fuperior fnif- tra, and then four large branches like thofe from the right fubclavian, viz. the jugularis externa, jugularis interna, vertebralis, and axillaris, which are termed ft- nijlra. The external jugular veins are diftributed chiefly to the outer parts of the throat, neck and head; and fend a fmall vein to the arm, named cepbalica, which affifts in forming a large one of the fame name. The internal jugular veins go to the internal parts of the neck and head, communicating v/ith the finufts of 3 O the"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"2 3 8 ANA T the dura mater, and in feveral places with the external' jugular veins. ' The vertebral veins pafs through the holes in the tranf- verfe apophyfes of the vertebrae of the neck, fending branches to the neck and occiput. They form the finus venales of thefe vertebrae, and communicate with the fi- nufes of the dura mater. The axillary veins are continuations of the fubclaviae, from where thefe leave the thorax, to the axillae. They produce the mammariae internae, thoracicae, fcapulares or humerales, and a branch to each arm, which, together with that from the external jugularis, forms the vena cephalica. Afterwards the axillary vein terminates in. the princi¬ pal vein of the arm, called hafilica; which, together with the cephalica, is diflributed by numerous ramifica¬ tions to all parts of the arm, fore-arm, and hand. The portion of the inferior vena cava contained in the pericardium is very fmall, being fcarcely t,he twelfth part of an inch on the fore-part, and not above a quarter of an inch on the back part. From thence it immediately perforates the diaphragm, to which it gives the venae diaphragmaticae inferiors or phrenicoe. . ■ It pafles next behind the. liver, through the great finus of that vifeus, to which it furnifhes feveral branches, termed venue hepatica. In this courfe it inclines a little toward the fpina dorfi and aorta inferior, the trunk and ramifications of which it afterwards accompanies in the abdomen, all the way to the os facrum. Thus the inferior cava fends out on each fide, in the fame manner with the aorta, the venae adipofae, renales, fpermaticoe, lunibares, and facrae. Having reached to the os facrum, it lofes the name of cava, and termina¬ ting by a bifurcation, like that of the defeending aorta, it forms the two venae iliacae. Thefe iliac veins having given off the hypogaftricae, with all their ramifications, to the vifeera of the pelvis, and to fome other external and internal neighbouring parts, go out of the abdomen, under the ligamentum Fal- loppii, and there take the name of vena crurales. Each crural vein fends off numerous ramifications to all the lower extremity. The vena azygos or fine pari is very confidera\"ble, and arifes poftcriorly from the fuperior cava a little above the pericardium. * It is immediately afterwards bent backward over the origin of the right lung, forming an arch which furrounds the great pulmonary veffels on that fide. From thence it runs down on the right fide of the vertebra dorfi on one fide of the aorta, and before the intercoftal arteries ; and getting behind the diaphragm, it terminates by a very fenfible anaftomofis, fometimes with the vena renalis, fometimes with a neighbouring lumbar vein, and fometimes immediately with the trunk of the cava inferior. The vena azygos fends out two or three fmall veins from the top of the arch, one of which goes to the afpera arteria; the others partly to the afpera artera, and partly to the bronchia, by the name of vena; O M Y. Part IV. bronchiales, accompanying the ramifications of the bron¬ chia] artery. Afterwards the azygos detaches from the extremity of the arch a fmall trunk common to two or three fmall veins, called intercojlales fuperiores dextree, which bring back the blood from the firft three feries of intercoftal mufcles, and from the neighbouring part of the pleura. Thefe intercollal veins fend branches through the in¬ tercoftal mufcles to the ferratus fuperior pofticus, ferra- tus major, <bc. and afterwards they run along the in- terftices between the ribs, communicating with the venae mammariae. They likewife fend fmall branches backward to the vertebral mufcles and canal of the fpine, where they communicate with the venal circles, or finufes which bring back the blood from the medulla fpinalis. As the azygos runs down, it fends off'the inferior intercollal veins on the right fide, one going to each fer¬ ries of intercoftal mufcles. Thefe veins run along the lower edges of the rib?, and perforate the mufcles by branches, which go to the pofterior and external part of the thorax. They communicate with the venae thoracicae, ‘and mod commonly with the mammaria interna ; and laftly, more or lefs with each other, by perpendicular branches, near the pofterior extremities of the ribs. The azygos fends off likewife the left intercoftal veins, but feldom the whole number; for the fuperior veins come often from the left -fubclavian. The inferior in¬ tercoftal veins, to the number of fix or feven, come often from the trunk of the azygos; and running between the aorta and vertebra, they fend off almoft the fame ramifi¬ cations with the veins on the right fide, and likewife fome to the oefophagus. The azygos, having reached below the laft rib, fends off a large branch, which bending outward, perforates the mufcles of the abdomen, is ramified between their different planes, and communicates with the like ramifi¬ cations of the laft or laft two intercoftal veins. The peftorales internae, are fmall veins difpofed in pairs toward the right and left hand, behind the fternum and parts near it, including the diaphragmaticae fuperi¬ ores, or pericardio-diaphragmaticae, mediaftinae, mam¬ mariae internae, thymicae, pericardiae, and gutturales or tracheales. The right vena mediaftina goes out anteriorly from the trunk of the fuperior cava, a little above the origin of the azygos; the left comes from the fubclavia. The right fuperior diaphragmatica, or pericardio-dia- phragmatica, comes anteriorly from the root of the bi¬ furcation near the mediaftina; and is diftributed, by fe¬ veral branches, to the upper, fore, and back parts of the pericardium, communicating with thofe of the left diaphragmatica. The left fuperior diaphragmatica comes from the left fubclavian, a little below the origin of the mammaria. The right internal mammaria arifes anteriorly from the vena cava, a little below the angle of the bifurca¬ tion. It runs along the neareft internal or pofterior edge of the fternum, and on the cartilaginous extremities of the"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"PartIV. A N A T the right ribs, together with the artery of the fame name. Having reached near the diaphragm, it fends it a branch which runs toward the tendinous plane, and communi¬ cates with the common diaphragmatic veins. Afterwards this mammary vein gives fmall branches to the mediaftinum, and others between the ribs to the in¬ teguments ; of which thofe that pafs between and under the cartilages of the lad true ribs, run down on the in¬ ner or pofterior fide of the mufculi re« 5 ti abdominis, be¬ ing ramified among their flelhy fibres, and communica¬ ting with the epigaftric veins by feveral fmall twigs. The left internal mammaria arifes anteriorly from the left fubclavian, oppofite to the cartilage or anterior ex¬ tremity of the firft true rib. The right vena thymica, when it arifes feparately, goes out from the bifurcation; and when it is wanting, the thymus, from .whence it takes its name, is furnilhed by the gutturalis, or fome other neighbouring vein. This vein often reaches no lower than the inferior part of the thymus •, ?.nd the left vein of the fame name comes from the left fubclavian, almoft oppofite to the riernum.' The right pericardia feems to go out rather from the origin of the right fubclavian, than from the trunk of the fuperior cava. It goes to the upper fide of the pe¬ ricardium, and othermeighbouririg parts. The right gutturalis or trachealis goes out from the upper part of th£ bifurcation, above the mammaria of the fame fide, fometimes more backward,' and fometimes from the fubclavia. It is diftributed to the glandulae thyroidasae, trachea arteria, mufculi fterno - hyoidxi, thymus, and glandular bronchialcs. It communicates, by lateral branches, with the internal jugular vein. The left gutturalis comes from the upper or pofterior part of the left fubclavian, near its orign. The.right fubclavian vein is veryfhort, and its courfe very oblique, fo that it appears to rife higher than the left vein. It fends off, firft of all, four large branches, viz. the.vertebralis, which is the firlt and moft pofterior; the jugularis interna, jugularis externa,, and axillaris. The left fubclavian feems to afcend but very little after the bifurcation; and, in this courfe, it covers the origin of three large arteries, which come from the curvature of the aorta. It fends off four large branches, befides the fmall pe&oral veins, and receives the duffus thora- cicus. It likewife gives off, before its principal divifion, a fmall trunk for the left fuperior intercoftals, and this in- tercoftal trunk furnilhes likewife the left bronchialis. Each fubclavian vein, near the middle of the clavi- cula, fends off a branch, called cephalica, which de- fcends near the furface of the body, between the del- toides and pedtoralis major. Each external jugular vein arifes from the fubclavian on the fame fide, fometimes from the axillaris, and fome¬ times from the union of thefe two veins. They run up between the mufculus cutaneus and fterno-maftoidxus. Sometimes they are double from their very origins; and when they are fingle, each of them divides after¬ wards into two, one anterior, and the other pofterior, or rath;r fuperior, The anterior vein goes to the throat O M Y. 239 and face, running up toward the angle'of the lower jaw, and the polterior goes to the temples and occiput. The anterior external jugular vein is oftema branch of the jugularis interna, and fometimes it comes from the vena axillaris. It runs up toward the lateral part of the lower jaw, between the angle and the chin, and fends feveral branches forwards, backwards, and inwards. Polteriorly it gives, (1.) A large branch on the fide of the upper part of the larynx, which communicates with the jugularis interna, and likewife with a large Ihort branch'of the jugularis externa polterior. (2.) A fmall branch, which has the fame communication, but which is not always to be found. (3.) Another Imall branch a little below the lower jaw, which communicates with the jugularis externa polterior. Anteriorly it fends feveral branches to the mufcles of the larynx, fterno-hyoidxi, thyro-hyoidx, and to the in¬ teguments ; and below the larynx it fends communica¬ ting branches to the jugularis externa anterior of the'o- ther fide. A little higher, oppofite to the cartilago-thyroides, it gives off a tranlverfe branch, which tuns on the anterior and lower part of the mufculi fterno-maftoidxi, and com¬ municates with the jugularis of the other fide. The fuperior and inferior tranfverfe branches commu¬ nicate on each fide by branches more or lefs perpendicu¬ lar, and fend a fmall branch to the mufculus quadratus of the chin, to the mufculus cutaneus and integuments; It fends another • large branch anteriorly toward the fymphyfis of the lower jaw, which, after having fuppli- ed the maxillary glands, is diftributed to the digaiiric mufcle, to the chin and under lip. Interiorly, at the fame place, it fends out a large branch* which furnilhes the glanduls fublinguales, runs down to¬ ward the cornua of the os hyoides, to communicate with fome branches of the jugularis interna, and fends feveraL rami to the tongue, called vena ratlinx. It gives off likewife a fmall branch, which running upon the mufcu¬ lus labiorum triangularis, to the commiffure of the lips,' is diftributed to the neighbouring parts. The fame branch which gives out the venae raninae,. detaches another to the lateral parts of the feptum palati, which is diftributed to the amygdalae, and to the uvula, and fends rami forward to the membrane which lines the arch of the palate. Another branch goes out from it to the pterygoidaeus internus, periftaphylini, and cephalo- pharyngaei. Afterwards the trunk of the anterior external jugular vein runs up on the mufculus triangularis, where it re¬ ceives the name of vena triangularis, in a winding courfe, from the angle of the lower jaw to the great or internal angle of the orbit, fending branches on each fide to the. mufcles and integuments. The trunk of the vena angularis having reached the bones of the nofe, fends out a branch through the lateral cartilages of the nofe, which is diftributed to the nar.es; and another which runs down in a winding courfe to the upper lip. At the great or inner angle of the eye, the fame trunk fends off feveral other branches; the firft of which goes"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"to the root of the tiofe, and Communicating with its fel¬ low from the other fide* gives feveral fmail veins to the holes of the olfa nafi. The fecond branch runs up on the fore-head, by the name of vena frontalis, and is diftributed to each fide. The third branch enters the orbit in a winding courfe, 6 n one fide of the cartilaginous pulley, and communi¬ cates with the finufes of the dura mater, by the orbitary finus of the eye. The fourth branch goes along the mufculus fuperci- liaris and the upper part of the orbicularis, to the fmail dr external angle of the eye, to communicate with the vena temporalis, and with that vein which runs along the lower part of the orbicular mufcle. The pofterior or fuperior external jugular vein runs up toward the parotid gland, and lower anterior part of the eye, giving out feveral branches tow an? each fide. At its origin it fends out pofterioriy, a principal btanch, with its ramifications, to the mufcles which co¬ ver the fcapula and joint of the humerus, commonly called vena viufcularis . A little higher, it gives off the vena cervicalis, which goes to the vertebral mufcles of the neck. Near the cervical vein, but a little more outward, it gives off fometimes the fmail vena cephalica, which runs down between the pedtoralis major and deltoides, and u- nites with the vena cephalica of the. arm. Backward it detaches the vena occipitalis, which is di¬ ftributed on the occiput ; it Iikewife fends out a fmail vein, which enters the cranium by the pofterior maftoid hole, and terminates in one of the lateral finufes of the dura mater. Having reached as far as the parotid gland, it forms communications with the anterior external jugular, under the angle of the lower jaw; and then paffes through the parotid gland, between that angle and the condyle, gi¬ ving off a large branch which communicates with ano¬ ther branch common to the internal and anterior external jugulars. Afterwards it pafles before the ear, taking the name of vena temporalis , which is diftributed to the temples and lateral parts of the head, towards the occiput and fore¬ head. The temporal vein of one fide communicates, above, with its fellow on the other fide; before, with the vena frontalis; and behind, with the vena occipitalis. Oppo- fite to the ear, it gives out a large branch, one ramus of which runs under the lower edge of the zygoma, and then returning, communicates with another ramus from the fame jugularis, a little below the condyle of the low¬ er jaw. Behind this condyle, it gives branches to the temporal mufcle, to the neighbouring parts of the upper jaw, and to the infide of the lower jaw. The interned jugular vein is the largcft of thofe that go to the head. It runs up behind the fterno-maftoidseus and omo-hy- oidscus, which it erodes, along the fides of the vertebnfc of the neck, by the edge of the longus colli, to the fof- fula of the foramen lacerum of the balls cranii. The fiift branches which it fends off are fmail, and go 0 M Y. Part IV. to the thyroid glands. About two fingers breadth high¬ er up, it detaches a middle-fized branch, which runs la¬ terally towards the larynx, and may be named vena gut- t ura Its. ' This guttural vein divides chiefly into three branches; the lowelt of which goes to the thyroid gland and neigh¬ bouring mufcles ; the middle branch to the larynx, muf- culi thyroidsei, <bc. and the third runs upward to the great communication between the two jugulares. About the fame diftance upward, almoft oppofite to the os hyoides, the internal jugular gives another branch, which fends rami to the mulcles belonging to that bone, and others which communicate with the foregoing branch. This other branch runs upward toward the parotid gland and angle of the lower jaw, where it fends communica¬ ting branches forward and backward to the two external jugulares. The internal jugular fends another branch backward,, which is diftributed to the occiput, where it communi¬ cates with a branch of the vertebralis, and, through the pofterior maftoid hole, with the lateral finus of the du¬ ra mater. Afterwards it reaches the foramen lacerum of the ba- fis cranii, bending a little, and fending off Imall twigs to the pharynx and neighbouring mulcles. The vertebral vein arifes pofteriorly from the fubcla- via or axillaris, fometimes by two ftems. The firft and principal Item gives out a branch, called vena cervicalis , which is diftributed to the neighbouring mufcles, and afterwards runs up through the holes of the tranfverfe apopbyles of the vertebras colli. The other Item of the vertebial vein runs up on the fide of the vertebras; and having reached the fourth, or fometimes higher, it runs in between the tranlverfe apo- phyfes of that vertebra and the fifth, to join the firft or principal Item. Thus the vertebral vein accompanies the artery of the fame name, fometimes in one trunk, fometimes in feveral ftems, through all the holes of the tranfverfe apophyles of the vertebras colli, all the way to the great foramen oc- cipitale, communicating with the occipital veins and fmail occipital finufes of the dura mater. In its paffage it gives off one branch, which enters by the pofterior jsondyloid hole of the os occipitis, and com¬ municates with the lateral finus of the dura mater. As thefe veins run through the hoks in the tranfverfe apophyfes, they lend branches forward to the anterior mulcles of the neck, and to the fmail anterior mufcles of the head. Other branches go Iikewife outward and backward to the mufeuli tranfverfales and vertebiales colli; and in¬ ward to the great canal of the fpinal marrow, where they form finufes, which communicate with thofe on the other fide. Thefe vertebral finufes are pretty numerous, and pla¬ ced one above another all the way to the occiput; the lower communicate with the upper; and at the great foramen of the os occipitis there is a communication be¬ tween them and the occipital finufes of the dura mater. The fubclavian vein having fent off the branches al¬ ready deferibed, goes out of the thorax, and pafles be¬ fore"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Plate M , .m// A '"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Part IV. fore the anterior portion of the mtifculus fcalenus, and between the firft iib and the clavicle, to the axilla. Through this courfe it takes the name of vena axillaris, and gives off feveral branches, the chief of which are the venae mtsfculares, tboracicse, and vena cephalica. The rnufculares, are diitributed to the middle portion of the mufculus trapezius, to the angularis, infra-fpina- tus, and fubfcapularis; and as fome of thefe branches go to the fhoulder exteriorly, others interiorly, the ve¬ nae fcapulares are diftinguifhed into external and internal. A little before the axillaris reaches the axilla, it fends Out the venae thoracicae, one of which is fuperior, called alfo mammaria externa, and the other inferior. It like- wife fends rami to the mufculus fubfcapularis, teres ma¬ jor, teres minor, fupra-fpinatus, latiffimus dorfi, ferra- tus major, pefforalis minor, pettoralis major, and to the glands of the axilla. The axillaris having reached the fide of the head of the os humeri, produces a branch, nam tAvena cephalica, and afterwards runs along the arm by the name of vena bafiliea. The cephalic vein, which is a branch of the axillaris, at a fmall diftance from its origin, joins the fimll cepha¬ lica, which runs down from the fubclavia, or jugularis externa. The great cephalica runs down between the tendons of the laft mentioned mufcles, and along the outer edge of the external portion of the biceps; communicating feveral times with the vena bafiliea, and fending fmall rami on each fide, to the neighbouring mufcles, fat and fkin. A little below the external condyle of the os humeri, it detaches a branch backward, which runs up between the mufculus brach ; a lis and the upper portion of the fn- pinator longus, and afterwards bends back between the os humeri and anconeus externus, where it communi¬ cates with fome branches of the bafiliea. Having reached very near the fold of the arm, it is divided into two principal branches, one long, the other fhort. The long branch is named radialis externa , and the fhort one may be called mediana cephalica, to diftin- guifh it from another mediana, which is a fhort branch of the bafiliea. ' The external radial vein runs along the radius between the mufcles and integuments, giving off branches towards both fides, which communicate with other branches of the lame vein, and with fome from the bafiliea. The mediana cephalica runs down obliquely toward the middle of the fold of the arm, under the integu¬ ments, and over the tendon of the biceps, where it joins a fhort branch of the fame kind from the bafiliea. From this anaftomofis, a confiderable branch goes out, which runs down on the fore-arm, uniting on or.e fide WiWi the vena cephalica, and communicating on the o- ther with the bafiliea, by feveral irregular areolae. The name of mediana is given to this large branch, as well as to the two fhort ones, by the union of which it is formed. From this union of the two lateral medians, and fometimes from the origin .of the mediana media, a branch goes out, which runs down on the infide of the Vol. I. No. ii. a 2 4 £ fore-arm, oppofite to the interroffeous ligament, and is called vena cubiti profunda. It goes to the neighbour¬ ing mufcles, and communicates widi the other veins of the fore-arm. The-mediana cephalica fometimes fends down a long branch, called radialis interna, which lies almoft parallel to the radialis externa. Afterwards the cephalica, having reached the extre¬ mity of the radius, is diftributed, by numerous areolae, almoft in the fame courfe with the radial artery. A particular branch goes out from it, which runs more or lefs fuperficially between the thumb and metacarpus, by the name of cephalica pollicis. The areola: furnifii the interroffeous mufcles and integuments, and commu¬ nicate with a fmall ramus from the bafiliea, called by the ancients Salvatella. The bafilic vein fends off firft of all, under the head of the os humeri, a pretty large branch, which paffes al¬ moft tratftVerfely round the neck of that bone, from within backward, and from behind outward, running upon the fcapula, where it is ramified on the deltoides, and communicates with the venae fcapulares externa:. This branch may be named vena Jub-humeralis, or ar- ticn laris. This articular vein fends down two principal branches, one of which runs along the infide of the bone, to which, and to the periofteum, it gives fmall veins. The other turns forward, toward the middle of the arm between the bone and the biceps, and communicates with the ce¬ phalica. Below die neck of the os humeri, near the hollow of the axilla, and behind the tendon of the pe&oralis ma¬ jor, the bafiliea fends out a confiderable branch, which runs down on the fide of the brachial artery, and fur- nifhes the neighbouring mufcles on both fides. This vein is named profunda brachii. Immediately afterwards, the bafiliea detaches two or three fmall veins, which run down very clofely joined to the brachial artery, furrounding it at different diftances by fmall twigs which communicate with each other. Thefe fmall veins, which often arife from the profun¬ da fuperior, communicate with the bafiliea and cephalica; and having reached the fold of the arm, they divide like the artery; and the fame divilions are continued along the whole fore-arm. Afterwards the bafiliea continues its courfe along the in¬ fide of the os humeri, between the mufcles and integuments, forming many communications with the vena profunda and cephalica, and fupplying the mufcles and integuments. Having reached the inner condyle, and having fent off obliquely, in the fold of the arm, the mediana bafiliea, it runs along the ulna, between the integuments and muf¬ cles, a little toward the outfide, by the name oi cubit a- lis externa. The bafiliea having at length reached the extremity of the ulna, fends feveral branches to the convex fide of the carpus; one of which, named Salvatella, goes to that fide of the little finger next the ring finger, having firft communicated with the cephalica, by means of the venal areolae confpicuous on the back of the hand. In the other fingers this vein follows nearly the fame courfe with the arteries. 3 P ANATOMY. In"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"242 ANATOMY. Part IV. In general, the external or fuperficial veins of the fore¬ arm are larger than the internal. The inferior Vena Cava having run down about a quar¬ ter of an inch from the right auricle of the heart, with¬ in the pericardium, pierces that membrane and the ten¬ dinous portion of the diaphragm. At this place it gives off the vente diaphragmaticse, or phrenicae, which are diftributed to the diaphragm, and appear chiefly on its lower fide, one towards the right hand, and one towards thc left. The right vein is more backward and lower than the left. The left is diftribu¬ ted partly to the pericardium, and partly to the dia¬ phragm ; and fometimes they fend rami to the capfuls renales. The inferior cava having perforated the diaphragm, pafl’es through the pofterior part of the great fiffure of the liver, penetrating a little into the fubftar.ee of that vifeus, between the great lobe and the lobulus Spigelii. In its paffage, it fends off commonly three large branches, called vena hepatica, which are ramified in the liver. Befides thefe large branches, it fends out fomc other fmali ones, either before or immediately after it goes out of the liver. In the foetus, as the vena cava paffes by the liver, it gives off the duttus venofus, which communicates with the finus of the vena portae; and in adults is changed to a flat ligament. After its paffage. through the liver, the vena cava turns from before backward, and from right to left, to¬ ward the fpina dorfi, placing itfelf on the right fide of the aorta, which it accompanies from thence downward. Having got as low as the arteris renales, it gives off the veins of the fame name, termed formerly yen* e- rnulgentes. The right renal runs down a little obliquely, becaufe of the fituation of the kidney. The left vein croffes on the forefide of the trunk of the aorta, immediately above the fuperior mefenteric artery. They fend up the venae capfolares, which go to the glandulae renales, and downward; the venae adipofae, which go to the fatty covering of the kidneys; and ordi¬ narily the left renal vein furnifhes the left fpermatic vein. Afterwards they run to the finus, or cavity of the kid¬ neys, in the fubftance of which they are diftributed by numerous ramifications. A little below the renal veins, the trunk of the cava fends out anteriorly, toward the right fide, the right ve¬ na fpermatica. The left fpermatic vein comes common¬ ly from the left renalis. In their paffage, they fend feveral fmali branches on each fide, to the peritonaeum and mefentery, where they feem to be joined by anaftomofes with the vente mefa- raicae. The cava lends likewife off pofleriorly the vente lum- bares, which commonly arife in pairs. Thefe maybe divided into fuperior and inferior veins. Their origins vary in different manners. Sometimes the cava gives off a branch to each fide below the firft vertebra of the loins, which, like a common trunk, fur- nifties the lumbar veins. This branch communicates with the azygos. Sometimes a confiderable branch goes out from the lower extremity of the cava, near the bifurcation, chief¬ ly on the right fide, which afterwards running up be¬ tween the bodies and tranfverfe apophyfes of the vertebras, detaches the venae lumbares, and communicates with the azygos. Sometimes a like branch comes from the beginning of the left vena ilkica, and, running up on that fide in the fame manner, produces the lumbares. The venae lumbares on one fide communicate by tranf¬ verfe branches with thofe of the other fide, and likewife with each other by branches more or lefs longitudinal. The firft and fecond often go from the azygos, and thereby they communicate with the intercoftal veins. The lumhar veins lend fmali capillaries, in their paf¬ fage, to the fubftance of the bodies of the vertebras y and they are diftributed to the mufeies of the abdomen, quadratus lumborum, ploas, iliacus, &c. They fend branches backward to the neighbouring vertebral mufcles, and to the canal of the fpine, and communicate with the venal finufes. The inferior cava, having reached as low as the laft vertebra of the loins, and near the bifurcation of the aorta, runs in behind the right iliac artery, and there is divided into two fubaltern trunks, called the right and left iliac veins. From this bifurcation of the vena cava, the vena facra goes out, and accompanies the artery of the fame name in its diftribution to the os facrum, to the nerves which lie there, and to the membranes which cover both fides of that bone. Each original iliac vein is divided on the fide of the os facrum, much after the fame manner as the arteries, into two large trunks. One of thefe trunks is named vena iliaca externa or anterior ; the other interna or poflerior. Thefe veins follow nearly the courfe and diftribution of the iliac arteries, except that the hypogaftric vein does not fend off the vena umbilicalis. From the common trunk of the iliac veins, and fome¬ times from the origin of the iliaca externa, a particular branch goes out, which is diftrib&ted to the mufculuspfoas, iliacus, and quadratus lumborum ; and afterwards fends a ramus on the fore-fide of the laft tranfverfe apophyfis of the loins, to communicate with the laft lumbar vein. The external iliac, a little before it leaves the abdo¬ men, near the ligamentum Fallopii, lying on the pfoas and iliac mufcles, gives off almoft the fsme branches with the artery of the fame name, and follows the fame courfe. The chief branches are thefe: A little before it goes out of the abdomen, it fends off from the outfide, a fmali branch, which runs up a- long the crifta of the os ilium, and gives branches on each fide to the lateral and pofterior lower portions of the mufeuli abdominis, to the mufculus iliacus, fcse. From theinfide, before it leaves the abdomen, it fends off the vena epigaftrica; which having furnifhed fome fmali rami to the neighbouring conglobated glands, runs up along the infide of the mufeuli re< 5 ti, on which it is ramified both ways. Afterwards"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Part IV. A N A T Afterwards the vena epigaftrica runs upward, and joins the ramifications of the mammaria. Before the iliac vein gets from under the ligamentum Fallopii, it fends feveral fmall rami to the neighbouring lymphatic glands ; and immediately afterwards, lofing the name of iliaca, it takes that of cruralis. The hypogaftric, or internal iliac vein, runs behind the iliac artery, from which the following branches go out. From the pofterior or convex part of the arch, it gives a branch to the fuperior lateral part of the os facrum, which is diftributed to the mufculus facer, or tranverfo- fpinalis lumborum, and other mufcles thereabouts, and to the cavity of the bone, which it enters through the firft great hole. A little lower, on the fame fide, it fends out another, which is diftributed much in the fame manner with the former, and enters the fecond hole. From the external lateral part of die fame arch, a little anteriorly, it fends out a large branch, which runs behind the great fciatic finus, and is diftributed to the muf- culi glutsei, pyriformis, and gemelli. Lower down, the fame lateral part of the hypogaftric vein gives out another large branch, called obturatrix ; which, having run a little way, detaches feveral rami, and afterwards reaching the foramen ovale of the os in- nominatum, perforates the obturator mufcles, communi¬ cates with the vena cruralis, and is diftributed* to the mufculus pedlineus, triceps, and neighbouring parts. Among the branches fent off by the vena obturatrix, before it perforates the mufcles, one is fituated exterior¬ ly, which runs toward the fciatic finus, to the mufculus iliacus, the fuperior part of the obturator internus, and to the os ilium. Interiorly, the fame obturator vein fends off another branch, which is diftributed to the ureters, bladder, and internal parts of generation in both fexes. Laftly, the hypogaftric vein runs backward, and goes out of the pelvis, above the ligament which lies between the inferior lateral part of the os facrum and fpine of the ifehium. ^ It next fends, a large branch upward to the lower part of the os facrum, and two or more downward ; which, running behind the fame ligament, are diftributed to the buttocks, anus, neighbouring portion of the mufculus pedlineus, and to the external parts of generation. The veins that go to the anus, are termed hamorrhoi- dales externa ; they that go to the parts of generation, pudica interna. The external hasmorrhoidales commu¬ nicate with the internal veins of the fame name, which come from the fmall vena mefaraica. The crural vein goes out under the ligamentum Fal¬ lopii, .on the infide of the -crural artery, and immediate¬ ly gives fmall branches to the inguinal glands, the muf- culus pe< 5 lineus, and parts of generation. Thefe laft are termed pudiea externa, and evidently communicate with the internal veins of the fame name. About an inch below, where it leaves the abdomen, the crural vein produces a large branch, which runs down anteriorly between the integuments and the farto- O M Y. 24 J rius, following the dire&ion of that mufcle almoft all the way to the infide of the thigh. This branch having afterwards got beyond the con¬ dyles of the os femoris, runs down between the inte¬ guments and inner angle of the tibia, to the fore-part of the inner ankle, and is diftributed to the foot. All this large branch is named vena faphena, or faphena major. After the origin of the faphena, as the trunk of the crural veins runs down, it finks in between the mufcles, and is diftributed to all the inner or deep parts of the lower extremity, accompanying the crural artery to the very extremity of the foot. As the faphena is a vein of very large extent, we fh a ll here deferibe it altogether, and afterwards return to the vena cruralis. The vena faphena, in its paffage from the inguen to the foot, is covered only by the fltin and fat. Immedi¬ ately after its rife, it gives fmall veins to the inferior in¬ guinal glands; and then it gives out others more anteri¬ orly, which, running under the integuments, commu¬ nicate with each other by numerous areolae. The faphena, having run down on the thigh, as low as the middle of the fartorius, fends off to the fame fide feveral branches, which communicate with each other, and with the fuperior branches. Between thefe upper and lew'er branches, the faphena fends backward a particular branch; which, after being diftributed to the integuments which cover the gracilis internus and triceps, turns backward; and a little below the ham, runs in among the mufcles fituated there, and communicates with another branch, which may tc term¬ ed faphena minor. Afterwards the trunk of the great faphena runs down, on the infide of the tibia, lying always near the fkin ; and at the upper part of that bone it fends branches fore- ward, outward, and backward. The anterior branches go to the integuments on the upper part of the leg; the pofterior, to thofe which co¬ ver the gaftrocnemii, and communicate with the little faphena; and the external branches are likew'ife diftribu¬ ted to the fat and integuments, and having reached 33 low as the middle of the tibia, it fends a communicating branch to the trunk of the great faphena. From this communication, a branch goes out anterior¬ ly, which runs along the integuments of the tibia all the way to the outer ankle. As the faphena runs down on the infide. of the tibia, it fends out a branch near the middle of that bone, which runs up behind the tendons of the fartorious, gra¬ cilis internus, and femi-nervofus, then between the tibia and upper end of the foleus, and is joined by an anafto- mofis with the crural vein. At the lower part of the tibia, the faphena produces a coafiderable branch, which runs obliquely forward q- ver the joint of the tarfus toward the cuter ankle, fend¬ ing off feveral rami which communicate with each other, and with the trunk of the faphena. The extremity cf this trunk paffes on the forefide of the inner ankle, and runs irregulaily under the Hein, a- !ong"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"z : 44 A N A long the iafteriliee between the iirft two mstatarfal bones toward the great toe, where this vein terminates. The crural vein, having fent off the faphena, and the fmall branches for the pcdtineus, be. as has been faid, runs down on the thigh behind the crural artery. Op- polite to the -little trochanter, it produces two large fnort branches* or one which afterwards divides into two, whereof one is anterior, the other pofterior. The anterior branch runs more or lefs tranfverfely forward, to be diilributed to the vaftus internus, lower part of the pc&ineus, and of the fecond triceps, and to the other two mufcles of the fame name, running in be¬ tween them as it goes from one to another. The pofterior branch runs more or lefs tranfverfely backward, and furnifhes the glutei, vaftus externus, and beginning of the biceps. A little below thefe two branches, about the tipper ex¬ tremity of the vaftus internus, the crural vein produces a branch which runs down on the fide of the trunk, co¬ vering the crural artery, almoft as low as the ham, where it is again united to the trunk by an anaftomofis. It has the name of vena fciatica , from the fciatic nerve which it accompanies. On the outfide of this anaftomofis, the crural vein gives off a branch which runs backward between the bi- ceps and neighbouring mufcles, a*d fo downward on the backfide of the leg 4 little exteriorly, and very near the fkin, all the way to the outer ankle. This vein is term¬ ed faphena minor , or externa. The little faphena, having got near the integuments in its courfe downward, gives out a branch which runs backward, and communicates with the great faphena a- bout the middle of the backfide of the thigh. Immediately above and below the ham, this vein fends out other branches, which likewife communicate with the faphena major, and, having run down about one third part of the backfide of the tibia, it fends off another branch, which is afterwards re-united to the trunk. About the beginning of the tendo-achillis, the little faphena runs outward in the integuments, toward the outer ankles, where it terminates in cutaneous ramifica¬ tions fent to every fide. The crural vein, having detached the little faphena, runs down between the biceps and the other flexors of the leg, clofely accompanied\" by the crural artery, be¬ tween which and the inner condyle of the os femoris it is fituated. A little above the ham, it takes the name of vena po- plitea ; and as it runs down betwixt the two condyles, it gives branches to the flexor mufcles, to the lower and pefterior parts of both vafti, and to the fat which lies a- bove the interftices of the two condyles. It likewife gives off feveral other branches, one of which runs up laterally between the outer condyle and the biceps, and then turning forward, is ramified in the fame manner with the artery. The vena poplitea runs down immediately behind the mufcle of the fame name, at the lower part of which it fends off feveral ramifications to each fide, which di¬ vide and unite again in different ways; and afterwards it lofes its name, being divided into three confiderable branches, called tibialis anterior, tibialis pofterior, and per on tea. The anterior tibial vein, having diftributed fonie fmall branches from its very beginning to the mufcles behind the heads of the two bones of the leg, perforates the in- terofleous ligament from behind, forward, and runs be¬ tween the fuperior portions of the mufculus tibialis anti- cus, and extenfor digitorum communis. As foon as it pierces the interoffeous ligament, it di- ftributes fmall fuperficial branches to the head of the ti¬ bia and fibula, which run to the joint of the knee, and communicate with the lateral branches of the vena po¬ plitea. Afterwards it divides into two or three branches, which run down together on the forefide .of the interof¬ feous ligament in company with the anterior tibial arte¬ ry, which they furround at different diftances, by fmall communicating circles. Thefe branches having reached the lower extremity of the leg, unite in one, which afterwards divides into feve¬ ral, the ramifications of which are diftributed to the foot. The pofterior tibial vein gives off, from its beginning, a branch toward the infide, which is diftributed to the gaftrocnemii and foleus. This vein is named furalis. Afterwards the pofterior tibialis runs down between the foleus and tibialis pofticus, giving branches to each of them. It is divided in the fame manner as the tibi¬ alis anterior, into two or three branches, which, as they run, furround the correfponding artery, by fmall communicating circles formed at different diftanceB. It continues this courfe in company with the artery as low as the outer ankle, fornilhing the mufculut. tibialis pofticus, and the long flexors of the toes. Laftly, it paffes on the infide of the os calcis, undef the foie of the foot, where it forms the venae plantares, by dividing into feveral tranfverfe arches, which comma • nicate with each other, and with the faphena, and fend ramifications to the toes. The vena peronaea is likewife double, and fometimes -triple. It runs down on the infide of the fibula, which it likewife furrounds at different diftances, by communi¬ cating branches, after the manner of the tibialis pofterior. It runs down as low as the outer ankle, communicating feveral times with the tibialis pofterior, and fending rami¬ fications to the neighbouring portions of the mufeuli pe- ronaei, and long flexors of the toes. The vena porte is a large vein, the trunk of which is fituated chiefly between the eminencies on the lower or concave fide of the liver. It may be confidered as made up of two large veins, joined almoft endwife by their trunks, from each of which the branches and ramifications go out in oppofite directions. One of thefe trunks adheres to the liver, and is ramified in that vifeus, its branches accompanying the whole diftribution of the hepatic artery. The other trunk is without the liver, and fends its branches to the vifeera, fupplied by the reft of the arte- ria caeliaca, and by the two mefentericae, that is, to the ftoroach, inteftines, pancreas, fpleen, mefentery, and o- mentum.

T H E medullary fubftance of the brain is employed in forming the white fibrous cords, which are called nerves. Within the flcull we fee the nerves to be the medullary fubftance continued; and the fpinal mar¬ row is all employed in forming nerves. The nerves are compofed of a great many threads, lying parallel to each other, or nearly fo, at their exit from the medulla. This fibrous texture is evident at the origin of moft of the nerves within the flcull; and in the cauda equina of the fpinal marrow we can divide them into luch fmall threads, that a very good eye can fcarce perceive them; but thefe threads, when looked at with a microfcope, appear each to be compofed of a great number of fmaller threads. How fmall one of thefe fibrils of the nerves is, we know not; but when we confider that every, even the moft minute part of the body is fenfible, and that this muft depend on the nerves, (which all conjoined would not make a cord of an inch diameter), being divided in¬ to branches or filaments to be difperied through all thefe minute parts, we muft be convinced, that the nervous fibrils nre very fmall. The medullary fubftance, of which the nervous fibrils are compofed, is very tender, and would not be able to refill fuch forces as the nerves are expofed to within the bones, nor even the common force of the circulating fluids, were not the pia mater and tunica arachnoides continued upon them; the former giving them firmnefs and ftrength, and the latter furnilhing a cellular coat to connect the threads of the nerves, to let them lie foft and tnoift, and to fupport the veffels which go with them. It is this cellular fubftance that is diftended when air is forced through a blow-pipe thruft into a nerve, and that makes a nerve appear all fpongy, after being diftend¬ ed with air till it dries ; the proper nervous fibrils lhrivel- ing fo in drying, that they fcarce can be obferved. Thefe coats would not make the nerves- ftrong enough to bear the ftretching and preffure they are expofed to in their courfe to the different parts of the body ; and there¬ fore, where the nerves go out at the holes in the cranium and fpine,.the dura mater ^.generally wrapt clofely round them, to colledt their difgregatcd fibres into tight firm cords ; and that the tenfion which they may happen to be expofed to may not injure them before.they have got this additional coat, it is firmly fixed to the fides of the holes in the bones through which they pafs. The nervous cords, thus compofed of nervous fibrils, cellular coat, pia and dura mater, have fuch numerous blood-veffels, that, after their arteries only are injected, the whole cord is tinged of the colour of the injedled liquor. A nervous cord has very little elafticity, compared with feveral other parts of the body. When cut out of the body, it does not become obfervably Ihorter, while the blood-veffels contraft three eighths of their length. Nerves are generally lodged in a cellular or fatty fub¬ ftance, and have their courfe in the interftices of mufcles, where they are guarded from preffure; but in feveral- parts they are fo placed, as if it was intended that they Ihould there fuffer the vibrating force of arteries, or the preffure of the contracting fibres of mufcles. The larger cerds of the nerves divide into branches as they go off to the different parts; the branches being fmdler than the trunk from which they come, and ma¬ king generally an acute angle where they feparate. In feveral places, different nerves unite into one cord, which is commonly larger than any of the nerves which form it. Several nerves* particularly tliofe which are di- ftributed to the bowels, after fuch union, fuddenly form a hard knot confiderably larger than all the ncryes of which it is made.. Thefe knots were formerly called corpora olivaria, and are now generally named ganglions. The ganglions have thicker coats, more numerous and larger blood-veffels than the nerves ; fo that they appear more red and mufcular. Commonly numerous fmall nerves, which corjundly are not equal to the fize of the ganglion, are fent out from it, hut with a ftru&ure no way different froin that of other nerves. The nerves fent to the organs of the fenfes, lofe there their firm coats-, and terminate in a pulpy fubftance. The optic nerves are expanded into the foft tender webs, the retinae. The auditory nerve has fcarce the confidence of mucus in the veftibulum, cochlea,.and femicircular ca¬ nals- of each ear. The papillae of the nofe, tongue, and fltin, are very foft. The nerves of mufcles-can likewife be traced till they feem to lofe their -coats by becoming very foft ; from which, and what we obferved of the fenfatory nerves, there is reafi&n to conclude, that the mufcular nerves are - alfo pulpy at their terminations, which we cannot indeed profecute by di flection. Sect.."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"248 A N A T Sect. II. Of the particular Nerves. It is generally faid, that there are forty pair of nerves in all; of which ten come out from the encepha¬ lon, and the other thirty have their origin from the fpinal marrow. * Of the ten pair of nerves which come from the ence¬ phalon, the firji is the Olfactory, which have their origin from the corpof a ftriata, near the part where the internal carotid arteHes are about to fend off their branches to the different parts of the brain; and in their courfe under the anterior lobes of the brain, which have each a depreflion made for lodging them, become larger, till they are extended to the cribriform bone; where they fplit into a great number of fmall filaments, to pafs thr&igh the little holes in that bone; and being joined by a branch of the fifth pair of nerves, are fpread on the membrane of the nofe. The tender ftrudure and fudden expanfion of thefe nerves on fuch a large furface, render it impoflible to trace them far; which has made fome authors deny them to be nerves: But when we break the circumference of the cribriform lamella, and' then gently raife it, we may fee the diftribution of the nerves fome way on the mem¬ brane of the nofe. The contrivance of defending thefe long foft nerves from being too much prefled by the anterior lobes of the brain under which they lie, is Angular; becaufe they have not only the prominent orbitar procefles of the frontal bone to fupport the brain on each fide, with the veins going into the longitudinal finus, and other at¬ tachments bearing it up, but there is a groove formed in each lobe of the brain itfelf for them to lodge in —Their fplitting into fo many fmall branches before they enter the bones of the fluill, is likewife peculiar to them ; for generally the nerves come from the brain in difgregated filaments, and unite into cords, as they are going out at the holes of the bones. This contrivance is the beft for anfwering the purpofe they are defigned for, of being the organ of fmelling; for had they been expanded upon the membrane of the nofe into a medullary web, fuch as the optic nerve forms, it would have been too fenfible to bear the impreflions of fuch objefls as are applied to the nofe ; and a diftribution in the more common way, of a cord fending off branches, would not have been equal enough for fuch an organ of fenfation. _ The fiecond pair of nerves, the Optic, rifing from the thalami nervorum opticorum, make a large curve out¬ wards, and then run obliquely inwards and forwards, till they unite at the fore-part of the fella turcica; then foon divide, and each runs obliquely forwards and out¬ wards to go out at its proper hole in the fphenoid bone, accompanied with the ocular artery, to be extended to the globe of the eye, within which each is expanded into a very fine cuplike web, that lines all the infide of the eve as far forwards as the ciliary circle, and is univer- fallv known by the name of Retina. Though the fubftance of this pair of nerves feems to be blended at the place where they are joined; yet ob- fervations of people whofe optic nerves were not joined, and of others who were blind of one eye from a fault in O * M Y. Part V. the optic nerve, or in thofe who had one of their eyes taken out, make it appear, that there is no fuch intimate union of fubftance ; the optic nerve of the affected fide only being wafted, while the other was large and plump. And the fame obfervations are contradictory to the doc¬ trine of a decuffation of all the nerves, for the difeale could be traced from the affedted eye to the origin of the nerve on the fame fide. Thefe people whofe optic nerves were not joined, ha¬ ving neither feen objedts double, nor turned their eyes different ways, is alio a plain proof, that the conjunction of the optic nerves will not ferve to account for either the uniform motions of our eyes, or our feeing objects Angle with two eyes. The retina of a recent eye, without any preparation, appears a very fine web, with fome blood-veffels coming from its center to be diftributed on it; but, after a good injection of the arteries that run in the fubftance of this nerve, as is common to other nerves, it is with difficul¬ ty that we can obferve its nervous medullary fubftance. —The fituation of thefe veflels in the central part of the optic nerve, the want of medullary fibres here, and thp firmnefs of this nerve before it is expanded at its entry into the ball of the eye, may be the reafon why we do not fee fuch bodies, or parts o,f bodies, whofe picture falls or; this central part of the retina. The Third Pair rife from the anterior part of the proceflus annularis, and piercing the dura mater a little before, and to a fide of t|ie ends of the pofterior clinoid procefs of the fphenoid bone, run along the receptacula, or cavernous finufes, at the fide of the ephippium, to get out at the foramina lacera; after which each ofcthem divides into branches, of which one, after forming a little ganglion, is diftributed to the globe of the eye; the others are fent to the mufculus reCtus of the palpebra, and to the attollens, adduCtor, deprimens, and obliquus minor mufcles of the eye-ball. Thefe mufcles being princi¬ pal inftruments in the motions of the eye-lid and eye-ball, this nerve has therefore got the name of the Motor O- culi. The Fourth Pair, which are.the fmalleft nerves of any, derive their origin from the back-part of the bafe of the teftes; and then making a long courfe on the fide of the annular protuberance enter the dura mater a little far¬ ther back, and more externally than the third part, to run alfo along the receptacula, to pafs out at the foramina la- ” cera, and to be entirely fpent on the mufeuli trochleares, or fuperior oblique mufcles of the eyes. Thefe'muf¬ cles being employed in performing the rotatory motions, and the advancement of the eye-balls forward, by which feveral of our paffions are expreffed, the nerves that ferve them have got the name of Pathetici. The Fifth Pair are large nerves, rifing from die annular procefles where the medullary procefles of the cerebellum join in the formation of that tuber, to enter the dura mater near the point of the petrous procels of the temporal bones ; and then finking clofeby the receptacula at the fidesofthe fella turcica, each becomes in appearance thicker, and goes cut of theikull in three great branches. The firji branch of the fifth is the Ophthalmic, which runs through the foramen lacerum, to the orbit, having"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Part V. ANATOMY.- 249 having in its paflage thither a connexion with the fixth pair. It is afterwards diftributed to the ball of the eye with the third; to the nofe, along with the olfa&ory, which the branch of the fifth that pafles through the fora¬ men orbitarium internum joins, as was already mention¬ ed in the defcription of the fir ft pair. This ophthalmic branch likewife fupplies the parts .at the internal canthus of the orbit, the glandula lacrymalis, fat, membranes, mufcles, and teguments of the eye-lids; its longeft far- theft extended branch palling through the foramen fupperci- liare of the os frontis, to be diftributed to the forehead. The fecond branch of the fifth pair of nerves may be called MaxillarisSuperior, from its ferving princi¬ pally the parts of the upper jaw. It goes out at the round hole of the fphenoid bone, and fends immediately one branch into the channel on the top of the antrum maxil- lare ; the membrane of which and the upper teeth are fttp- plied by it in its paflage. As this branch isafaoutto go out at the foramen orbitarium externum, it fends a nerve through the fubftance of the os maxillare to come out at Steno’s du£t, to be diftributed to the fore-part of the palate ; and what remains of it efcaping at the external orbitar hole, divides into a great many branches, that fupply the cheek, upper lip, and noftril. The next eonfiderable branch of the fuperior. maxillary nerve, after giving branches which are refle&ed through the fixth hole of the fphenoid bone, to join the intercoftal where it is palling through the Ikull with the carotid artery, and the portio \"dura of fhe feventh pair, as it pafles through the os pe- trofum, is fent into the nofe by the hole common to the palate ajid fphenoidal bone •, and the remaining part of this nerve runs in the palato-maxillaris canal, giving off branches to the temples and pterygoid mufcles, and comes at laft into the palate to be loft. The third or Maxillaris Inferior branch of the fifth pair going out at the oval hole of the fphenoid bone, ferves the mufcles of the lower jaw, and the mufcles fi- tuated between the os hyoides and jaw: All the falivary glands, the amygdalae, and the external ear, have branches from it: It has a large branch loft in the tongue, and fends another through the canal in the fubftance of the lower jaw to ferve all the teeth there, and to come out at the hole in the fore-part of the jaw, to be loft in the chin and under lip. The Sixth Pa'ir, which is the fmalleft except the fourth, rifes from the fore-part of the corpora pyrami- dalia; and each entering the dura mater fome way behind ■ ’ ■ •h e pofterior clinoid procefs of the fpenoid bone, has a long courfe below that membrane, and within the recep- taculum at the fide of th'e fella turcica, where it is im- merfed in the blood of the receptacle: It goes afterwards out at the foramen lacerum into the orbit, to ferve the abduritor mufcle of the eye.—A defeat in this nerve may therefore be one caufe of a ftrabifmus.—In the paflage of this nerve below the dura mater, it lies very conti¬ guous^* the internal carotid artery, and to the ophthal¬ mic branch “of the fifth pair of nerves. At the place where me fixth pair is contiguous to the carotid, a nerve either goes from each of them in an uncommon way, to wit, with the angle beyond where it rifes obtufe, to de- feend with the artery; and to form the beginning of the Vol. I. No. 11. 3 intercoftal nerve, according to the common defcrip¬ tion ; or, according to other authors, this nerve comes up from the great ganglion of the intercoftal, to bejoined to the fixth here. The Seventh Pair comes out from the lateral part of the annular procefs behind where the medullary pro¬ cefs of the cerebellum are joined to that tuber; and each being accompanied with a larger artery than moft other nerves, enters the internal meatus auditorius, where the two large bundles of fibres, of which it appeared to confift within the Ikull, foon feparate from each other; one of them entering by feveral fma]l holes into the vefti- ble, cochlea, and lemicircular canals, is ftretched on this inner camera of the ear in a very foft pulpy fubftance; and being never feen in the form of a firm cord, fuch as the other parcel of this and moft other nerves become, is calledPoRTio Mollis of the auditory nerve. The other part of this feventh pair pafles through Ga¬ len’s foramen csecum, or Fallopius’s aquaedudt, in its crooked paflage by the'fide of the tympanum ; in which paf- fage, a nerve fent from the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, along the outfide of the tuba Eufta- chiana, and crofs the cavity of the tympanum, where it has the name of chorda tympani, is commpnly faid to be joined, to it. The very acute angle which this nerve makes with the fifth, or the fudden violent refledHon it would fuffer on the fuppofition of its coming from the fifth to the feventh, appears unufual; whereas, if we fuppofe that it comes from the feventh to the fifth, its courfe v/ould be more in the ordinary way, arid the chor¬ da tympani would be efteemed a branch of the feventh pair going to join the fifth, the fize of which is increa- led by this acquifition. This fmaller bundle of the feventh gives branches to the mufcles of the malleus, and to the dura’ mater, -while it pafles through the bony crooked canal,- and at laft comes out in a firm chord named Portio Dura, at the end of this canal, be¬ tween the ftyloid and maftoid procefl'es of the temporal bone, giving immediately filaments to the little oblique mufcles of the head, and tothofe that rife from the ftyloid procefs. It then pierces through the parotid gland, and divides into a great many branches, which are difperfed in the mufcles and teguments that cover all the fide cf the upper part of the neck, the whole face and cranium, as far back as the temples, including a eonfiderable part of the external ear. The Eighth Pair of nerves rife from the lateral bafes of the corpora olivaria in difgregated fibres; and as they are entering the anterior internal part of the holes common to the os occipitis and temporum, each is joined By a nerve which afeends within the dura rnater from the tenth of the head, the firft, fecond and inferior cervical nerves: This every body knows has the name of the Ner- vus Accessorius. When the twoget out of thelkull, the accefforius feparates from the eighth, and, defend¬ ing obliquely outwards, pafles through the fterno-maftoi- deus mufcle, to which it gives branches, and afterwards terminates in the trapezius and rhomboid mufcles of the fcapula. In this courfe it is generally more or lefs join¬ ed by the fecond cervical nerve. The large Eighth Pair, foon after its exit, gives 3 R- nerves"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"250 A N A T nerves to the tongue, larynx, pharynx, and ganglion of the intercoftal nerve, and being disjoined from the ninth and intercoftal, to which it adheres clofely fome way, runs ftreight down the neck behind the internal jugular vein, and at the external fide of the carotid artery. As xt is about to enter the thorax, a large nerve goes off from the eight of each fide: This branch of the right-fide turns round from the fore to the back part of the fubcla- vian artery, while the branch of the left-fide turns round the great curve of the aorta ; and both of them mounting up again at the'! de of the oefophagus, to which they give branches, are loft at laft in the larynx. Thefe are called the Recurrent nerves, which we are defired to ftiun in the operation of bronchotomy, though their deep fituation protedls them fufficiently. The eighth' pair, above, and at or near the place where the recurrent nerves go off from it, or frequently the recurrents themfelves, fend off fmall nerves to the peri¬ cardium, and to join with the branches of the intercoftal that are diftributed to the heart; but their fize and fi¬ tuation are uncertain. After thefe branches are fent off, the par vagum on each fide defeends behind the great branch of the trachea, and gives numerous filaments to the lungs, and fome to the heart in going to the oefophagus. The one of the left-fide running on the fore-part of the oefophagus, com¬ municates by feveral branches with the right one in its defeent to be diftributed to the ftomach : The right one gets behind the oefophagus, where it fplits and rejoins fe¬ veral times before it arrives at the ftomach, to which it fends nerves; and then being joined by one or more branches from the left trunk, they run towards the caeliac artery, there to join into the great femilunar ganglion formed by the two intercoftals. The Ninth Pair of nerves comes from the inferior part of the corpora pyramidalia, to go out of the lkull at their proper holes of the occipital bone. After their egrefs they adhere for fome way firmly to the eighth and intercoftal; and then fending a branch, that in many fubjefts is joined with branches of the firft and fecond cervical nerves, to be diftributed to the thyroid gland and mufcles on the fore-part of the trachea arteria, the ninth is loft in the mufcles and fubftance of the tongue. The Tenth Pair rifes in leparate threads from the fides of the fpinal marrow, to go out between the os oc- cipitis and firft vertebra of the neck. After each of them has given branches to the great ganglion of the in¬ tercoftal, 8th, 9th, and ift cervical nerves, it is diftri¬ buted to the ftreight, oblique, and fome of the extenfor mufcles of the head. The branch reflected from the fixth pair, joined pofli- bly by fome filaments of the opththalmic branch of the fifth, runs along with the internal carotid artery, through the crooked canal formed for it in the temporal bone, where the little nerve is very foft and pappy, and in feveral fubjedls divides and unites again, and is joined by one or more branches from the fifth particularly of its fuperior maxillary branch, before it comes out of the lkull. As foon as the nerve efcapes out of this bony canal, it is connected a little way with the eighth and ninth; then feparating from thefe, after feeming to receive addition- O M Y. Part V. al nerves from them, it forms a large ganglion, into which branches from the tenth of the head, and from the firft and fecond cervical, enter. From this ganglion the nerves come out again fmall, to run down the neck along with the carotid artery, communicating by branches with the cervical nerves, and giving nerves to the mufcles that bend the head and neck. As the intercoftal is about to enter the thorax, it forms another ganglion, from which nerves are fent to the trachea and to the heart; thefe defigned for the heart joining with the branches of the eighth, and moll of them palling between the two great arteries and the auricles, to the fubftance of that mufcle. The intercoftal after this confifting of two branches, one going behind, and the other running over the fore-part of the fubclavian artery, forms a new ganglion where the two branches unite below that artery, and then defend¬ ing along the fides of the vertebras of the thorax, re¬ ceives branches from each of the dorfal nerves; which branches appearing to come out between the ribs, have given the name of intercoftal to the whole nerve. Where the addition is made to it from the fifth dorfal nerve, a branch goes off obliquely forewards ; which being joined by fuch branches from the fixth, feventh, eighth, and ninth dorfal, an anterior trunk is formed, and palfes be¬ tween the fibres of the appendix mufculofa of the dia¬ phragm, to form, along with the other intercoftal and the branches of the eighth pair, a large femilunar gan¬ glion iituated between the caeliac and fuperior mefenteric arteries ; the roots of which are as it were involved in a fort of nervous net-work of this ganglion, from which a great number of very fmall nervous threads run out to be extended on the furface of all the branches of thofe two arteries, fo as to be eafily feen when any of the arteries are ftretched, but not to be railed from them by diffetfion; and thus the liver, gall-bladder, duodenum, pancreas, fpleen, jejunum, ilium, and a large lhare of the colon, have their nerves fent from this great folar ganglion or plexus. Several fibres of this ganglion, running down upon the aorta, meet with other nerves fent from the pofterior trunk of the intercoftal, which continues its courfe along the fides of the vertebra, they fupply the glandular re- nales, kidneys, and teftes in men, or ovaria in women; and then they form a net-work upon the inferipr mefen¬ teric artery where the nerves of the two fides meet, and accompany the branches of this artery to the part of the colon that lies in the left fide of the belly, and to the redlum, as far down as to the lower part of the pelvis. The intercoftal continuing down by the fide of the ver¬ tebrae of the loins, is joined by nerves coming from be¬ tween thefe vertebrae, and fends nerves to the organs of generation and others in the pelvis, being even joined with thofe that are fent to the inferior extremities. The Spinal Nerves rife generally by a number of difgregated fibres from both the Fore and back part of the medulla fpinalis, and foon after form a little knot or gan¬ glion, where they acquire ftrong coats, and are extend¬ ed into firm cords. They are diftinguifhed by numbers, according to the vertebras from between which they come out; the fuperior of the two bones forming the hole through, which they pafs, being the one from which the. number"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Part V. A N A number is applied to each nerve. There are generally faid to be thirty pair of them; feven of which come out between the vertebras of the neck, twelve between thofe of the back, five between thofe of the loins, and fix from the falfe vertebras. The First Cervical pair of nerves csmes out be¬ tween the fir ft and fecond vertebras of the neck ; and ha¬ ving given branches to join with the tenth pair of the head, the fecond cervical and intercoftal, and to ferve the mufcles that bend the neck, it fends its largeft branches backwards to the extenfor mufcles of the head and neck; fome of which piercing through thefe mufcles, run up on the occiput to be loft in the teguments here; and many fibres of it advance fo far forward as to be connedted with the fibrils of the firft branch of the fifth pair of the head, and of the portio dura of the auditory nerve. The Second Cervical is foon joined, by fome branches, to the ninth of the head and intercoftal, and to the firft and third of the neck; then has a large branch that comes out at the exterior edge of the fter- no-maftoidasus mufcle, where it joins with the acceflorius of the eighth pair; and is afterwards diftributed to the platyfma myoides, teguments of the fide of the neck and head, parotid gland, and external ear, being connedted to the portio dura of the auditory nerve, and to the firft cervical. The remainder of this fecond cervical is fpent on the levator fcapul® and the extenfors of the neck and head. Generally a large branch is here fent off to join the acceflorius of the eighth pair, near the fuperior angle of the fcapula. The Thi rd Pair of the neck pafles out between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae; having immediately a communication with the fecond, and fending down a branch, which being joined by a branch from the fourth cervical, forms the Phrenic nerve. This defcending, enters the thorax, between the fubclavian vein and ar¬ tery ; and then being received into a groove, formed for it in the pericardium, it has its courfe along this capfula of the heart, till it is loft in the middle part of the dia¬ phragm. The right phrenic has a ftreight courfe; but the left one is obliged to make a confiderable turn out¬ wards, to go over the prominent part of the pericardium, where the point of the heart is lodged.-The middle of the diaphragm fcarce could have been fupplied by any other nerve which could have had fuch a ftreight courfe as the phrenic has. The other branches of the third cervical nerve are di¬ ftributed to the mufcles and teguments at the lower part of the neck and top of the Ihoulder. The Fourth Cervical nerve, after fending off that branch which joins with the third to form the phrenic, and beftowing twigs on the mufcles and glands of the neck, runs to the jarm-pit, where it meets with the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh cervicals, and First Dorsal, that efcape in the interlaces of the mufeuli fealeni, to come at the arm-pit, where they join, lepa- rate, and rejoin, in away fcarce to be rightly exprefled in words; and, after giving feveral confiderable nerves to the mufcles and teguments which Cover the thorax, they divide into feveral branches, to be diftributed to all the r O M Y. 25 r parts of the fuperior extremity. Seven of thefe branches we lhall deferibe under particular names. 1. Scapularis runs ftreight to the cavitas ferr.ilu- nata of the upper cofta of the fcapula, which is a hole, in the recent fubjedf, by a ligament being extended from one angle of the bone to the other, giving nerves in its way to the mufcles of the fcapula. When it has palled this hole, it fupplies the fupra-fpinatus mufcle ; and then de¬ fcending at the anterior root of the fpine of the fcapula, it is loft in the other mufcles that lie on the dorfum of that bone. 2. Articularis finks downward at the axilla, to get below the neck of the head of the os humeri, and to mount again at the back-part of it; fo that it almoft furrounds the articulation, and is diftributed to the muf¬ cles that draw the arm back, and to thofe that raife it up. 3. Cutaneus runs down the fore-part of the arm, near the fkin, to which it gives off branches ; and then divides, on the infide of the fore-arm, into feveral nerves, which fupply the teguments there, and on the palm of the hand. 4. Musculo-Cutaneus, or perforansCajferi, paf- fes through the coraco-brachialis mufcle ; and, after fup- plying the biceps flexor cubiti and brachiseus internus, pafles behind the tendon of the biceps, and over the ce¬ phalic vein, to be bellowed on the teguments on the out- fide of the fore-arm and back of the hand. 5. Muscularis has a fpiral courfe from the axilla, under the os humeri, and backward to the external part of that bone, fupplying by the way the extenfor mufcles of the fore-arm, to which it runs between the two bra- chiaei mufcles, and within the fupinator radii longus.— At the upper part of the fore-arm, it fends off a branch, which accompanies the fupinator longus till it comes near the wrift, where it pafles obliquely over the radius, to be loft in the back of the hand and fingers. The princi¬ pal part of this nerve pierces through the fupinator radii brevis, to ferve the mufcles that extend the hand and fingers, whofe actions are not injured when the fupinator afts. 6. ULNARis is extended along the infide of the arm, to give nerves to the mufcles that extend the fore-arm, and to the teguments of the elbow: Towards the lower part of the arm, it Hants a little back-ward, to come at the groove behind the internal condyle of the os humeri, through which it runs to the ulna: In its courfe along this bone, it ferves the neighbouring mufcles and tegu¬ ments ; and as it comes near the wrift, it detaches a branch obliquely over the ulna to the back of the hand, to be loft in the convex part of feveral fingers. The larger part of the nerve goes ftreight forward to the in¬ ternal fide of the os pififorme of the wrift; where it fends off a branch which finks under the large tendons in the palm, to go crofs to the other fide of the wrift, ferving the mufeuli lumbricales and interoflei, and at lalt ter¬ minating in the ftiort mufcles of the thumb and fore- fin¬ ger. What remains of the ulnar nerve, after fupplying the Ihort mufcles of the little finger, divides into three branches; whereof two are extended along th« fides of the Iheath of the tendons of the flexors of the little fin¬ ger, to furnilh the concave Ude of that finger; and the third"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"2 5 ? A N A T third branch is difpofed in the fame way upon the fide of the ring-finger next to the little finger. When we lean or prefs on the internal condyle of the os humeri, the numbnefs and prickling we frequently feel, point out the courfe of this nerve. 7. Radiahs accompanies the humeral artery to the bending of the elbow, ferving the flexors of the cubit in its way ; then paffing through the pronator radii teres mufcle, it gives nerves to the mufcles on the fore-part of the fore¬ arm, and continues its courfe near to the radius, bellow¬ ing branches on the circumjacent mufcles. Near the wrill, it fometimes gives off a nerve, which is diftribu- ted to the back of the hand, and the convex part of the thumb, and feveral of the fingers, inftead of the branch of the mufcular. The larger part of this nerve, palling behind the annular ligament of the wrill, gives nerves to the (hort mufcles of the thumb; and afterwards fends a branch along each fide of the Iheath of the tendons of the flexors of the thumb, fore-finger, mid-finger, and one branch to the fide of the ring-finger, next to the middle one, to be loll on the concave fide of thofe fingers. Though the radial nerve paffes through the pronator mufcle, and the mufcular nerve fecms to be Hill more un¬ favourably placed within the fupinator brevis; yet the. action of thefe mufcles do not feem to have any effetf in hindering the influence of thefe nerves, for the fingers or hand can be bended while pronation is performing vigo- roully, and they can be extended while fupmation is ex- ercifed. The manner of the going off of thefe nerves of the fingers, both from the ulnar and radial, is, that a fingle branch is fent from the trunk to the fide of the thumb and little finger, farthell from the other lingers; and all the reft are fupplied by a trunk of a nerve, which fplits into two fome way before it comes as far as the end of the metacarpus, to run along the fides of different fin¬ gers that are neareft to each other. It might have been obferved, that, in defcribing the pofterior branches of the ulpar and mufcular nerve, we did not mention the particular fingers, to the convex pa,rt of which they are diftributed. The reafon of this omif- fion is, the uncertainty of their dillribution ; for though fometimes thefe pofterior branches go to the fame fingers, to the concave part of which the anterior branches of the ulnar and radial are fent, yet frequently they are diftri¬ buted otherwife. The fituation of thefe brachial nerves in the axilla, may let us fee how a weaknefs and atrophy may be brought on the arms by a long continued preffurc of crutches, or fuch other hard fubftances on this part; and the courfe of them from the neck lo the arm, may teach us, how much better effe&s veficatories, or ftimu- lating nervous medicines, would have, when applied to the lkin, covering the tranfverfe proceffes of the verte¬ bras of the neck, or at the axilla, than when they are put between the fhoulders, or upon the fpinal proceffes, in convulfions or palfies of the fuperior extremities, where a ftimulus is required. The Twelve Dorsal nerves of each fide, as foon as they efcape from between the vertebras, fend a branch O M Y. Part V. forward to join the intercoflal, by which a communica¬ tion is made among them all; and they foon likewife give branches backyards - to the mufcles that raife the trunk of the body, their principal trunk being extended outwards, to come at the furrow in the lower edge of each rib, in which they run toward the anterior part of the thorax, between the internal and external intercoflal mufcles, giving off branches in their courfe to the muf¬ cles and teguments of the thorax. The First dorfal, as was already obferved, is parti¬ cular in this, that it contributes to form the brachial nerves; and that the two ^branches of the intercoftal, which come down to the thorax, form a confiderable ganglion with it. The Six lower dorfal nerves give branches to the dia¬ phragm and abdominal mufcles. The Twelfth joins with the firft lumbar, and bo- ftows nerves on- the mufculus quadratus lumborum and iliacus internus. As the intercoftal is larger in the thorax than any where elfe, and feems to diminilh gradually as it afeends and defeends, there is caufe to fufpeft that this is the trunk from which the fuperior and inferior pairs are feet as branches. The Five Lumbar nerves on each fide communicate with the intercoftal and with each other, and give branches backwards to the loins. The First communicates with the laft dorfal, fends branches to the abdominal mufcles, to the pfoas and ilia¬ cus, and to the teguments and mufcles on the fore-part of the thigh; while its principal branch joins with the other nerves, to form the crural nerve. The Second Lumbar nerve paffes through the pfoas mufcle, and is diftributed nearly in the fame way as the former : as is alfo the Third. Branches of the fecond, third, and fourth, make up one trunk, which runs along the fore-part of the pelvis; and, palling in the notch at the fore-part of the great hole common to the os pubis and ifehium, is fpent bn the addu<£lor mufcles, and on the teguments on the infide of the thigh. This nerve is called the Obturator, or Posterior Crural Nerve. By united branches from the jfr/?, fecond, third, and fourth lumber nerves, a nerve is formed that tuds along the pfoas mufcle, a> efcape with the external iliac veffels out of the abdomen, below the tendinous arcade of the external oblique mufcle. This nerve, which is named the Anterior Crural, is diftributed principally to the mufcles and teguments on the fore-part of the thigh. A branch, however, of this nerve runs down the infide of die leg to the upper part of the foot, keeping near' to the vena faphsena; in opening of which with a lancet at the ankle, the nerve is fometimes hurt, and occafions lharp pain at the time of the operation, and numbnefs afterwards.

Some way above the ham, where it has the name of the poplitteut nerve, it fends off a large branch that paffes over the fibula, and finking in among the mufcles on the anterior external part of the leg, runs down to the foot, to be loft in the up¬ per part of the larger toes, fupplying the neighbouring mufcles and teguments every where in its paffage.

Uses of the Nerves. Many experiments concur in proving, that the nerVes are the inftruments of fenfation. As to the mode of their operation, feveral different theories have been given. Some fuppofe, that they are elaftic cords, refembling fiddle- ftrings; and that they convey fenfations to the brain by a kind of vibratory motion. Others have fuppofed them to be tubular, and to contain a fluid called animalfpirits ; and that fenfation is produced by the motions and coun¬ ter-motions of this fluid. Many ufelefs volumes have been wrote upon each of thefe hypothefes.—Another and more recent theory fuppofes, that the nerves are not tubular, but that they are pervaded by a fubtile elaftic fluid called JEther ; and that fenfation, be. are occafroned by the of- cillations of that fluid.

Of fuch Parts of the Body as could not properly be deferibed under any of the former general Divifions. Sect. I. Of the common Integuments. THE SKIN. T H E fkin is a fubftance of very large extent, made up of feveral kinds of tendinous, membranous, vafcular, and nervous fibres, the intertexture of which is £0 much the more wonderful, as it is difficult to unfold; for their directions are as various as thofe of the fluff of which an hat cenfifts. This texture is what we commonly call leather, and it makes, as it were, the body of the fkin. It is not ea- fily torn, may be elongated in all directions, and after¬ wards recovers itfelf, as we fee in fat perfons, in women with child, and in fwellings; and it is thicker and more compact in fome places than in others. Its thicknefs and compadtnefs are not, however, al¬ ways proportionable ; for on the pofterior parts of the body, it is thicker and more lax than on the fore-parts; and on the palms of the hands, and fole 3 of the feet, it is both very thick and folid. The outer furface of this fubftance is furnifhed W'ith fmall eminences, which anatomifts have thought fit to call papilla, in which the capillary filaments of the cu¬ taneous nerves terminate by fmall radiated pencils. Tliefe papillae differ very much in figure and difpofi- tion in the different parts of the body, and they may be diftinguifhed into feveral kinds. The greateft part cf them is Sat, of different breadths, and feparated by fulci, which form a kind of irregular lozenges. The pyramidal figure aferibed to thefti, is not natural, and appears only when they are contracted by oold or by difeafes. The papillae of the palm of the hand, of the foie- of the foot, and of the fingers and toes, are higher than on the other parts of the body; but they are likewife fmaller, clofely united together, and placed as it were endwife, with refpect to each other, in particular rows, which reprefent on the fkin all kinds of lines, ftraight, crooked, waving, fpiral, <cc. Thcfe feveral lines are often diftin&ly vifible in thofe parts of the palm of the hand which are next the lirft phalanges of the fingers. Tjie red part of the lips is made up of papillss, repre- fenting very fine hairs or villi, clofely united together. There is another particular kind under the nails; the papillae being there more pointed, or in a manner conical, and turned obliquely towards tlis ends of the fingers. U Thofe"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A T Thofe which are found in the hairy fcalp, fcrotum, <bc. are ftill of other kinds. The papillae of the firft and fecond kinds appear to be furrounded at their bafes by a foft mucilaginous and, pretty vifcid fubftance, which fills the imeiltices between them, and reprefents a kind of net-work or iievc, the- malhes or holes of which furround each papilla.. Tins fubftance is commonly called corpus reticulure, or mu-, eofitn. This vafcular texture is of various forms .and figures in the different parts of the body. The inner furface of the fkin is covered by very finaU tubercles, commonly called cutaneous glands, or glan¬ dule miliar es. . Thefe tubercles are partly fixed in fmall foffulse, in the fubftance of the fkin, which anfwer to the fame number of fmall cavities in the corpus adipofum. Their excretory duds open on the outer furface of the fkin, fometimes in the papillae, and fometimes on one fide of them. The great eft part of them furnifhes fweat, and others a fatty oily matter of different thickneffes, as in the hairy fcalp, in the back, behind the ears, and at the lower part of the nofe, where this matter may be fcjueezed out, in form of fmall worms. Befides thefe corpufcles, there are other fmall folid bodies, almoft of an oval figure, contained in the fub-, ftanCe of the fkin. Thefe are the roots or bulbs from v/hence the hairs arife, and fome of them are fituated within the inner furface of the fkin. The fkin has feveral confiderable openings, fome of Which have particular names; fuch as the fifl’ure of the palpebrae, the nares, the mouth, the external foramen of the ears, the anus, and openings of the parts, of ge¬ neration. Befides thefe, it is perforated by an infinite number of fmall holes, called pores , which are of two kinds. Some are more or lefs perceivable to the naked eye; fuch as the orifices of the milky duds of the mammae, the ori¬ fices of the excretory canals of the cutaneous glands, and the paffages of the hairs. The other pores are imperceptible to the naked eye, but vifible through a microfcope ; and their exiftence is likewife proved by the cutaneous tranfpiration, and by the effeds of topical applications; and from thefe two phaenomena, they have been divided into arterial and ve¬ nal pores. THE CUTICULA, OR EPIDERMIS. The cutfide of the fkin is covered by a thin tranfpa- rent web, clofely joined to it, which is called epidermis, tuticula, 'Or the fearf-fkin. The fubftance of the cuticula appears to be very uni- fprm on the fide next the /kin, and to be compcifcd on the other fide of a great number of very fine fmallfi|ua- mous laminae, without any appearance of a fibrous or vafcular texture, except fome fmall filaments, by which it is conneded to the papillae. This fubftance is very folid and compad, but yet ca¬ pable of being extended and thickened, as vve fee by O M Y. 255 fteeping it in water, and by the blifterS raifed on the fkin by veficatories. It yields very much in fwellings; but not fo much as the fkin, without breaking or crocking. Hard and reiterated fridions loofen it infenfibly, and prefently afterward, a new ftratum arifes, which thrulls; the firft outward, and may itfelf be loofened and thru!! outward by a third ftratum, and fo on The epidermis adheres very clolely to the cutaneous papillae, from which it may be feparated by boiling; or by fteeping, for a long time, in cold water. It adheres ftill clofer to the-corpus reticulare, which is eafily raifed along with it; and they feem to be true portions or continuations of each other. The. epidermis covers the fkin through its whole ex¬ tent, except at the places where the nails lie. It is. marked with the fame furrows and lozenges as the fkin, and has the fame openings and pores; and though it may\" be faid to pafs the bounds of the fkin, where it is conti¬ nued inward, through the great openings, yet at thefe places it lofes the name of epidermis. When we examine narrowly the fmall pores or holes, through which the fweat partes, the epidermis feems to enter thefe, in order to compleat the excretory tubes of the cutaneous glands.- The fertilise of the hairs have likewife the fame productions of the, epidermis, and it feems to give a fort of coat or bark to the hairs them- felves. Laftly, the almoft imperceptible duCts of the cu¬ taneous pores are lined by it. USES OF THE SKIN. It is chiefly and properly the filamentary fubftance, called the body of the fkin, which is the univerfitl inte¬ gument of the body, and the bafis of all the other cuta¬ neous parts; e,a.ch of which has its particular ufes. • The fkin is able to refill external injuries to a certain degree, and fuch impreifions, fiiCtions, ftrokes, 6c. to which the human body is often liable, as would hurt, wound, and diforder the parts of which it is compofed, if they were not defended by the fkin. / The papilhe.are the organ of feeling, and contribute to an univerfal evacuation, called infenfible tranfpiration. They likewife ferve to tianfinit from without, inwards, the fubtle particles or iinpreflions of fome things applied to the fkin. The firft of thefe three ufes depepds on the extremities of the nerves, the fecond on the.arterial’ productions, and the third on the productions of the veins. The cutaneous glands fecrete an oily humour of differ-, ent confidences, and they are likewife the origin of fweat. The epidermis ferves to keep the pencils or nervous fi¬ laments of the papilke in an even fituaticn, and without eonfufion; and it hkewife moderates the irnprefiions of external objeCts. Another ufe of the epidermis is to regulate the cuta¬ neous evacuations already mentioned, the moft confider- able of which is infenfible tranfpiration. THE MEMBR AN A^AD IPOS A, AND FAT. The fecond uniyerfal integument of the human body,, b"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"256 is the membrana adipofa, or corpus adipofum. This is not, however, a (ingle membrane, but* a congeries of a great number of membranous laminae, joined irregularly to each other at different dillances, fo as to form nume¬ rous interfaces of different capacities, which communicate with each other. Thefe interftices have been named cel- lulx, and the fubftance made up of them, the cellulous fubfiance. The thicknefs of the membrana adipofa is not the fame all over the body, and depends on the number of laminae of which it is made up. It adheres very clofe¬ ly to the (kin, runs in between the mufcles in general, and between their feveral fibres in- particular, and com¬ municates with the membrane which lines the infide of the thorax and abdomen. The ftrudture is demonftrated every day by butchers, in blowing up their meat, when newly killed; in doing which, they not only fwell the membrana adipofa, but the air infinuates itfeif likewife in the interftices of the mufcles, and penetrates even to the vifeera, producing a kind of artificial emphyfema. Thefe cellular interftices are fo many little bags or fatchels, filled with an undtuous or oily juice, more or lefs liquid,- which is called fat. This fubftance increafes in quantity in the body, by reft and good living; and on the contrary, diminifhes by hard labour and a fpare diet. The proportional differences in the thicknefs of this membrana adipofa, are determined, and may be obferved to be regular in fome parts of the body, where either beauty or ufe required it. Thus we find it in great quantities, where the inter¬ ftices of the mufcles would otherwife have left difagree- able hollow or void places ; but being filled, and as it were padded with fat, the (kin is raifed, and an agree¬ able form given to the part. In fome parts of the body the fatferves for a cuftiion, pillow, or mattrefs ; as on the buttocks, where the lami¬ nae and cells are very numerous. The fat is likewife of great ufe to the mufcles, in pre- ferving the flexibility neceffary for their adtions, and in preventing or leffening their mutual fridtions. THE NAILS. The fubftance of the nails is like that of horn, and they are compofed of feveral planes of longitudinal fibres foddered together. Thefe ftrata end at the extremity of each finger, and are all nearly of an equal thicknefs, but of different lengths.. The external plane or ftratum is the longeft, and the reft decreaie gradually, the innermoft being the (horteft; fo that the nail increafes in thicknefs from its union with the epidermis, where it is thinneft, to the end of the fin> ger, where it is thickeft. The graduated extremities or roots of all the fibres of which thefe planes confill, are hollowed for the reception of the fame number of very fmall oblique papillae, which are continuations of the true Ikin, which having reached to the root of the nail, forms a femilunar fold, in which that root is lodged. Part VI. After this femilunar fold, the lkin is continued on the whole inner furface of the nail. The fold of the Ikin is accompanied by the epidermis, to the root of the nail exteriorly, to which it adheres very clofely. Three parts are generally diftinguifhed in the nail, the root, body, and extremity. The root is white and in form of a crefcent; and the greateft part of it is hid un¬ der the femilunar fold already mentioned. Tlie crefcent and the fold lie in contrary diredtions to each other. The body of the nail is naturally arched, tranfparent, and appears of the colour of the cutaneous papillae which lie under it. The principal ufe of the .nails is to ftrengthen the ends of the fingers and toes, and to hinder them from being inverted towards the convex fide of the hand or foot, when we handle or prefs upon any thing hard. THE HAIRS. The hairs belong as much to the integuments as the nails. They are a kind of reeds or ruffles, the roots or bulbs of which lie toward that fide of the Ikin which is next the membrana adipofa. The trunk or beginning of the ftem perforates the Ikin, and the reft of the ftem ad¬ vances beyond the outer furface of the (kin, to a certain diftance, which is very various in the different parts of the body. When the different hairs are examined by a micro- fcope, we find the roots more or lefs oval, the largert extremity being either turned toward, or fixed in the corpus adipofum. This oval root is covered by a whitifli ftrong membrane, in fome meafure elaftic; and it is connedtcd either to the Ikin, to the corpus adipofum, or to both, by a great number of very fine vefl'efs and nervous filaments. Within the root, we obferve a kind of glue, fome very fine filaments of which advance toward the fmall extremity, where they unite and form the ftem, which paffes through this fmall extremity to the flein. As the ftem paffes through the root, the outer membrane elongated in form of a tube, which clofely invefts the ftem, and is entirely united to it. The ftem having reached the furface of the Ikin,' pierces the bottom of a fmall foffula between the papil¬ lae, or fometimes a particular papilla, and there it meets the epidermis, which feems to be inverted round it, and to unite with it entirely. A fort of undtuous matter tranfudes through the fides of the foffula, which is be- ftpwed on the Item, and accompanies it, more or lefs, as it runs out from the Ikin, in form of an hair. Sect. II. Of the Abdomen. The Abdomen begins immediately under the thorax, and terminates at the bottom of the pelvis of the offa in- nominata. Its circumference, or outer furface, is di¬ vided into regions, of which there are three anterior, viz. the epigaftric or fuperior region, the umbilical or middle region, and the hypogaftric or lower region. There' is but one poftgrior region, named regio lumbaris. ANATOMY."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANA The epigaftric region begins immediately under the appendix enfiformis, at a fmall fuperficial depreflion, call¬ ed the pit of the ftomach, and ends above the navel at a tranfverfe line, fuppofed to be drawn between the laft falfe ribs on each fide. This region is fubdivided into three parts; one middle, named epigaftrium ; and two lateral, termed hypochon¬ dria. The epigaftrium 'takes in all that fpace which lies between the falie ribs of both fides, and the hypochon¬ dria are the places covered by the falfe ribs. The umbilical region begins above the navel, at the tranfverfe line already mentioned, and ends below the navel at another tranfverfe line, fuppofed to be drawn parallel to the former, between the two criffae of the os ilium. This region is like wife divided into three parts ; one middle, which is properly the regio umbilicalis ; and two lateral, called ilia, or the flanks; and they comprehend the fpace between the falfe ribs and upper part of the os ilium on each fide. The hypogaftrtc region is extended downward from the inferior limit of the umbilical region, and is divided into three parts ; one middle, called pubis; and two la¬ teral, called inguina, or the groins. The lumbar region is the pofterior part of the abdo¬ men, and comprehends all that fpace which reaches from the lowert ribs on each fide, and the laft vertebra of the back, to the os facrum and neighbourings parts of the ofla ilium. The lateral parts of this region are termed the loins, but the middle part has no proper name in men. Laftly, the bottom of the abdomen, which anfwers to the pelvis of the fkeleton, is terminated anteriorly by the pudenda or parts of generation, and polteriorly by the dunes and anus. The buttocks are feparated by a fofla, which leads to the anus; and each buttock is ter¬ minated downward by a large fold, which diftinguifhes it from the reft of the thigh. The fpace between the anus and the parts of genera¬ tion, is called perinasum, and is divided into two equal lateral parts by a very diftinCt line, whidi is longer in males than in females. The cavity of the abdomen, formed by the parts al¬ ready mentioned, (all which are covered by the fkin and membrana adipofa) is lined on the infide by a parti¬ cular membrane, called peritonaeum. It is feparated from the cavity of the thorax by the diaphragm, and ter¬ minated below by the mufculi levatores ani. This cavity contains the ftomach, and the inteftines. It contains likewife the mefentery, mefocolon, ‘omentum, liver, gall bladder, fpleen, pancreas, glands of the me¬ fentery, vafa laCtea, receptaculum chyli, kidneys, renal glands, ureters, bladder, and the internal parts of ge¬ neration in both fexes. The whole fore-part of the abdomen forms an oblong convexity, like an oval vault, more or lefs prominent in the natural ftate, in proportion to the quantity of fat up- pn it, and of food contained in it, or to the different degrees of pregnancy in women. The hypogaltric and -umbilical regions are more-fubjoCtto thefe varieties, than the epigaftric region. Vol. I. Numb. li. TOM Y. 257 The appendix enfiformis of the fternum, the cartilagi¬ nous portions of the laft pair of true ribs, thofe of the firft four pairs of falfe ribs, all the fifth pair, the five lumbar vertebrae, the ofla innominata, the os facrum, and os coecygis, form the bony lides of the cavity of the abdomen. The diaphragm, the mufcles called particularly muf¬ culi abdominis, the quadrati lumborum, pfoai, iliaci, the mufcles of the coccyx, and of the inteftinum reCtum, form the chief part of the circumference of this cavity, The cavity of the abdomen is of an irregularly oval figure, but ftill fymmetrical. On the forefide it is uni¬ formly arched or oval, and its greateft capacity is even with the. navel, and nearelt part of the hypogaftrium. On the upper fide it is bounded by a portion of a vault, very much inclined. On the backfide, it is in a manner divided into two cavities by the jutting out of the ver¬ tebrae of the loins. On the lower fide, it contrails gra¬ dually all the way to the little edge of the pelvis, and from thence expands again a little as far as the 03 coccygis and tubercles of the ifehium, terminating in the void fpace between thefe three parts. PERITONAEUM. Having carefully removed the mufcles of the abdo¬ men, the\" firft thing we difeover is the peritonaeum, a membranous covering, which adheres immediately to the inner furface of the mufculi tranfverfi, and of all the 0- ther parts of this cavity; and involves and inverts all the vifeera contained therein, as in a kind of bag. The peritonaeum in general is a membrane of a pretty clofe texture, and yet very limber, and capable of a very great extenfion ; after which it can recover itfelf, and be. contracted to its ordinary fize; as we fee in pregnancy, dropfies, corpulency, and repletion. It feems to be made up at leaft of two portions, one* internal, the other external; which have been looked upon by many anatomifts as a duplicatnre of two dif- tindt membranous laminae. But, properlyfipeaking, the internal portion alone deferves the name of a mem¬ branous lamina, as being the main body cf the perito¬ naeum. The external portion is no more than a kind of fibrous or follicular apophyfis of the internal; and may properly enough be termed the cellular fubftance of the peritonaeum. The true membranous lamina, commonly called thej internal lamina, is very fmooth, and polilhed on that fide which is turned to the cavity and vifeera of the abdomen, and continually moiftened by a ferous fluid difeharged through almolt imperceptible pores. The cellular fubftance, or external portion of the peri¬ tonaeum, adheres very clofely to the parts which form the infides of the cavity of the abdomen. The cellular fubftance has feveral elongations, which have been called productions of the peritonaeum. Two of thefe productions accompany and invert the fpermktie ropes in males, and the vafcular ropes, commonly called the round ligaments, in women. There are other two, which pafs under the ligamentum Failoppii, with .the 3 T criirai 3"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"258 A N A T crural veflels, which they involve, and are gradually loft in their courfe downward. To thefe four productions of the cellular fubflance of the peritonaeum, we may add a fifth, which is fpread on the neck of the bladder, and perhaps a fixth, which ac¬ companies the inteftinum reftum. All thefe elongations pafs out of the cavity of the abdomen, and may be termed external, to diftinguifh them from others that remain in the abdomen, and are called internal, of which hereafter. The great blood-veflels, that is, the aorta and vena cava, are likewife involved in this cellular fubftance of the peritonseum. In a word, it involves immediately and frparately all the parts and organs which are com¬ monly faid to lie in the duplicature of the peritonseum. It has-, neverthelefs, prouudtions of its own, but they are very different from thofe of the cellular fubftance ; for they run from without, inward, that is, they advance from the convex fide of the great bag of the peritonseum, into the- cavity of that bag, fome more, fome lefs, and alfo in different manners; as if the fides of a large ball, or bladder were thruft inward into the cavity of the ball or bladder.. Of thefe internal elongations or intropreflions of the true lamina of the peritonaeum, fome are fimply folded, like a duplicature ; fome are expanded like inverted bags Or facculi to contain fome vifcus ; fome begin by a fimple duplicature, and are- afterwards expanded into a cavity, which contains fome organ ; fome are alternately extend¬ ed in the form of fimple duplicatures, and of cavities; and laftly, fome form-only a fmall eminence on the inner furface of the great cavity of the peritonaeum. The chief u^es of the peritonaeum are, to line the ca¬ vity of tire abdomen, to invert the vifcera contained in that cavity as in a common bag, tofupply them with particular coats, to form productions, ligaments, con¬ nexions, folds, vaginae, <bc. The fine fluid which tranfudes through the whole in¬ ternal furface 1 of the peritonaeum, prevents the inconve¬ niences which might arife from the continual frictions and motions to which the vifcera of the abdomen are expofed either naturally or by external impulfes. VENTRICULUS/or stomach. The ftomach is a great bag or refervoir, fituated partly in the left hypochondrium, and partly in the epigaftrium. The figure of the ftomach is like that of a bag-pipe, oblong, incurvated, large and capacious at one end, and fmall and contracted at the other. The curvature of the ftomach gives us occafion to di- ftingnifti two arches in it; one large, which runs along the greateft convexity ; and one fmall, direCtly oppofite to the former. The fides of the ftomach, are the two lateral portions which lie between the two arches. The ftomach has two extremities, one large, and one fmall like a crooked funnel. It has two openings, cal¬ led the orifices of the ftomach, one between the great extremity and the fmall curvature, the other at the end of the fmall or contracted extremity. The firft opening O M Y. Part VL is a continuation of the cefophagus; the other joins the inteftinal canal, and is called pylorus. The great extremity of the .ftomach is in the left .hy¬ pochondrium, and for the moil part immediately under the diaphragm. The fmall extremity of the ftomach does not reach to the right hypochondrium. It bends obliquely backward, toward the upper orifice, fo that the pylorus lies about two fingers breadth from the body of the vertebrae im¬ mediately under the fmall portion of the liver, and con- fequently lower down, and more forward than the o- ther orifice by alnioft the fame diftancc. . According to this natural fituation, the ftomach, efpe- cially when full, lies fo as that the great curvature is turned more upward than downward, and the fmall cur¬ vature more backward than upward. One of the lateral convex fides is turned upward, the other downward; and not forward and backward, as they appear in dead bodies, where the inteftines do not fup- part them in their natural fituation. The ftomach is compofed of feveral parts, the chief of which are the different ftrata which form its fubftance, to which anatomills give die name of tunicte or coats. ,Thefe coats are commonly reckoned to be four in num¬ ber, the outer or-common, the flefhy or mufcular, the nervous or aponeurotic, and the villous or inner coat; and they are afterwards fubdivided feveral ways. The firft or outermoft coat is fimply membranous, be-, ing one of the internal productions of the peritonseum. The fecond or mufcular coat is made up of feveral. planes of fibres, which may all be reduced to two, .one external, the other internal. I he external coat is longitu¬ dinal, though in different refpeCts, following nearly the direction of the curvatures and convexities of the fto¬ mach ; and the internal plane is tranfverfely circular. Between the outer and inner planes, round the fu- periour orifice, there are two diftinCt planes, about the breadth of a finger, and very oblique, which furround this orifice in oppofite directions, and interledt each o- ther where they meet on the two lateral fides. Along the middle of each lateral fide of the fmall extremity, there runs a tendinous or ligamentary flat portion, above a quarter of an inch in breadth, which terminates in the pylorus. Thefe two portions lie be¬ tween the common and mufcular coats, and adhere very ftrongly to the firft. Between the fame two coats, there is a cellular fubftance which adheres very clofely to the external coat, and infinuates itfelf between the flsihy fibres of the fe¬ cond, all the way to the third. The third coat, called commonly tunica nervofa, fu- ftains, on its convex fide, a very large reticular diftri- bution of capillary veflels and nerves. On the concave fide, it feems to be of a very loofe texture, and as it were fpungy or filamentary, containing a great number of fmall glandular bodies, efpecially near the fmall curva¬ ture and fmall extremity of the ftomach. The fourth coat of the ftomach is termed villofa, be-, caufe, when it fwims in clear water, fome have imagined they faw fomething in it like the pile of velvet. Thefe two coats are of a larger extent than the two ; fiqnner."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Part Vi. ANA former, .and they join in forming large rugae on the con¬ ave furface of the ftomach, the greateft part of which re tranfverfe, though irregular and waving. In the interfticcs of tliefe rugae,, there is often found a fort of flimv mucus, with which the whole cavity of the ftomach feems like wife to be moiftened. This mu¬ cus is much more fluid in living bodies, and is fupplied by the glands of the ftomach, It is termed fuccus gaftri- cus or ftomachicus. Oil the inner furface ,of the fmall extremity of the fto¬ mach, at the place where it ends in the inteftinal canal, we obferve a broad, thin, circular border, with a roundifh hole in the middle. This hole is the inferiour orifice of the ftomach, called, by the Greeks pylorus, which figni- fies a porter. This border is a fold or duplicature of the two inner coats of the ftomach, the nervofa .and viljofa ; and it is formed in part by a fafciculus of flefhy fibres fixed iri the duplicature of the tunica nervola, and diftinguifhed not only from the other flefhy fibres of the extremity of •the ftomach, but alfa from thofe of the inteftines, by a tbin, whitifh circle, which apppears even through the exter¬ nal or common coat, round the union of the ftomach and inteftines. The figure of the pylorus is that of a ring, tranfverfe- ly flatted, the inner edge of which, or that next the center, is turned obliquely toward the inteftines, like a broad portion of a funnel. This inner edge runs na¬ turally more or lefs into little plaits or gathers, like the mouth of a purfe almoft fhut. It is therefore* kind of fphincter, which can contrail the inferior orifice of the ftomach, but feems not capable of fliutting it quite clofe. The ftomach receives in general whatever the mouth fends thither, through the canal of the cefophagus; but its partciujar ufe is to receive the aliments, to contain them for a longer or fhorter time, in proportion as they are more folid or fluid, and to digeft them, that is, to put them in a condition to be turned into that nutritious fluid called chyle. This operation, which goes by the general name of digeftion, and by which chylification begins, is perform¬ ed partly by the fuccus gaftricus, which flows continually from the tunica villofa, and partly by the continual contraction and relaxation of the mufcular coat. The pylorus, or flefhy circle of the inferiour orifice of the ftomach, ferves to retain the aliments in it, till they have acquired a fufficient degree of fluidity to pafs eafily through thr.S-opening. The gentle and alternate motions of the orbicular fi¬ bres of the mufcular coat, may afiift in fending through the pylorus, in the natural .way, the aliment that is fuffi- cienrly digefted. This was called the periftaltic or vermi¬ cular motion, by thofe who believed that it is fucceflively reiterated, like that of earth-worms when they creep. The fituation of the ftomach, which is nearly tranf¬ verfe, is likewife of ufe in making the aliment remain long enough in that cavity, and may ferve to make the length of this flay in feme meafure arbitary, by means of the different poftures of the body;' for when we lie on the left fide, the aliment mufl remain longer, than when we lie on the right, £, c. TOUT 2 59 The Intestines in general, and Inteftinum, Duodenum in particular. Between the pylorus and the very loweft part of the abdomen, lies a long canal, bent in a great many dif¬ ferent directions, by numerous convolutions or turnings, called theinteftin s. This canal, thus folded and turned, forms a confider- able bulk, which fills the greateft part of the cavity of the abdomen; and it is connected, through its whole extent, to membranous productions or continuations of the peri¬ tonaeum, principally to thofe called the mefentery and mefocolon. The incurvations of the inteftinal canal form two arches, a fmall one by which it is connected to the mefen¬ tery and mefocolon, and a great one on the oppofite fide, which lies loofe. The whole canal is generally about feven or eight times as long as the body. The inteftines in general are compofed of feveral coats, much in the fame manner with the ftomach. The firft and outermoft is a continuation of the mefen¬ tery, or of feme 'other elongation or duplicature of the peritonamm. This is commonly termed the common coat; and it has a cellular fubftance on its inner furface, like that of the ftomach. The fecond coat of the inteftines is flelhy or mufcular, and made up of two planes, one external, the other in tcrnal. The external plane is very thin, and its fibres longitudinal; the internal plane is thicker, and its fi¬ bres run tranfverfely round the circumference of the in¬ teftinal cylinder. The third coat is called nervofa, and is fomething like that of the ftomach. It has a particular plane, which ferves as a balls to fuftain it, made up of very fine, ftrong, oblique fibres, which feem to be of the li¬ gamentary or tendinous kind. This coat fuftains two reticular febftances which are both vafcular, one arterial, the other venal, accompanied by a great number of nervous filaments. Thefe vefl’els and nerves are productions of the mefenteric veflels and nerves; and as they furround the whole canal of the in¬ teftines, feme anatomifts have formed them into a diftinCt coat, by the name of tunica vafculofa. The nervous coat fends off from its inner furface a great number of portions of fepta, more or lefs circu¬ lar, which contribute to the formation of what are cal¬ led valvulae conniventes. . The fourth or innermoft coat is very feft, and is na¬ med tunica villofa. It has the fame extent with the third coat, which fupports it, and it lines all the fepta of that third coat. The fmall inteftines form ope continued uniform canal; and though three portions of it have three different names, yet we have no fufficient marks whereby to di- ftinguifh them, to fix the precife extent or length of each portion, to fettle its juft limits. The firft and fhorteft portion of the whole canal-, is called duodenum; the fecond, which is much longer, jejunum; and the third, which is fiill longer than the fecond, ileum."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"z5o A N A T The duodenum having arifen from the pylorus, is im¬ mediately bent a little backward, and obliquely down¬ ward ; then it bends a fecond time toward the right kid¬ ney, to which it is a little conne&ed, and from thence palfes before the renal artery and ve n, afcending infen- fibly from right to left, till it gets before the aorta and laft vertebrae of the back. It continues its courfe obliquely forward, by a gentle turn. Through this whole courfe, the duodenum is firm¬ ly bound down by folds of the peritonaeum, efpecially by a tranfverfe duplicature which gives origin to the me- focolon. The villi of this inteftine are thicker than in the Ho¬ rn ach ; but the texture of them in man is not like hairs, as they are commonly reprefented in figures; but ra¬ ther like that of a fungous granulated fubftance, com- pofed of an infinite number of very fine papillae of dif¬ ferent figures, in which we fee, through a microfcope, a multitude of depreffed points or pores, by which their whole furface feems to be pierced. By the fame help we obferve, on different places of the inner furface of this inteftine, feveral round vil¬ lous tubercles, rifing like fmall verucse at different di* ftances from each other. This fubftance fuftains an infinite number of capillary veffels, of different kinds; for befides. the blood-veffels, we fometimes obferve a great number of white* fila-. ments which run through it, and end at its inner furface, l;ke fo many capillary roots of the veffels, called venae lafteae. The internal furface of the duodenum is furnifhed with a great number of fmall flat glandular tubercles, raifed on the fides, and depreffed in the middle, by a kind of foffula; and they are more numerous near the be¬ ginning of this inteftine than any where elfe. Thefe glands appear like little bladders, with the ori¬ fices turned toward the cavity of the inteftine, and the bodies fixed in the fpungy fubftance next the ner¬ vous coat. They furnilh a particular vifcid fluid. In the inner furface of the duodenum, almoft at the lower part of the firft incurvation, and on the Ihorteft fide, there is a longitudinal eminence, in the point or apex of which lies a particular opening, which is the ori¬ fice of the dudtus bilarius, within which the duftus pan- .creaticus likewife opens. INTE STINUM JEJUNUM. The jejunum, fo called, b caufe it is oftener found empty than the ilium, begins at the laft incurvation of the duodenum, and is there connected to the beginning of the mefocolon. From thence it bends downward from left to right, and obliquely forward, orfiom the vertebrae, and makes feveral convolutions, which lie chiefly in the upper part of the umbilical region. Through all this courfe it is connefted to the mefentery. The jejunum and ilium may be diftinguifhed by divi¬ ding both inteftines into five parts; and to allow nearly two fifths to the jejunum, and three fifths and a little more to the ileum. o M Y Part vi. The coats of the jejunum are nearly of the fame ftruc- ture with thofe of the duodenum,-but thinner. INTESTINUM ILEUM. The convolutions of the inteftinum ileum furrou'nd thofe of the jejunum on the two lateral and lower fides, and it paffes in a winding courfe from the left fide, by the hypogaftrium, to the right fide, where it terminates a little below the right kidney, joining the inteftina craffa. The ftru&ure of the ileum is much the fame with that of the jejunum ; only the internal duplicaturep or valvulae conniventes decreafe gradually both in number and fize. The Intestina Crassa in general, and Inteftinum cae¬ cum in particular. The great inteftines are one continued canal, divided into three poitions, like the fmall ones. This canal be¬ gins by a kind of facculusor bag, which is reckoned the firft of the three portions, and called caecum. The fe¬ cond portion, called colon, is the longeft of the three, and is diftinguilhed from them by a great number of par¬ ticular eminences or convexities, which appear on its outer furface through its whole length. The laft portion is named re&um, being more uniform, narrower, thicker,' and much fhorter than the colon. The ftrufture of the great inteftines is nearly the fame with that of the fmall ones, in regard both to the num¬ ber and difpofition of their coats. They are fhorter, and have fewer convolutions, but are much more capa¬ cious. The coats in general are ftronger, but efpecially the mufcular coat. The inteftinum caecum is only a round fhort broad bag, the 'bottom of which is turned downward* and the mouth or opening upward. It lies under the right kidney, and is hid by the laft convolution of the. ileum. It is about three fingers breadth in length, and its diameter is more than double that of the fmall in¬ teftines. On one fide of the bottom of the caecum lies an ap¬ pendix, refembling a ;mall inteftine, nearly of the fame length with the caecum, but very flender. It is termed appendicula vermiformis, from its fuppofed refemblance to an earth-worm. Its common diameter is not above a quarter of an inch. By one extremity it opens late¬ rally, and a little obliquely, into the bottom of the cae¬ cum ; and the other extremity is clofed, being fometimes greater, fometimes fmaller, than the reft of the appendix. Through the membranous or common coat of the cae¬ cum, we fee three white ligamentary bands, which adhere very clofely both to the outer and mufcular coat. One of them is hid by the adhefion of the mefocolon ; and all the three divide the caecum longitudinally into three parts more or lefs equal. They all unite in the appendicula vermiformis, and cover its whole outer fide immediately under the common coat."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANA T O M Y. 261 INTESTINUM COLON. The colon is the mod confiderable of all the inteftines. From the cascum, of which it is a continuation, it reaches, in form of an arch, above the umbilical region, and To the lower part of the left hypochondrium. Its continuity is however a little interrupted by the ileum, which advances into the cavity of the colon, and, together with-a certain fold of that inteftine, forms what is called valvula coli. The whole convex fide of the colon is divided longi¬ tudinally into three pafts, by three ligamentary bands, continued from thofe of the caecum, and of the fame ftructure with thefe. Two of the three bands run on each fide, along the great curvature of the colon; and the third along the ima'll curvature. Thefe three longitudinal bands do the office of fraena, between which this inteftine is through its whole length alternately deprefled into tranfverfe folds, and raifed in¬ to confiderable eminences. All the folds are duplica- tures, which form portions of valvulae conniventes in the cavity of the inteftine ; and the eminences form recep¬ tacles, called the cells of the colon. The common coat, on one fide, is a continuation of the mefocolon ; and, on the other fide, it contributes, by the fame continuation, to form the omentum. The arch of the colon begins under the right kidney, near the haunch. It runs up on the forefide of that kid¬ ney to which it is connected, pafles under the veficula fellis, which tinges it with a yellow colour at that place, and continues its courfe before the firft incurvation of the duodenum, to which it adheres, and partly hides it. In this part of its courfe, therefore, there is a remark¬ able connexion between the colon, duodenum, right kidney, and veficula fellis. From thence the arch of the Colon runs before the great convexity of the ftomach,- and fometimes a little lower ; then turns backward under the fplecn, in the left hypochondrium ; runs down on the forefide of the left kidney, to which it is connected; below this kidney turns toward the vertebrae, and terminates th^re by a double incurvation, or by two oppofite convo¬ lutions, which reprefent in fome meafure an inverted ro¬ man S. At the place v/here the caecum joins the colon, one portion of the circCmference of both is deprtfied, and forms a large fold on the infide, which advances into the cavity of the inteftine. It is a little open in the middle, and its extremities are very thick, by reafon of the mutual duplicatm e of the coats of the caecum and colon. The extremity of the ileum is as it were grafted in the opening of this fold, and ftrongly united to its fides by the adhefion of its tranfverfe fibres to the tranfverfe fibres of the caecum and colon. This union forms a pretty thick ring, which likewife advances into the common cavity of the caecum and co¬ lon, where it is wrinkled or formed into gathers, al- moft like the lower extremity of the celophagus, the pylorus or infide of the anus. Its circumference is more or lefs oval ; and, by a kind of continuity with the com- Vol. I. Numb. n. mon fold of the caecum and colon, it forms two pro¬ ductions, which M. Morgagni calls the fraena of the valvula coli. The membranous-coat pf the extremity of the ileum is continued on the caecum and colon, without finking into any fold, at die place where the ileum enters the colon. This valvulacoli is contrived to hinder the return of the excrements into the ileum ; it produces this effeCt part¬ ly as a valve, and partly as a kind of fphinCter. The capacious arch of the colon is contracted by both extremities to the regio lumbaris, near the kidneys, by two particular ligaments, one on the right fide, the other on the left, which are only fmall duplicatures of the peri¬ tonaeum, more or lefs tranfverfe. The remaining portion, which forms the two con¬ volutions in form of the roman S, contracts below the left kidney, being narrower there, than lower down. The coats of this portion become gradually thicker and ftronger., and likewife the ligamentary bands, which ap¬ proach each other by degrees, and feem to increafe in breadth. INTESTINUM RECTUM and ANUS. The laft of all the inteftines, is named reCtum, or the ftreight gut, which, properly fpeaking, is a true conti • nuation of the laft convolution of the colon ; and it is the repofitory, fink, and common fewer, of the whole intefti- The reCtum having pafled below the laft vertebra of the lojns, to the infide of the os facrum, is bent back¬ ward on that concave fide to which it is connected ; and having reached the os coccygis, it runs likewife in the direction of that bone, and bends a little forward, ter¬ minating beyond the extremity of the coccyx. The figure of this inteftine varies according as it is. full or empty. When empty, it is irregularly cylindri¬ cal, and links in by a kind of tranfverfe folds ; and in that ftate, it is about three fingers breadth in diameter, more or lefs. When full, it is wider in proportion to the quantity of faeces, wind, or whatever elfe is contained in it; and it may be extended to the fize of a large bladder., fo as to reprefent a kind of ftomach. The membranous coat often contains a great quantity of fat, fpread between it and the mufcular coat, and forming round the inteftine numerous eminences, in the room of the appendices adipolar of the colon. The mufcular or flefhy coat is very thick : the longi¬ tudinal fibres, which in the. other inteftines are very thi i, are in this ftronger than the circular fibres of the reft. The ligamentary bands continue to increafe in breadth, and to approach each other. The nervous or filamentous and internal coats, are larger here, than in the other inteftines; and when, the reCtum is empty, they form a great number of waving ru¬ ga; in its cavity, which difappear, in proportion as that cavity is filled. The innermoft coat is very improperly termed villofa, ■ and fcarce deferves the name of papillaris, becaufe of the fmallnefs of the little corpufdes fpread on its fur face '3 3 U It"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"-A 262 A N A T It contains a great number of fingl or folitary glands; 'and it is always moiftened by a mucus of different con¬ fluences difcharged by thefe glands or folliculi. Near the extremity of this inteftine, the rugs or folds become in a manner longitudinal; and at laft, to¬ wards the circumference of the inner margin 0 / the anus, they form little bags or femilunar lacunae, the openings of which are turned upward, toward the cavity of the inteftine. Thefe lacunae are fomething like thofe at the lower extremity of the ccfophagus, or upper orifice of the ftomach. At length the extremity of the rectum contracts, and terminates by a narrow orifice called the anus, the fides of which are difpofed in clofe folds or gathers. This extremity of the inteftine has fereral mulcles belonging to it, fome of which fufround it like fphinXcrs, the reft are broad flefhy planes inferted in it, and which being likewife fixed to other parts, fuftain it in its natural fi- vuation, and reftores it to that fituation when aifturbed by the force neccffary for the exclufion of the faeces. Thefe latter mufcles are.termed levatores ani, the firft go by the general name of fphinXers. Thefe fphinders are three in number, one inteftinal or oibicular, and two cutaneous or oval; whereof one is large, fuperior, and internal; the ether fmall, inferi¬ or, and external. The inteftinal or orbicular fphinXer of the anus, con- flfts merely in an augmentation of the inferior portion of the flefhy fibres of the extremity of the reXum. The cutaneous ligament goes out anteriorly, from the extremity of the cs coccygis. It is very flender, and divides into two portions at the orifice of the anns, which run into the membrana adipofa, and are inferted in the fkin on each fide of the anus, by a kind of expan- fion ; and continuing to divaricate, they are loft on the two fides of the ptritona:um. The interoffeous ligameut of the ofla pubis is a very ftrong triangular membrane, fixed by two of its edges in the inferior rami of thefe bones, all the way up to their common fymphyfis. The third edge, which is theloweft, is loofe ; and this whole membrane, the middle of which is perforated by a particular hole, is ftrctched very tight between the two bones, and under their cartilaginous arch, to which it adheres very clofely. At the lower part of this interoffeous ligament, along its whole lower or loofe edge, lies a digaftric mufcle, fixed by its two extremities in the rami of the ofla pubis, its middle tendon lying on the middle of the edge of the ligament. The cutaneous fphinXcrs have each an anterior and pofterior infertion, ending both ways in a kind of point, and comprehending the orifice of the anus between their middle portions. They are diftinguifhed from each other by their fitua¬ tion, by their fize, and by a kind of white cellular line. The greateft of the two appears to be double, and the fmalleft lies neareft the fkin, and adheres moll clofely to it. They are inferted backward, partly in the apex of the os coccygis, and partly in the contiguous portion of the cutaneous ligament of that bone. Forward their chief O M Y. Part VI. infertion is in the middle tendon of the tranfverfalis ure¬ thrae; and they have likewife fome connexions, to other mufcles of the urethra. - 7 he levatores ani are broad, thin, mufcular portion*, fixed by. one extremity of their flefhy fibres round the concave fide of the inferior portion of the pelvis, from the fymphyfis of the ofla pubis, beyond the fpine of the ifehium. The other extremity of thefe fibres runs down on each fide behind, and under the curvature of the end of the reXum, where they meet together, and unite from the bafis of the os coccygis all the way to the margin of the anus. We ought likewife to remark, that the margin or edge of the anus is formed by the union of the lkin and epi¬ dermis with the internal coat of the redlum ; fo that the moft fuperficial portion of that coat feems to be a conti¬ nuation of the epidermis. MESENTERIUM & MESOCOLON. This great bundle of inteftincs is not left to move at random in the cavity of the abdomen; but artfully bound down by a membranous web, which prevents the intefti¬ nal convolutions from being intangled in each other, and from being twilled or comprefied in all their different ways of meeting; and yet allows them a gentle floating, but limited motion. This web is diftinguilhed into two portions; one of which, being very broad and very much plaited, connects the fmall inteftines ; the other, which is long and incur- vated, does the fame office to the greater inteftines. Thefe two portions arc in reality only one and the fame continuation of the membranous lamina of the peri¬ toneum doubled back upon itfelf, and they are diftin¬ guilhed only by their breadth. Taken both together, they form a kind of fpiral roll, more or lefs plaited in its circumference. The firft portion has retained the name of mefentery, the other is termed mefocolon. The mefentery begins at the laft incurvation of the duodenum, and runs obliquely from left to right, along the vertebrae of the loins. In this fpace, the membra¬ nous portion of the peritonaeum is detached on both hands, produces a duplicature by two elongations or particular laminae applied to each other, and thu,s forms the mefentery. It is narrow at its upper and lower parts, but chiefly at the upper. The middle portion is very broad, and the edge of it next the inteftines is every where very much plaited. Thefe plaits or folds are only waving in¬ flexions, fuch as may be obferved in the edge of a piece of fhamoy, which has been often drawn through the fin¬ gers. They make this edge of the mefentery very long, and they run through about one third of its breadth. The two laminae are joined together by a cellular fub- ftance, which contains glands, veffels, and nerves; and in fome fabjeXs a great quantity of fat, which keeps the two laminae a diftance from each other. Along the whole circumference of the mefentery, the two lamina are naturally feparated, and applied to the two fides of the fmall inteftines, which they inveft by their union, or rather reciprocal continuation on the. great curvature"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A T curvature of that canal, and carry it as in afcarf or fling. This is what forms the external or membranous coat of the inteftines. The mefocolon is the continuation of the mefentery, which having reached the extremity of the ilium, con¬ tracts and changes its name. At this place the particu¬ lar lamina which is turned to the right fide, forms a fmall tranfverfe fold, called ligamtntum co'li dextrum. Afterwards the mefocolon afeends towards the right kidney, where it feems to be loft by the immediate ad- fiefion of the colon to that kidney, and to the firft incur¬ vation of the duodenum. Then it appears again, and, in- creafing in breadth, it continues its courfe almofl: tranf- verfely under the liver, ftomach, and fpleen, where it be¬ gins to turn downward, under the left hypochondrium, toward the kidney on the fame fide. Through this whole courfe, the mefocolon extends in breadth, and forms nearly a tranfverfe femicircular plane, very little plaited at its great circumference. By this circumference or edge, it is connected to the colon ; arid hides that ligamentary band of this inteftine, which runs along its fmall curvature. By its fiiort or fmall edge, it forms the triangular cafe of the duodenum ; and by its great edge, the external coat of the colon, in the fame manner as the mefentery does that of the fir.alj inteftines. As it partes under the large extremity of the ftomach, it adheres a little to the lower portion of that extremity, as the diaphragm does to the upper. Having got below the left kidney, it contrails and Forms another tranfverfe fold, called ligametitum colt ft - nifrutn. Afterwards it expands again, but not fo much as in the upper part, and runs down on the left pfoas mufcle, toward the laft vertebrae of the loins. This defeending portion is fixed to the convolutions of the co¬ lon in the fame manner as the fuperior portion is to the arch of that inteftine. The inteftinum re&um is likewife inverted by a parti¬ cular produ&ion of the peritonaeum, called commonly by the barbarous name of meforettutn. This production is very narrow ; and, about the middle of the forefide of the reflum, it forms a tranfverfe femicircular fold, which appears when the inteftine is empty, but is loft when it is filled. . GLANDULE MESENTERICaE, VASA LYMPHATICA & LACTEA. Between the laminae of the mefentery, a great num¬ ber of glands lie fcattered through the cellular fubftance. In the natural ftate, thefe glands are fomething of the fi¬ gure of lentils or little round beans ; fonie of them being orbicular, others oval, but all of them a little flatted. Thefe glands are of the number of thofe that anato- mifts call glandule conglobate, the ftruCturc of which is not as yet fufScnntly known. They feem to be of a cellular fubftance, furrounded by a very fine membrane or coat, on which, by the help of microfcopes, we difeo- ver an intertexturc cff particular filaments. .Befides the blood-vefiels which are diftributed in a reticular manner in the mefenteric glands, and befides many nervous filaments fpread through them, we dif- 6 M Y. £<% cover an infinite number cf fmall veflels cf another kind running from gland to gland. Thefe veflels are extremely thin and tranfparcnt, and furcifhed on the infide with numerous valves, which ap¬ pear on the outfide like little imall knots very near each other. They go out from each gland by ramifications,, as by fo many roots, and having formed a fmall trunk, they are again divided, and enter home neighbouring gland by the fame kind of ramifications by which they Went out from the former. They are termed lymphatic vejjels, becaufe for the moft part they contain a very clear, limpid, though mu¬ cilaginous ferum, called lympha by anatomifts But as they have likewife been obferved to be filled with a white milky fluid, called chyle, they have been called vafa chy- I ft ra, or vene latte e. They have-the name of veins , becaufe their valves are difpofed as thofe of the ordinary blood-veins, and becaufe the fluid which they contain runs from fmaller into larger tubes. They derive their firft origin from the tunica villofa of the inteftines, and chiefly from that of the fmall inteftines, by a.great number of fmall capillary roots. From thefe roots there arifes, between the coats of the inteftines, a kind of rete mirabile, which fur rounds almoft the whole circumference of the inteftinal canal, between the mufeu- lar and external coat. This reticular texture of lafleal veflels keeps clofe to the external coat, and leaves the canal along with it, on the fide of the mefentery, where it forms two planes of ramifications, plainly diftinguifhed from each other by the cellular fubftance, and adhering clofely to the infide of the two membranes of the mefentery. In this fepa- rate ftate they run on the Jaminse of the mefentery, as far as the firft mefenteric glands, where they unite again into one plane. After this union, the ladteal veflels are diftributed al¬ moft uniformly through the whole extent of the mefen¬ tery, from its circumference to its origin or adhefion to the vertebra; efthe back, between the mefenteric glands, which they join, and form frequent anaftomoles or com¬ munications. Having parted th.ough the mefentery, the ramifications begin to unite as they approach, the fpina dorfi, and con- fequently their number is leflened, and their fize increa- fed; and having parted the laft mefenteric glands, they terminate about the middle of the adhefion of the mefo¬ colon in fmall common trunks, which receive a great number of lymphatic veflels from the glandulse lambares, and others below thefe. The Iatfeal veffels which lie between the mefenteric glands and middle adhefion of tfte mefocolon to the fpina dorfi, run down on the body of the inferior aorta, be¬ tween the extremities of ike fmall mufcle of the dia¬ phragm, and terminate in a kind of erftern, called by fome. receptaculum chyli, by others receptaculum Pecquelti . The greateft part of the receptaculum chyli lies be¬ hind the right portion cf the inferior mufcle of the dia¬ phragm, cn the right fide of the aorta, at the union of the laft vertebra of the back with the firft of the loins. It is a kind of membranous veficle, the conformation of which is various in human fcbjeils. Sometimes it is of"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"•2 04 A NATO M Y.

It is compofed of very thin coats, and its cavity is di¬ vided by fmail pellicqlas or membranous fepta, the dif- pofition of which is irregular. It is chiefly round the lower part of this receptacle, that the laft Ja<5teal veffels are inferted, fome on the fides, and fome behind the aorta; and {hey are accompanied by numerous lympha¬ tic veffels. The upper portion is contracted between the aorta and vena azygos, and forms a particular ca¬ nal, which runs up through the thorax, by the name of dud us thoracicus. HE PAR & VESICULA FELLIS. The liver is a large and pretty folid mafs, of a dark red colour, a little inclined to yellow, fituated immedi¬ ately under the arch of the diaphragm, partly in the right hypochondrium, which it fills almoft intirely, and partly in the epigaftrium, between the appendix enfifor- mis and fpina dorfi, and terminating commonly in the left hypochondrium. . The figure of the liver is irregular, it being arched or convex on the upper part, unequally concave on the low¬ er, and very thick on the right and back fides. Towards the left and anterior fides its thicknefs dccreafes very much, and terminates there by a kind of edge ; and it is broader from right to left, than from before backwards. It may be divided into lateral parts called lobes; one jof which is termed the great or right lobe ; the o- ther, .the fmall or left lobe. Tkefe two lobes are di- ftinguifned above, hy a membranous ligament; and be¬ low very plainly, by a confidcrable feiflure lying in the fame direction with the fuperior ligament. The eminences on the concave fide of the liver belong to the great lobe. The principal eminence is a fort of triangular or pyramidal apophyfis fituated backward near the great feiffure which diftingui/hes the two lobes. This triangular eminence is termed lobulus Spigelii, 'or limply the fmall lobe of the liver. Qne of its angles advances a confiderable way toward the middle of the lower fide of the great lobe, and is loft there. Toward the forefide, there is another eminence lefs prominent but broader; and to this eminence and the former, the ancients gave the general name of porta. The depreflions on the concave or lower fide of the liver are four in number. The firft is the feiflure that feparates the two lobes, which runs a-crofs the concave fide, from the eminences already mentioned, to the ante¬ rior edge, where it terminates by a notch of different depths in different fubje&s. This is termed the great feiffure of the liver. The fecond depreflion is fituated tranlVerfely between the two eminences of the great lobe, and filled by the firms of the vena pert re. The third depreflion is back¬ ward, between'the great lobe and lobulus Spigelii, and the vena cava paffes through it. The fourth is a kind •of fulcus between the lobulus and fmall lobe of the liver, which in the foetus ferved to receive a venal canal loft in adults, in whom it appears only as a kind of ligament. This fulcus is in fome meafure a continuation of the \"great feiflure, and joins the vena cava by an acute angle. Befides thefe four depreflions, there is one on the fore-part of the great lobe, in which the vtficula fellis is lodged; and it fometimes runs as far as the edge', where it forms a fmall notch. We may likewife reckon among thefe depreflions, a fmall fuperficial cavity in the polterior and lateral part of the lower fide of the great lobe, by which it refts on the right kidney; and like¬ wife a fuperficial cavity in the left lobe, where it runs over the ftomach. Laltly, on the pofterior edge of the liver, there is a great finus common to both lobes, which gives paffage to the fpina dorfi and oefophagus, near the place where the vena cava defeends. The convex fide of the liver is commonly connected to the diaphragm by three ligaments, which are only conti¬ nuations of the membranous lamina of the peritonaeum. One lies near the edge of the extremity of each lobe, and one in the middle, and they are accordingly termed the right, middle, and left ligaments. There is a cel¬ lular fubftance in the duplicature of each, in which the blood-veflcls and lymphatics run, and which fends off a kind of lamina into the fubftance of the liver. The right ligament fometimes connedls the great lobe to the cartilages of the falfe ribs ; and the left liga¬ ment, or that of the fmall lobe, is often double, and ad¬ vances toward the. middle ligament. This middle liga¬ ment begins low, in the great feiflure of the liver, near the eminences called porta, and from thence paffes thro* the anterior notch and over the convex fide of the liver at the union of the two lobes, and is fixed obliquely in the diaphragm. It is likewife fixed along the upper and inner part of the vagina of the right mufculus re<5tus of the abdomen, in foch an oblique manner as to be nearer the linea alba below than above. Befides thefe ligaments the great lobe of the liver is likewife connected to the right ala of the tendinous por¬ tion of the diaphragm, not by a ligament, but by a broad and immediate adhefion, without the intervention of the membrane of the peritonaeum, which is only fold¬ ed quite round this adhefion, to form the external mem¬ brane of all the reft of the body of the liver. The middle ligament, called improperly ligament urn hepatis fufpenforium, contains in its duplicature a thick white rope, like a round ligament, which was the um¬ bilical vein in the foetus. Thus the lower part reprefents a falx, the convex edge of which is fnarp, and the other rounded. All thefe ligaments ferve to keep the liver in its proper fituation, and to hinder it from inclining too much to¬ wards either fide : But we muft not imagine that any of them ferve to fufpend it; becaufe it is fufficiently fup- ported by the ftomach and inteftines, efpecially when they are filled. When the ftomach is empty, or when we fall longer than ordinary, it is a common exprefiion to fay the Jlo- mach pinches us. As the liver is not then fuftained by the ftomach and inteftines, it defeends by its own weight, .and"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"riftfe Vvin"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANATOMY. 2 <55 and chiefly by the means of the middle ligament pulls the diaphragm along with it. It is in that place there¬ fore that we have this uneafy fenfation, and not at the fuperior orifice of the ftomach, as i? commonly believed. The liver is compofed of feveral kinds of veflels, the ramifications of which are multiplied in an aftonilhing manner, and form by the intertexture of their capillary extremities, an innumerable colledion of fmall pulpy, friable corpufcles, which are looked upon to be fo many organs defigned to feparate from the mals of blood a particular fluid termed the bile. The greateft part of thefe veflels from one end to the other is included in a membranous vagina called capfula vena portae, or capfula Glijfoni. The trunk of the vena portae is fituated tranfverfely between the broad anterior eminence of the great lobe of the fiver, and the root of the lobulus, in a particular feiflure, and forms what is^called the Jinus of the vena portae . From this linus five principal branches go out, which are afterwards divided into millions of ramifica¬ tions through the whole fubftance of the liver. At this place the vena portae lays down the common office of a vein, and becomes a kind of artery as it en¬ ters, and is again ramified in the liver. The extremi¬ ties of all thefe ramifications of the trunk of the vena portae hepatica end in the pulpy friable corpufcles which leem to be thick villous folliculi. Its in thefe folliculi that the-bile is fccreted, and it is- immediately collected in the fame ‘number of extremities of another kind of veflels, which unite by numerous ra¬ mifications into one commoruirunk. Thefe ramifications are termed port bilarii, and the trunk duttus hepaticus ; and the ramifications of thefe two kinds 'of veflels are in- veiled together by the capfula of the vena portae. The blood, deprived of this bilious fluid, is reconveyed to the heart by a great number of venal ramifications, which afterwards unite into three principal branches, be- fides others that are lefs conliderable, that’terminate in the vena cava, and are all called by the name of vena hepatica. The capillary extremities of the ramifications of the vena cava, join thofe of the vena ports, and accompany them through the liver; and, yet the great branches of both veins iriterfed each other in feveral places. The dudus hepaticus, or trunk of the pori bilarii, ha¬ ving run a little way, joins another canal called duttus cyflicus or vcftcularis, becaufe it comes from the veficu- la fellis. Thefe two united duds form a common trunk named duttus cholidochus, becaufe it conveys the bile. This dud having reached the incurvation of the duode¬ num, iiffir.uates'itfelf through the coats of that inteftine, and opens into the cavity thereof, not by a round papil¬ la, but by an oblong orifice, rounded at the upper part, and contraded at the lower, like the fpout of an ewer, or-like a common tooth-picker.' The gall-bladder is a kind of fmall bag lhaped like a pear, that is, narrow at one end and wide at the other. The wide extremity is termed the. fundus or bottom , the narrow extremity the neck, and the middle portion the body. About one third of^he body of the velicuJa lies in a depreffion on the concave fide of the liver, from Vol. I. No. 11. 3 the trunk or finus of the vena ports, where the neck is fituated to the anterior edge of the great lobe, a little toward the\" right fide, where the bottom is placed. The gall-bladder is compofed of feveral coats; the outermoit of which is a Continuation of that which in¬ verts the liver, and confequently of the peritonaeum. The fecond coat is flelhy, and made up of two ftrata, one longitudinal, the other rranfverfe, the fibres of which have nearly the fame irregular direction with thofe of the ftomach ; and this difpofition of the fibres in thefe vifeera is owing to the different diameters in the feveral portions of them, and to their incurvation. Thefe two coats arc conneded by a cellular fubftance continued between the body of the veficula and the liver, all the way, to a whitifh ftratum, which is looked upon as the third coat 'of the gall-bladder anfwering to the tunica nervofa of the inteftines. The innermolt or fourth coat has on the infide a great number of reticular folds, filled with fmall lacunas, like perforated papillae, efpecially near the neck of the vefi¬ cula where thefe folds are longitudinal, and afterwards form a kind of fmall pyloruS with plaits of the fame na- ttfre with thofe in the great one. Thefe lacuna are looked upon to be glands. That fide of the body of the veficula which lies next the liver is conneded to that vifcu 3 by a vaft number of filaments, which run a great way into the fubftance of the liver; and among thefe filaments there are fome duds which form a communication between the pori bi¬ larii and veficula. They are molt numerous near the neck of the veficula, and they are named duttus cyjl-he~ patici, or hepattco-cyjlici . The neck of the veficula is'formed by the contradion of the fmall extremity; and this neck bending afterwards in a particular manner, produces a narrow canal named duttus cyficus. The neck of die veficula is nearly of the fame ftrudure with the other parts. It has on the infide feveral reti¬ cular rugae and fome folds which appear like fragments of valvulae conniventes, fituated very near each other, from the neck to the contradion of the cyftic dud. The fir ft of thefe folds is pretty broad and large, and almoft circular; fhe next is more oblique, and fmaller in lize; and the reft diminiffi in the fame manner. The bile which pafles through the dudus hepaticus in¬ to the cholidochus, may be called hepatic', and that which is colleded in the veficula fellis, may be termed cyjlic. The hepatic bile flows continually through the dudus cholidochus into the duodenum, whereas the cyftic bile flows only by reafon of plentitude or by compreiiion. The ufes of the liver ffiall be explained after the de- feription of pancreas; fpleen, and omentum, all thefe vifeera having a great relation to the liver. s PANCREAS. The pancreas is a long flat gland, of that kind which anatomifts call conglomerate, fituated under the ftomach, between the liver and the fpleen. Its figure refembles that of a dog’s tongue ; and it is divided into two fides, one fuperior, the other inferior; two edges, one ante- 3 X rior."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"2 66 ANA T rior, the other poftcrior; and two extremities, one large, which reprefents the bafis of a tongue, andonefmall and a little rounded like the point of a tongue. The pancreas is lituated tranfverfely undeT the ftomachj in the duplicature of the poftcrior portion of the mefo- colon. The large extremity is conne&ed to the firft in¬ curvation of the duodenum, and from thence it partes before the reft of that inteftine, all the way to its laft incurvation ; fo that a great part of the duodenum lies between the pancreas and the vertebrae of the' back. The fmall extremity is fixed to the omentum near the fplecn. The pancreas is conapofed of a great number of foft glandular molecule, combined in fuch a manner, as to exhibit the appearance of one uniform mafs on the out¬ ride, theiurface of which is rendered uneven only by numerous fmall convexities, more or lefs flatted. When thefe moleculs are feparated a little from each other, we find along the middle of the breadth of the pancreas, a particular duff, in which feveral fmaller dutts terminate laterally on each lide, like fmall rami in a ftem. This canal, named duttus pancreaticus, or duftus Virfungi, is very thin, white, and almoft tranfparept, and the extremity of the trunk opens commonly into the extremity of the ductus cholidochus. From thence it diminifties gradually, and terminates in a point, next the fplecn. The fmall lateral branches are likewife pretty large near the trunk, and very fmall toward the edges of the pancreas, 1 all of them lying in the fame plane like the branches of the common fern. The pancreatic dudt is fometimes double in man, one lying above the other. It is not always of an equal length, and fometimes runs in a winding courfe, but al¬ ways in the fame plane ; and it is nearer the lower than the upper fide of the pancreas. It pierces the coats of the duodenum, and opens into the duffus cholidochus, commonly a little above the prominent point of the ori¬ fice of that canal; and fometimes it opens immediately into the duodenum. SPLEEN. The fpleen is a bluifti mafs, fomething inclined to red, and of a long oval figure, being about feven or eight fingers-breadth in length, and four or five in breadth. It is of a foftifli fubftance, and is lituated in the left hypochondrium, between the great extremity of the ftomach, and the neighbouring falfe ribs, under the edge of the diaphragm, and above the left kidney. The inner or concave fide is divided by a longitudinal groove or feiflure, in two planes or half-fides, one upper, the other lower; and by this groove, the veflels and nerves enter in human fubjedb. The fuperior half-fide is broader and more concave than the inferior, being proportioned to the convexity of the great extremity of the ftomach. The inferior half-fide lies backward on the left kidney, and forward on the colon; and fome¬ times this fide of the fpleen appears to have two fuperfi- cial cavities, one anfwering to tlie convexity of the fto¬ mach, • the other to that of the colon. The convex fide of the fplecn is turned to the left- ribs. O M Y. Part VI. It is connected to the ftomach, by the veflels called vafa brevia ; to the extremity of the pancreas, by ramifica¬ tions of the fplenic artery and vein; and to the omen¬ tum, by ramifications which the fame artery and vein fend to the fpleen, and which run in the longitudinal groove. It is connedfed to the edge of the diaphragm by a particular membranous ligament of different breadths in different fubjedfs, fixed in its convex fide, fometimes near the upper edge, and fometimes near the lower. The ftrudlure of the fplecn is not eafy to be unfolded in man, and it is very different from that of the fpleens of brutes, from which both public and private demon- ftrations are commonly made. Its coverings adhere to it fo clofely in man, that it is difficult to diftinguilh the common from the proper coat ; whereas in fome brutes, fuch as oxen, Iheep, <&c. we eafily find two coats feparated by a cellular fubftance. This covering feems to be no otherwife a continuation of the peritonseum than by the intervention of the omentum and mefocolon. In man the fubftance of the fpleen is almoft wholly vaf- cular. In oxen the fubftance of the fpleen is chiefly re¬ ticular, and in Iheep it is cellular. In oxen and (beep there are no venal ramifications, but inftead thereof only open finufes difpofed like branches, except a fmall por¬ tion of a venal trunk perforated on all fides, at the ex¬ tremity of the fpleen. In the human fpleen we fee fomething like glandular ccrpufcles, as in thofe of other animals; and there are numerous venal ramifications through its whole extent. Between thefe ramifications we every where obferve an appearance of extravafated blood, lying in a kind of fila¬ mentary tranfparent and very delicate lubftance expand¬ ed through the whole fpleen. This filamentary fubftance, having furrounded all the ramifications, terminates in almoft imperceptible cells which communicate with eaeh other. OMENTUM & APPENDICES EPIPLOICiE. The omentum is a large, thin, and fine membranous bag, furrounded on all fides by numerous portions of fat, which accompany and even invert the fame number of arteries and veins adhering, clofely to each other. The greateft part of it refembles a kind of flat purfe or a fportfman’s empty pouch, and is fpread more or lefs on all \"the fmall inteftines from the ftomach to the lower part of the regio umbilicalis. Sometimes it goes down to the lower part of the hypogaftrium, and fometimes does not reach beyond the regio epigaftrica. It is commonly plaited or folded in feveral places, efpecially between the bands of fat. It is divided into a fuperior and inferior, an anterior and poftcrior, and a right and left portion. The fupe¬ rior portion is in a manner divided into two borders, one of which is fixed along the great curvature or con¬ vex fide of the arch of the colon, and the other along the great curvature of the ftomach. The commiflure or union of thefe two borders on the right fide,, is fixed to the common ligament or adhefion of the duodenum and coko*"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANATOM Y. 2 6 7 colon, and to the contiguous parts of thefe inteftines. That on the left fide is fixed to the longitudinal failure of the fpleen, to the extremity of the pancreas, and to the convex fide of the great extremity of the ftomach. It is likewife fixed to the membranous ligament which fuftains the dudtus cholidochus, and connects it to the vena portae ventralis. Below thefe adhefions, the other portions, that is, the anterior, pofterior, two lateral and inferior portions, which lad: is the bottom of the fucculus epiploicus, hare commonly no fixed connections, but lie loofe between the fore-fide of the cavity of the abdomen and inteftines. The membrane of the omentum is through, its whole extent made up of two extremely thin laminae joined by a cellular fuftance; the quantity of which is very confi- derable along the blood-veffels, which it every where ac¬ companies in broad bands, proportioned to the branches and ramifications of thefe velTcls. Thefe cellular bauds are more or lefs filled with fat according to the corpu¬ lency of the fubjedf. Befidcs this large membranous bag, there is another much fmaller, which differs from the large one, not on¬ ly in fize, but alfo in figure, fituation and connexion ; and this is the little omentum. This fmall bag is fixed by its whole circumference, partly to the fmall curvature of the ftomach, and partly to the concave fide of the liver before the finus of the vena portae, fo as to fur- round and contain the prominent portion of the lobulus. The little omentum is thinner and more tranfyarent than the other, and its cavity diminiflies gradually from the circumference to the bottom. Its ftru&ure is pretty much the fame with that of the great omentum, it be¬ ing compofed of two laminae, with a mixture-of the fame portions of fat, which are confidcrably finer than*in the other. The fatty appendices of the colon and redtum appear to be a kind of fmall omenta or appendices epiploicae. They are fituated at different diftances along thefe in- teftines, being particular elongations of their common or external coat. They are of the fame ftrudture with the great omenta, and there is a cellular fubftance contained in their duplicature, more or lefs filled with fat, accord* ing as the fubjedt is fat or lean. Uses of the Abdominal Vifcera. The inteftines in general finifh what the ftomach had begun., The alimentary pulp having been fuffi- eiently prepared by the fuccus gaftricus, or lymph of the ilomach, undergoes a further change by the inteftinaJ lymph, bile, and pancreatic juice, by which the milky liquor called chyle is produced, and this liquor rendered fluid enough to enter the l.idteal veffcls through the tu¬ nica villofa o*^ the fmall inteftines, while the grofftr por¬ tion of the aliment continues its courfe, and becoming gradually thicker as it advances toward the great inte¬ ftines, is there collected by the name of faces. The valve of the colon, which might more properly be termed fphinfter or pylorus of the ileum, hinders the fee,es. from returning into the fmall inteftines. The glandular lacunas of the inteftines.furnifh conti¬ nually a kind of mucilage, which not only defends the internal coat from the acrimony of the feces, but ferves alfo to fabricate thefe feces in proportion to their diffe¬ rent degrees of folidity. The inteftinum redtum is the laft refervatory of the feces. The great thicknefs of its mufcular coat, and. the great number of longitudinal fibres by which this thicknefs is chiefly formed, enable it to yield to the col¬ ledted feces to fo great a degree, as to reprefent a large bladder or ftomach. The mufeuli levatores ani ferve to fufpend the lower portion of this inteftine, efpecially when full •, and it is partly by the contradtion of thefe mufcles which overcome the fphindter of the anus, that the feces are difeharged out of the body. Thefe fphinc- ' ters form the third pylorus of the whole alimentary canal. The mefentcry and mefocolon connedt the inteftines, in fuch a manner, as that they cannot be twilled or run into knots, without hindering them from Hiding and yielding to each other according to the different pofturcs of the body, or according as they are more or lefs empty or full. The adhefions of the mefentery form the convolutions of all the fmall inteftines into a large bundle, irregularly round, which fills a great part of the cavity of the abdo¬ men, from the cpigaftrium downward. The mefocolon by its adhefion to the colon forms a kind of feptum tranfverfum, between the fmall inteftines and the vifcera contained in the cpigaftrium ; and this fcp* turn fupports the liver and ftomach under the arch of the diaphragm, juft as much as it is fuftained by the inteftines; The breadth of the mefentery and mefocolon affords a large extent to the ramifications of the arteries, veins; and nerves, diftributed through them by innumerable communications and anaftomofes, by means of which any portion of the inteftines may be fapplied, though the principal branch which leads to it fhould happen to be compreffed or obftrufted.. The cellular fubftance in the duplicature of the mefen¬ tery and mefocolon, ferves not only for a foft bed to all thefe ramifications, but alfo to contain thofe colleffions of fat neceffary for the formation of the bile; and the cel¬ lular fubftance of, the mefentery has likewife one ufe pe¬ culiar to it, which is to invert the lymphatic glands and la&eal veffels, and upon this account it is thicker than that, of the mefocolon. The la&cal veffels being firft formed by a copious re¬ ticular texture round the circumference of the inteftines;. refembling the vafcular network of that cjnal, and after¬ wards uniting every where through the duplicature of the mefentery, with die arterial ramifications which they likewife accompany in many places ; it is cafy to conceive; that the pulfation of the mefenteric arteries mull propel the chyle in the lafteal veffcls from the inteftines to the reccptaculum chy.li, that motion being fuitable to the di¬ rection of their valves, The liver is the principal organ for the fccretion of the bile. The villi of that immenfe number of glandular cells of which it is compofed, filtrate continually from the blood of the vena portae fmall drops of bile, which afterwards infinuate themfdves' into the. pori bilarii, an I arae"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"?6S are in part lodged in the veficula fefiis, and in part ran direClly into the duodenum. The fpleen, omentum, appendices epiploicae, adipofe ftrata of the mefentery, and thofe of the great inteftines, and even the pancreas, with the whole feries of glands in the inteftinal canal, feem to contribute to the forma¬ tion of the bile, as fo many auxiliary or rather prepara¬ tory organs. The veficular bile appears to be more exalted than that in the hepatic duCt ;• and by meeting in the duCtus cho- lidochus, they feem to compofe a third kind of bile, which-without the cyftic or veficular bile would perhaps be too mild, and too acrid without the hepatic. This bile mixes in the duodenum with the pancreatic juice, and with that of the inteftinal glands; and from this mixture a fluid refults, which is proper to feparate the chylous matter from the grofs and ufelefs part of the a- limentary pulp, as it comes from the ftomach. RENES Sc URETERES. The kidneys are two pretty folid, glandular bodies, fituated in the pofterior part of the cavity of the abdo¬ men, on each fide of the lumbar vertebras, between the laft falfe ribs and ofla ileum. The right kidney lies un¬ der the great lobe of the liver, and is confequently low¬ er than the left, which lies under the fpleen. The figure of the kidneys refembles that of a large bean, their circumference being convex on one fide, and concave on the other. The concave fide is turned to the vertebrae, and the convex fide the oppofite way. In each kidney we obferve a fore and back fide, an upper and lower extremity, a great and fmall curvature, and a convexity and concavity. The back-fide is broader than the fore-fidc; and the upper extremity is a little broader and more incurvated than the lower. The depreffion in the fmall curvature is oblong and uneven, refembfing a finus, furrounded by fe- veral tubercles ; and as it is turned a little toward the fore-fide, this fide is fomething narrower than the other. The kidneys are furrounded by a very loofe membra¬ nous and cellular covering, called tnembrana adipofa , becaufe in fat perfons the cells of this fubftance are filled with fat. The proper coat or membrane of the kidneys is com- pofed of two laminae, between which there is likewife a very fine cellular fubftance, which may be made fenfible by blowing through a pipe between the two laminae. The external lamina is very thin, and adheres clofely to the internal lamina, by means of the cellular fub¬ ftance. The internal lamina penetrates every where, by numerous elongations, into the fubftance of the kidney, from which it cannot be feparated without tearing. The furface of the external lamina is very fmooth, poliflied and gliftening, and it renders the whole furface of the kidney very even and uniform. The blood-veflels having entered the kidneys, are ra¬ mified every way; and thefe ramifications fend out other capillary rami, which go all the way to the furface, where they appear like- irregular ftars, and furnilh the proper membrane of the kidneys. Part VI. The proper membrane having furrounded the kidney all the way to the fihus, joins the veflels at that place, and accompanies all their ramifications through the body of the kidney, in form of a vagina or capfula. We may diftinguilh three kinds of fubftances iri the kid¬ ney; an exterior fubftance, which is thick, granulated, and in a manner cortical; a middle fubftance, which is medullary and radiated, called Jiriata , fulcaia, or tubu¬ larity becaufe it feems to be made up of radiated tubes ; and an inner fubftance, which is only a continuation of the fecond, and terminates on the infide by papillae, for which reafon it is called papillaris. The papillae, which are only a continuation of the me¬ dullary fubftance, are often a little paler than that fub¬ ftance. They are ten or twelve in number, very di- ftinCt from each other, refembling the fame number of cones, with very broad bafes and obtufe apices. At the point of each papilla we fee, even without a microfcope, in a fmall depreffion, feveral very fmall holes, through which little drops may be perceived to run when the papillae are compreffed. Thefe are little drops of urine, which being filtrated, partly in the corti¬ cal, partly in the medullary or tubular fubftance, do af¬ terwards pafs through the fubftance of the papillae, and are difeharged by thefe orifices. Each papilla lies in a kind of membranous calix or infundibulum, which opens into a common cavity called the pelvis. This pelvis is membranous, being of the fame ftrutture with the calices, of which it is a continua¬ tion ; and its cavity in man is not uniform, but diftin- guilhed into three portions, each of which contains a' certain number of infundibula or calices, together with the papillae which lie therein. At the place where thefe infundibula furround the bafes of the papillae, they fend pi oduCtions into the me¬ dullary or radiated fubftance of the kidney, which ac¬ company the blood-veflels, and ferve for capful# or va¬ ginae to all the vafcular' arches, both arterial and venal, and to their different ramifications, quite through the cortical fubftance, and as far as the furface of the kidney. After the infundibula h^ve contracted in a conical form round the apices of the papillae, each of them forms a fmall ftiort tube or gullet, which, uniting at different dif- tances along the bottom of the finus of the kidney, form three large tubes, which go out from the finus in an o blique direction from above downwards, and immediate¬ ly afterwards unite into one trunk. This trunk becomes a very long canal, called the ure¬ ter. In men the three tubes fupply the place of what\" is called the pelvis in brutes, and might properly be call¬ ed the roots or branches of the ureters than the pelvis. The ureters are commonly two in number, one for each kidney. The fituatron of the trunk, and of the roots and branches of each ureter, with refpeCt to the renal artery and vein, is in the following manner: The artery is in the upper part of the finus, and partly before the vein. The vein is about the middle, and between the artery and ureter. The ureter is in the lower part, a little be¬ hind the vein, and k is partly furrounded by one branch of the artery. ANATOMY. From"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A ■ i The ureters rcn. down obliquely, and with a very fmall degree of inflection, from the kidneys to the lateral parts of the inner or anterior fide of the-os facrum, and paffing between, the reCtum and bladder they terminate in the laft of thefe vifcera. They are jfompofed of three proper coats; the firft of which, that furrounds the reft, is of a whitifh co¬ lour, and of a very compact filamentary texture, being ftretched with difficulty, and appearing like a filamentary fitbftance degenerated. The next coat is of a reddifh co¬ lour, ftronger than the firft, and made up of different ftrata of fibres, which interfed each other; but it is ve¬ ry hard to determipe, whether they are mufcular, or limply membranous. GLANDULE REN ALES, vulgo CAP- S'ULjE ATRABILARIiE. Immej) i ATEt .y above each, kidney, lies a glandular body, called by the ancients capfulae atribilariae ; by others capfulae renales, renes fuccenturiati, and glandulae re¬ rales. They are fituated on the upper extremity of each kidney a little obliquely, that is, more toward the inner edge and finus of the kidney than toward the outer con¬ vex edge, Each gland is an oblong body with, three fides, three edges, and two points, like an irregular crefcent with its great or convex edge ftiarp, and the fmall condave edge broad. Its length is about two thirds of the greateft breadth of the kidney, and the breadth of its middle portion is about one third of its extent between the two extremities, fometimes more, fometimes lefs. Its colour is a dark yellow. It has one anterior, one pofterior, and one lower fide, which laft may be termed the bafis 5 and it has one upper, and two lower edges, whereof one is anterior, the other pofterior.- The upper edge may be called the crifta, and the two lower edges the labia. . The furface of thefe glands is uneven; the forefide is tfie broadeft, and the lower fide or bafis the narrowed. Along the middle of the anterior fide, a ridge runs from the edge of the inner extremity, a little above the bafis, to the point of the other extremity, and divides this fide into two equal parts, like the niiddle rib of the leaf of a tree; and on the lower fide, under the bafis, there is a kind of raphe or future. The blood>yeffels of thefe glands come from the ar- teriae, and venae renales, and diaphragmaticae, and like- wife from %he aorta and vena cava, from the arteria cae-' liaca, <bc. Thefe veflels are termed the capfular ar- teries and veins; and as they enter the glands, theyfeem to be inverted by a vagina, .In the inlide of thefe capfulae, there is a narrow trian¬ gular cavity, the furface'of which is full of fliort ftrong villi of a yellowifti colour; but in children it is rcddifli, and of a dark brown in aged people. The .fides of this cavit^y are connected by a great number of filaments.; and they appear to be wholly glandular, that is, to be filled with very fine fmall folliculous corpufcles. This carity contains an unCtnous vifeid liquor,- of a yellowifh red colour, which with age changes gradually 4 Von. I. Numb. 12. 3 r O M Y. - 269 into a yellowifh purple, a dark yellow, and a black yel¬ low ; and fometimes it is perfectly black; but even then, .if it be fpread thin on a large furface, it appears yellow. The qfes -of thefe renal glands have not as yet been difeovered; and all that we know about the liquor con¬ tained in them, is, that it refembles the bile. They are very large in the foetus, and diminifh in adults. VESICA URINARIA. The bladder is a kind of membranous and- flefhy pouch or bottle, capable of dilatation and contraction, fituated in the lower part of the abdomen, immediately be¬ hind the fymphyfis of the offa pubis, and oppofite to the beginning of the inteftinum reCtum. The figure of it is nearly that of a fliort oval. It is broader on the fore and back fides, than on the lateral parts ; rounder above than below when empty, and broader below than above when full. It is divided into the body, neck, and bottom ; into an anterior, pofterior, and two lateral parts. The upper part is termed the fundus or bottom ; and the neck is a portion of the lower part, which is contracted like the gullet of fome veflels. The bladder is made up of feveral coats. That part of the external coat which covers the upper, pofterior, and lateral fides c-f llie bladder, is the true lamina or membrane of the peritonaeum; and the reft of it is fur- • rounded by a cellular fubftartce, by the intervention of which, the peritonaeum is connected to the mufcular coat. The proper coats are three in number, one mufcular, one nervous, and one villous, which is the innermoft. The mufcular coat is compofed of feveral ftrata of fleftiy fibres; the outermoft of which are moftly longitudinal; the next to thefe are more inclined toward each hand ; and the innerjnoft, more and more oblique; and they become at length almoft tranfverfe. The nervous coat is nearly of the fame ftrudture with the tunica nervofa of the ftomach. The-internal ooat is fomething granulated and glan¬ dular, and a mucilaginous ferum is continually difeharged through it, which moiftens the inner furface qf the bladder and defends it againft the acrimony of the urine. At the top of the bladder, above the fymphyfis of the offa pubis, we obferve a ligamentary rope, which runs* up between the peritonaeum and the linea alba of the ab-' domen, all the way to the navel, diminifhing gradually in thicknefs as it afeends. This rope had a particular' ufe in the foetus, as (hall be faid in another place. It is fufficient to add here, that it is in part originally a pro¬ duction of the inner coats of the bladder, which produc-..3 tion is termed urachus. This rope is compofed likewife of two other ligamen-, tary elongations, which are the extremities of the um¬ bilical arteries. Thefe arteries come from the hypoga- ftricse, run up by .the fides of the bladder, and ■ main hollow and filled with blood, even in adults, as high .as the middle of the bladder, through all which fpace they likewife fend off ramifications. Afterwards they lofe- their cavity, and become ligamentary as they afeend. '3Y . At"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"270 A N A T At the upper part of the bladder, they approach each other ; and, joining the urachus, form that rope, which may be termed the fuperior ligament of the bladder. The lower part of the bladder, which deferves the name of fundus much better than the upper part, is per¬ forated by three openings, one anterior, and two pofte¬ rior. The anterior opening is formed by an elongation of all the proper coats, in form of a gullet, turned much in the fame manner with the inner orifice of the roftrum of the head of an alembic. This elongation is Called the neck of the bladder, the defcription of which belongs to that of the parts of generation in men. The other two openings in the true fundus af the bladder, are formed by the ureters, which, in theircourfe downward already defcribed, run behind the fpermatic veffels, and then behind the lower part of the bladder, approaching each other. Each ureter lies between the umbilical artery and vas deferens of the fame fide, the artery lying on the outfide of the ureter, and the vas de¬ ferens on the infide. Afterwards they get between the vafa deferentia and the bladder, eroding thefe canals: and then at about a finger’s breadth from each other, they begin to pierce the coats of the bladder. They run a little way between the mufcular and nervous coats, and open into theblad-. dcr obliquely, fomething nearer each other than when they firft entered its coats. The orifices of the ureters in the bladder, arc fome¬ thing oval, and narrower than the cavity of the ureters immediately above them The edge of thefe orifices is very thin, and feems to be formed merely by the union ©f the internal coat of the bladder with that of the ureters. Befides the ligaments already mentioned, there are likewife two fmall ones, by which the anterior part of the true fundus of the bladder is connected to the ofla pubis, which lhall be defcribed with the neck and fphinc- ter after the hi Rory of the parts of generation in both fexes. THE PARTS OF GENERATION IN MALES. The fpermatic arteries go out mod commonly from the anterior part of the inferior aorta, near each other, and about an inch lower than the arteriae renales. They run down obliquely in the pofterior part of the abdomen, within the cellular fubftance of the perito- nscum, palling infenfibly from behind forward; and fo parting gradually more and more from 'the aorta, they crofS over the forefide of the ureters, and run through the openings or rings of the abdominal mufcles, along with the elongations or produftions of the cellular portion of the peritonseum. They are fmall at their origin; and in their courfe downward, they give off pretty confidcrable lateral ra¬ mifications to the membrana adipofa, peritonaeum, and alfo to the mefentery. They fonjetimes pafs through the areolae, or mefhes of the fpermatic veins; and before they go out of the ab¬ domen, they are divided into very fine rami, which run O M Y. Part Vr. in a more or lefs winding courfe, almoft parallel to each other. Afterwards they enter the cellular productions of the peritonaeum, which ferve them for vaginae. They do not fluctuate indifferently from one fide to the other of thefe vaginae; but are connected along their inner furface by thin membranous laminae, which are likewife continua¬ tions of the cellular fubftance of the peritonaeum. The arteries continue the fame winding courfe within thefe vaginae, pailing before the vafa deferentia, which are likewife contained in them; and at length they ter¬ minate by ramifications in the epididymes and teftes. The teftes are two glandular bodies, fituated near each other, without the abdomen, below the interftice between the groins in an adult. The ancients named tb^m didymi or gejnini, Their fize is nearly that of a pigeon’s egg, and they are of an oval figure, a little flat¬ ted at each fide. We may confider in each tefticle, two extremities, two edges, and two fides. One extremity is fituated forward, and a little upward ; the other back¬ ward, and a little downward; and their edges lie up¬ ward and downward. At the upper edge, they have each an appendix, cal¬ led epididymis, together with which it is involved infe- veral coverings; and they are both fufpended in a com¬ mon covering, called the ferotum. Each tefticle is a fpermatic gland formed by a vaft' number of fine whitilh tubes, folded and twifted in dif¬ ferent manners, and diftributed in different fafciculi, be¬ tween membranous fepta; the whole being furrounded by a ftrong common covering, named tunica albuginea. Thefe fepta are difpofed longitudinally, divaricating from each other on one fide, and approaching on the 6- ther. They approach each other along one edge of the tefticle, and terminate in a long narrow whitilh body, as in a kind of axis. From thence they divaricate in a regular manner, and are fixed by their oppofite edges in the inner furface of the tunica albuginea, of which they appear to be a con¬ tinuation. This white body may be termed the nucleus of the tefticle. From this defcription, we fee that all thefe fepta are not of an equal breadth; that the interftices between them are in fome meafure trangular; and that the extent of the fmall tubes, which lie therein, muft be very con- fiderable. They have been reckoned to amount to many ells, by taking the fum of all their feveral portions ; and they may be eafily unfolded by a long maceration, which deftroys the delicate fubftance by which all their folds and convolutions are connected and tied down. All thefe fmall canals feem to teiminate by a fmaller number of common trunks at the white body or nucleus al¬ ready mentioned; which trunks do afterwards pierce the upper part of the anterior extremity of the tefticle, and are difpofed in feveral folds along the lateral external part of the upper edge, all the way to the pofterior extremi¬ ty. From this union arifes a long whitilh plaited fafei- culus or bundle, called epididymis, or appendix to the tefticle. The epididymis thus formed, may be reckoned a pro¬ duction of the tefticle, or a kind of teftis accefforius; and"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A T and it refembles in fome meafure an arch fupported by its center or frame. It is more contracted at the middle, than at the extremities, by which it is clofely united to thofe of the tefticle. Between its extremities it does not immediately touch the tefticle, but is only loofely connected to it, by the duplicature of a very fine and almoft tranfparent mem¬ brane, as by a kind of ligament. This membrone is the continuation and duplicature of the tunica albuginea or proper coat of the tefticle, which having fupplied the place of a ligament to the epididymis afterwards inverts it. The epididymis is flat, a little concave on the under fide, or that next the tefticle, irregularly convex on the upper fide, or that turned from the tefticle; and thefe two fides are diftinguifhed by two angular edges; by the innermoftof which, it is conneCled to the tefticle, in the manner already faid; but the outer edge and flat fide are loofe and free. The anterior extremity or head of the epididymis arifes from the tefticle; and the pofterior extremity or tail, which likewife adheres very clofely to it, is incurvgted from behind, forward, and a little upward, and contrac¬ ting by degrees, forms a particular canal, termed vas deferens, which (hall be described after the fcrotum. The fcrotum is the cutaneous covering of the teftes. Outwardly, it is a bag common to both, formed by a continuation of the ikin of the neighbouring parts, and commonly very uneven, having a great number of rugse on its outer furface. Interiorly it is flefliy, and forms a mufcular capfula for each tefticle, termed dartos. The exterior or cutaneous portion of the fcrotum is nearly of the fame ftrufture with the Ikin in general, of which it is a continuation; only it is fomething finer, and it is likewife plentifully ftored with febaceous glands and bulbs or roots of hairs. Though it is a common covering for both tefticles, it is neverthelefs diftinguiflied into two lateral parts by a fuperficial and Uneven prominent line which appears like a kind of future, and from thence has been termed raphe. This line is a continuation of that which divides in the fame manner the cutaneous covering of the penis ; and it is continued through the perirweum, which it di¬ vides likewife, all the way to the anus It is only fu¬ perficial, and does not appear on the infide of the Ikin, The inner furface of this cutaneous bag is lined by a very thin cellular membrane, through which bulbs and glands appear very diftimftly when we view its infide. The dartos, or flefhy portion of the fcrotum, is a true cutaneous mufcle; the fibres of which are for the moft part ftrongty connected to the fhin, running through the cellular fubftance which lies between thefe two portions in place of a membrana adipofa, but without the leaft appearance of fat. This mufcle is thin, and by the dif- pofition of its fibres forms a bag with two cavities, or two fmall bags joined laterally to each other, and con¬ tained within the cutaneous portion. The lateral parts of thefe two bags, which are tu ned from each other, are longer than thofe which are joined together; and by this union afeptum is formed between the teftes, which may be called mediaftinum feroti. The raphe or future already mentioned adheres to the. O M Y 271 edge of this feptum, and thereby braces down the middle of the cutaneous portion, which from thence appears to have in part two cavities. The aponeurotic or ligamentary expanfion of the dar¬ tos is fixed in the ramus of the os pubis, between the mufculus triceps and the origin of the corpus caverno- fum of the fame fide, all the way to the lower part of the fymphyfis of thele bones. The vafa deferentia are two white folid flatted tubes, one lying on the right fide, the other on the left. From the epididymis, of which they are continuations, each of them runs up in the cellular vagina of the fpermatic vef- fels, as high as the openings in the abdominal mufcles ; the blood-veflels lying forward, and the vas deferens be¬ hind them. This fafciculus, thus formed by the blood-veflels, vas deferens, and their common covering, is termed the fpermatic rope. The covering is fmoother on the outer than on the inner fide, and for that re„fon it has been looked upon as a vagina ; the internal fubftance of which is moft cellular, and connects all the veflels together, while the external forms a covering to invert them. The vas deferens having reached the membranous la-, mina of the peritonaeum, where that lamina runs over- the orifice of the vagina, feparates from the blood vef- fels, and runs backward, in form of an arch, in the cel¬ lular fubftance of the peritonaeum, as far as the neareft fide of the bladder. It pafles afterwards behind the body of the bladder, to which it adheres very clofely, as alfo to the lamina of the peritonaeum which covers it, and then continues- its arched courfe towards the neck of the bladder, where both vafa deferentia meet, and their arches terminate. In this courfe, the vas deferens pafles behind and crof- fes the neighbouring umbilical artery ; crofles the extre¬ mity of the ureter of the fame fide, in its paflage be¬ tween that extremity and the bladder; and having got behind the bladder, it meets the vas deferens of the o- ther fide between the infertions of the ureters, and they run down together to the neck of the bladder. This canal, which at the origin of the epididymis is pretty large and plaited, becomes immediately afterward {mailer and fmoother, and continues in that form till it gets behind the bladder,, where it begins again to be lar¬ ger and more uneven. It arifes from the angular portion or pofterior extremi¬ ty of the epididymis, and from thence runs forward in a very oblique courfe, on the pofterior half of the epididy¬ mis, where it is a little incurvated as it joins-the back- fide of the fpermatic veflels. The cavity of the vas deferens is cylindrical, though the whole tube is flat, and its external circumference o- val, and the cavity inlarges as it pafles-behind the blad¬ der. The termination of thefe canals mult be referred to the hiftory of the urethra. The particular coverings-of the teftes are commonly- called coats; and they are reckoned to be three in num¬ ber ; the tunica mufculofa, named cremarter, vaginalis and albuginea. The firft two are common to each te¬ fticle, and to the fpermatic rope that belongs to it; and. the third is peculiar to the tefticle alone. Tire"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"3 ' 7'2 A N ’ A T The tunica vaginalis is the modconflderable of the three, and mud be deferibed fird, in order to conceive thedruc- ture and connexion of the cremader, which is very im¬ properly called a coat. The albuginea has been already deferibed with the tedes. The tunica vaginalis is a continuation of the vagina tit the fpermatic rope, .which, as it approaches the te¬ dicle, is gradually dilated, and forms two capfuke, one contained within the other, the external being the longed and broaded at bottom; fo that there is a void fpace there .left between them, in which the tefticle is lodged. The inner furface of this coat is lined by a fine mem¬ brane, which drengthens the bottom of the vagina, and forms a kind of diaphragm, which prevents all communi¬ cation between the vagina of the fpermatic rOpe and the tunica vaginalis of the tedicle. • The cremader, improperly termed a coat, is a thin mufcle or ftelhy plane, which runs down round the va¬ gina of the fpermatic rope, and terminates in the tunica vaginalis of the tedicle. It furrounds almod the whole vagina* and after¬ wards expands itfelf on the upper and external part of the tunica vaginalis, in which it is ififerted and lod. It arifes partly from the ligamentum Fallopii, and partly from the lower edge ( o f the internal oblique muf¬ cle of the abdomen ; and on this account it feems fome- times to arife from the (pine of tlie os ilium. The corpora cavernofa are two ligamentary and very limber tubes, united laterally to each fide, thrpugh the greated part of their length, and folid at their two ex¬ tremities, two of which are connected together, and rounded like the end of a finger; the other two divari¬ cate, like the branches of the greek Y, and diminifliing gradually in fize after the divarication, termihate in an oblique point. Thefe divaricated and pointed extremi¬ ties may be called the roots , and the round extremities the heads. • Thefe two bodies are almod cylindrical, being round, arid of an equal diameter from the roots to the heads, where they are in fome meafure conical. The ligamen¬ tary fubdance of their fides is elaftic, and compoled of fine clofe fibres, which are partly tranfverfe, and partly more or lefs oblique. The cavity of thefe ligamentary tubes is entirely filled by a drong cellular or cavernous fubdance, which does not feem to be a continuation of the fubdance of the fides. Thefe cells communicate with each other, and ar.e always more or lefs full of blood, rCfembling .pretty much the cellular fubdance of the fpleen ; only with this difference, that the fides of the cells are thicker in thefe cavernous bodies, and without any additional fnb- dance. By the union of the two corpora cavernofa, two exter¬ nal grooves are formed, one on the upper fide, the other on the lower. The lower groove is fomething broader than the upper, and it is filled through its whole length by a third tube, narrower than the corpora -cavernofa, cal¬ led the urethra. The roots of the corpora cavernofa are fixed, each, to the edge of the fn.all ramus of the os ifehium and os O M* Y- Part VI: pubis. They meet at the fymphyfis of the ofla pubis, where each of them becomes a cylindrical tube, and unites with the other in the manner already faid. The heads or rounded extremities join the bafis,, of a didindt body,’ called the glans, which is an expan- fion of the urethra, and clofely united to it. >. By the union of the corpora cavernofa from their roots to their round extremities or heads, ,a particular feptum; is formed by the tranfverfe fibres of both. Between the fibres of this feptum feveral fmall void fpaces are left, by which the corpora cavernofa communicate with; each other. The urethra is the third fpungy tube which compofesn the penis, and it adheres to the corpora cavernofa through the whole length of the inferior groove foimed by their union. It differs from the other two, both as it is nar^ rower, and as it forms a true hollow canal. Its fubdance is fpungy or cavernous, except a fmall portion next the bladder, and its inner and outer furfaces are mem¬ branous. It is at firft no more than a membranous canal conti¬ nued from the anterior opening of the bladder, at the place called the neck of the bladder About a finger’s breadth and an half from its origin,, it joins a cavernous fubdance like that of the two other tubes, only fmaller, which furrounds it through the whole extent of the inferior groove of the corpora ca-. vernofa. But before this fpungy fubdance begins to furround the urethra, it forms a diftintd oblong body, like a pear or onion, which is connected only to the lower convex fide of the canal, and afterwards, being fplit on each fide, inveds it quite round. This body is called the bulb of the urethra, being larger than any other part of that canal, and divided interiorly' by a very fine membranous . feptum, into lateral parts ; and therefore when it is in¬ flated, it appears to be double or with two heads. The firfl portion of the urethra, or that which is not covered by the cavernous fubdance, and which from the bladder to the bulb is only a membranous canal, is fii- ftained by a large folid whitifh mafs, of the figure of a chefnut, and fituated between the .bladder and the bulb . of the urethra, its bafis being toward the 1 bladder, the apex or point toward the urethra, and the fides lying up¬ ward and downward. This body is termed the prodates, from a greet word - . that exprefles its fituation before the veficulse feminales, . and implies a plurality, becaufe it appears to be divided into two lateral lobes, by a hollow groove which, runs through its upper fide from the bafis to the apex. The fird portion of the urethra lies in this groove, adhering very clofely to the prodates which furround it. The body of the prodates lies on the intedinum rec¬ tum, and the apex is under the internal labium of the cartilaginous arch of the ofla pubis. The inner fubdance is fpungy, but very compadi; and in each lobe there are feveral folliculi which open into the fird portion of the urethra, toward the bottom of the groove. The fpungy fubdance of the urethra, having reached the extremity of the corpora cavernofa, forms a large head, called the glans , which crowns the three fpungy"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A T pillars ; with this difference however, that it is a conti¬ nuation of the fpungy fubftance of the urethra, and on¬ ly adheres to the extremity of the corpora cavernofa without any direft communication. The figure of the glans is that of a rounded cone, a little flattened at the lower part, and with an oblique prominent balls, the circumference of which is fomething greater than that of the corpora cavernofa. The fpungy fubftance of the glans is thick and uni¬ form next the corpora cavernofa; but next the urethra, it is perforated by a continuation ft\" that canal, and is there no thicker than the urethra before the formation of the glans. Therefore the canal of the urethra does cot lie in the middle of the glans, but continues its direift courfe thro’ the lower flat lide of it, all the way to the extremity, where it terminates by an oblong orifice. All the convex furface of the glans is covered by a fine villous fubftance; and that again by a fine mem¬ brane, refembling the red part of the lips. The circum¬ ference of the balls of the glans has a double row of fmall papiliae, which may be reckoned febaceous glands, from which a thick matter is difcharged. At the bottom of the cavity of the firft portion of the urethra, or that which lies within the proftates, there is a fmall oblong oval eminence,- pretty large on the back part, and terminating forward in a point, called carun¬ cula or verumontanum. The large portion of it is com¬ monly perforated by two holes, fometimes only by one-, and very feldom by three; and thefe are the excretory orifices of the veficulse feminales. Each orifice has a fmall thin Incmbranous border, which may ferve for valves to the excretory dufts of the veficulae. On each fide of the large portion of the caruncula, there are five or fix holes ranked in form of a crefcent round its lateral parts; which are the orifices of the ex¬ cretory duds of the proftates that come from the follicu- li already mentioned, and run in an oblique courfe to the orifices, in a kind of membranous duplicature. The veficulae feminales are foft whitilh knotty bodies, about three or four fingers breadth in length, one in breadth, and about three times as broad as thick, fitua- ted obliquely between the redum and lower part of the bladder, in fuch a'manner, as that their fuperior extre¬ mities are at a diftance from each other, and their lower N extremities united between thofe of the vafa deferentia, of which they imitate both the obliquity and the incur¬ vation. They are irregularly round on the upper part, and their breadth decreafes gradually from thence. By the union of their lower extremities, they form a kind of fork, the branches of which are broad, and bent like rams horns. Thefe extremities are very narrow, and form a fmall neck, which-runs behind the bladder to¬ ward its orifice, and continues its courfe in the groove of the proftates, through the fubftance of the contiguous portion of the urethra, till its extremities pierce the caruncula in the manner already faid. The inner fubftance of the veficulse is plaited, and in a manner diftinguiflied into feveral capfuls, by contort¬ ed folds. Their external furface is covered by a fine Vol. I. No. f2. a O M Y. 273 membrane, which firves for a border and frsenum to the folds, and is a true continuation of the cellular fubftance of the peritonaeum. The veficulae may eafily be unfold¬ ed, and all their contoi lions ftreightened, and by this means they become much longer than in their natural ftate. Their inner furface is villous and glandular, and con¬ tinually furnilhes a particular fluid, which exalts, re¬ fines, and perfects the femen, which they recive from the vafa deferentia, and of which they are the refervato- ries for a certain time. The palfage of the vafa deferentia into the veficulae is very particular. It was obfffrved, that thefe canals are incurvated behind the bladder, and that their con traded extremities unite at that place. They unite in an angle, and run between the contiguous extremities of the vefi¬ culae ; and this union is fo clofe, that the adhering por¬ tions feem to form only one middle feptum, between two fmall tubes, each of which is formed, partly by the ex¬ tremity of one vas deferens, and partly by that of the neighbouring veficula. This lateral union of the extremities of the vas defe¬ rens, and veficula feminalis on each fide, forms likewife a kind of Ihort feptum, which terminates in.a crefcent, like a fmall femilunar valve, and the extremity of the vas deferens is narrower than that of the veficula. By this, mechanifm, the fluid contained in each vas deferens has liberty to enter the contiguous veficula, but that con¬ tained in the veficula cannot return into the other canal. Afterwards the two fmall tubes, formed each by the extremities of the vas deferens and veficula, run in be¬ tween the bafis of the proftates, and canal of the ure¬ thra ; and perforating the fides of that canal obliquely, they terminate in the caruncula. The infide of the canal of the urethra is lined by a fine membrane, full of capillary blood-vefiels; and its furface is perforated by a great number of oblong holes or fmall lacunas of different fizes, the largeft lying near the glans. Thefe lacunas, or orifices of the excretory dufts of the fame number of fmall glands, are difperfed through the fubftance of the urethra. Which duds run for fome Way in the fpungy fubftance, along the convex fide of the internal membrane of the urethra, and open oblique¬ ly from behind, forward into the great canal. The edges of the lacuna are femilunar, or like a crefcent. A little way from the beginning of the cellular fub¬ ftance of the urethra, we meet with two lacuna more confiderable than the reft, and their dufts are very long. Thefe lacuna and du&s lead to two glandular bodies, fituated on the two convex fides of the fpungy fubftance of the urethra near the bulb. Each of them is about the fize of a cherry-ftone, but they are oblong and flat, and covered intircly by the mufcles called accelerators. Thefe two bodies are -commonly called prof at x infe- r lores. The cavity of the urethra refembles nearly that of a fmall writing pen. It is not every where round, and to¬ wards the gland becomes broader and flatter on one fide, efpecially in the gland itfelf, where there is a kind of o- val or navicular foffula. This canal terminates at the extremity of the glans 3 Z by"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"274 A N A T by a narrow oblong orifice of fiflure, which is much lefs than the reft of the cavity. The commiffures of this fmall fiflure are turned one toward the convex, the Ga¬ ther toward the flat fide of the glans; and the labia of c’ne fiflure are its lateral parts ; and it feenis to be fur- rounded by flefhy fibres. The prseputium is a continuation of the lkin of the pu¬ bis and fcrotum, and it adheres all the way to the bafis of the glans. The reft of the cutaneous integument co¬ vers the glans without adhefion, and terminates by an opening. This portion is named prseputium, and along the whole lower or back fide, both of the whole integu¬ ment in general, and of the prseputium in particular, there runs a fine future, which is a continuation of the raphe of the perinseum and fcrotum. The inner furface of the prseputium is lined with a fine membrane from the opening all the way behind the bafis of the glans ; and the fame membrane is folded from behind, forward, round the glans, forming the proper integument thereof, and covering very clofely its whole villous furface, as far as the orifice of the urethra, where it joins the membrane, which lines the infide of that canal. This proper membrane of the glans, and internal membrane of the prseputium, form conjointly along the iflat part of the glans, from its bafis to the orifice of the urethra, a membranous duplicature, which like a feptum or mediaftinum divides this part into two lateral portions, and limits the motions of the prseputium; for which rea¬ son it is called franurn pneputii. The furface of the internal membrane of the prapu- lium difcharges a fluid which prevents it from adhering to the glans. Several mufcles are inferted in the parts which we have defer bed in this paragraph. The firft two mufcles are commonly termed ere&ores, or acceleratores urinsg. The next two are called acce¬ lerators. The four fmall mufcles, two of which are fuperior, and two inferior, may be called proftatici. The ere&ores lie along the roots of the corpora ca- vernofa ; each of them being fixed by one extremity ve¬ ry obliquely, in the internal labium of the ramus of the os ifehiura, from the taberofity upward. From thence it accompanies the root of the corpus cavernofum, all the way to the fymphyfis of the offa pubis, and is fixed by its other extremity in the corpora caverndfa, near their union; where the fibres of both bodies meet, and are reciprocally expanded over both corpora. They lie a little lower, and more interiorly, than-the roots of thefe cavernous bodies^ The mufeuli tranfverfi, called alfo triangulares, are two long, narrow, flefhy faficiculi, inferted each by •one extremity in the root or beginning of the ramus of the os ifehiura ; from whence they run tranfverfely along the edge of the interoffeous ligament of the offa pubis, as far as the apex of the proftates, where their other ex¬ tremities meet, and form commonly a kind of digaftric mufcle, the middle of which gives infertion to the muf¬ cles of the urethra, and to the cutaneous fphitufters. of the anus.. O M Y. Part VI. The fuperior proftatici are two thin planes, fixed in the upper part of the infide of the fmall rami of the offa pu¬ bis; from whence they are fpread over and inferted in the proftates. Their infertions in the offa pubis are on ‘one fide of thofe of the obturatores interni. The proftatici inferiores are fmall tranfverfe planes, each of which is fixed in the fymphyfis, between the ra¬ mus of the os pubis and os ifchium, and from thence runs tranfverfely, till it meets -its fellow from the other fide under the proftates, to which they are both ftrongly connected, and they ferve like a girth to faftain thefe glands. The PARTS of GENERATION in FEMALES. The parts of generation in females are feveral in number, fome of them external, and fome internal ; and they are all fubordinate to one principal internal part, called the uterus. The uterus lies between the bladder and inteftinum reftum. It is a body inwardly hollow, outwardly of a whitifti colour, of a pretty folid fubftance, and, except in time of pregnancy, of the figure of a flat flalk, being in adults about three fingers breadth in length, one in thicknefs, and two in breadth at one end, and fcarcely one at the other. The broadeft portion is termed the fundus , and the narrowed the netk. Its fituation is oblique, the fundus being turned backward and upward, and the neck for¬ ward and downward; the broad fides lie next the reftum and bladder, and the narrow fidcs are lateral. The cavity of the uterus is flat, and refembles an ob¬ long triangle, the fhorteft fide of which anfwets exa&ly to the fundus, and the two longeft fides lie one on the right-hand, the other on the left. Of the three angles of this cavity, the two which terminate the fundus are perforated each by a nar¬ row du#, which with difficulty admits a hog’s briftle. The third angle forms a flat dueft wider than the former, which perforates the neck of the uterus lengthwife, and terminates at the extremity of that neck by a tranfverfe opening. This opening is termed the internal orifice of the ute¬ rus ; and, in the natural ftate, is narrower than the duft of the collum uteri, fo that only a fmall ftilet can be parted through it. At the edge of this orifice, are feve¬ ral fmall holes, anfwering to the fame num ber of glandu¬ lar corpufcles, which difeharge a vifeid lympha. The inner furface of the cavity of the uterus is lined by a very fine membrane, which at the fundus or broad portion is fmooth and even, but in the narrow portion which leads to the orifice it; is wrinkled in a particular manner. The portion of this membrane, which covers the bot¬ tom of the cavity, is- perforated by a great number of' confiderable holes, through which fmall drops of blood may be obferved to pafs when the whole uterus is com- preffed. In. die narrow part, which anfwers to the collum, each fide"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A T fide is divided into two lateral parts, by a kind of pro¬ minent longitudinal line, which is larger in the upper or anterior fide, than in the lower or pollerior. On each fide of thefe two longitudinal lines, there are lines or rugae obliquely tranfverfe, and difpofed like branches, the longitudinal lines reprefenting trunks. Between and round thefe rugae, there are fmall lacunae, through which a mucilaginous fluid is difcharged that clofes the orifice of the uterus. The fubftance of the body of the uterus is fpungy and compad, with a copious intertexture of veflels. Its thicknefs. is nearly equal and uniform in the fides and edges, but the fundus is thicker toward the middle, than toward the two angles, where the thicknefs de- creafes gradually. The edg'es are likewife much thinner near thefe angles, than near the extremity of the neck. The uterus is covered by a portion of the peritonaeum, which ferves it for a coat, and is the continuation of that which covers the bladder and inteftinum redum, running up from the lower and pollerior part of the bladder, over the anterior part of the uterns, and from thence over the fundus, and down the backfide, and af¬ terwards going to the redum. On each lateral part or edge of the uterus, this por¬ tion of the peritonaeum Jorms a broad duplicaturd, which is extended on each fide, more or left directly to the neighbouring lateral parts of the pelvis, forming a kind of membranous feptum between the anterior and pofte- rior halves of the cavity of the pelvis; and it is after¬ wards continued in a loofe manner with the peritonaeum, on the fides of the pelvis. Thefe two broad duplicatures have the name of liga¬ ments lata, and vefpertilionum aLe. The upper edge of each is partly double or folded, forming two fmall diftind duplicatures. The laminae of all thefe duplicatures are connected by a cellular fubftance, in the fame manner as the other ■ duplicatures of the peritonaeum ; and they contain the .Fallopian tubes, the ovaria, a part of the fpermatic vef- ftls, and of tbofe that go to the body of the uterus, the- ropes called the round ligaments, the nerves, 6 c. * The ovaria are two whitilh, oval, flat,, oblong bodies* fituated on the fides of the fundus uteri ; to which they are fixed by a kind of Ihort round ligament, and inclofed, -together with it, in the dtiplicature of the pollerior pi¬ nion of the ligamenta lata. They are compofed of a compact fpungy fubftance, and of feveral little balls, or tranfparent veficnlae, which are called cva. The fpungy fubftance furrounds each of thefe ydfeulae very clofely, and Teems likewife to furniih them with diftind fpungy coverings or calices. The ligaments of the ovaria lie in the edges of the pollerior pinions of the ligamenta lata, much in the feme manner as the umbilical vein in the anterior or umbi¬ lical ligament of the liverv They are round ropes-of a- filamentary texture, fixed by one extremity to the err* ner of the fundus uteVi, a little above and behind the le¬ vel of that fundus. They were formerly believed to be hollow, and looked upon as vafa deferentia, Th6 Fallopian tubes are tw;o. flaccid, conical and ver¬ miform canals, fituated mere or lefs tranfverfely on.each.. & M Y. 275- fide of the uterus, between the fundus and the lateral» parts of the pelvis, and included in the anterior duplica¬ tures or pinions of the ligamenta lata. Each of them is fixed by its narrow extremities in the cprner of the fundus uteri, into which it opens, though by fo narrow a dud, as hardly to admit a large briftle. From thence their diameter augments by degrees all the way to the other extremity, where it is about one third part of an inch. The body of the tubae goes in a winding courfe, and their large extremity is bent toward the o- varia. Thefe large extremities are irregularly round, and ter¬ minate by a narrow orifice, a little plaited, and turned to¬ ward the ovarium, where it prefently expahds irt form- of a membranous fringe, full of plaits and incifures. Thefe fringes are called the broad ends of the Fallopian tubes. Thefe tubes- are compofed of flelhy • fibres, whereof fome are longitudinal, andfome obliquely circular, with an intertexture of another very fine fubftance. The anterior pinions of the ligamentum latum fervfi for a common or external coat to both tubae, and alfo to conned them, in the fame manner as the mefentery con- neds the intellines. From thence the tubae, and efpe-- cially their fringes, come to be loofe. The pubes is that broad eminence at the lower part of the hypogaftrium, between the two inguina:, on which hairs grow at a certain age. This eminence is owing to a particular thicknefs of the membrana adipofa which co¬ ver the fore-part of the ofta pubis, and fome fmall por¬ tions of the neighbouring mufcles. The longitudinal cavity which reaches from the-middle and lower part.of the pubes, within an inch of the anus, was by the ancients termed ftnus; and they called the lateral parts of that cavity aLe, which is a more proper name than that of labia, commonly given to them-. The• places where the alse are joined above'and below are termed commifiures; and may likewife be called the extremities or angles of the finus.. The alse are more prominent, and thicker above than • below, and lie nearer each other below than above’. They are chiefly compofed of the flein, cellular fubftance, and fat. The exterior flein is a continuation of that of the pubes and inguina. It is mere or lefs even, and furnilhed with a great number of glandular corpufcles, from which a whitifh ceruminous matter may be expr-efl- - ed; and after a certain age it is likewife covered: in the : fame manner with the pubes. The inner fide of the alae is fomething like thle red portion of the lips of the mouth; and it is diftinguilhed every where from the external fide by a kind of line, in the fame maimer as the r«l portion of the lips from the reft of the Ikin; being likewife thinner and fmoother than the outward Ikinv A great number of pores are ob- fervable in it, and alfo numerous glandular corpufcles which furniih a liquor more'or lefs febaceous. Near the inner iedge of the inner furfaces of the alae, on each fide of the orifice of the canal of the uterus, we find a fmall hole more vifible than the reft. Thefe two holes are termed lacunae ; and they communicate by two final! duds with the Tame number of follicular bodies ly- ingi.:"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"• 271 ? A N A 1 ing in the fubftance of the stlae, and which maybe look¬ ed upon as fmall prodates anfwering to. the glandules pro- ftaticx in males. When comprefled, they difcharge a vifcid liquor. Above the fuperior commiflure, a thin flat ligament runs down from each fmall branch of the ofia pubis, which pe¬ netrates the fat in the fubftance of each ala, and is loft therein infenfibly near the edge. Thefe may be looked upon as the ligamenta fufpenforia of the alx. The infe¬ rior commiflure of the alas is very thin, or like a membra¬ nous ligament, and, together with the neighboring parts -of the inner fides, it forms a foflula, termed navicularis or fcaphoides. The fpace between the inferior commif¬ fure and anus, termed perinasum, is about a large fin¬ ger’s breadth In length. The other external parts are fituated in the finus, and hid by die alx. Directly under the fuperior commiflure lies the clitoris, with its covering called prxputium. A little lower is the orifice of the urethra; and below that is the orifice of the great canal of the uterus. The circum¬ ference of this orifice is bordered either by a membranous circle, called hymen, or by flelhy portions, termed carun- culx myrtiformes. On each fide of the clitoris begins a ve¬ ry prominent fold like a crifta, which runs down obliquely on each fide of the orifice of the urethra. Thefe folds are termed nymph x, and they might likewife be named criftx cliteridis. The clitoris appears at firft fight like a fmall imperfora¬ ted glans. Its upper and lateral fides are covered by a kind of prxputium, formed by a particular fold of a por¬ tion of the inner fide of the alae; which appears to be glandular, and to difcharge a certain moifture, and its in- fide is granulated. By difledtion, we difeover in the clitoris a trunk and two branches, as in the penis, made up of a fpungy fub- ftance, and of very elaftic coats, but without any ure¬ thra. The .trunk is divided into two lateral parts of a middle feptum, from the bifurcation, to the glans, where it is infenfibly loft. The bifurcation of the trunk is on the edge of the car¬ tilaginous arch of the ofia pubis; and the branches which refemble the roots of the corpora cavernofa are inferted in the inferior rami of thefe bones, and in thofe of the ofia ifehium, where they terminate by degrees; but there is fomctimeS a membranous tube on each fide, which reaches to the tuberofity of the ifehium. The trunk of the clitoris is fuftained by a ligamentum fufpenforium fixed in the fymphyfis of the ofia pubis, and containing this trunk in its duplicature, nearly as in the other fex. Four mufclesor fafciculi of fleftiy fibres are inferted in the trunk of the clitoris, two on each fide. One of them runs down on the forefide of the neighbouring cor¬ pus cavernofum, and is inferted by a tendinous or apo¬ neurotic portion, partly in the extremity of the corpus cavernofum, and partly in the tuberofity of the ifehium. Thefe two mufcles are called erestores. The other mufcle on each fide lies under the former, and runs down on the fide of the urethra and great orifice ©f the uterus, aft the way to the anus j increafing gra- O M Y. Part VI. dually in breadth in its paflaj^, and terminating partly like that which is called accelerator in males. Thefe two mufcles furround very ciofely the lateral parts of the urethra, and of the great orifice. They ex¬ pand very much as they defeend, and are fpread on the lower and lateral parts of the great orifice; for which reafon feveral anatomifts have looked upon them as muf- cular fphindters. The nymphx, crifta: clitoridis, or, as they may like¬ wife be termed, alx minores five internse, are two pro¬ minent folds of the inner Ikin of the great or external alx, reaching from the prxputium of the clitoris to the two fides of the great orifice of the uterus. They begin very narrow, and, having inereafed in breadth in their courfe downward, they are again contracted at their low¬ er extremity. They are of a fpungy fubftance, intermixed with glands, feveral of which may be perceived by the naked eye. Their fituation is oblique, their upper extremities lying near each other, and the lower at a much greater diftance In married women they are more or lefs flaccid and decayed. By the urethra in females, we mean the urinary dudt, the orifice of which is between the nymphx below the glans of the clitoris. The fides of this orifice are a little prominent and wrinkled, and perforated by fmall lacu- nx, from which a vifcid or mucilaginous liquor may be fqueezed. The body of the urethra is a fpungy dudt of the fame ftrudturc as in males, but much fhorter, fituated diredtly under the trunk of the clitoris, and above the great canal of the uterus, adhering to each of thefe canals be¬ tween which it lies, by membranous filaments. It pafies under the cartilaginous arch of the ofia pubis, and ter¬ minates by an oblique opening at the neck of the bladder. The great canal is fituated below the urethra, and a- bove the extremity of the inteftinum redtum, a little ob¬ liquely, being more raifed on the inner and back part, than on the outer and fore part. Its inner or pofterior extremity joins the extremity of the body of the uterus, and furrounds its orifice much in the fame manner as the duodenum furrounds the pylorus, or as the ilium is furrounded by the cxcum and colon. The anterior extremity forms the great orifice, which lies under that of the urethra, and above the foflula of the inferior commiflure of the alx. The body of the canal is chiefly made up of a fpungy fubftance, interwoven with numerous blood-veflels ; and it is commonly longer and narrower in virgins, than in married women. Its inner or concave furface, has feveral tranfverfe rugx, and is covered by a particular membrane. The rugx are formed by oblong narrow eminences, incur- vated like portions of arches, placed very near each o- ther, and difpofed in fuch a manner as to divide the cavity of the canal into an upper and lower fide. By the union of the extremities of the upper and lower rugx, a kind of raphe or future is formed on the right and left fides ; and both arches are fometimes interfedtdd in the middle, and fo form two half-arches. 13"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Part VI. In general, thefe arches are very confiderable in young perfons; become gradually more fuperficial in married women, and are quite loft in time of delivery. The inner or pofterior extremity of this great canal furrounds the orifice of the uterus, a little obliquely, in fuch a manner, as that the upper fide of the canal lies very near the orifice, and the lower fide at a greater xliftance from it, and this makes the extremity of the u- terus appear to advance mere into the canal on the lower than on the upper part. The exterior or anterior extremity of the great canal in virgins, and efpecially before the firft eruption of the •jnenfes, is commonly bordered by a circular membranous fold, of different breadths, more or lefs fmooth, and fometimes femilunar, which in fome fubjeCts leaves but a very fmall opening, in others a large opening, and in all renders the external orifice narrower than the reft of the cavity. This fold, called hymen, is formed by the union 'of the internal membrane of the great canal with that on the infide of the alse, and reprefents a membranous circle of different breadths, ahd fometimes uneven. This membranous circle is commonly ruptured after the confummation of marriage; is unite loft in delivery; and afterwards only fome irregular portions of it remain, which, from their funpofed refemblance to myrtle leaves, have been termed earunculas myrtiformes. This circle may likewife fuffer fome diforder by too great a flux of the menfes, by imprudence, levity, and other particular accidents. Each fide of the anterior portion of the great canal is covered exteriorly by a thin broad cavernous and vafai- lar plexus, called the plexus retiformis o'f that canal. Thefe two planes run down on each fide of the clitoris behind thenymphae, and likewife cover the urethra like a collar, before they are fpread on the great canal. This plexus is ftriCtly united to the mufcular portions commonly taken for accelerators or conftriCtors, lying be¬ tween thefe portions and the lateral parts of the urethra and of the great canal. Sect. III. Of the Thorax. . By the thorax, we commonly underftahd all that part of the body which anfwers to the extent of the fternum, ribs, and vertebrae of the back, bpth outwardly arid in¬ wardly. The thorax is divided into the anterior part called commonly the breaft, the pofterior part called the back, and the lateral parts called the right and left fides. The external parts of the thorax, befidcs the Ikin and membrana adipola, are principally the mammae, and the mufcles which cover the ribs and fill the fpaces between them. In the mammae we fee the papillae or nipples, and a fmall coloured circle, which furrounds them. The internal parts of the thorax are contained in the large cavjty of that portion of the trunk, called the middle venter, or cavity of the breaft. This cavity is lined by a membrane named pleura, and divided into two lateral cavities by a membranous feptum named mediaftinum, which is a production or duplicature of the pleura. -> Vcl. I. Numb. 12. 277 Thefe parts are the heart, pericardium', trunk of the aorta, a portion of theafpera arteria and of the oeiopha?- gus, the duCtus laCteus or thoracicus, the lungs, <kc. The hard parts, which form the fides of the cavity of the thorax, are the twelve vertebrae of the back, all the ribs, and the fternum. The foft parts, which complete the fides, are the membrane called pleura, which lines the cavity, and the mufculi inter-coftales, fterno-coftales, and diaphragma. All thefe hard and foft parts taken together rcprcfent a kind of cage, in fome meafure of a conical figure, flat¬ ted on the forefide, depreffed on the backfide, and in a manner divided into two nooks by the figure of the verte¬ brae of the back, and terminated below by a broad arched bafis inclined backward. The intercoftal mufcles fill up the interftices betwixt the ribs, and fo complete the fides of the cavity; the bafis is the diaphragm, and the pleura not only covers the whole inner lurface of the ca¬ vity, but, by forming the mediaftinum, divides it into two, one on the right hand, the other on the left. M A M M M. The name of mammae, or breafts, is given to two emi¬ nences more or lefs round, fituated in the anterior and a little toward the lateral parts of the thorax. The body of the mammae is partly glandular, and part¬ ly made up of fat; or it is a glandular fubftance mixed with portions of the membrana adipofi*, the -cellulous pelliculae of which fupport a great many blood-veffels, lymphatics, and ferous or lactiferous duCts, together with fmall glandular molleculae which depend on the for¬ mer ; all of them being clofely furrounded by two mem¬ branes continued from the pelliculae;. The innermoft of thefe two membranes, which is in a manner the bafis of the body of the mammaj is thick and almoft flat, adhering to the mufculus peCtoralis ma¬ jor. The fecond or external membrane is thinner, form¬ ing a particular integument for the body of the mam ma, more or lefs convex, and adhering clofely to the lkin. The corpus adipofum of the mamma in particular, is a fpungy clufter, more or lefs interlarded with, fat, ora collection of membranous pelliculae, which, by the parti¬ cular difpofition of their outer fides, form a kind of mem¬ brane in Ihape of a bag, in which all the reft of the cor- : pus adipofum is contained. The anterior or outer por¬ tion of this bag, or that which touches the lkin, is ve¬ ry thin ; but that fide next the peCtoialis major, is thick*. The glandular body contains a white mafs, which is merely a collection of membranous duCts, narrow at their origin, broad in the middle, and which contract again as • they approach the papilla, near which they form a kind of circle of communication. They are named duCtus laCtiferi. The coloured circle or diik is formed by the lkin,” the inner furface of which fuftains a great number of fmall glandular molleculae. They appear very plainly all over the areola, even on the outfide, where they form little flat heights or eminences at different difiances quite reur.-i the circle. _ . - • ; 3 4 A The ANATOM Y."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Part VL 278 A N A T The tubercle which lies in the center of the areola, is termed papilla, or the nipple. In women with child, or who give fuck, it is pretty large, and generally longer or higher than it is thick dr broad. The texture of the nipple is fpnngy, elaftic, and liable to divers changes of confidence, being fometimes harder, fometimes more flaccid. It feems to be made up chiefly of ligamentary fafciculi, the extremities of which form the bafis and apex of the nipple. Between thefe fpungy and elaftic fafciculi lie feven or eight particular tubes, at fmall diftances from each other, and all in the fame direction. Thefe tubes end at the bafts of the papilla in the irregular circle of communica¬ tion of the lactiferous duCts, and at the apex, in the fame number of almoft imperceptible holes or orifices* The ufe of the mammae in the nourilhmcnt of children is known to all the world: But it is not certainly known what the papillae and areolae in males can be defigned for. Milk has been obferved in them, in children of both fexes., PLEURA and MEDIASTINUM. The pleura is a membrane which adheres veryclofely to the inner furfaceof the ribs, fternum, and mufculi in- ter-cofta!es, fub-coftales, and fterno-coftales, and to the convex fide of the diaphragm. It is of a very firm texture, and plentifully ftored with blood-vefiels and nerves, in all which it refembles the peritonaeum. The cellular portion goes quite round the inner fur- face of the thorax, but the membranous portion is difpo- ied in a different manner. Each fide of the thorax has its particular pleura, intirely diftinCt from the other, and making as it were two gteat bladders, lituated laterally with refpeft to each other in the great cavity of the brcaft, in fuch a manner as to form a double feptum or partition running between the vertebrae and the fternum, their other fides adhering to the ribs and diaphragm. This particular duplicaturc of the twopleurae is termed mediaftinum. The two laminae of which it < s made up are clofely united together near the fternum and vertebrae; hut in the middle, and toward the lower part of the fore- fi de, .they are feparated by the pericardium and heart. A little more backward they are parted in a tubular form by the cefophagus, to which they ferve as a covering • and in the moft pofterior part, a triangular fpace is left between the vertebrae and the two pleurae from above downward, which is filled chiefly by the aorta. The mediaftinum doe 3 not commonly terminate along the middle of the infide of the fternum, but inclines to¬ ward the left fide. The furface of the pleura turned to the cavities of the Jkreaft, is Continually moiftened by a lymphatic ferofity which tranudes through the pores of the membranous portion. The pleura ferves in general for an inner integument to the cavity of the thorax. The mediaftinum cuts off all communication between the two cavities, and hinders ©ne lung from prefling on the other when we lie on one fide. It like wife forms receptacles for the heart, peri¬ cardium, cefophagus, &£v O M T. THYMUS. The thymus is an oblong glandular body, round on the upper part, and divided below into two or three lobes, of which that toward the left hand is the longeft. In the foetus it is of a pretty large fize, lefs in children, and very little in aged perfons. The greateft part of the thymus lies between the du* plicature of the fuperior and anterior portion of the me¬ diaftinum, and the great veffels of the heart; from whence it reaches a little higher than the tops of the two pleurx, fo that fome part of it is out of the cavity of the thorax. Its particular inward ftruflure and fecretions are not as yet fufficiently known to determine its ufes, which however feem to be defigned more for the fetus than for adults. COR. The heart is a mufcular body fituated in the cavity of the thorax on the anterior part of the diaphragm, be¬ tween the two laminae of the mediaftinum. It is in fome meafure of a conical figure, flatted on the fides, round at top, and oval at the bafis. Accordingly, we confide* in the heart the bafis, apex, two edges, and two fides; one of which is generally flat, the, other more convexv Befides the mufcular body, which chiefly forms what we call the heart, its bafis is accompanied by two appendices called auriculae, and by large blood-veffels ; all thefe are included in a membranous capfula, named pericardium. It is hollow within, and divided by a feptum which runs between the edges into two cavities, called ventri « cult, one of which is thick and folid, the other thin and foft. This latter is generally termed the right ventricle, the other the left ventricle, though in their natural fituation the right ventricle is placed more anteriorly than the left. Each ventricle opens at the bafis by two orifices, one of which anfwers to the auricles, the other to the mouth of a large artery; and accordingly one of them may be termed the auricular orifice, the other the arterial ori¬ fice. The right ventricle opens into the right auricle, and into the trunk of the pulmonary artery; the left, in¬ to the left auricle,, and into the great trunk of the aorta. At the edges of thefe orifices are found feveral moveable pelliculae, called valves by anatomifts ; of which fome are turned inward, toward , the cavity of the ventricles, called triglochines or tricufpides; others are turned towards the great veffels, called femilunares or figmoidales. The valvulae tricufpides of the left ventricle are like wife termed mitrales. The inner furface of the ventricles is very uneven, many eminences and cavities being obfervable therein. The moft confiderable eminences are thick fleftry pro¬ ductions called columnac. To the extremities of thefe pillars are faftened feveral tendinous cords, the other ends of which are joined to the valvulae tricufpides. There are likewife other fmall fhort tendinous ropes along both edges of the feptum between the ventricles. Thefe fmall cords lie in an obliquely tranfverfe fituation, and form a kind of net-work at different diftances. The cavities of the inner furface of the ventricles are fmall deep foffulse or lacunae placed very near each Other, with fmall prominent, interfaces between them. The"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Part VI. The fiefliy Qr mufcular fibres of which the heart is made up, are difpofed in a very Angular manner, efpe- cially thofe of the right or anterior ventricle, being either bent into arches or folded into angles. The fibres which are folded into angles are longer than thofe which are only bent ihto arches. The middle of theie arches, and the angles of the folds, are turned towards the apex of the heart, and the extremities of the fibres towards the bafis. Thefe fibres differ not only in length, but in their directions, which are very oblique in all, but much more fo in the long or folded fibres than in the (hort ones, which are Amply bent. Each ventricle is compofed of its proper diflinCl fibres, but the left ventricle has many more than the right. Where the two ventricles are joined, they form a feptum which belongs equally to both. The fibres which compofe the inner or concave furface ©f the ventricles, do not all reach to the bafis ; fome of them running into the cavity, and there forming the flefhy columnse, to which the loofe floating portion of the tricufpidal valves is fattened by tendinous ropes. The valves at the orifices of the ventricles are of two kinds. One kind allows the blood to enter the heart, and hinders it from going out the fame way ; the other kind allows the blood to go out of the heart, but hinders it from returning. The valves of the firft kind terminate the auriculas, and thofe of the fecond lie in the openings pfthegreat arteries. The firlt are termed femulanar or fig- moidal valves, the others triglochincs, tricufpidal, or mitral., i The tricufpidal valves of the right ventricle are fixed to its auricular orifice, and turned inward toward the cavity of the ventricle. They are three triangular pro¬ ductions, very fmooth and polifhed ob that fide which is turned towards the auricle; and on the fide next the ca¬ vity of the ventricle, they have feveral membranous and tendinous expanfions, and their edges are notched or in¬ dented.. The valves of the auricular orifice of the left ventricle are of the fame lhape and ftruCture, but they are only two in number ; and from fome fmall refem- blance to a mitre, they have been named mitrales. The femilunar valves are fix in number, three belong¬ ing to each ventricle, fituated at the mouths of the great arteries; and they may be properly enough named val- vulae arteriales. The great artery that goes out from the left ventricle, is termed aorta. As it goes out, it turns a little toward the right hand, and then bends obliquely backward to form what is called aorta defeendens. The trunk of the artery which goes out from the right ventricle is called arteria pulmonaris. This trunk, as it is naturally fituated in the thorax, runs firft of all di- rerily uptvard for a fmall fpace, then divides laterally in¬ to two principal branches, one for each lung; that which goes to tlie right lung being the longeft, for a reafoo that (hall be given hereafter.. The auricles are mufcular bags fituated at the bafis of the heart, one towards the right ventricle, the other to¬ wards the left,- and joined together hy an inner feptum, and external communicating fibres, much in the fame manner with the ventricles ; onex>f them being named the right auricle, die other tbeJeft. They are very uneven 279 on the infide, but fmoother on the outfide, and terminate in a narrow, flat, indented edge, reprefen ting a cock’s comb, or in fome meafure the ear of a dog. They open into thefe orifices of each ventricle, which are named auri¬ cular orifices; and they are tendinous at their opening, in the fame manner as the ventricles. The right auricle is larger than the left, and it joins the right ventricle by a common tendinous opening. It has two other openings united into one, and formed by two large veins which meet and terminate there, almoft in a direft line, called vena cava fuperior and inferior. The notched edge of this auricle terminates obliquely in a kind of obtufe point, which is a fmall particular produc¬ tion of the great bag, and is turned toward the middle of the bafis of the heart. The left auricle is a kind of mufcular bag or refervoir, of a pretty confiderable thicknefs, and unequally fquare, into which the four veins open, called venue pttlmonares , and which has a diftinft appendix belonging to it, like a third fmall auricle. This bag is very even on both fidts. The heart lies almoft tranfverfely on the diaphragm, the greateft part of it being in the left cavity of die tho¬ rax, and the apex being turned toward the bony extre¬ mity of the fixth true rib. The bafrs is toward the right cavity ; and both auricles, efpecially the right, reft on- the diaphragm. The origin or bafis of the pulmonary artery is, in this natural fituation, the higheft part of the heart on the forefide; and the trunk of this artery lies in a perpendi¬ cular plane, which may be conceived to pals between the ftemum and fpina dorfi. Therefore fome part of tlte bafis of the heart is in the right cavity of the thorax; and the reft, all the way to the apex, is in the left ca¬ vity; and it is for this reafon that the mediaftinum is turned toward that fide. According to this true natural fituation of the heart, the parts commonly faid to be on the right fide are ra¬ ther anterior, and ftiofe on the left fide pofterior; and that fide of the heart which is thought to be the forefide, is naturally the upper fide, and the backfide confeauent- ly the lower fide. The lower fide is very flat, lying wholly on the dia¬ phragm ; but the upper fide is a little convex through its whole length, in the direction of the feptum between the ventricles. The heart, with all the parts belonging to it, is con¬ tained in a membranous capfula, called pericardium, which is in fome mealure of a conical figure, and much bigger than the heart. It is not fixed to the bafis of the heart, but round the large veins: above the- aurichs, be¬ fore they fend off the ramifications, and round the large arteries, before their divifions. * The pericardium is made- up of three laminae, the middle and chief of which is compofed of very fine ten¬ dinous filaments, clofely interwoven and eroding each o- ther in different direftiens. The internal lamina feems to be a continuation of the outer ccat of the heart, au¬ ricles, and great veffels; The trunks of the aorta and pulmonary artery have one common coat which contains them both as in a (heath, and is lined on the infide by a cellular jubilance, chiefly in that fpace which lies between where. ANATOMY."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"*3o A N\" A T where the trucks are turned to each other, and the fides of the (heath. There is but a very finall portion of the vena cava contained in the pericardium. The pericardium is clofely connedted to the diaphragm, •not at the apex, bat exadtly at that place which anfwers to the flat or lower fide of the heart ; and it is a very difficult rhatter to feparate it from the diaphragm in dif- fedtion. The internal lamina is perforated by an infinite num¬ ber of very fmall holes, through which a ferous fluid continually tranfudes, in the fame manner as in the peri¬ toneum. This fluid being gradually collected after death, makes what is called aqua pericardii, which is found in confiderable quantities in opening dead bodies while they remain freffi. Sometimes it is of a reddiffi colour, which may be owing to a tranfudation of blood through the fine membrane of the auricles. The heart and parts belonging to it are the principal inftruments of the circulation of the blood. The two ventricles ought to be confidered as two fyringes fo clofely joined together as to make but one body, and furniffied with fuckers placed in contrary directions to each other, fo as that by drawing one of them, a fluid is let in, and forced out again by the other. The heart is made up of a fubftance capable of con¬ traction and dilatation. When the flefliy fibres of the ventricles are contracted, the two cavities are leflened in an equal and direCt manner, not by any contortion or twitting, as the falfe refemblance of the fibres to a fi¬ gure of eight has made anatomifts imagine. For if we confider attentively in how many different directions, and in how many places, thefe fibres crofs each other, as has been already obferved, we muff fee clearly, that the whole ftruCture tends to make an even, direCt, and uni¬ form contraction, more according to the breadth or thicknefs, than according to the length of the heart, be- caufie the number of fibres fituated tranfverfely, or al- moft tranfverfely, is much greater than the number of longitudinal fibres. The flefliy fibres thus contracted, do the office of fuck¬ ers, by prefling upon the blood contained in the ventricles,, which blood being thus forced toward the balls of the heart, preffes the tricufpidal valves againft each other. Opens the femilunares, and rulhes with impetuofity through the arteries and their ramifications, as through fo many elaftic tubes. The blood thus puffied on by the contraction of the ventricles, and afterwards preffed by the elaftic arteries, enters the capillary veflels, and is from thence forced to return by the veins to the auricles, which, like retire¬ ments, porches, or antichambers, receive and lodge the blood returned by the veins during the time of a new contraction. This contraction of the heart is by anato- mitts termed fyftole. The contraction or fyftole of the ventricles ceafes im¬ mediately, by the relaxation of their flefhy fibres; and in that time the auricles, which contain the venal blood, being contracted, force the blood through the tricufpidal valves into the ventricles, the fides of which are thereby dilated, and their cavities enlarged. This dilatation is termed diaftole, * O M Y. Part VI. in this manner does the heart, by the alternate fyftole and diaftole of its ventricles and auricles, puffi the blood through the arteries to all the parts of the body, and re¬ ceive it again by the veins. This is called the circula¬ tion of the blood, which is carried on in three different manners. The firft and moll univerfal kind of circulation is that by which almoft all the arteries of the body are filled by the fyftole of the heart, and the greateft part of the veins evacuated by the diaftole. The fecond kind of circulation oppofite to the firft, is through the coronary veflels of the heart, the arteries of which are filled with blood during the diaftole of the ventricles, and the veins emptied during the fyftole. The third kind of circulation is that of the left ven¬ tricle of the heart; through the venal duCts of which a fmall quantity of blood pafles, without going through the lungs, which is the courfe of all the remaining mafs of blood. * , ' PULMONES. The lungs are two large fpungy bodies, of a reddiffi colour in children, greyilh in adult fubjedts, and blCuffi in old age; filling the whole cavity of the thorax, one being feated in the right fide, the other in the left, part¬ ed by the mediaftinum and heart, and of a figure answer¬ ing to that of the cavity which contains them; that is, convex next the ribs, concave next the diaphragm, and irregularly flatted and deprefled next the mediaftinum and heart. * They are diftinguiffied into the right and left lung; and each of thefe into two or three portions called lobi} of which the right lung has commonly three, or two and a half, and the left lung two. The right lung is gene¬ rally larger than the left, anfwerably to that cavity of the breatt, and the obliquity of the mediaftinum. At the lower edge of the left lung, there is an in¬ dented notch or finus oppofite to the apex of the heart; which is therefore never covered by that lung, even in the ftrongeft infpirations, and confequently the apex of the heart and pericardium may always ftrike againft the ribs. . i The fubftance of the lungs is almoft all fpungy, being made up of an infinite number of membranous cells,, and of different forts of veflels fpread among-the cells, in in¬ numerable ramifications. This whole mafs is covered by a membrane continued from each pleura, which is commonly faid to be double; but what is looked upon as the inner membrane is only an expanfion and continuation of a cellular fubftance. The veflels which compofe part of the fubftance of the lungs are of three or four kinds; the air-veflels,' blood-veflels, and lymphatics, -arid the nerves. The air- veflels make the chief part, and are termed bronchia. Thele bronchia are conical tubes, compofed of an in¬ finite number of cartilaginous fragments, like fo many irregular arches of circles, connedted together by a li¬ gamentary elaftic membrane, and difpofed in fuch a man¬ ner as that the lower eaflly infinuate themfelves within t-hofe above them.. • - , ‘ They"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANA They are lined on the infide by a very fine membrafte, which continually difcharges a mucilaginous fluid; and in the fubftance of the membrane are a great number of fmall blood-veflels. The bronchia are divided in all directions into an infi¬ nite- number of ramifications, which diminifh gradually in fize; and as they become capillary, change their car¬ tilaginous ftru&ure into that of a membrane. Each of thefe numerous bronchial tubes is widened at the extremity, and thereby formed into, a fmall membra¬ nous cell, commonly called a veficle. Thefe cells or folliculi are clofely connected together in bundles; each fmall branch producing a bundle proportionable to its extent and the number of its ramifications. Thefe fmall veficular or cellulous bundles are termed lohulet ; and as the great branches are divided into fmall rami, fo the great lobules a redivided into feveral fmall ones. The cells or veficles of each lobule have a free communication with each other, but the feveral lobules do not communicate fo readily. The lobules appear diftinCtly to. be parted by another cellulous fubftance, which furrourids each of them in pro¬ portion to their extent, and fills up the interftices between them. This fubance forpis likewife a kind .of irregular mcmbrKmous cells, which are thinner, loofer, and broad¬ er than the bronchial vefifcles. All the bronchial cells are furrounded by a very fine reticular texture of the fmall extremities of arteries j>nd veins, which communicate every way with each other. The blood-veflels of the lungs are of two kinds; one Common, called the pulmonary artery and veins ; the o- tfcer proper, called the bronchial arteries and veins. The pulmonary artery goes out from the right ventri¬ cle of the heart; and its trunk having run almoftdiredly upward as high as the\" curvature of the aorta, is divided into two lateral branches, one going to the right-hand* Called the right pulmonary artery, the other to the left, termed the left pulmonary artery . The right artery pafles under the curvature of the aorta, and is confe- quently longer than the left. They both run to the lungs, and are difperfed through their whole fubftance by ramifications nearly like \"thofe of the bronchia, and lying in the fame directions. The pulmonary veins having been diftributed through ,the lungs in the fame manner, go odt en each fide, \"by two great branches, which open laterally into the refer- voir or mufcular bag of the right auricle. Befides thefe capital blood-veflels, there are two o- thers called the bronchial artery and vein. Under the root of each lung, that is, under that part formed by the .fubordifiate trunk of the pulmonary arte¬ ry, -by the .trunks of the pulmonary veins, and by the trunk ofnhe bronchia, th^re is a pretty broad membra-' nous ligament, which ties the pofterior edge of each lung to the lateral parts of the \"vertebras of the back, front that-root all the way to the diaphragm. The bronchia already deferibed are branches or rami¬ fications of a large canal, partly cartilaginous, and part¬ ly membranous, called trachea-, or afpera arteriai It i^fituated anteriorly in thp lower part of the neck, from Whence it r«ns down into the thorax betwixt the two Vol. I. Numb. is.- ' 3 - T O M T. 281 pleurae, through the upper fpace left between the dupli- cature of the mediaftinum, behind the thymus. Having reached as low as the curvature of the aorta, it divides into two lateral parts, one toward the right- hand, the other toward the left, which enter the lungs, and are diftributed through them in the manner already faid. Thefe two branches are called bronchia, and that on the right fide is ihorter than that of the left. The trachea is made up of fegments of circles or car¬ tilaginous hoops, difpofed in fuch a manner, as to form a canal open on the back part, the cartilages not going quite round; but this opening is filled by a foft glandular membrane, which completes the circumference of the canal. Each- circle is about the twelfth part of an inch in breadth, and about a quarter of that fpace in thicknefs. Their extremities are round; and they are fituated ho¬ rizontally above each other, fmall intcrftices being left between them, and the lower edge of the fuperior feg¬ ments being turned toward the upper edge of thofe next below them. They are-all connected by a very ftrong elaftic mem¬ branous ligament fixed to their edges. The canal of the afpera arteria is lined on the infide by a particular membrane, which appears to be partly fleihy or mufcular, and partly ligamentary, perforated by an infinite number , of fmall holes, through which a mucilaginous fluid continually pafles, to defend the inner furface of tile trachea againft the acrimony of the air. This fluid comes from fmall glandular bodies difperfed through the fubftance of the membrane, but efpecially from the glands, fomething larger than the former, which lie on the outer or pofterior furface of that ftrong mem¬ brane, by which the circumference of the/canal is com¬ pleted. The fame ftruCture is obfervable in the ramifi¬ cations of the trachea from the greateft to the fmalleft. At the angle of the firft ramification of the trachea ar¬ teria, we find on both the fore and back fides, certain' foft, roundilh, -glandular bodies, of a bluifh or blackiftv colour, and of a texture partly like that of the thymus already deferibed, and partly like that of the glandula thyroides. There are other glands of the fame kind, as the Origin of each ramification of the bronchia, but they decreafe proportionably in number and s fize. They arc fixed immediately to the bronchia, and covered by thef interlobular fubftance; and they feem to communicate by fmall openings with the cavity of the bronchia. . Refpiration is performed by organs of two kinds, one or which may be looked upon as active, the other as paflive. The lungs are of the fecond kind, and the firft compre¬ hends chiefly the diaphragm and intercoftal mufcles. As foon as the intercoftal mufcles begin to contrail, the arches of the ribs are raifed together with the (ter - num, and placed at a greater diftance from each other; by which,means the cavity of the, thorax is inlarged on the ‘two lateral and anterior fides. , At the fame inftant the diaphragm is flatted ,or brought toward a plane by two motions, which are ap¬ parently contrary; that is, by the contraction of the diaphragm, and the dilatation of the ribs in which it is- inferted. The external furface of the thorax b :ir.g thus in a manner increafcd, and the cavity of the bronchia"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"282 A N A T being at the fame time, and by the fame means, lefs re¬ filled or prefled upon ; the ambient air yields to the ex¬ ternal prefl'ure, and infinuates itfelf into all the places where the prefl’ure is diminifhed, that is, into the afpera arteria, and into all the ramifications of the bronchia all the wif to the veficles. This is what is called infpiration. This motion of infpiration is inftantaneous, and ceafes in a moment by the relaxation of the intercoftal mufcles ; the elaftic ligaments and cartilages of the ribs bringing them back at the fame time to their former fituation. This motion, by which the ribs are deprefled and brought nearer each other, is termed expiration. The pulmonary arteries and veins which accompany the bronchia through all their ramifications, and fur- round the veficles, tranfmit the blood through their nar¬ row capillary extremities, and thereby change or modify it, at leaft in three different manners. The firft change or modification which the blood un¬ dergoes in the lungs, is to have the cohefionS of its parts broken, to be attenuated, pounded, and, as it were, .re¬ duced to powder. The fecond is, to be deprived of a certain quantity of ferum, which tranfpires through the lungs, and is what we commonly call the breath. The third is to be in a manner reanimated by the impreflion of the air. OESOPHAGUS. The oefophagus is a canal partly mufcular, and partly membranous, fituated behind the trachea arteria, and before the. vertebrae of the back, from near the middle of the neck, down to the lower part of the thorax; from whence it pafles into the abdomen through a particular hole of the fmall or inferior mufcle of the diaphragm, and ends at the upper orifice of the ftomach. It is made up of feveral coats, almoft in the fame manner as the ftomach, of which it is the continuation. The firft coat, while in the thorax, is formed only by the duplicature of the pofterior part of the mediaftinum, and O M y. Part VI. is wanting above the thorax and the neck, where the outer coat of the cefophagus is only a continuation of the cellular fubftance belonging to the neighbouring parts. , The fecond coat is mufcular, being made up of feveral ftrata of flelhy fibres. The third is termed the nervous coat , and is like that of the ftomach and inteftines. The fourth or innermoft coat refembles in fome mea- fure that of the inteftines, except that inftead of the villi it has fmall and very Ihort papillae. Through the pores of this coat, a vifcid lympha is continually dis¬ charged. The cefophagus from its very beginning, turns a little to the left hand, and naturally runs along the left ex¬ tremities of the cartilages of the afpera arteria. The thyroid gland, pharynx and larynx, /hall be defcribed in another place. DUCTUS THORACICUS. The thoracic du<ft is a thin tranfparent canal, which runs up from the receptaculum chyli, along the fpina dorfi, between the vena azygos and aorta, as high as the fifth vertebra of the back, or higher. From thence it pafles behind the aorta toward the left hand, and afcends behind the left fubclavian vein, where it terminates in fome fubjetfs by a kind of veficula, in others by feve¬ ral branches united together, and opens into the back- fide of the fubclavian vein near the outfide of the inter¬ nal jugular. This canal is plentifully furni/hed with femilunar valves turned upward. Its opening into the fubclavian vein in the human body, is, in the place of valves, co¬ vered by feveral pellicula:, fo difpofed as to permit the entrance of the chyle into the vein, and hinder the blood from running into the dudt. It is fometimes double, one lying on each fide, and fometimes it is accompanied by appendices called pampinifortnes. EXPLANATION of PLATE XIX. Figure i.

The name of brain is given to all that mafs which fills the cavity of the cranium, and which is imnjediate- ly furrounded by two membranes called meninges or matres. This general mafs is divided into three particular por¬ tions; the cerebrum or brain properly fo called, the ce¬ rebellum, and medulla oblongata. To thefe three parts, a fourth is added, which fills the great canal of the fpina dorfi, by the name of medulla fpinalis, being acontinua- tion of the medulla oblongata. Th&"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"23 4 ANA T The meninges or membranes are two in number. The firfi is named dura mater; the fecond pia mater, which is again divided into two; the external lamina being termed araehnoides, the internal retaining the common name of pia mater. DURA MATER. The dura mater inclofes the brain and all it appen¬ dages. It lines the infide of the crariium, and fupplies the place of an internal periofleum, being fpread in all the holes and depreffions, and covering all the eminences in fuch a manner as to prevent their being hurtful to the brain. The dura mater is made up of two laminae, adhering very clofely together ; the fibres of both croffing each other obliquely. Their texture is very clofe and Itrong, appearing to be partly ligamentary and partly tendinous. The dura mater flicks clofely to the cranium by a great number of filaments of the external lamina, which enter the pores of the bones chiefly at the futures both above and below ; and by penetrating thefe joints, they com¬ municate with the external periofleum. Thefe adhefions are formed intirely by the external lamina. The internal lamina is very fmooth and polifh- ed on the infide, which is alfo continually moftened by a fine fluid difeharged through its pores, much in the fame manner as in the peritonaeum and pleura. The folds of the dura mater are made by the internal lamina; and three of them form particular fepta; one of which is fuperior, .representing a kind of mediaftinum between the two great lobes of the brain. The fecond is in a middle fituation, like a diaphragm between the ce¬ rebrum and cerebellum; the third is inferior, between the lobes of the cerebellum. The fuperior feptum is longi¬ tudinal, in form of a feythe, from whence it is termed the falx of the dura mater. The middle feptum is tranf- verfe, and might be called the diaphragm of the brain. The Inferior feptum is very fmall, and runs down be¬ tween'thc'lobes of the cerebellum. _ B elides thefe large folds, there are two fmall lateral ones on each fide of the fella turcica,, each running from the poflerior to the anterior clynoid apophyfis on the fame fide. Thefe two folds, together with the anterior and poflerior parts of the fella turcica, form a fmall foffula in which the pituitary gland is lodged. The elongations of the dura mater are produ&ions of both laminae, which go beyond the general circumference, and pafs out of the cranium. The mofl confiderable of thefe elongations pafies through the great occipital foramen, and runs down the common canal of the vertebrae in form of a tube, lining the infide of that canal, and inclofing the medulla fpi- »alis,' by the name cf the dura mater of that medulla. The other elongations accompany the nerves out of the cranium in form of vaginae, which are more numerous than the nervous trunks reckoned in pairs. There are tv/o particular elongations which form the periflor.eum of the orbits, together with the vaginae of > the optic nerves. Thefe orbitary elongations go out by the fphencidal or fuperior crbltary fifTures, and, fncrea- O M Part VI. fing in breadth in their paflage, line the whole cavity of the orbits, at the edges of which they communicate with the pericranium and periofleum of the face. The elongations of the dura mater which accompany the blood-veffels through the foramina of the cranium, unite with the pericranium immediately afterwards. Such, for inflance, are the elongations which line the foffula: of the foramina lacera or jugularia, and the bony or ca¬ rotid canals of the apophyfis petrofa, <bc. The dura mater contains in its duplicature feveral par¬ ticular canals, into, which the venal blood not only of that membrane, but of the whole brain, is carried. Thefe canals are termed finufes, and fome of them are difpofed in pairs, others in uneven numbers; that is, fome of them are placed alone, in a middle fituation; others are difpofed laterally on each fide of the brain. The moft ancient anatomifts reckoned only four; to which we can now add four times as many. Thefe finufes are in the duplicature of the dura mater; and their cavities are lined on the infide by particular very fine membranes. They may be enumerated in this manner. The great finus of the falx, or fuperior longitudinal finus, which was reckoned the firft by the arfeients. Two great lateral finufes, the fecond and third of the ancients. The finus called torcular Herophili, the fourth of the ancients. The fmall finus of the falx, or inferior longitudinal finus. The poflerior occipital finus, which is fometimes double. Two inferior occipital finufes, which form a portion of a circle, and may likewife be called the inferior lateral Six finus petrofi, three on each fide, one anterior, one middle or angular, and one inferior. The two in¬ ferior, together with the occipital finufes, complete a circular finus round the great foramen of the os occipitis. The inferior tranfverfe finus. The fuperior tranfverfe finus. The two circular finufes of the fella fphenoidalis; one faperior, and one inferior. Two finus cavernofi, one on each fide. Two orbitary finufes, one on each fide. All thefe finufes communicate with each other, and with the great lateral finufes by which they difeharge themfelves into the internal jugular veins, which are on¬ ly continuations of thefe lateral finufes. They likewife unload themfelves partly into the vertebral veins, which communicate with the fmall lateral or inferior occipital finufes; and partly into the external jugular veins, by the orbitary finufes which communicate with the vena anguiares, frontales, nafales, maxillares, &c. as the la¬ teral finufes likewife communicate with the venae occipi- tales, 8cc. Thus the blood which is\" carried to the dura mater, &c. by the external and internal carotid, and by the vertebral arteries, is returned to the heart by the exter¬ nal and internal jugular and vertebral veins ; fo that when the paflage of the blood is obflruited in any particular place, it finds another way, by virtue of thefe communi¬ cations, though not with the fame eafe."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Plate XX."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":". ■ ' M i I"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A T PI A MATER. This membrane furrounds the whole mafs of the brain more particularly than the dura mater. It ad¬ heres very clofely to the brain, and is coune&ed to the' dura mater only by the veins which open into the finufes. .The pia mater is made up of two very fine laminae, the outermoft of which covers pretty uniformly all the convex furface of the brain, and lines in the fame man¬ ner all the concave or inner furface of the dura mater. The internal lamina forms a great number of plicae, du- plicatures, and fepta, which infinuate themfelves into all the folds and circumvolutions, and between the different ftrata of the cerebrum and cerebellum. CEREBRUM. The cerebrum properly fo called, is a kind of me¬ dullary mafs, of a moderate confidence, and of a grey- iih colour on the outer furface, filling all the fuperior portion of the cavity of the cranium, or that portion which lies above the tranfverfe feptum. The upper part of the cerebrum is of an oval figure, like half an egg cut Iengthwiie. It is flatted on the lower part, each lateral half of which is divided into three eminences, called lobes, one anterior, one middle, and one pofterior. The fubftance of the cerebrum is of two kinds, diftin- guifhed by two different colouts ; one part of it, which is fofteft, being of a greyiili or afli colour; the other, which is more folid, being very white. The afh-colour- ed fubftance lies chiefly on the outer part of the cere¬ brum like a kind of cortex, from whence it has been named fubjiantia cortiealis or cinerea. The white fub¬ ftance occupies the inner part, and is named fubjiantia medullaris, or Amply fubjiantia alba. The cerebrum is divided into two lateral portions, fe- parated by the falx, or great longitudinal feptum of the dura mater. They are generally termed hemifpheres. Each of thefe portions is divided into two extremities, one anterior and one pofterior, which are termed the lobes of the cerebrum, between which there is a large inferior protuberance which goes by the fame name ; fo that in each hemifphere there are three lobes, one anterior, one middle, and one pofterior. The t anterior lie upon thefe parts of the os frontjs which contribute to the formation of the orbits and of the\" frontal finufes, commonly called the anterior foflae of the bafis cranii. The pofterior lobes lie on.the tranf-. verfe feptum; and the middle lobes, in the middle or lateral foflae of the bafis cranii. Each lateral portion of the cerebrum has three fides ; one fuperior, which is convex; one inferior, which is uneven ; and one lateral, which is flat, and turned to the falx. Through the whole furface of thefe three fidcs we fee inequalities or windings like the circumvolutions of inteftines, formed by waving ftreaks or furrows very deep and narrow, into which the fepta or cluplicatures of the pia mater infinuate themfelves; and thereby feparate thefe circumvolutions from each other. Near the furface thefe circumvolutions-are at fomedi- Yol. T. Numb. 12. O M Y. 2 f ?5 ftance from each other, reprefenting ferpentine ridges; and in the interftices between them, the fuperficial veins of the cerebrum are lodged, between the two laminae cf the pia mater, from whence they pafs in the duplicature of the dura mater, andfo open into the finufes. Thefe circumvolutions are fixed through their whole depth to the fepta or duplicatures of the pia mater, by an infinite number of very fine vafcular filaments. When they are cut tranfverfely, we obferve that the. fubftantia alba lies in the middle of each circumvolution, fo that there is the fame number of internal medullary circumvolutions as of external cortical ones. Having cut off the falx from the crifta galli, and turned it backward; if \"we feparate gently the two la¬ teral parts or hemifpheres of the cerebrum, we fee a longitudinal portion cf a white convex body, which is named ’ corpus callofum. It is a middle portion of the medullary fubftance, which under the inferior finus of the falx, and alfo a little toward each fide, is parted from the mafs of the cerebrum, to which it is fimply conti¬ guous from one end of that finus to the other. The furface of the corpus .callofum is covered by the pia mater, which runs in between the lateral por¬ tions of this body, and the lower edge of each hemi- fphere. The corpus callofum becomes afterwards continuous on each fide with the medullary fubftance, which through all the remaining parts of its extent is intircly united with the cortical lubftance, and together with the corpus callofum forms a medullary arch or vault of an oblong or oval figure. After which we will obferve a ’ medullary convexity much fmaller than that which is com-, mon to the whole cerebrum, but of the fame form ; fo that it appears like a medullary nucleus of the cerebrum. Under this arch are two lateral cavities, much longer than they are broad, and very fh allow, feparated by a tranfpatent medullary feptum. Thefe cavities are named the anterior, fuperior, or great lateral ventricles • of the cerebrum. The lateral ventricles are broad, and rounded at thefe extremities which lie next the tranfparent feptum; They go from before backward, contracting in breadth, and feparating from each other gradually in their pro- grefs. Afterwards they bend downward, and return obliquely from behind forward, in a courfe like the turn¬ ing of a ram’s horn, .and terminate almoft under their fu¬ perior extremities. Thefe ventricles are lined with a thin membrane. The tranfparent partition or feptum lucidum, lies di¬ rectly under the raphe or future of the corpus callofum, of which it is a continuation. It is made up of two me¬ dullary lamina;, more or lefs feparated from each other by a narrow medullary cavity, fometimes filled with a ferous fubftance. The feptum lucidum is united by its lower part, to the anterior portion of that medullary body, called the for¬ nix ’with three pillars. The fornix being cut off and inverted, or quite remo¬ ved, we fee firft of all a vafcular web, called plexus ckoroides , and feveral eminences more or lefs covered by the expanfioa of that plexus. There are four pairs of 3 4 C eminences"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"2%6 A N A T eminences which follow each other very regularly, two large, and two fmall. The firft two great eminences are named corpora Jiriata a nd the fecond, thalami nervo¬ rum Opticorum. The, four fmall eminences are clofely united together; the anterior being called nates, and the pofterior tejles. Immediately before thefe tubercles there is a fingle eminence, called g landula pinealis. The corpora firiata got that name, becaufe in fcraping thmi with the knife we meet with a great number of white and afh-coloured lines alternately difpofed, which are only the tranfverfe fedtion of the medullary and cor¬ tical laminae, mixed together in a vertical pofnion in the bafis of the cerebrum. They lie in the bottom of the foperior cavity of the lateral ventricles, which they refemble in feme meafure in ftiape, their anterior parts being near the feptum luci- dum, from which they feparate gradually as they run backward, and diminifh in fize. The thalami vsrvorurn oplicorum are fe named, be¬ caufe thefe nerves arife chiefly from them. They are two large eminences placed by the fide of each other, between the pofterior portions or extremities of the copora ftriata. Their figure is femi-fpheroidal and a little oval; and they are of a whitifh colour on the fur- face ; but their inner fubftance is partly greyifh and part¬ ly white. Thefe two eminences are .clofely joined together, and at their convex part they are fo far united as really to become one body, the whitifh outer fubftanCe being con¬ tinued uniformly over them both. Immediately within this whitifh common fubftance thefe two eminences are clofely contiguous till about the middle of their thicknefs ; and from thence they fepa¬ rate infenfibly toward the bottom, where by the fpace left between them a particular canal is formed, named the third ventricle, one extremity of which opens for¬ ward, the other backward. At the bottom thefe two eminences are elongated down¬ ward toward both fides, into two thick, round, whitifh cords* which feparate from each other like horns, by a large curvature; and afterwards by a fmall' curvature turned forward in an oppofite direction to the former, and reprefenting the tip of an horn, they approach each Other again. The fize of thefe ropes diminifhes gradu¬ ally fromhheir origin to their anterior reunion. The tubercles are four in number, two anterior, and two pofterior; adhering together as if they made but one body, fituated behind the union of the thalami nervorum opticorum.. Their forface is white, and their inner fub¬ ftance greyifh, and are called nates and tejtes. Diredtly under the place where the tubercles of one fide are united to thefe of the other fide* lies a fmall mid¬ dle canal, which, communicates by its anterior opening with the third ventricle, under the thalami nervorum opr ticorum, and by its pofterior opening with the fourth ventricle, which belongs to the cerebellum. Where the convex parts of the two anterior tubercles join thefe pofterior convex parts of the thalami nervorum opticorum, an interftice or opening is left between thefe four convexities which communicates with the third ven¬ tricle, and with the fmall middle canal, Ioftead of the O M T. Part VI. ridiculous name of anus, which has been given to this o- pening, it may be called foramen aammune pojlerius. The glandula pinealis is a fmall foft greyifh body, a- bout the fize of an ordinary pea, irregularly round, and ^formetimes of the figure of a pine apple, fituated behind the thalami nervorum opticorum, above the tubercula quadrigemina. It is fixed like a fmall button to the low¬ er part of the thalami by two very white medullary pe- dunculi, which at the gland are very near each other, but feparate almofl tranfverfely toward the thalami. It feems to be moftly of a cortical fubftance, except near the footftalks, where it is dome thing medullary. Between the bafis of the anterior pillar of the fornix, and the anterior part of the union of the optic thalami, lies a cavity or foflula named infundibulum. It runs down towards the bafis of the cerebrum, contracting gra¬ dually, and terminates in a ftreight courfe, by a fmall membranous canal, jn a foftifh body fituated in the fella turcica, named glandula pituitaria. The infundibulum opens above, immediately before the optic thalami, by an oval hole named foramen commune anterius, andcon- fequently communicates with the lateral ventricles. At the lower part of tb? thalami nervorum opticorum, diredtly under their union, lies a particular canal, called the third ventricle of the cerebrum. This canal opens forward into the infundibulum under the foramen commune anterius, by which it likewife com¬ municates with the lateral ventricles. It opens backward under the foramen commune pofterius, between the tha¬ lami and tubercula quadrigemina, oppofite to the fmall middle canal which goes to the cerebellum. The plexus choroides is a very fine vnfcular texture, confiding of a great number of arterial and venal ramifi¬ cations, partly colleiled in two loofe fafciculi, which lie one in each lateral ventricle, and partly expanded over the neighbouring parts, and covering in a particular man¬ ner the thalami nervorum opticorum, glandula pinealis, tubercula quadrigemina, afld the other adjacent parts both of the cerebrum and cerebellum, to all which it adheres. The pituitary gland is a fmall fpongy body lodged in the fella turcica between the fphenoidal folds of the dura raster. It is of a fingular kind of fubftance, which feems to be neither medullary nor glandular. On the outfide it is partly greyifh and partly reddifh, and white within. It is tranfverfely oval or oblong, and on the lower part in feme fubjedts it is divided by a fmall notch into two lobes, like a kidney-bean. It is covered by the pia mater as by a bag, the opening of which is the extre¬ mity of the infundibulum, and it is furrounded by the fmall circular finufes which communicate with the finus cavernofi, CEREBELLUM. T h e cerebellum is contained under the tranfverfe fop- turn of the dura mater. It is broader laterally than on the fore or back fides* flatted on the upper fide, and gently inclined both ways, anfwerable to- the feptum, which ferves it as a kind of tent or deling. On the fower fide it is rounder ; and on the backfide it is divided"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANATOMY. *$1 into two lobes, feparated by the occipital feptum of the dufa mater. It is made up, like the cerebrum, of two fubftances, but it has no circumvolutions on its furface. Its fulci are pretty deep, and difpofed in fuch a manner as to form thin flat .ftrata, more or lefs horizontal, between which the internal lamina of the pia mater iniinuates it- felf by a number of fepta equal to that of the ftrata. Under the tranfverfe feptum, it is covered by a vaf- cular texture, which Communicates with the plexus cho- roides. It has two middle eminences called appendices vermiformes j one anterior and fuperior, which is turned forward; the other pofterior and inferior, which goes back¬ ward. There are likewife two lateral appendices, both turned outward. Befides the divifion of the cerebellum into lateral por¬ tions or into two lobes, each of thefe lobes feems to be likewife fubdivided into three protuberances, one anterior, one middle or lateral, and one pofterior. When we feparate the two lateral portions or iobes, having firft made a pretty deep incifion, we difcover foft- of all the pofterior portion of the medulla oblongata ; and -in the pofterior farface' of this portion, frotn the tuber- cula quadrigemina, all the way to the pofterior notch in the body of the cerebellum, and a little below that notch, we obferve an oblong cavity which terminates backward like the point of a writing pen. This cavity is what is called the fourth ventricle. At the beginning of this cavity, immediately behind the fmall common cafial which lies under the tubercles, we meet with a thin medullary lamina, which is looked up¬ on as a valve between that canal and the fourth ventricle. A little behind this lamina, the cavity grows wider to¬ wards both hands, and then contracts again to its firft fize. It is lined interiorly by a thin membrane, and feems oftentimes to be diftinguilhed into two lateral parts, by a kind of fm ill groove, from the valvular lamina to the point of the calamus feriptorius. This membrane is a continuation of that which lines the fmall canal, the third ventricle, infundibulum, and the two great ventricles. * On each fide of this ventricle the medullary fubftance forms a trunk which expahds rtfelf in form of laminae- through the cortical ftrata. When one lobe of the cere¬ bellum is cut vertically from above downward, the me¬ dullary, fubftance will appear to be difperfed in ramifica¬ tions through the cortical fubftance. Thefe ramifica¬ tions have been named arbor vita; ; and the two trunks from whence thefe different laminae arife, are called pe¬ dunculi cerebelli. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata is a medullary fubftance fitua- ted from before backward in the middle part of the bafes of thfe cerebrum and cerebellum Without any difcontinua- tion, between* the lateral parts Of both thefe bafes; and- therefore it may be looked upon as one middle medullary bafis common to both cerebrum and cerebellum, by the reciprocal continuity of their medullary fubftances, through the great notch in the tranfverfe feptum of the dura mater; which common bafis lies immediately oir that portion of the dura mater which lines the bafis of the cranium. The medulla oblongata is therefore juftly efteemed to be a third general part of the whole mafs of the brain, or as the common production or united elongation of the whole medullary fubftance of the cere¬ brum and cerebellum. It is extremely difficult, if not altogether impoflible, to examine or demonftrate it as we ought, in its natural fituation; but we are obliged to do both on a brain in¬ verted. The lower fide of the medulla oblongata in an inverted fituation, prefents to our view feveral parts which are in general either medullary productions, trunks of nerves, or trunks of blood-veffels. The chief medullary productions are thefe : The large or anterior branches of the medulla oblongata; which have likewife been named crura anteriora, femora, and brachia medullse oblongatas, and pedunculi cerebri: The tranfverfe protuberance, called likewife proceflus annula¬ ris, or pons varolii*. The fmall or pofterior branches, called pedunculi cerebelli, or crura pofteriora medullse cblpnga- tse: The extremity or cauda of the medulla oblongata,, with two pairs of tubercles, one of which is named cor¬ pora olivaria, the other corpora pyramidalia; and to all thefe productions we muft add a production of the infun¬ dibulum and two medullary papilla*. The great branches of the medulla oblongata are two Very considerable medullary fafciculi, the anterior extre¬ mities of which axe feparated, and the pofterior uni¬ ted, for. that, taken both together, they reprefent a Ro¬ man V. The tranfverfe, annular, or rather femi-aimular pro¬ tuberance, is a medullary production, which feems at firft: fight to furround the pofterior extremities of the great branches; but the medullary fubftance of this protube¬ rance is in reality intimately mixed with that of the .two former. Varolius, an ancient Italian author, viewing thofe parts m .an inverted fituation, compared the two branches to two rivers, and the protuberance to a bridge over them both, and from thence it has the name of tons Varolii. The fmall branches of the medulla oblongata are la¬ teral productions of the tranfverfe protuberance, which hy their roots feern to encompafs that medullary por¬ tion in which the fourth ventricle or calamus feriptorius is formed.. The extremity is no more than die medulla oblongata contracted in its pafFage backward to the anterior edge' of the great foramea of the os occipitis, where it termi¬ nates, in the medulla fpinalis; and in this part of it feve- ral things are to be taken notice of. We fee firft of all, four eminences, two named corpora olivaria , and the o- ther tw o corpora pyramidalia. Immediately afterwards, it is divided into two lateral portions by two narrow grooves, one on the upper fide, the other on the lower. They both run into the fubftance of:the medulla, as be¬ tween two-cylinders, flatted on that fide by which they are joined together. When we feparate thefe ridges with the fingers^ we obferve a crucial intertexturc of feveral Snail medullary cords*:"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"288 A N A T O M Y. Part VI. cords, which go obliquely from the fubftance of one late¬ ral portion into the fubftance of the other. The corpora olivaria and pyramidalia are whitilh emi¬ nences fituated longitudinally near each other on the Lower fide of the extremity or cauda, immediately be¬ hind the tranfverfe or annular protuberances. The Cor¬ pora olivaria are in the middle, fo that the interftice be¬ tween them, which is a kind of fuperficial groove, an¬ swers to the inferior groove of the following portion. The corpora pyramidalia arc two lateral eminences depending on the olivaria. Thefe four eminences are fi¬ tuated on the lower half of the medulla. The tubercula mammillaria, or papillae medullares, which are fituated very near the production of the infun¬ dibulum, have been taken for glands. Thefe tubercles feem to have fome immediate relation to the roots or bales of the anterior pillar of the fornix. The beak or tube of the infundibulum is a very thin production from the fides of that cavity; and it is (length¬ ened by a particular coat given to it by the pia mater. It Is bent a little from behind forward, toward the glan- dula pinealis, and afterwards expands again round this gland. The membrana arachnoides, or external lamina of the pia mater, appears to be very diftinCtly feparated from the internal lamina, in the interftices between all thefe eminences on the lower fide of the medulla oblongata, without, any vifible cellular fubftance between them. From this medulla oblongata, arife almoft all the nerves which go out of the cranium through the diffe¬ rent foramina by which its bafis is perforated. It like- wife produces the medulla fpinalis, which is no more than a common elongation of the cerebrum and cerebel¬ lum, and of their different fubftances ; and therefore the medulla oblongata may juftly be faid to be the firft ori¬ gin or primitive foUrce of all the nerves of the human body. MEDULLA SPINALIS. The medulla fpinalis is'only an elongation of the ex¬ tremity of the medulla oblongata; and it has its name from its being contained in the bony canal of the fpinadorfi; con- fequently a continuation or common appendix of the cere¬ brum or cerebellum, as well becaufe of the two fubftances of which it is compofed, as becaufe of the membranes by which it is inverted. The dura mater, after it has lined the whole internal furface of the cranium, goes out by the great occipital foramen, and forms a kind of funnel, in its progrefs downward through the bony Canal of the vertebrae. The fpinal marrow is made up of a cortical and me¬ dullary fubftance, as the cerebrum and cerebellum ; but with this difference, that the alh-coloured fubftance lies within the other; and in a tranfverfe fetfion of this me¬ dulla, the inner fubftance appears to be of the figure of an horfe-lhoe. The body of the medulla fpinalis runs down all the way to the firft vertebra of the loins, where it terminates in a point. The fize of it is proportionable to that of the bony canal, fo that it is larger in the vertebrae of the neck than thofe of the back. It fends off from both the fore and back fides, at dif¬ ferent diftances, flat fafciculi of nervous filaments. The anterior and pofterior fafciculi having got a little'beyond the edge of the medulla, unite in pairs, and form on each fide a kind of knots, called ganglions by anatomifts, each of which produces a nervous trunk. Thefe gangli¬ ons are made up of a mixture of cortical and medullary fubftance, accompanied by a great number of fmall blood- veffels. The dura mater, which inverts the medulla, fends out on each fide the fame number of vaginae as there are ganglions and nervous trunks. Thefe vaginae are pro¬ ductions of the external lamina; the internal lamina, which is very fmooth and polilhed on the infide, being perfo¬ rated by two fmall holes very near each other, where each vagina goes off, through which holes the extremi¬ ties of each anterior and pofterior fafciculus are tranf- mitted ; and immediately after their paffage through the internal lamina, they unite. Uses of the Brain and its Appendages in general. Maephighi was the firft who difeovered the brain to be a gland, or an organ fitted to feparate fome particular fluid from the mafs of blood. The infinite number of fmall fecretory clufters ftrain or filter the mafs of blood carried to them by the nu¬ merous ramifications, and feparate from it an exceflive- ly fine fluid ; the remaining blood being conveyed back, by the fame number of venal extremities, into the finufes of the dura mater, and from thence into the jugular anct vertebral veins. This fubtile. fluid, commonly called animal fpirit, nervous juice , or liquor of the nerves , is continually forced into the medullary fibres of the white portion of the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and me¬ dulla fpinalis ; and by the intervention of thefe fibres fupplies and fills the nerves, which are a continuation of them. PERICRANIUM. Besides the external integuments of the head, the fltin, hair, and cellular fubftance, there is an aponeuro¬ tic expanfion which covers the head like a cap, and is fpread round the neck and on the Ihoulders like a riding- hood. < This aponeurofis is very ftrong on the head, and it appears to be maSe up at leaf! of two ftrata of fibres crof- fing each other. As it is fp^ad on the neck it becomes gradually thinner, and ends mfenfibly , on the clavicles. It fends out a production on each fide, from above down¬ ward, and from without inward, which having parted o-- ver the fuperior extremity of the mufculus fterno-maftoi- dasus, runs behind that mufcle toward the tranfverfe apo- phyfes of the vertebras of the neck, where it communi¬ cates with the ligamenta inter-tranfverfalia.

ANATOM Y. well as of all the other bones of the human body, ex¬ cept the teeth, is. covered by a particular membrane, of which that portion which particularly inverts the cranium is named pericranium , and that which inverts the bones of the face is fimply termed periofteum. The pericranium is made up of two laminae clofely u- nited together. The internal lamina, which has by fome been taken for a particular periofteum, covers immediate¬ ly all the body parts of this region ; and the external la¬ mina has been looked upon as a membrane diftinft from the internal, and named pericranium particularly. Sect. V.- Of the Eye. The Globe or Ball of the Eye. The globe of the eye is made up of feveral proper parts, fome of which being more or lefs folid, reprefent a kind of Ihell formed by the union of feveral membra¬ nous ftrata called the coats of the globe of.the eye; and the other parts being more or lefs fluid, and contained in particular membranous capful®, or in the interftices be¬ tween the coats, are termed the humours of the globe of the eye. Thefe capful® are likewife termed coats_. • The coats of the globe of tlie eye are of three kinds. Some form chiefly the fliell of the globe; fome are ad¬ ditional, being'fixed only to a part of the globe; and fome are capfular, which contain the humours. The coats which form the fliell are three in number. The ex¬ ternal is termed tunica fclerotica or cornea; the middle coat is named choroides ; and the third or innermoft, re¬ tina. The additional coats are two; one called tendi- mfa or albuginea, which forms the white of the eye; and the other, conjundiva,, The capfular tunic® are likewife two, the vitrea, and cryfta'llina. The Coats of the Eye. The moft external, thickeft, and rtrongeft coat of the eye is the fclerotica or cornea, and it invefls all the o- ther parts of which the globe is compofed. It is divided into two portions, one called cornea opaca, the other cornea lucida, which is only a fmall fegment of a fph.ere, fituated anteriorly. The cornea opaca is made up of feveral ftrata clofely connected together, and is.of an hard compact texture refembling parchment. About the middle of its pofte- rior convex portion, where it fuftains the optic nerve, it is in a manner perforated, and thicker than any where elfe. The cornea lucida is made up in the like manner of feveral ftrata or lamin® clofely united, and appears to be a continuation of th^e opaque portion or fclerotica, though of a different texture. This portion is fomething more convex than the cor¬ nea opaca.. fo that if reprefents the fegment of a fmall fphece added to the fegment of a greater. The cornea lucida is perforated by a great number of imperceptible pores, through which a very fine fluid is con¬ tinually difeharged, which foon afterwards evaporates. The fecond coat of the globe of the eye is the cho- Vol. I. No. 13.' 3 53? roides, which is of a blaclufli colour, more or lefs incli¬ ned to red, and adheres, by means of a great number of fmall veffels, to the cornea opaca, from the infertion pf the optic nerve, all the way to the union of the two cornese, where it leaves the circumference cf the globe, and forms a perforated feptum, by which the fmall feg¬ ment of the globe is feparated from the greater. This portion goes commonly by the particular name of uvea, which was formerly given to the whole fecond coat; and as it is of different colours in feveral fubjefts, it has like- wile got the name of iris. The anterior portion or perforated feptum of the cho¬ roides has the name of uvea, and the hole near the cent tre of this feptum is called pupilla. The anterior lami¬ na of the fame feptum is termed iris, and the radiated plicae of the pofterior lamina, procejfus ciliares. Be¬ tween the two laminae of the uvea, we find two very thin planes of fibres which appear to be fklhy, the fibres of one plane being orbicular, and lying round the circum* ference of the pupilla, and thofe of the other being ra¬ diated, one extremity of which is fixed to the orbicular plane, the other to the great edge of the. uvea. The pile® -or proceflus ciliares are fmall radiated and prominent duplicatures of the pofterior lamina of the u- vea, and their circumference anfwers partly to that of the white ring of the external lamina. They are oblong thin plates; their pofterior extremities, or thofe next; the choroides, being very fine and pointed; the others, or thofe. next the pupilla, broad, prominent, and ending in acute angles. The fpace between the cornea lucida and uvea con¬ tains the greateft part of the aqueous humour, and com¬ municates by the .pupilla with a very narrow fpace behind the uvea, or between that and the cryftalline. Thefe two fpaces have been termed the two chambers of the a- queous humour, one anterior, the other pofterior. * The third coat of the eye is of a very different texture from that of the other two coats. It is white,' foft, anc! tender, and in a njanner medullary, or like a kind of pafte fpread upon a fine reticular web. It appears to be thicker than >the choroides, and reaches from the infer¬ tion of the optic nerve, to the extremities of the ciliary radii, being equally fixed to the choroides through its whole extent. At the place which anfwers to the infer¬ tion of the optic nerve, we obferve a fmall depreflion, in which lies a fort of medullary button terminating in n point; and from this depreflion blood-veffels go out, which are ramified on all fides through the f.bftancc of the retina. The Humours of the Eye arid their Capsule. The vitreous humour is a clear and very liquid gela¬ tinous fluid, contained in a fine tranfparent capfula, called, tunica vitrea, together with which it forms a mart nearly of the confidence of the white ofan egg. It fills the great- eft part of the globe of the eye, that is, almoft all that, fpace which anfwers to the extent of the retina, except a fmall portion behind the uvea, where it forms a fofllila, in which the cryftalline is lodged. The tunica vitrea„is compofed exteriorly of two krnt- 4 D n®"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":".na: very clofely conncded, which quite furround the mafs of humour, and are immediately applied to the retina, all the way to the great circumference of the corona cili- aris; but from thence to the circular edge of the foflula of the cryftalline, this coat is full of radiated fulci, which contain the proccflus ciliares of the uvea. The internal lamina of the tunica vitrea gives off, through the whole fubftance of this humour, a great num¬ ber of cellular elongations or fepta. The radiated fulci of the tunica vitrea, which may be termed fulci ciliares , arc perfectly black, when the coat is taken out of the^body. The ciyftalline is a fmall lenticular body, of a pretty firm confiftence, and tranfparent like cryftal. It is con¬ tained in a tranfparent membranous capfula, and lodged in the anterior foflula of the vitreous humour. The figure of the cryftalline is lenticular, but its po- fterior fide is more convex than the anterior, the con¬ vexity of both fides being very rarely equal. The cryftalline capfula or coat is formed by a duplica turc of the tunica vitrea The external lamina covers the anterior fide of the cryftalline mafs ; the internal la¬ mina covers the backfide, and likewife the foflula vitrea, in which the cryftalline is lodged. The anterior portion fwells when macerated in water, and then appears to be made up of two pelliculae, united by a fine fpungy fubftance.. The aqueous humour is a very limpid fluid, refembling a kind of lympha or ferum, with a very fmall degree of vifeidity; and it has no particular capfula like the cry¬ ftalline and vitreous humours. It fills the fpace between the cornea lucida and uvea, that between the uvea and the cryftalline, and the hole of the pupilla. Thefe two lpaces are called the chambers of the aqueous humour, and they are diftinguiftied into the anterior and poftcrior. The anterior chamber, which is vifible to every body, between the cornea lucida and uvea, is the largeft; the other between the uvea and cryftalline is very narrow, efpecially near the pupilla, where the uvea almoft touch¬ es the cryftalline. Tunica Albuginea and Muscles of the Globe of the Eye. The tunica albuginea, called commonly the white of the eye, and which appears on all the anterior convex fide of the globe, from the cornea lucida, to the begin¬ ning of the pofterior fide, is formed chiefly by the tendi¬ nous expanfion of four mufcles. There are commonly fix mufcles inferred in the globe of the human eye, and' they are divided into four redi and two obliqui. The redi are again divided, from their fituation, into fuperior, inferior, internal, and ex¬ ternal ; and from their functions, into a levator, de- preflor, addudor, and abdudor. The two oblique muf¬ cles are denominated from their fituation and fize, one being named obliquus fuperior or major, the other o- lliquus inferior, or minor. The obliquus major is likewife called irochlearis, becaufe it pafles through a fmall cartilaginous ring, as over a trochlea or pulley. The mufeuli redi are fixed by their pofterior extremi- O M Y. Part vr. ties at the bottom of the orbit near the foramen opti- cum in the elongation of the dura mater, by fhort nar¬ row tendons. Ffom thence they run wholly fielhy, to¬ ward the great circumference of the convexity of the globe, between the optic nerve and cornea lucida, where they are expanded into flat broad tendons which touch each other, and afterwards unite. Thefe tendons are fixed firft of all by a particular infertion in the circumfe¬ rence juft mentioned, and afterwards continue their adhe- fion all the way to the cornea, forming the tunica albu¬ ginea. The fuperior oblique mufcle is fixed to the bottom of the orbit, by a narrow tendon, in the fame manner as the redi, between the rectus fuperior and internus.. From thence it runs on the orbit oppofite to the interfticc be¬ tween thefe two mufcles, toward the internal angular a- pophyfis of the os frontis, where it terminates in a thin tendon, which having pafled through a kind of ring as o- ver a pulley, runs afterwards in a vagina obliquely back¬ ward under the redus fuperior, that is between that muf¬ cle and the globe; and, increafing in breadth, it is inferred pofteriorly and laterally in the globe, near the redus ex- ternus. The ring through which this mufcle pafles, is partly cartilaginous and partly ligamentary. The cartilaginous portion is flat, of a confiderable breadth, and like half a ring. The ligamentary portion adheres ftrongly to the two ends of the cartilage, and is fixed in the fmall foflula which lies in the orbit, on the angular apophylis of the os frontis. By means of this ligament, the ring is in fome meafure moveable, and yields to the motions of the mufcle. To the anterior edge of the ring, a ligamenta¬ ry vagina is fixed, which invefts the tendon all the way ter its infertion in the globe. The obliquus inferior is fituated obliquely at the low¬ er fide of the orbit, under the redus inferior, which confequently lies between this mufcle and the globe. It is fixed by one extremity a little tendinous, to the root of the nafal apophyfis of the os maxillare, near the edge of the orbit between the opening of the dudus nafalis, and the inferior orbitary fiflure. From thence it pafles obliquely, and a little tranfverfe- ly backward, under the redus inferior, and is fixed in the pofterior lateral part of the globe by a flat tendon, oppofite to, and at a fmall diftance from the tendon of the obliquus fuperior, fo that thefe two mufcles do in fome meafure furround the outer pofterior part of the globe. The redus fuperior moves the Anterior portion of the globe upward when we lift up the eyes; the redus infe¬ rior carries this portion downward; the internus,, toward the nofe; and the externus, toward the temples. When two neighbouring redi ad at the fame time, they carry the anterior portion of the globe obliquely to¬ ward that fide which anfwers to the diftance between thefe two mufcles ; and when all the four mufcles ad fiicceffively, they turn the globe of the eye round, which is what is called rolling the eyes. The ufe of the oblique mufcles is chiefly to counterba¬ lance the adion of the redi, and to fupport the globe in all. the motions- already mentioned. This is evident from their"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANA their infertions, which are in a contrary direction to thofe of the reCti, their fixed points with relation to the mo¬ tions of the globe being placed forward, and thofe of the reCti backward, at the bottom of the orbit. The reft us externus, by being bent on the globe, not only hinders it from being carried outward, biit alfo pre¬ vents the indirect motions of the obliqui from thrufting it out of the orbit toward the temples. The Supercili»a, fl»(/MuscrLi Frontales, Occi- p 1 tales, and Superciliar.es. The fupercilia, or eye-brows, are the two hairy arches fituated at the lower part of the forehead, between the top of the nofe and temples, in' the fame direction with the bony arches which form the fuperior edges of the orbits. Their colour is different in different perfons, and often in the fame perfon different from that of the hair on the head; the hairs of which they confift are ftrong and pretty ft iff, and they lie obliquely, their roots being turned to the nofe, and their points to the temples. The fupercilia have motions common to them with thofe of the fkin of the forehead, and of the hairy fealp. By thefe motions the eye-brows are lifted up, the fkin of the foreheadis wrinkled more or lefts regularly and tranf- verfely; and the hair and almott the whole ftcalp is mo¬ ved, but not in the fame degree in all perfons. The eye-brows have likewife particular motions which con- trad the fkin above the nofe ; -and all thefe different mo¬ tions are performed by the following mufcles. The frontal mufcles are two thin, broad, fiefhy planes of unequal lengths, lying immediately behind the fkin and membrana adipofa, on the anterior parts of the fore¬ head, which parts they cover from the root of the nofe, and through about two thirds of the arch of the eye¬ brows on each fide, all the way .to the lateral parts of the hair on the forehead. At the root of the nofe they touch each other as if they were but one mufcle; and at this place their fibres are fhort and longitudinal, or ver¬ tical. Thefe mufcles are fixed by the inferior extremities of their ftefhy fibres immediately in the fkin, running thro’ the membrana adipofa. They cover the mufculi fuper-> ciliares, and adhere clofely to them by a kind of inter¬ texture. By the fame fibres they feem to be inferted in the angular apophyfes of the os fronds, and to be blend¬ ed a little with the mufcles of the palpebrse and nofe; The upper extremities of their flefhy fibres are fixed in the external or convex furface of the pericranium. Each of their lateral portions covers a portion of the temporal mufcle on the fame fide, and adheres very clofely to it. The occipital mufcles are two fmall, thin, broad, and very fhort flefby planes,. fituated on the lateral parts of the occiput, at feme diftance from each other. They are inferted by the inferior extremities of their .flefhy fibres in the fuperior tranfverfe line of the os occipitis, and al¬ fo a little above it. From thence they run up obliquely from behind forward, and are fixed in the inner concave furface of the pericranium. , The breadth of thefe mufcles reaches from the pofte- riar middle part of the occiput, toward the mailoid a-. T O M Y. 29 s pophyfis, and they diminilh unequally in length as they approach the apophyfes. Thefe four mufcles feem always to a£l in concert, the occipitales being only auxiliaries or afliftants to the fron- tales, the office of which- is to raife the fupercilia, by wrinkling the (kin of the forehead. The mufculi fuperciliares are flefhy fafciculi, fituated behind the fupercilia, and behind the inferior portion of the mufculi frontales, from the root cf the nofe to above one half of each fuperciliary arch. They are ftrongly- inferted, partly in the fynarthrofis of the ofla nafi, with the os fronds, where they come very near the proper muf¬ cles of the nofe, and partly in a fmall neighbouring portion of the orbit. From thence- they firft run up a little, and afterwards more or lefts in the direction of the eye-brows. They are made up of feveral fmall fafciculi of oblique fibres, all fixed by one end in the manner al¬ ready faid, and by the other partly in the lower extre¬ mity of the mufcles by which they are covered, and partly, in the fkin of the fupercilia. The action of thefe mufcles is to deprefs the eye¬ brows, to bring them clofe together, and to contract the fkin of the fore-head immediately above the nofe, into longitudinal and oblique wrinkles, and the fkin which covers the root of the nofe into irregular tranfverfe wrinkles. The Palp-ear.® and Membrana Conjunctiva. The palpebrse are a kind of veils or curtains placed tranfverfely above and below the anterior portion of the globe of the eye;:and accordingly there are two eye¬ lids to each eye, one fuperior, the other inferior, The fuperior is the. largeft and moft moveable inman. They both unite at each fide of the globe, and the places of their union are termed angles^ one large and internal, which is next the nofe, the other fmall. or external, which- is next the temples. The palpebrse- are made up of common and proper parts. The common parts are the fkin, epidermis, and membrana adipofa. The proper .parts are the mufcles, the tarfi, the punfta or foramina lachrymalia, themem- brana conjunctiva, the glandula lachrymalis, and the par¬ ticular ligaments which fuftain the tarfi. The tarfi and their ligaments are in fome meafure the bafis of all thefe parts-. The tarfi are thin cartilages forming the principal pars of the edge of each palpebra; and they are broader at the middle than at the extremities. Thofe of the fupe¬ rior palpebrse are fomethir.g lefts than half an inch in breadth; but in the lower palpebrse they are not above the fixth part of an inch ; and their extremities next the temples are more fiender than thofe next the nofe. Thefe cartilages are fuited to the borders and curva¬ ture of the eye-lids, The lower edge, of the fiiperior cartilage and upper edge of the inferior, terminate e- qually, and both may be termed the ciliary edges. The eppofite edge of the upper tarfus is fomething femi-cir- cular between its two extremities; but that, of the infe¬ rior tarfus is more uniform, and both are thinner than the ciliary edges."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"2 9 2 A N A T The broad ligaments-of the. tat fi are membranous e* IorgatioHs formed by the union of the periofteum of the brbits' and pericranium along bath edges of each orbit. The fuperior ligament is broader than the inferior, and fixed to the fupeiior edge of the upper cartilage, as the inferior is to the lower edge of the lower cartilage, fo that thefe ligaments and the tarfi, taken alone or without the other parts, reprefent palpebrse. The membrana cortjundriva is a thin membrane, one portion of which lines the inner furface of the palpebrs. •At the edge of the orbit it has a fold, and is continued from hence on the anterior half of the globe of the eye, adhering to the tunica-albuginea; fo that the pajpebice and the forepart of the globe of the eye are covered by one and the fame membrane, which does nor appear to be a continuation ofthe pericranium, but has fome connec¬ tion with the broad ligaments of the tarfi. The name of conjunctiva is commonly given only to that part which covers the globe, the other being called fimply the internal membrane of the palpebrse; bnt we may very Well name the one membrana oculi conjunc¬ tiva, and the other membrana palpebrarum conjunctiva. That of the palpebrae is a very fine membrane adhering very clofe, and full of fmail capillary blood-veffcls. It is perforated by .numerous imperceptible pores, through which a kind of ferum is continually difcharged. The conjunctiva of the eye adheres by the interven¬ tion of a cellular fubftance, and is confequently loofe, and as it were moveable; and it may be taken hold of and feparated in feveral places from the tendinous coat. It is of a whitifh colour; and being tranfparent, the albu¬ ginea makes it appear perfectly white : Thefe two coats together forming what is called the white of the eye. The lachrymal gland is white, and of the number of thofe called conglomerate glands. It lies under that de- preflion obfervable in the arch of the orbit near the tem¬ ples, and laterally above the globe of the eye. It is a 3 ' t rie flatted, and divided as it were into two lobes, one of which lies toward the infertiori of the mufculus reCtus fuperior, the other toward the reCtus externus. It ad¬ heres very clofely to the fat which furrounds the mufcles- and pofterior convexity of the eye, and it was formerly named glandula innominata. \" From this gland feveral fmail duCls go out, which run down almoft parallel to each other, through the fub¬ ftance of the tunica interna or conjunctiva of the fuperior palpebra, and afterwards pierce it inwardly near the fu¬ perior edge of the tarfus. The flat edge of each palpebra is adorned with a row of hairs called cilia, or the eye-lajhes. Thofe belong¬ ing to the fuperior palpebra are bent upward, and longer than thofe of the lower palpebra which are bent down¬ ward. Thefe rows are placed next thefkin, and.are not fi-egk, but irregularly double or triple. The hairs are er r the middle'of the palpebrae than toward the nd for about a quarter of an inch from the • _they are quite wanting. <- i v ; the u * border of the palpebrae, near the inter- m! - ^ \\ rr toward the eye, we fee a row of fmail *. . w v.ned foramina or panda ciliaruu O M Y. ‘ Part VI. They are the orifices of the fame number of fmail obr long glands which lie in the fulci, channels, or .grooves cm the inner furface of the tarfus. Thefe little gland? are of a whitifh colour ; and when fqueezed, a feba- ceous matter like foft wax, is difcharged through the punCla ciliarra. Near the great or internal angle of the palpebrse, the flat portion of their edges terminates in another which is rounder and thinner. By the union of thefe two edges an angle is formed. ... ... At this place, the extremity of the flat portion is df- ftinguifhed from the round portion by a fmail protube¬ rance or papilla, which is obliquely perforated by a fmail hole in the edge of each palpebra. Thefe two fmail holes are very vifible, and often more fo in living than in dead bodies, and they are commonly named punCia lachrymalia, being the orifices of two fmail dudls which open beyond the angle of the eye into a particular refer- •voir, termed facculus lachrymalis, which fhall be de- feribed in the article of the nofe. The pundla lachrymalia -are oppofite to each other, and fo they meet when .the eye is fhut. Round the orifice of each of thefe points, we obferve a whitifh circle which feems t6 be a cartilaginous appendix of the tarfus, and which keeps the orifice always open. The caruncula lachrymalis is a fmall reddifh, granu¬ lated, oblong body, fituated precifely between the inter¬ nal angle of the palpebrse and globe of the eye. The fubftance of it feems to be wholly glandular. We djf- cover upon it a great number of fine hairs covered by an oily, yellowifh matter; and on the globe of the eye, near this glandular body, we fee a femilunar fold, forrfin ed by the conjundtiva, the concave fide of which is turn ed to the uvea, and the convex fide to the nofe. The Muscles of the Palpebrae. The mufcles of the palpebrse are commonly reckon¬ ed to be two, one peculiar to the upper eye-lid, named levator palpebra fuperioris ; the other common to both, Called mufculus Orbicularis palpebrarum. The levator palpebrae fuperioris 'is a very thin mufcle, fituated in the orbit above, and along the redtus fuperior oculi. It is fixed to the bottom of the orbit, by a fmail narrow tendon, near the foramen opticum, between the pofterior infertions of the redfus fuperior and obliquus fuperior. From thence its flefhy fibres run forward on the redtus, increafing gradually in breadth, and termi¬ nate by a very broad aponeurofis in the tarfus of the fu¬ perior palpebra. By the mufculus palpebrarum obliquus we underftand all that extent of flefhy fibres, which by a thin ftratum furrounds the edge of each orbit, and from-thence, with¬ out any interruption, covers the two palpebrse all the way to the cilia. Almoft all of them have a common tendon fituated {ranfverfely between the internal angle of the eye and the nafai apophyfis of the os maxillare. This is a (lender Itgarnentary tendon, ftrongeft where it is fixed in the bone, and dimini/hing gradually as it ap¬ proaches the angle of the palpebrse, where it terminates"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Part VI. ANA' at the union of tits points, or at the extremities of the two tarfi. This mufcle is divided into four portions, whereof the fir ft is that which furrounds the orbit. The fecond portion is that which Ties between the upper edge of the orbit and the globe of the eye, and which covers the in¬ ferior edge of the orbit below, fome of its fibres being fixed to both edges of the orbit. The third portion feems to belong more particularly to the palpebra, and thegreateft part of it is fipent in tl»e palpebra fuperior. The fibres of this portion meet at the two angles of the eye, where they, appear to make very acute inflexions without any difcontinuation. The fourth portion is an appendix to tne third, from which it differs chiefly in this, that its fibres do not reach to the angles, and form only fmall arches, the ex¬ tremities of which terminate in each palpebra. All thefe different portions of the orbicular mufcle ad¬ here to the (kin, which-covers it from the upper part of the nofe to thd temples, and from the fupercilium to the upper part of the cheek. < When they contraX, feveral wrinkles are formed in the fkin, which vary according to the different direXions of the fibres. The Uses of the Eye, and of its Appendages, in general. Every body knows that, the eye is the organ of vi- fion. The tranfparent parts of the globe modify the rays of light, by different refraXions ; the retina and choroides receive the different impreffions of thefe rays; and the optic nerve carries thefe impreffions to the brain. When objeXs are at a great diftance or obfcure, the pu- pilla is dilated; and it is contraXed when objeXs are rear, or placed in a great light. The mufcles of the globe of the eye and of the palpebra perform the mo¬ tions already -defcribed. The glandula lachrymalis continually moiftensthe fore¬ part of the globe of the eye ; and the lachrymal ferum is equally fpread over that globe by the motions of the fu¬ perior palpebra, the inner furface of which is in .a fmall meafure villous.. The union of the -two .palpebra direXs this ferum towards the punXa lachrymalia ; and the unXu- ous matter, difcharged through the foramina ciliaria, hiqders it from running out between the palpebra. The large fize and vifcid furface -of the caruncula prevents it from running beyond the punXa, and thus forces it into them. The fupercilia may hinder fweat from falling on the eyes. The fuperior cilia, which are longer than the in¬ ferior, may have the fame ufe; and they both ferve to prevent dull, infeXs, isc. from entering the eyes when they are only a little open. Sect. VI. The Nose. The bones of the nofe have already been defcribed in the futures of the bones of the head, The foft parts are the integuments, mufcles, facculus lachrymalis, mar.brana pituitaria, and hairs of the nares. The internal nares, or the- two cavities of the Vol. I. No. 13. 3 r o m y. m n©fe, comprehend- the whole fpace bctwccrt the external nares and pofterior openings immediately - above the arch of the palate ; from whence thefe cavities reach up* ward as far as the lamina cribrofa of the os ethmoides, where they communicate forward with the finus fron- tales,. and backward with the finus fphenoidales. La¬ terally, thefe cavities are bounded on the infidg by the feptum narium,-and on the outfide, or.that next the cheeks, by the conch®, between which they communi cate with the fieus maxillarw. The particular fixation of thefe cavities deferves our attention. The bottom of them runs direXly backward, fo that a ftreight and pretty large ftilet may eafily be paffed from the external nares, under the gif.it apophy- fis of the occipital bone. The openings of the maxilla¬ ry' fmufes are nearly oppofite to the upper edge of the ofla raakrum. The openings of the frontal finufes are more or Jefs oppofite to, and between the pulleys or rings of the mufculi trochleares; and by thefe marks the fix¬ ation of all the other parts may be determined. The inferior portion of the external nofe is compofed of feveral cartilages, which are commonly five in num¬ ber, and of a pretty regular figure. Tie reft are only additional, fmalier, more irregular, and the number of them more uncertain. Of the five ordinary cartilages, one is fituated in the middle, the other four laterally. 7 he middle cartilage is the mod confiderable, and fup- ports the reft, being conneXed immediately to the bony parts; but the other four are conneXed to the middle car¬ tilage, and to each other, by means of ligaments. The fub-feptum, or portion under the feptum narium, is a pillar of fat applied to the inferior edge of the cartilagi¬ nous partition, in form of a foft moveable appendix. The thicknefs of the ala: narium, and efpecially that of their lower edges, is not owing to the cartilages, which are very thin, but to the fame kind of folid fat with which tbefe cartilages are covered. The great cartilage is im¬ moveable by reafon of its firm connexion to the bony parts of the nofe; but the lateral cartilages are move- able, becaufe-of their ligamentary connexions, and they are moved in different manners by the mufcles belonging to them. The external nofe is covered by the common integu¬ ments, the flrin, epidermis, and fat. Thofe which co¬ ver the tip of the nofe and alas narium are a great num¬ ber of glandular bodies, called glandula febacea, the contents of which may ealily be fqueezed out by the fingers. Six mufcles are commonly reckoned to belong to the nofe; two reXi, Called alfo pyramidales or triangulares; two obliqui, or laterales; and two tranfverfi, or tnyrti- formes. The nofe may alfo -be moved in -feme meafure by the mufcles of the lips, which in many cafes become affiftants to the proper mufcles of this organ. The mufculus pyramidalis, or anterior, on each fide, is inferted by one extremity in the fynarthrofis of the os fronds and ofla naft, where its flefliy fibres mix with thofe of the mufculi frontales and fuperciliares. It is very flat, and runs down on the fide of the nofe, increa- fing -gradually in breadth, and terminating by an apoaeu- rofis, which reprefeats the bafis of a pyramid) and-is in- 4 E ferted"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"294 A N A T f cited in tHe moveable cartilage which forms the ala of liie nares. '1 he oblique or lateral mufcle is a thin flefhy plane, lying on die fide of the former. The lateral mufcle is fixed by its upper extremity ;to tire apophyfis nafalis of the os maxillare, below its articulation with the os fron¬ ds,, and fometimes a little lower than the middle of the bluer edge-of the orbit. From tiience it runs toward the.ala narium, and is infer ted in the moveable cartilage, near the os maxillare, being covered laterally by a por¬ tion of the neighbouring mufcle of the upper lip. . The tranfverfe or inferior mufcle, called alfo myrti - formes, is inferred by one end in the os maxillare, near the lower edge of the orbi-c, much about the place which anfwers to the extremity of the.focket of the dens cani- nus on the fame fide. From thence it runs almoft-tranf- verfely upward, and is fixed in die lateral cartilages of the note, over which it fometimes runs to the aise of the great cartilage, to be inferted there, The fit ft two pairs of thefe mufcles raife and dilate the alas of the nares when they aft; and at the fame time raife die upper lip, by reafon of their conneftion with the mufcles of that part.

It is likewife continued down from the nares to the pharynx, feptum palati, isc. It is termed pituhnria, becaufe, through the greateft pant of its large extent, it ferves to feparate from the arterial blood a mucilaginous lympha, called pituha by the ancients, which in the natural ftate is pretty liquid ; but it is fubjeft to very great changes, becoming fome- times. glutinous or fnotty, fometimes limpid, 6e. nei¬ ther is it feparated in equal quantities through the whole membrane. When we carefully examine this membrane, it appears to be of a different ftrufture in different parts. Near the edge of the external nares it is very thin, appearing to be the fkin and epidermis in a degenerated ftate. All the other, parts of it in general are fpungy, and of diffe¬ rent thickneffes. The thickeft parts are thofe on the ieptum narium, on the whole lower portion of the. inters- r,al nares, and on die conchas. On tire fide next tlie periofteum and perichcndrium it is plentifully ftored with final! glands,, the excretory dufts of which are very lung near the feptum narium, and their orifices very vifible. The frontal, maxillary and fplienoidal fnufes open in¬ to the internal nares, but in different manners. The frontal finufes open from above downward, anfwering tp the in 'undibula of the os ethmoides. The fpheaoidales open forwards, oppofite to the poftertor orifices of the nares; and the maxillares open a little higher, between the two conchae. The opening of the finus maxillaris in fome fubjefts is Angle, in others double; it lies cxaftly between the two conphac, about the middle of their depth,. O M Y. Part VI, It is proper here to obferve the whole extent of the maxillary finus. Below, there is but a very thin par? tition between it and the dentes molares, the roots of which do, in fome fubjefts, perforate that feptum. A- bove, there is only a very thin tranfparent lamina be¬ tween the orbit and the finus. Backward, above the tu- berofity of the os maxillare, the fides of the finus arfe very thin, efpecially at the place which lies before die root of the apophyfis pterygoides, through which the in¬ ferior maxillary nerve fends down a ram,us to the fora¬ men palatinum pofterius, commonly called guflatoriuni. Inward, or toward the conchas narium, the bony part of the finus is likew ife very thin. The lachrymal facculus is an oblong membranous bag, into which the ferous fluid is difeharged from the eye through the punfta lachrymalia; and from which the fame fluid paffes to the lower part of the internal nares. It. is lituated in a bony groove and canal, formed partly by the apophyfis nafalis of the os maxillare and os unguis, partly by the fame os maxillare and lower part of the os unguis, and partly by this lower portion of the os unguis and a fmall fuperior portion of the concha narium in¬ ferior. This bony lachrymal duft runs down for a little way obliquely backward, toward the lower and lateral part of the internal nares on each fide, where its lower extremi¬ ty opens on one fide of the fiDUs maxillaris under the inferior concha. The upper part of this duft is only an half canal or groove; the lower is a complete canal, nar¬ rower than the former. The facculus lachrymalis may be divided into a fuperior or orbitary portion, and an inferior or nafal portion. The orbitary portion fills the whole bony groove, being fituated immediately behind the middle tendon of the mufculus orbicularis. The nafal portion lies in the bony canal of the nofe, being narrower and Ihorter than the former. The oibitary portion is difpofed at its upper extremi¬ ty, much in the manner of an inteftinum caecum, and at the lower extremity is continued with the portio na¬ falis. Towards the internal angle of the eye, behind the tendon of the orbicular mufcle, it is perforated by a fmall fliort canal formed by the union of the lachrymal dufts. The nafal portion having reached the lower part of the bony duft under the inferior concha, terminates in a fmall, flat, membranous bag, the bottom of which- is perforated by a round opening. The fubftance of this facculus is fomething fpongy or cellulous, and pretty thick, being ftrongly united by its convex fide to the periofteum of the bony canal. The duftus inciforii, or nafi>palatini of Steno, are two canals which go from die bottom of the internal na¬ res crofs the arch of the palate, and open behind the firft or largeft dentes inciforii.. Their two orifices may be difrinftly feen in the fkekton at the lower part of the nafal foffa:, on the anterior aad lateral; fides of the Crifta; maxillares; and we may likewife perceive their oblique paflage through the maxillary hopes, and laftly their in¬ ferior orifices in a fmall cavity or folia! a, called for or men palaiinum anterius., .

Anatomists commonly divide or diftinguifh the ear ■ into external and internal. Ey the external ear they mean all that lies without the external orifice of the me¬ atus auditorius in thq os temporis; and by the internal ear, all that lies within the cavities of that bone, and al¬ io the parts that bear any relation thereto. The greateft part of the external ear confifts of a large cartilage very artificially framed, which is the bafis of all the other parts of which this\" portion of the ear is made up. The internal ear confills chiefly of feveral ■ b ony pieces, partly formed in the fobftance of the ofia temporum, and efpccially in that portion of it called a- pophyftspetrofa, and partly feparated from, but centain- ed in a particular cavity of that bone. The external ear, taken altogether, refembles in fome degree the /hell of a muflel, with its broad end turned upward, the fmall end downward, the convex fide next the head, and the concave fide outward Two portions are diftinguifbed in the external ear taken all together; one large and folid, called in Latin pinna, which is the fuperior, and by much the greateft pavt; the ether imall and foft, called the Ube, which makes the lower part. The forefide is divided' into eminences and cavities. The eminences are four in number, called helix, anther lix, tragus , and antitragus. The helix is the large folded border or circumference of the great portion of the ear. The anthtlix is the large oblong eminence or rifing furlounded by the helix. The tragus is the fmall anterior protuberance below the anterior- extremity of the helix, which in an advanced age is covered with hairs. The antitragus is the pofterior tubercle below the infe¬ rior extremity of the anthelix. The cavities on the forefide are four in number; the hollow of the helix ; the depr^fhon at the fuperior extre¬ mity of the anthelix, called fojj'a navicular is-, the con¬ cha, or great double cavity that lies under the rifing term¬ ed anthelix, the upper bottom of which, is diftingui/hed from the lower by a continuation of the helix in form of a tranfverfe crifta ; and laftly, the meatus of the ex¬ ternal ear lituated at the lower part of the bottom of the concha. The backfide of the external ear /hews only one cbn- fiderable eminence, which is a portion of the convex fide of the concha, the other portion being hid \"by the adlie- fion. of the ear to the os temperis. Of- M Vi, '2 p 5 The other parts of the eitertial -ear, befides- the carti¬ lage, are ligaments, mufcles, integuments, febaceous and ceruminous glands, arteries, Veins and nerves. The cartilage of the outward ear is nearly of the fame extent and figure with the large folid.portion thereof, al¬ ready mentioned; but it is not of the fame thicknefs, being covered by integuments on both fides. la the lobe or foft lower portion of the ear, this cartilage is wanting. . The. external ear is fixed to the cranium, not only by the cartilaginous portion of the meatus auditorius, but alfo by ligaments, which are two ifi number, one anterior, the other pofterior. The anterior ligament is fixed by one extremity to the root of the apophyfis zygomatica of the os temporis, at the anterior and a little toward the fuperior part of the meatus c/Teiis, clofe to the cor¬ ner of the glenoid cavity; and by the other extremity, to the anterior and fuperior patt cf the caitilaginous me¬ atus. The poftericr ligament is fixed by one end to the root of the maftoid apophyfis, and by the other to the pofterior part of the convexity of the concha,, fo that it is oppofite to the anterior ligament. Of the mufclgs of the external car, fome go between the cartilages and the os temporis, others are confined to the cat tilages alone. Both kinds vary in different fub- jefts, and are fometimes fo very thin, as to Icok more like ligaments than mufcles. The mufcles of the firft kind are generally tines in number, one fuperior, cr.e pofterior, and ere anterior.. The fuperior mufcle is fix¬ ed in the convexity ef the folia navicularis, and of the fuperior portion of the concha; from Vhence it runs up to the fquametis portion of the pa temporis, expanding in a. radiated maimer, and is inferted principally in the ligamentary apOneUrofis, which covers the pofteiior por¬ tion of the temporal mufcle. The anterior mtifcle is fmall, more or iefs inverted, and like an appendix to the fuperior. It is fixed by one extremity above the root of the zygomatic apophyfis, and by the oilier, in the anterior part of the convexity of the concha. The pofterior mufcle is almoft tranfverfe, and of a confiderable bVeadth, being fixed by one end to the po- fterlor part of the convexity of the concha,, and by the other in the root of the maftoid apophyfis. The fmall mufcles which are confined to the cartilages are only fmall ftrata of fibres found on both fides of the cartilages. The lobe cf the ear, or that foft portion which lies under the tragus, agtitit.gus, and meatus auditorius, is made up of nothing but fkin and cellular fobftauce. T he rntatus auditorius is partly bony, and partly cartilaginous. The bony portion is the loagtft, and fai ms the bottom ef die canah The cartilaginous portion is the fherteft, and forms the external opening or orifice of the canal. Thefe two portion* jeiried end wife to each other, form a canal of about three quarters of an inch in length, ef different widenefs in its different parts, and a little ct r<- torted, It is lined on the infide by the fkin and cellular membrane,, through its whole length ; and thus thefe in¬ teguments malts up for the breaks in the cartilaginous portion*."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"29 6 A N A T portion, and form a kind of cutaneous tnbe in the other portion. The fltin which covers both fides of the cartilage con¬ tains a great number of fmall glands, which continually ■■ difcharge an oily whitifh humour, coileded chiefly near the .tuhefions of the ear to the head, and under the fold of the helix ; and thefe glands are of the febaceous kind. Tlie fkin which lines the meatus auditorius contains an¬ other kind of glands, of a yellowiffi colour, and which may be plainly ieen on the convex fide of the qutaneous tube already mentioned. Thefe glands are difpofed in fuch a manner as to leave reticular fpaces between them, and they penetrate a little . way into the fubftance of the fltia. They are called glan¬ dule ceruminofe, becaufe they difcharge that matter which is named cerumen, or the wax of the ear. The inner furface of the cutaneous tube is full of fine hairs, between which lie the orifices of the ceruminous glands. The firfl place in which we meet with thefe glands is on that part of the convex fide of the cutaneous tube which fupplies the breaks of the cartilaginous meatus. All the bony parts of the organ of hearing, dr bones of the internal ear, being contained in the inferior por¬ tions of die ofla temporum; it will be very proper to re¬ coiled what has been already faid about thefe, in Part I. All the bony organ of hearing may be divided into four general parts: t. The external meatus auditorius; 2. The tympanum or barrel of the ear; 3. The laby¬ rinth; 4. The internal meatus auditorius. It may like- wife be divided into immoveable or containing parts, which take in all the four already mentioned ; and move- able or contained parts, which are four little bones lod¬ ged in the tympanum, called incus, malleus, Jlapes, and os orbiculare or lenticulare. The external auditory paffiige begins by the external auditory hole, the edge of which is rough and prominent; but backwards towards the maftoid apophyfis it appears very much Hoped. The paflage itfelf is about half an inch in length, running obliquely from behind forward, in a curve direction, and fometirties winding a little in the middle, like a ferew. Its cavity is almoft oval, wider at the entry than at the middle, after which it widens again by degrees. It terminates inwardly by an even circular edge lying in a plane very much inclined, - the upper part of it being turned outward, and the lower part inward; fo that the whole canal is longer on the lower fide than on the upper. The concave fide of the circular edge is grooved quite round. In children this bony canal is wanting, as well as the maftoid apophyfis; and the inner circular edge is a di- f-ineb -ring, which in an advanced age unites intirely, and becomes one piece with the reft. It is termed the bony circle in infants, and indeed it is very eafily fepara- ted from afl the other parts. It would feem therefore, that the whole bony canal in adults is only a prolongation of the bony circle in chil¬ dren ; becaufe even in a more advanced age, the whole canal may, without much difficulty, be taken'out. The circular groove lies hetween the maftoid apophyfis and the articular fifiure er crack. O M, Y. Part VI. The tympanum or barrel of the ear is a cavity irre¬ gularly fgini-fpherical, the bottom of it being turned irv tvafd, and the mouth joined to the circular groove al¬ ready mentioned. Both eminences and cavities are ob- fervable in it. The remarkable eminences are three in number; a large tuberofity lying in the very bottom of the barrel, a little toward the back part; and a fmall irregular pyra¬ mid fituated above the tuberofity, and a little more back¬ ward; the apex of it is perforated by a fmall hole, and On one fide of the bafis two finall bony filaments are ofteh found in a parallel fituation. In the third eminence is a cavity fhaped like the mouth of a fpoon, fituated at the upper and a little towards the anterior part of the bot¬ tom of the tympanum. The principal cavities in the tympanum are, the open¬ ing of the maftoid cells or finuofities; the opening-of the Euftachian tube; the bony half-canal ; the feneftra ova- lis and rotunda; and to thefe may be added the fmall hole in the pyramid. The opening-in the maftoid cells is at the pofterior and tipper part of the edge of the barrel. The cells themfdves which end there are dug in the fubftance of the maftoid proeefs, being very irregular and full of wind¬ ings and turnings. The opening of the Euftachian tube is at the anterior a<nd a little toward the upper part of the edge of the bar¬ rel. This tube runs from the tympanum, towards the pofterior openings of the nafal foffic, and arch of the pa¬ late. The bony portion thereof is dug in the apophyfis petrofa, along the duft of the carotid apophyfis; and when it leaves that, it is lengthened out by the Ipinal a- pophyfis of the os fphenoides. The bony half-canal, of which the cavity refembling the mout.h of a fpoon is the extremity, lies immediately above the Euftachian tube, towards the upper fide of the apophyfis petrofa, or rather in the Very fubftance of that upper fide. The feneftra ovalis is a bole of communication between the tympanum and labyrinth. It lies immediately above the tuberofity, the upper fide of it being a little rounded, the lower a little flatted ; and one extremity being turn¬ ed forward, the other backward. The feneftra rotunda is fomething Jefs than the ovalis, and fituated in the'lower, and a little towards the pofte¬ rior part of the large •tuberofity ; the opening of it, which is the orifice of a particular dud in the labyrinth, lying obliquely backward and outward. The hole in the apex of the pyramid is the orifice ■ of a cavity, which may be named the ftnus of this py¬ ramid. The tympanum contains feveral little hones called the bones of the ear. They are generally four in number, denominated from fomething to which they are thought to bear a refembiance, viz. incus, malleus, ftapes, and os orbiculare or lenticulare The incus, or anvil, refembles, in fome meafure, one of the anterior grinders with its roots at a great diftance from each other; at leaft it comes nearer to this than to the ftiape of the anvil. It may be divided into a body and branches. The body is a large fubftance, the branches"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Part VI. A N A T branches or legs are two, one long and one fhott. The body is turned forward, the fhort leg backward, and the long leg downward. The body of the incus is broader than it is thick. It has two eminences, and two cavities between them, much in the fame manner as we fee in the crown of the firft grinders. The fhort leg is thick at its origin, and from thence decreafing gradually, it ends in a point. It is fituated ho¬ rizontally, its point being turned backward, and joined to the edge of the maftoid opening of the tympanum. The long leg, viewed through the external auditory paffage, appears to be fituated vertically ; but if we look upon it either on the fore or backfide, we fee it is incli¬ ned, the extremity of it being turned much more'inward, than the root or origin. The point of the extremity is a little flatted, and bent inward like a hook, and fome- times a little hollowed like a kind of ear-picker. The malleus or hammer is a long bone, with a large head, a fmall neck, an handle, and two apophyfes, one in the neck, the other in the handle. The top of the head is confiderably rounded, and from thence it contracts all the way to the neck. Both head and neck are in an inclined fituation, and the eminences and cavities in it anfwer to thofe in the body of the incus. The.handle is looked upon by fome as one of the a- pophyfes of the malleus; and in that cafe, it is rhe great- eft of the three. It forms an angle with the neck and head, near which it is fomething broad and flat, and de¬ crees gradually toward its extremity. The apophyfis of tbe handle, termed by others the fmall or fhort apophyfis of the malleus, terminates the angle already mentioned, being extended towards the neck, and lying in a ftraight line with that fide or border of the handle which is next it. The apophyfis of the neck, called alfo apophyfis gra¬ cilis, is in a natural ftate very lqng, but fo flender with¬ al, that it is very eafily broken, efpecially when dry; it arifes from the neck, and fometimes appears much long¬ er. than it really is, by the addition of a fmall dried ten¬ don flicking to it. ■ The ftapes is a fmall bone, very well denominated from the refcmblance it bears to a ftirrup. It is divided into the head, legs,, and bafis. The head is placed upon a fhort flatted, neck, the top of it being fometimes flat, fometimes a little hollow. The two legs taken together, form an arch, like that of a ftirrup, in the concave fide of which is a groove, which runs..through their whole length. One leg is long¬ er, more bent, and a little broader than the other. The bafis refembles that of a ftirrup, both.in its oval fliape, ’and union with the legs, except that it is not per¬ forated as the ftirrups now are, but folid, like thofe of the ancients. Round its circumference, next the legs, is a little border, which makes that fide of the-bafis appear a little hollow. The other fide is pretty fmooth, and one half of the circumference is fomething more curve than the other. The orbicular or lenticular bone is the fmalleft bone in the body. It lies between the head of the ftapes and ex- Von. I. Numb, 13. O M Y. 297' tremity of the long leg of the incus, being-articulated with each of thefe. In dry bones it is found very clofe- Iy connedfcd, fometimes to the ftapes, fometimes to the incus, and might in that ftate be eafily miftaken for an e- piphyfis of either of thefe bones. The labyrinth is divided into three parts, the anterior, middle, and pofterior. The middle portion is termed veJUbtilum\\ the anterior, cochlea ; and the pofterior, th? labyrinth in particular, which comprehends the three fg T micircular canals. The veftibulum is an irregularly round cavity, lefs than the tympanum, and fituated more inward and a lit¬ tle mere forward. T hefe two cavities are, in a manner, fet back to back, with a common partition-wall between them, perforated near the middle by the feneftra ovalis, by which the gavities communicate with one another. The cavity of the veftibulum is likewife perforated by feveral other holes ; on the outfide, or towards the tym¬ panum, by the feneftra rotunda ; on the backfide, by the live orifices of the femicircular canals; on the lower part of the forefide, by two holes, which are the entry of the cochlea; and on the fore-fide, towards the inter¬ nal meatus auditorius, oppofite to the feneftra ovalis, by a great many very fmall holes for the paflage of the nerves. The femicircular canals are three in number, one ver¬ tical and fuperior, one vertical and poftciior, and one ho¬ rizontal. The fuperior vertical canal is fituated tranf- verfely with refpeft to the apophjfis petrofa, the convex fide or curvature of it being turned upward, and the ex¬ tremities downward, one inward, the other outward. The pofterior vertical canal lies parallel to the length of the apophyfis, the curvature being turned backward, and the extremities forward, one upward, the other down? ward; and the fuperior extremity of this canal meets and lofes itfelf in the internal extremity of the former. The curvature and extremities of the horizontal canal are ai¬ med on a level; the curvature lying obliquely backward, and the extremities forward, ending under thofe of the fupetior vertical canal, but a little nearer each other ; and.the inner being almoft in the middle fpace, between the extremities of the pofterior vertical canal. The horizontal canal is generally the leaft of the three; the pofterior vertical is often, and the fuperior vertical fometimes,’ the greateft; all the three canals are larger than a femicircle, forming nearly three quadrants; they are broader at the orifices than in the middle. Thefe orifices open into the back-fid-e of the veftibulum, being but five in number, fo that in the pofterior patr of the veftibulum, two appear towards the infide, and three towards the outfide. The cochlea is a fort of fpiral fhell, with two dmfts, formed in the anterior part of the apoph) fis petrofa, in fome meafure reTembling the fliell of a fnail. The parts to be diftingnifhed in it, are the bafis, the apex, the fpiral lamina, or halffeptum, by which its cavity is divided in¬ to two half-canals ; the fpindle round which the cochlea turns;, and laftly, the orifices and union of the two duds. The bafis is turned diredlly inward, toward the inter¬ nal foramen auditorium, the apex outward, and the axis of the fpindle is nearly horizontal. 3' 4 F The"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"2 ( ?§ A N A T The bafis of the cochlea is gentler hollowed, and to¬ wards the middle perforated by feveral fmall holes. The fpindle is a kind of ftiort cone, with a very large bafis, which is the middle of the bafis of the cochlea. Thro’ its whole length runs a double fpiral groove, which, through a microfcope,' ftiews a great number of pores. The cochlea makes about two turns and an half from the bafis to the apex; and the two dudts, being ftridlly united together through their whole courfe, form an en¬ tire common feptum, which muft not be confounded with the half feptum or fpiral lamina, as is often done. The firft might be termed the common feptum, the other the particular feptum or half-feptum. Both of them are clofely joined to the fpindle, being thicker there than in any other place. The common feptum is complete, and feparates the turns entirely from each other; whereas the half-feptum in the Ikeleton is only a fpiral lamfha, the breadth of which is terminated all round by a very thin border lying in the middle cavity of the cochlea. In the natural ftate, there is a membra¬ nous half feptum, which completes the partition between the two dudts. The two half-canals turn jointly about the fpindle, one being fituated towards the bafis of the cochlea, the other towards the apex: for which reafon they have been termed the one internal, and the other external; the divifion of them into the upper and lower flight, not being agreeable to the natural (late, but liable to convey a very falfe idea thereof. The fpiral or volute of the cochlea, begins at the low¬ er part of the veftibulum, runs from thence forward to the top, then backward down to thp bottom, afterwards upwards and forwards, and fo on from the bafis which is turned inward, to the apex which is turned outward. The two half-canals communicate fully at the apex of the cochlea. Their feparate openings are towards the bafis, one of them being immediately into the lower part of the forefide of the veftibulum, the other into the fe- neftra rotunda. The internal auditory hole is in the backfide of the apophyfis' petrofa, in fbnre tneafure behind the veftibu- tum and bafis of the cochlea- It is a kind of blind hole, divided into two fofluke,. one large, the other fmall. The large one lies Joweft, and ferves for the portio mol¬ lis of the auditory nerve or feventh pair. The fmall one is uppermoft, and is the opening of a fmall dudt through which the portio dura of the fame nerve paffes. The inferior folfula is full of little holes, which, in the natural date, are filled with nervous filaments of the portro mollis, which go to the fpindle,. to the femicircu- lar canals, and to thole of the cochlea. It is this foflu- la which forms the lhallow cavity at the bafis of the fpia- dle of the cochlea. Thepaflage for the portio dura of the auditory nerve runs behind the tympanum, and its orifice is the ftylo- maftoii hole. It begins by the fmall foflula, and pierces from within, outwards, the upper part of the apophyfis petrofa,, making there anangle or curvature. From thence it is inclined backward, behind the fmall pyramid of the tympanum, and runs down to the llylo-mafloid hole. It communicates likewife,,by a fmall hole, with die finus O M Y. Part. VI, of the pyramid; and lower down, by another hole, with the barrel of the ear. The internal parts of the ear are chiefly the membrana tympani, the periofteum of the barrel, olficula auditus, labyrinth and all its cavities, the membrana maftoidsea interna, the mufcles of the oflicula, and the parts which complete the formation of the Euftachian tube. The Euftachian tube is a canal or da<51 which goes from the tympanum to the pofterior openings of the nares, or nafal foflse, and toward the arch of the palate. The bony portion of it lies through its whole length immediately above the filfure of the glenoid or articular cavity of the os temporis, and terminates at the meeting of the fpinal apophyfis of the os fphenoidale with the a- pophyfis petrofa of the os temporis. The other or mixed portion reaches in the fame direc¬ tion from this place to the internal ala of the apophyfis pterygoides, or to the pofterior and outer edge of the nares. It is properly divided into four parts, two fuperior, and two inferior. The two upper parts or quarters are bony; and of thefe the innermoft is formed by the fide of the apophy¬ fis petrofa, the outermoft by the fide of the apophyfis fpinalis of the os fphenoides, fo that the upper half of this portion of the tube is bony. Of the two inferior parts, the internal is cartilaginous, and the external mem¬ branous ; fo that the lower half of this portion of the tube is partly cartilaginous next the os fphenoidale, and part¬ ly membranous next the apophyfis petrofa. The Euftachian tube thus formed, is very narrow in the bony part next the ear. The other portion grows gradually wider, efpecially near the pofterior nares, where the inner cartilaginous fide terminates by a prominent edge, and the outer fide joins that of the neighbouring noftril. The cavity of the tube is lined by a membrane like that of the internal nares, of which it appears to be a continuation. The fituation of the two tubes is oblique, their pofte¬ rior extremities at the ears being at a greater diftance than. the anterior at the nares, and the convex fides' of the prominent edges are turned toward each other. The o- penings of the tubes are oval at this place, as is likewife their whole cavity, efpecially that of the mixed portion. The membrana tympani is a thin, tranfparent, flattifh. pellicle, the edge of which is round, and ftrongly fixed in the orbicular groove which divides the bony meatus of the external ear from the tympanum or barrel. This membrane is very much ftretched or very tenfe, and yet not perfectly flat: for on the fide next the meatus exter- nus it has a fmall hollownefs, which is pointed in the mid¬ dle ; and on the fide next the tympanum it is gently con¬ vex, and alfo pointed in the middle. This membrane is fituated obliquely, the upper part of its circumference being turned outward, and the low¬ er part inward, fui.tably to the direction of the bony groove already mentioned. It is made up of feveral very fine laminae, clofely united together. The external la¬ mina is in fome meafilre a produdHon of the fkin and cu- ticula of the external meatus,; the internal lamina is a continuation of the periofteum of the tympanum; and when the membrane lias been firft macerated in water, each."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Part; VI. ANA each ofthefe laminae maybe fubdivided into feveral others. The depreflion in the middle of the membrana tympa- ni is caufed by the adhelion of the little bone called mal¬ leus, the handle of which is clofely joined to the infide of the membrane from the upper part of the circumfe¬ rence all the way tt> the center to which the end of the handle is fixed. This handle feems to lie in a very fine membranous duplicature, by means of which it is tied to the membrana tympani, and which ferves it for a pe¬ riofteum. The periofteum of the tympanum or barrel of the ear produces that of the fmall bones; it is likewife continued over the two feneftrte, and enters the euftachian tube, where it is loft in the inner membrane of that dud. The cellulae maftoidaei are very irregular cavities in the fubftance of the maftoid apophyfis, which communicate with each other, and have a common opening towards the infide, and a little above the pofterior edge of the or¬ bicular groove. Thefe cells are lined by a fine membrane, which is partly a continuation of the periofteum of the tympanum, and partly feems to be of. a glandular ftruc- ture like a kind of the membrana pituitaria. The ma¬ ftoid opening is oppofite to the fmall opening of the’ Eu- ftachian tube, but a little higher. The ligaments of the ofiicula come next in order. The incus is tied by a ftrong fhort ligament, fixed in the point of the fhort leg, to the edge of the maftoid opening. Between the incus and malleus we find a fmall, thin car¬ tilage. The malleus is connected through the whole length of its handle to the infide of the membrana tym¬ pani. The malleus has three mufcles, one external, one an¬ terior, and one internal; and the ftapes has one. mufcle. The external or fuperior mufcle of the malleus, is a thin fafciculus of flefliy fibres lying along the upper part of the bony meatus auditorius, between the periofteum and the other integuments. The outer part of it is pretty broad, and it contrails by degrees as it advances towards the up¬ per part or break of the orbicular groove of the tympa¬ num, into which it enters by a fmall tendon, above the membrana tympani, and is inferted in the neck of the malleus, near the fmall eminence or fhort apophyfis of the handle. The anterior mufcle of the malleus, is flefhy, long, and thin. It runs along the outlide of the Euftachian lube, to which it adheres very clofely through its whole length. Its anterior extremity is fixed in that fide of the tube juft before the fphenoidal fpine; and the pofterior extremity ends in a long thin tendon, which runs in the articular or glenoid fiffure of the os temporis, through a fmall oblique notch ; in which, fiffure it enters the tympa¬ num, and is inferted in the long thin apophyfis of the malleus. It is partly accompanied by a. nerve, which forms what is called the chorda tympani. The internal mufcle of the malleus is very flefhy and diftindh It lies along the infide of the Euftachian tube, partly on the cartilaginous, and partly on the bony por¬ tion, being fixed by one extremity in the apophyfis pc- trofa. Afterwards it runs along the cavity of the bony half-canal of the tympanum, within which cavity it is in- vefted by a pprtion of a membranous or Jigamentary va- T O M Y. 299 gina, which being fixed to the edges of the half-canal, forms an infire tube therewith. At the extremity of this bony half-canal, where we obferve the cavity fhaped like the mouth of a fpoon, this mufcle ends in a tendon, which is bent round the tranf- verfe bony or ligamentary ridge in the laft-named cavity, as over a pulley, and is inferted in the neck of the mal¬ leus above the fmall apophyfis, advancing likewife .as far as the handle. The mufcle of the ftapes is fhort and thick, and lies concealed within the fmall bony pyramid at the bottom of the tympanum. The cavity which it fills, touches very nearly the bony canal of the portio dura of the au¬ ditory nerve; and it terminates in a fmall tendon which goes out of the cavity through the fmall hole in the apex of the pyramid. As it goes through the hole it turns forward, and is inferted in the neck of the ftapes on the fide of the longeft and moil crooked leg of that bone. The three parts of the labyrinth, that is, the vefti- bulum, femicircular canals, and cochlea, are lined by a fine periofteum, which is continued over all the fides of their cavities, and fhuts the two feaeftrae of the tym¬ panum. The periofteum of the two fides of the bony fpiral la¬ mina advances beyond the edge of that lamina, and forms a membranous duplicature, which extending to the oppo- Cte fide coropleats the fpiral feptum. This feptum feparates the two half-canals from the ba¬ lls to the apex- but there it leaves a fmall opening, by which the fmall extremities of the half-canals communi¬ cate with each other.. The large extremity of the exter¬ nal half-canal ends by an oblique turn in the feneftra'ro¬ tunda, which is fhut by a continuation of the periofteum of that canal. The large extremity of the other half¬ canal opens into the veftibulum; and thefe two extremi¬ ties are intirely feparated by a continuation of the pe¬ riofteum. The ear is the organ of which we can moft diftindlly un¬ fold the ftrudlure, and demonftrate the greateft number of parts, that is, of fmall machines of which it is made up. We know likewife in general, that it is the organ of hear¬ ing ; .but. when we endeavour to difeover the ufes of each of thefe parts, that is, how each contributes to the great defign of the whole, after having thoroughly examined them, we muft be obliged to own, that the greateft part of what the moft able philofophers have faid upon this fubjedt, is without any real foundation.

The."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"200 A N A T The LARYNX. The larynx forms the protuberance in the upper and anterior part of the neck, called commonly pomum Adami. It is chiefly made up of five cartilages, viz, Cartilagor thyroides, which is the anterior and largeft; cricoides, the inferior, and bafis of the reft; two arytenoides, the pofterior and fmalleft ; and the epiglottis, which is above nil the reft. Thefe cartilages are connected together by ligaments, and they have likewife mufcles, glands, mem¬ branes, See. belonging to them. The cartilago thyroidaea is large and broad, and folded in fuch a manner as to have a longitudinal convexity on the forefide, and two lateral portions, which may be termed alee. The upper part of its anterior middle portion is formed into an angular notch; the upper edge of each ala makes an arch; and, together with the middle notch, thefe two edges referable the upper part of an ace of hearts. The lower edge of each ala is more even, and the pofterior edges of both are veryfmooth, being lengthen¬ ed out both above and below by apophyfes, which are named the cornua of the thyroid cartilage. The cricoid cartilage refembles a thick, irregular ling, very broad on one fide, and narrow on the other; or it rtay be compared to a fmall portion of a thick tube, cut horizontally at one end, and very obliquely at the o- ther. It is diftinguilhed into a bafis and top, into an an¬ terior, pofterior, and two lateral fides. The bafis is al- moft horizontal, when we ftand; and to this the afpera arteria is connected ; fo that the cricoides may be looked upon as the upper extremity of the trachea. The pofterior portion of the cricoides is larger than the reft, and its pofterior or convex fide is divided by a longitudinal eminence or prominent line into diftinft fur- faces, for the infertion of mufcles. The top is gently Hoped above this prominent line, and teiminates on each fide by a kind of obtufe angle, formed between it and the oblique edge of each lateral portion of this cartilage. The whole pofterior fide is diftinguilhed into two la¬ teral portions by two prominent lines, each of which runs down almoft in a ftreight direction from the articu¬ lar furface at the top, a little below the middle of this fide, where it terminates in another articular line a little concave; and near thefe four articular furfaces there are fmall tubercles. The two fuperior furfaces are for the articulation of the cartilagines arytenoidsese; and the two inferior, for the articulation of the inferior cornua or appendices of the cartilago thyroides. The cartilagines arytenoidmse are two fmall, equal, fi- milar cartilages, which, joined together, referable the fpout of an ewer, and they are fituated on the top of the cricoides. In each, we may confiderthe bafis; cornua; two fides, one pofterior and concave, the other anterior and convex; and two edges, one internal, the other ex¬ ternal, which is very oblique. The bafes are broad and thick, and have each a concave articular furface, by which they are joined to the cricoides. The cornua are bent backward, and a little toward each other. O M Y. Part VI. . The epiglottis is ah elaftic cartilage, nearly of the fi¬ gure of a purflain leaf, narrow and thick at the lower part, thin and (lightly rounded at the upper part, gently convex on the forefide, and concave on the backfide. It is fituated above the anterior or convex portion of the cartilago thyroides; and its lower extremity is tied »by a Ihort. pretty broad, and very ftrong ligament, to the middle notch in.the upper edge of that cartilage. It is perforated by a great number of holes, fomething like thole in the leaves of the hypericum, or St John’s Wort, which are hid by the membranes that cover its two fides. The cartilago thyroides is connected to the cricoides by feveral Ihort ftrong ligaments, round the articulations of the two inferior cornua, with the lateral articular fur¬ faces of the cricoides. The apices of the fuperior cor¬ nua are fixed to the pofterior extremities of the great cornua of the os hyoides, by /lender, round ligaments, about a quarter of an inch in length. The thyroides is likewife connected to the os hyoides Sy a Ihort, broad, ftrong ligament, one end of which is inferted in the fuperior notch of the cartilage, and the other- in the lower edge of the bafis of the bone. It has alfo two ligaments at the middle of the concave fide, > which belong to the arytenoida:se. The cricoides is tied to the lower p^rt of the thyroides by a ftrong ligament; and by the ligaments already men¬ tioned, to the inferior cornua of that cartilage. Its ba¬ fis is fixed to the firft cartilaginous ring of ti?e trachea arteria, by a ligament exactly like thofe by which the o- ther rings are connefted together; and the membranous or pofterior portion of the trachea is likewife fixed to the pofterior part of the bafis of the cricoides. The cartilagines arytenoidsese are connefted to the cri¬ coides by ligaments, which furround their articulations with the top of that cartilage. Anteriorly the bafis of each arytenoides is fixed to one end of a ligamentary cord, which by its other end is inferted about the middle of the concave fide of the anterior portion of the thy¬ roides. At their infertions in the thyroides, thefe two ligaments touch each other, but a fmall (pace is left between them, where they are fixed in the two aryte¬ noides, and they feem likewife to have a fmall adhefioa to the top of the cricoides. This is what is called the glottis. Under thefe two ligamentary cords there are two o- thers, which run likewife from behind forward. The in- terftice between the fuperior and inferior cords on each fide form a tranfverfe fiflure, which is the opening of a fmall membranos bag, the bottom of which is turned outward, that is,toward,the ala of the thyroides. Thefe two facculi are chiefly formed by a continuation of the internal membrane of the larynx, and the inner furface of their bottom appears fometimes to be glandulous. On the anterior furface of the arytenoid cartilages, there is a fmall depreflion between th? bafis and the con¬ vex upper part. This depreflion is filled by a glandulous body, which not only covers the anterior furface of each arytenoides, but is likewife extended forward from the bafis over the pofterior extremity of the neighbouring li¬ gamentary cord."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Part VI, ANA The epiglottis has likewife .two lateralTigaments, by Which it ,is connected to the arytenoides, all the way .to their points or cornua. It has alfo a membranous liga¬ ment, which running along the middle of its anterior or concave (ide, ties it to the root or bafis of the tongue. This ligament is only a diiplicature of the membrane which covers the epiglottis, continued to the neighbour¬ ing parts. Laftly, there are two lateral membranous li¬ gaments belonging to it, .fixed near the glandulous bodies called amygdala. The epiglottis is *not only perforated by the regular holes already mentioned, but has likewife a great number of fmall irregular fciffures and breaks, which are fo ma¬ ny different lacuna: fituated between its two membranes, and filled with fmall glands, the excretory orifices of which are chiefly on the backfide of this cartilage. The laryiix gives infertion to a number of mufcles, which ihall now be deferibed. The fterno-thyroidsi are two long, flat, narrow, thin mufcles, like ribbons, broader above than below, and fi¬ tuated along that part of the neck which lies between the thyroid cartilage and the fternum. They are covered by the fterno-hyoidsei, and they cover the thyroid glands, palling immediately before'them. Each mufcle is fixed, by its lower extremity, partly in the fuperior portion of the inner or backfide of the fter¬ num, partly in the ligament and neighbouring portion of the clavicula, and partly in the cartilaginous portion of the firft rib. Sometimes it runs a great way down on the firft bone of the fternum, and croffes the mufcle on the other fide. From thence it runs up on the afpera arteria, clofe by its fellow, paffes before the thyroid glands, over the cricoid cartilage; and is inferted, by its upper extremity, in the lower part of the lateral fide of the thyroid cartilage, and partly along that whole fide. The thyro-hyoidaei, or hyo-thyroidaei are two flat, thin mufcles, lying clofe by each other, between and a- bove the former. Each of them is .inferted, by its upper extremity, partly in the bafis, and partly in the neigh¬ bouring part of the great cornua of the os hyoides; and by its lower extremity, in the lower part of the lateral fide of the thyroid cartilage, immediately above the fu¬ perior extremity of the fterno-thyroidaeus; and both this luperioy extremity of the laft named mufcle, and the lower extremity of the thyro-hyoidaeus, are, at their place of union, confounded a little with the thyro-pha- ryngaeus inferior. The crico-thyroidaei are two fmall mufcles, fituated obliquely at the lower part of the thyroid cartilage. They are inferted by their lower extremities in the ante¬ rior portion of the cricoid cartilage, near each other, and by their fuperior extremities, laterally in the lower , edge of the thyroid cartilage, .at a diftance from each odier. The two mufeuli crico-arytenoidaei pofteriores are fi¬ tuated pofteriorly at the large or back portion of the cri- coides, filling almoft the two longitudinal furfaces of that portion, and diftinguifhed by the prominent line between thefe two furfaces. Each of them runs up obliquely, and is inferted, by its ypper extremity, in tbepofterior part of the bafis of the arytenOid cartilage, of the fame fide, near the angle of that bafis. Vol. I. No. 13. ‘ T O M Y. 301 The two crico-arytenoidsei laterales are fmall,. and fi¬ tuated more laterally than the former. Each mufcle is fixed by one end to the fide of the broad part of the cri- coides, and by the other to the lower part of the fide of the neighbouring arytenoides. The two thyro-arytenoidaei are very bread, each mui- cle being fituated laterally between the thyroides and cri- coides. It is fixed by a broad infertion in the infide of the ala of the thyroid cartilage; and the fibres contrac¬ ting from thence, run from before backward, and from below upward, towards the neighbouring arytenoid car¬ tilage, in which they are inferted, from the glottis to the angle of the bafis. The arytenoidaei are fmall mufcles lying on the pofte- rior concave fides of the arytenoid cartilages, of which two are called crucial arytenoidai, and one tranfverfe. The crucial mufcles run each obliquely from the bafis of one arytenoid cartilage, to the middle and upper part of the other, the left mufcle covering the right. The arytenoidaeus tranfverfalis is inferted more or lefs direCtly, by both extremities, in the two arytenoid car¬ tilages. The two thyro-epiglottici crofs the thyro-arytenoida??, being inferted in the inner lateral part of the thyroides, and laterally in the epiglottis. The aryteno-epiglottici are fmall flefhy fafciculi, each of which is fixed by one extremity in the head of one of the arytenoid cartilages, and by the other in the near- eft edge of the epiglottis. The larynx ferves particularly to admit and let out the matter of refpiration ; and the folidity of the pieces of which it is compofed hinders not only external objcCts, but alfo any hard thing which we fwallow, from difor- dering this paffage. The glottis, being a narrow flit, mo¬ difies the air which we breathe; and as it is very eafily dilated and contracted, it forms the different tones of the voice, chiefly by means of the different mufcles in¬ ferted in the cartilagines arytenoidaese, to which the o- ther mufcles of the larynx are afliftants. The whole larynx is likewife of ufe in deglutition, by means of its connection with the os hyoides, to which the digaftric mufcles of the lower jaw adhere; which irufcles raife the larynx together with the os hyoides e- >ery time we fwallow. The facility of varying and changing the tone of the voice, depends on the flexibility of the cartilages of the larynx, and decreafes in proportion as we advance in age, becaufe thefe carriages gradually harden and oflify. The mufeuli fterno-thyroidaei ferve in general to pull down the thyroid cartilage, and the whole larynx along with it. The thyro-hyoidaei may, as occafion requires, either draw up the larynx toward the os hyoides, or draw that bone downward toward the cartilago thyroides. It is difficult to determine the tile of the crico-thyroi- dsei from their fituation,_ They may either pull the cri- coides obliquely backward, or the thyroides obliquely forward. Both the lateral and poflerior crico-arytenoidje : , may feparate the arytenoid cartilages, and thereby open or di¬ late the glottis. The thyro-arytenoidaei aCting together, draw both the 3 4 G arytenoid"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"ANATOMY. Part VI. arytenoid cartilages forward, and confequently loofen the glottis, and render it capable of the fmallefl cuaver- ings of the voice. The arytenoidxi bring the arytenoid cartilages clofe together, and prefs them againfl each other ; and when the cartilages are in this fituation, they may at the fame time be inclined cither forward by the thyro-arytenoidxi, or backward by the crico-arytenoidxi pofteriores'. By this means the glottis, when /hut, may be either relaxed or tenfe ; and in this laft cafe it is intirely fhut, as when we hold in oar breath in draining. The general ufe of the epiglottis is to cover the glottis like a pcnt-houle, and thereby hinder any thing from' falling into it when we eat or drink; it ferves likcwife to hinder the air which we infpire from rufhing dirt « 5 lly upon the glottis, but by fplitting it, as it were, obliges it to enter by the fides, or in an oblique courfe. The mufcles of the epiglottis do not appear to be abfolutely ncceifary for that cartilage; for in deglutition, it may be fufficiently deprefTed by the bafis of the tongue ; and it may raife itfelf again by its own elafticity. The thyro- epiglottici and aryteno-epiglottici may ferve to (hut any lateral openings that might remain when the epiglottis is deprefTed by the bafis of the tongue; and the hyo-epi- glottici may pull it a little forward in ftrong refpirations, as-in fighing, yawning, The PHARYNX. The pharynx is a mufcular and glandular bag, the out¬ er furface of which is clofely joined to the inner furface of all that fpace which is at the bottom of the mouth, behind the pofterior nares, uvula, and larynx, and which reaches from the great or anterior apophyfis of the os occipitis all the way to the cefophagus, which is the con¬ tinuation of the pharynx. Though almoft all the mufcular or flefhy portions of which the pharynx is compofed, concur in the formation of one continued bag or receptacle, they are neverthelefs very diflinguifhable from each other, not only by their different infertions, from which they have been denomi¬ nated, but alfo by the different directions of their fibres. The greateft part of them may be looked upon as diga- ftric mufcles, the middle tendons of which lie backward in one longitudinal line, which in fome fubjedts appears plainly like a linea alba. The cephalo-pharyngxi are inferted in the lower fide Csf the apophyfis bafiliaris, or great apophyfis of the os occipitis, about the middle of the pofterior part. From thence they foparate laterally, and fometimes join the fly- lo-pharyngxi. The linea alba of the pharynx begins by the middle adhefion of thefe mufcles. The petro-pharyngxi' are inferted in the lower part of the extremity of the apophyfis petrofa; the fpheno-pha- ryngaei, partly in the os fphenoides, diredlly abave the internal’ala of the apophyfis pterygoides, and partly in the neighbouring cartilaginous portion.of the Etiflachian tube ; and the pterygo-pharyngxi, in the edge of the fame ala of the apophyfis pterygoides. Thefe three muf- «les on. each fide run obliquely backward, covering each other by fome fibres, and meet at the linea alba. Their life may be to draw the middle portion or great cavity of the pharynx upward. The ftylo-pharyngaei are inferted interiorly by one ex¬ tremity in the apophyfis, or epiphyfis ftyloides. From’ thence each mufcle runs down obliquely along the lateral part of the pharynx, covering and croffing the Other mufcles. It extends gradually in breadth as it defeendsy and forms two principal portions, one fuperior which is; narrow, and one inferior which is broad. The narrow portion is fpread among the mufcnlaT fibres above the thyroid cartilage, and the broad portion is inferted in the- fide of that cartilage; and thus the ftylo-pharyngxus i» partly a true ftylo-thyroidaeus. Thefe mufcles may draw the pharynx laterally upward, efpecially by their thy¬ roid portions. The peryffaphylo-pharyngsei are two fmall mufcles in¬ ferted between the uvula and lower extremity of the in¬ ternal ala of the apophyfis pterygoides, and run oblique¬ ly backward on the fides of the pharynx. The gloffo- pharyngxi are fibres Which run along the lateral edges of the tongue, from which they are patted backward, and run down on the fides of the pharynx under the llylo- pharyngxi. The hyo-pharyngxi in general are thofe on each fide which are inferted in the os hyoides ; and they may be reckoned three pairs, the bafio-pharyngxi, kerato-pha- 1 ryngxi minores, and kerato-ph’aryngxi majores; thefe : denominations being taken from their infertions in the bafis, and in the fmall and great cornua of the oS hy- oides. The mylo-pharyngxi is a mufcular portion diftindt from the genio-gloflus, inferted in the fide of the pharynx. T he fyndefmo^pharyngxi are fafciculi of mufcular fi¬ bres very diftindtly inferted by one’end along the liga¬ ments by which the fuperior cornua of the cartilage thy- roides are connected to the extremities of the great cor¬ nua of the os hyoides. From thence they run back¬ ward and meet at the linea alba. The thyro-pharyngxi are very broad, and each mufcle is inferted along the outfide of the ala of the cartilago thyroides, between the edge of that cartilage and the oblique line in which the thyro-hyoidxi are fixed From- thence they run up obliquely backward, and meet under the linea alba. The crico-pharyngxi are inferted each in the lower part of the fide of the cricoid cartilage. They feem to be appendices of the thyro-pharyngxi, /hewing no other marks of diflindtion but thefe infertions, and a fmall dif¬ ference in direction, becaufe as they run backward they defeend a little. The loweft of thefe mufcular fibres make a complete circle backward, between the two fides of the bafis of the cartilago cricoides. This circle is the beginning, of the cefophagus, and has been thought by fome to form a diftindt mufcle, called xfophagxus. The particular ufes of all thefe mufcles are very diffi¬ cult to be determined. It is cerra-in that thofe of the- middle and lower portions of the pharynx ferve chiefly for deglutition.

The palate is that arch or cavity of the mouth, fur- rounded anteriorly by the. alveolary edge and teeth of the upper jaw, and reaching from thence to the great opening- of the' pharynx. This arch is partly folid and immove¬ able, and partly fofr and moveable. The folid portion is that which is bounded by the teeth, being formed by: the*two ofla maxillaria, and two offa palati. The foft portion lies behind the other, and runs backward like a. veil fixed to the edge of the offa palati, being formed partly by the common membrane of the whole arch, and partly by feveral mufcular fafciculi, 6 c. The membrane that cove rs all this cavity is like that which lines the fuperior and middle portions of the pha¬ rynx. It is very thick, fet with fmall glands, the orifices of which are not fo fenfible as in the pharynx, and efpe- cially- in the rugas of the fuperior portion thereof. This membrane, together with that of the pofterior nares, forms, by an uninterrupted continuation, the an¬ terior and pofterior fur face of the foft portion, or feptumr palati; fo that the mufcular fafciculi of this portion lie in the duplicature of a glandulous membrane. The feptftm, which may likewife be termed velum, or valvula palati , terminates below by a loofe floating edge, reprefenting an arch fituated tranfverfely above the bafis. or root of the tongue. The higlieft portion or top of this arch fuftains a fmall, foft, and irregularly conical glandulous body, fixed by its bafis to the arch, and its apex hanging down without adhering to any thing, which is called uvula. On each fide of the uvula, there are two mufcular half arches,- called calumna' fipti palati. They are all join¬ ed to the uvula by their upper extremities, and difpofed ih fuch a manner, : as' that the lower extremities of the two which lie on the fame fide are at a little diftance from each other, and fo as that one half-arch is anterior, the other pofterior, an oblong triangular fpace being left between them, the apex of which is turned toward the bafis of the uvula. ’ The two half arches on one fide, by joining the like half arches on the other fide, form the entire arch of the edge of the feptum. The pofterior half arches run, by their upper extremities, more dire&ly toward the uvula than the anterior. The anterior half arches have a con¬ tinuation with the fides of the bafis of the tongue, and. the pofterior with the fides of the pharynx. At the lower part of the fpace left between the lateral half arches on-the fame fide, two glands ate fituated, termed. amygdala. The hilf arches are chiefly- made up of feveral flat flefhy portions, almoft in the fame manner with the body of the feptum. The membrane which covers them is; thinner than the other ports of it towards the palate, pha¬ rynx, and tongue. Each portion is a diftinft mufcle, the greateft part of which terminate by one extremity in the fubftance of the feptum and of the half arches, and by the other extremity in parts different from thefe. As anatomifts ufed formerly to afcribe all thefe muf¬ cles, as far as they knew them, to the uvula, without T O Ivl Y. 303 any regard to the feptum, they termed them in general either piery-Jlaphylini, or peri-Jlaphylini. The gloffo-ftaphylini are two fmall mufcles, fixed each in the lower and lateral part of the bafis of the tongue; from whence they run up obliquely backward along, the anterior half arches of the feptum palati, and terminate infenfibly on each fide near the uvula, fome of their fibres being fpread through the feptum. The pharyngo-ftaphylini are likewife two fmall muf¬ cles, each of them being fixed by one extremity to the lateral part of the mufeuli thyro-pbaryngaei, as if they were portions detached from thefe mufcles. From thence they run up obliquely forward along the two po^ fterior half arches of the feptum, and terminate in the feptum above the uvula, where they meet together, and feem to form an entire arch by the union of their fibres. The thyro-ftaphylini are two fmall mufcles, which ac¬ company the pharyngo-ftaphylini very clofely, through their whole courfe, except that their pofterior extremi¬ ties-are fixed in the thyroid cartilages near the'other mufcles. They are inferted in the feptum in the fame manner with the former. The fpheno-falpingo-ftaphylini are each fixed by one Extremity, partly to the fphenoidal fide of the bony por¬ tion of the Euftachian tube, partly to the neareft foft portion of the fame tube. From thence it runs toward rhe external ala of the apophyfis pterygoides, into which one portion of this mufcle is inferted. The other por¬ tion runs to the end of the ala, and turns round to the forked extremity thereof, as over a pulley, and is after¬ wards inferted in the feptum palati,: near the uvula. The pterygo-ftaphylinus fuperior is fo named becauf® k has a fmall infertion hi the upper part of the apophyfis pterygoides, befides that i-n the fphenoidal part of the bony portion of the tubs. The pterygo-ftaphylinus infe¬ rior on each fide, is a fmall mufcle, inferted by one ex¬ tremity .in the uncus pterygoidams, and by the other in- • the feptum near the uvula. The petro-falpingo-ftaphylini, or falpingo ftaphylini in-, temi, are thofe which are commonly called ptri-fiapJ:ylini; intern‘t. Each mufcle is fixed by one extremity, partly to the inner fide of the bony portion of the Euftachian tube, or that next the apophyfis petrofa, partly along the cartilaginous portion of the fame tube. From thenccr it pafles a little way under the foft membranous part, and) then, turning toward the feptum, is fixed in the edge, and partly in the upper fide thereof. The ftaphylini, or epiftjplrylini, are two fmall flefny. ropes, clofely united together, as if they made but one: mufcle. They are fixed by one extremity in the common’ point of the pofterior edges of the ofla palati, and from thence run downward and backward along the middle of the feptum, and likewife along the middle of almoft the whole uvula. Thefe, mufcles have been termed azygos Morgagnii, from the difeoverer, but he confidered them a9 One mufcle. The pterygo-ftaphylini inferiores are of the fame kind, and might be termed Jiaphylini, or epi- Jlaphylini laterales , and thefelaft, tuedii. The feptum palati ferves to conduct the lachrymal lympha, and that which is continually collected on the- aich of the palate, into the pharynx. It ferves for a valve."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"A N A T valve to binder what we fwnllowj and efpecially what we drink, from returning by the nares. The ufes of the different mufcles of the feptnm are not as yet fufficiently known, nor the different motions of which it is capable. The TONGUE. The tongue is divided into the balls and point; the ripper and under fides ; and the lateral portions or edges. The balls is the pofterior and thickeft part; the point, the anterior and thinneft part. The upper fide is not quite flat, but a little convex, and divided into two late¬ ral halves, by a (hallow depreffed line, called linea lin¬ gua mediana. The edges are thinner than the other parts, and a little rounded as well as the point. The lower fide reaches only from the middle of the length of the tongue to the point. The tongue is principally compofed of very foft flelhy fibres, intermixed with a particular medullary fubftance, and difpofed in various manners. Many of thefe fibres are confined to the tongue without going any farther, the red form feparate mufcles which go out from it in differ¬ ent ways, and are inferted in other parts. All the upper fide of the tongue is covered by a thick membrane of a papillary texture, upon which lies another very fine membrane like a kind of epidermis, which is likewife continued over the lower fide, but without papillae. Three forts of papills may be diftinguilhed in the up¬ per fide of the tongue, capitatse, ferai-lenticulares, and villofae, Thofe of the firlt kind are the larged, refem- bling little mufhrooms with Ihcrt items, or buttons with¬ out a neck. They lie on the balls of die tongue in fmall fuperficial foffulas. They refemble fmall conglomerate glands feated on a very narrow bafis, and each of them has fometimes a fmall depreflion in the middle of their upper or convex fide. They occupy the whole furface of the bafis of die tongue. They are glandular papillae, or fmall falival or mucilaginous glands. We oftentimes obferve, about the middle of this part of the tongue, a particular hole of different depths, the inner furface of which is entirely glandular, and filled with fmall papillae, like thofe of the fird kind. It is called foramen cacurn Morgagnii, as being fird deferi- bed by that anthor. Since that time M. Vaterus has difeovered a kind of falival duds belonging to it; and M. Heifter found two of thefe duds very diftindtly, the orifices of which were in the bottom of the foramen cae¬ cum near each other. He obferved the duds to run backward, divaricating a little from each other, and that one of them terminated in a fmall oblong veficle fituated on the fide of the fmall cornu of the os hyoides. The papillae of the fecond kind, or lemi-lenticulares, are fmall orbicular eminences, only a little convex, their circular edge not being feparate from the furface of the tongue. When we examine them in a found tongue, with a good microfcope, we find their convex fides full of fmall holes or pores, like the end of a thimble. They lie chiefly in the middle and anterior portions of the tongue, and are fometimes moll vifible ou the edges, O M ■ Y. Part VI. where they appear to be very fmooth and polilhed, even to the naked eye, * - r The papillae of the third kind, or villofae, sire the fmalleft and mod numerous. They fill the whole furface of the upper fide of the tongue, and even the interftices, between the other papillae. The flelhy fibres of which the tongue is compofed, and which go no further than the tongue, may be termed mufeuli lingua interiorei\\ and they are the fame which Spigelius named mufeuli linguales. The fibres thefe mufcles confift of are of three general kinds, longitudi¬ nal, tranfverfe, and vertical; and each of thefe fituatious admits of different degrees of obliquity. The longitu¬ dinal fibres point to the bafis and apex of the tongue, and feem partly to be expanfions of the mufeuli ftylo-glofli, hyo-glofli, and genio-glolli; of which hereafter. The vertical fibres feem likewife to be in part produced by the fame genio-glofli, and the tranfverfe by the mylo-glolfi. The mufeuli exteriores are four in number, and make a part of the body of the tongue. The mylo-glolE are fmall flelhy planes, fituated tranf- verfely, one on each fide, between the ramus of the lower jaw, and the bafis of the tongue. Their infertion in the jaw is immediately above the pofteiiorhalf of the mylo-hy- oidaeus, between the prominent oblique line on the infide of the bone, and the dentes molares. From thence they run toward the bafis of the tongue, and are loft there on one fide of the gloffo-pharyngxi. The ftylo-glofli are two long fmall mufcles which run down from the ftyloid apophyfes, or epiphyfes, and form two portions of the lateral parts of the tongue. Each mufcle is fixed in the outfide of the apophyfis ftyloides by a long tendon. The ftylo-hyoidaeus is the lowed, and the ftylo-pharyngaeus is in the middle, but more backward. As it runs down almoft oppofite to the infide of the angle of the lower jaw, it fends off a pretty broad and fliort lateral aponeurotic ligament, which being fixed in that angle ferves for a frsenum, or ligamentum fufpen- forium, to the mufcle in this part of its courfe. From thence it paffes on to the fide of the bafis of the tongue, where it firft of all adheres clofely to the lateral portion of the hyo-gloffus, and then forms, together with that mufcle, a large portion of the fide of the tongue. The hyo-glofli are each inferted in three parts of the os hyoides that lie near each other, in the bafis, in the root of the great cornu, and in the fymphyfis between ■ thefe two ; and on this account the hyo-gloffus has been divided by fome into two or three diftind mufcles, called bajio-glojfus, cerato-glojfus, and chondro-gfojfus. It is fituated on the infide, and a little lower than the ftylo-gloffus, with which it forms the lateral part of the tongue. The portion inlerted in the bafis of the os hy¬ oides lies more anteriorly, and is larger than the other two ; that which is inferted in the fymphyfis is the leaft, and that inferted in the great cornu the molt pofterior. This mufcle is partly fuftained by the mylo-hyoidseus, as by a girth; and the anterior portion is diftinguilhed frqm the reft by the paffage of the nerves of the fifth pair, and of the arteries which accompany them. The genio-glolli are fituated clofe to each other on the lower"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Fart VI. A N A T Tome of them lie very dear the Ikin, and the - reft at a greater diftance from it. As thefe lymphatic glands differ more in fituation than in fize or figure, they are commonly enumerated and de¬ nominated from the places where they lie; <r. g. Glandulae parotides lymphatics, Glandulas maxillares lymphatics, Glanduls jugulares, 6 c. The lymphatic veffels were difcovered more than an hundred years , ago. But their nature and origin were not underftood till Dr Alexander Monro, prefent Pro- feffor of Anatofriy in the Univerfity of Edinburgh, pu¬ blished his treatife, De Venis Lymphnticis Valvulojis , in the year 1757. In this treatjfe the. Doftor has pioved, by many accurate experiments. That the lymphatic vefl'els are a fyftem of abforbents: That they are not continua¬ tions of the arteries or veins; but that they are a diftinft fyftem of veffels, deftined for abforhing a pellucid liquor called lymph , from the different cavities of the body, 6c. and for tranfmitting it to the blood, by the contraction O- M V. 309 of their coats, and the preffure of the neighbouring parts. . Befides thefe veffels which accompany the glands, there are others of the fame ftruCture found on the fere- ral vifcera, where no lymphatic glands have hitherto been difcovered. We meet with them in very great numbers in the external membrane of the liver, and in the dupli- cature of the fuperior membranous ligament of this vifcus. Another fort of veffels termed lymphatics , are the fmall arteries and veins, which, in the natural ftate, tranfmit only the ferous part of the blood. Thefe vef¬ fels differ from the abforbent lymphatics in the fmallnefs of their diameter, and in their ftrudlure and fituation. All thefe little arteries and veins are uniform, extremely narrow, and though their Tides are not thinner than tbofe of the valvular lymphatics, yet their diameters are gene¬ rally lefs. The other lymphatics are full of valves, and very thin, but they are not narrow in proportion. The arterial and venal lymphatics are found on the parts which are naturally white, as on the Ikin, the white of the eye, 6c. EXPLANATION of PLATE XXI. Figure i.

A N Annuity is a fum of money, payable yearly, half- yearly, ot quarterly, to continue a certain number of years, for ever, or for life. An annuity is faid to be in arrear, when it continues unpaid after it falls due. And an annuity is faid to be in reverfion, when the purchafer, upon paying the price, does not immediately enter upon poffeffion; the annuity not commencing till fame time after. Interefl on annuities may be computed either in the way of fimple or compound interefl. But compound interefl:, being found moft equitable* both for buyer and feller, the computation by fimple interefl is univerfally difufed. I. Annuities for a certain Time. Problem i. Annuity, rate, and time, given, to find the amount, or fum of yearly payments, and interefl. Rule. Make i the firft term of a geometrical feries, and the amount of 11. for a year the common ratio; continue this feries to as many terms as there are years in the queftion; and the fum of this feries is the amount of 11. annuity for the given years; which, multiplied by the given annuity, will produce the amount fought. Example. An annuity of 40 1 . payable yearly, is forborn and unpaid till the end of 5 years: What will then be due, reckoning compound interefl at 5 per cent. on all the payments then in arrear ? *23 4 5 1 : i.oj : 1.1025 : 1.157625 : 1.21550625; whole fum is 5,525631251.; and 5.52563125 X 40 = 221.02525 = 2211. os. 6d. the amount fought. The amount may alfo be found thus: Multiply the gi¬ ven annuity by the amount of 11. for a year; to the produA add the given annuity, and the fum is the amount in 2 years ; which multiply by the amount of 1 h for a year; to the product add the given annuity, and the fum is the amount in 3 years, <bc. The former queftion wrought in this manner follows. 40 am. in 1 year. 126.1 ant. in 3 years. 1.05 1.05 42.00 132.405 40 40 . 82 am. in 2 years, 172.405 am. in 4years. 1,05 1.05 86.10 40 181.02525 40 126 1 am. in 3 years. 221.02525 am. in 5 years. If the given time be years and quarters, find the a- mount fqr the whole years, as above ; then find the a- mount of 11. for the given quarters ; by which multiply the amount for the whole years 5 and to the produsft add fuch a part of the annuity as the given quarters are of a year. If the given annuity be payable half-yearly, or quar¬ terly, find the amount of 11. for half a year or a quar¬ ter; by which find the amount for the feveral half-years or quarters, in the fame manner as the amount for the feveral years is found above. Prob. 2. Annuity, rate, and time given, to find the prefent worth, or fum of money that will purchafe the annuity. Rule. Find the amount of the given annuity by the former problem; and then, by compound interefl, find the prefent worth of this amount, as a fum due at the end of the given time. Examp. What is the prefent worth of an annuity of 40 1 . to continue 5 years, difeounting at 5 per cent, com¬ pound interefl ? By the former problem, the amount of the given an¬ nuity for 5 years, at 5 per cent, is 221.02525; and by Compound interefl, the amount of 1 1 , for five years, at 5I. per cent . is 1.2762815625 And, 1.2762815625)221.0252-5000(173.179 = 173 1. 3$. yd. the prefent worth fought. The prefent worth may alfo be found thus: By com¬ pound interefl, find the prefent worth of each year by'it- felf, and the fum of thefe is the prefent worth fought. The former example done in this way follows. 1.2762815625)40.000000000(31.3410 . 1.31550625)40.0000000 (32.908a 1.157625)40,00000 (34-5535 1.1025)40.000 (36.281 r 1.05)40.0 (38.0952 Prefent worth, 173.1788 If the annuity to be purchafed be in reverfion, find firft the prefent worth of the annuity, as commencing im¬ mediately, by any of the methods taught above; and then, by compound interefl, find the prefent worth of that prefent worth, rebating for the time in reverfion; and this laft prefent worth is the anfwer.

Anf. II. Annuities for ever , or freehold EJlates. In freehold eftates, commonly called annuities in fee- fimple, the things chiefly to be confidered are, 1. The annuity or yearly rent. 2. The price or prefent worth. 3. The rate of intereft. The queftions that ufually oc¬ cur on this head will fall under one or other of the follow¬ ing problems. Prob. 1. Annuity and rate of intereft given, to find the price. As the rate of 1 1 . to 1 1 . fo the rent to the price. Examp.

Price and rent given, to find the rate of intereft. As the price to the rent, fo 1 to the rate. Examp. An eftate of 180I. yearly rent is bought for 4000 1 . : What rate of intereft has the purchafer for. his money ? As 4000 : 180 :: I : .045 rate fought. Prob. 4. The rate of intereft given, to find how. many years purchafe an eftate is worth. Divide 1 by the rate, and the quot is the number of years purchafe the eftate is worth. , Examp. A gentleman is willing to purchafe an e- ftate, provided he can have 2 4 per cent.'for bis .money: How many years purchafe may he offer i .025)1.000(40 years purchafe. # Anf Prob, 5. The number, of years purchafe at which an eftate is hought or fold, given, to find the rate of intereft. Divide 1 by the number of years purchafe, and the quot is the rate of intereft. Examp.

The computations hitherto are all performed by a An¬ gle divifion or multiplication, and it will fcarcely be per¬ ceived that the operations are conduced by the rules of compound intereft ; but when a reverfion occurs, recourfe muft be had to tables of annuities on compound intereft. Prob. 6. The rate of intereft, and the rent of a freehold eftate in reverfion, given, to find the prefent worth or value of the reverfion. By Prob. 1. find the price or prefent worth of the eftate, as if poffeflion was to commence prefently; and then, by the Tables, find the prefent value of the given annuity, or rent, for the years prior to the commence¬ ment ; fubtraCl this value from the former value, and the remainder is the value of the reverfion. Examp. A has the poffeflion of an eftate of 130 1 . per annum, to continue 20 years ; B has the reverfion of the fame eftate from that time for ever : What is the va¬ lue of the eftate, what the value of the 20 years poffef- fion, and what the value of the reverfion, reckoning compound intereft at 6 per cent.

By the Tables, find the amount of the price of the re- verfioa for the years prior to the commencement; and then, by Prob. 2. find the annuity which that amount will purchafe. Examp. The reverfion of a freehold eftate, to com¬ mence 20 years hence, is bought for 675.577I. com¬ pound intereft being allowed at 6 per cent . : Required the annuity or rent.

The value of annuities for life is determined from ob- fervations made on the bills of mortality. Dr Halley, Mr Simpfon, and Monf. de Moivre, are gentlemen of diftinguiftied merit in calculations of this kind. Dr Halley had recourfe to the bills of. mortality at Breflaw, the capital of Silefia, as a proper, ltandard for the .other parts of Europe, being a place pretty, central, at a diftance from the fea, and not much crowded with traffickers or foreigners?,, He pitches upon 1000 per- fons all bom in one year, and obferves' how many of thefe were aHve every year, : from their birth to- the ex¬ tinction of the laft, and confequently how many died each year, as in the firft of the following tables; which is well adapted to Europe in general. But in the city of London, there is oblerved to be a greater difparity in the births and burials than in any other place, owing pro¬ bably to the vaft refort of people thither, in tire way of commerce, from all parts of the known world.

It may not be improper ixi this place to obferve, that however perfect tables of this fort may be in themfelves, and however well adapted to any particular climate, yet the conclufions deduced from them mull always be un¬ certain, being nothing more than probabilities, or con¬ jectures drawn from the ufual period of human life. And the practice of buying and felling annuities on lives, by rules founded on fuch principles,- may be jullly conli- dered as a fort of lottery or chance-work, in which the parties concerned mull often be deceived. But as efti- mates and computations of this kind'are now become fa- Ihionable, we fliall here give fome brief account of fuch as appear moll material. From the above tables the probability of the conti¬ nuance or extinction bf human life is ellimated as fol¬ lows. 1. The probability that a perfon of a given age lhall live a certain number of years, is meafured by the pro¬ portion which the number of perfons living at the pro- pofed age has to the* difference between the faid number and the number of perfons living at the given age. Thus, if it be demanded, what chance a perfon of 40 years has to live feven years longer ? from 445, the number of perfons living at 40 years of age in Dr Hal¬ ley’s table, fubtraCt 377, the number of perfons living at 47 years of age, and the remainder 68, is the num¬ ber of pferfons that died during thefe 7 years and the probability or chance that the perfon in the quellion fliall live thefe 7 years is as 377 to 6 j8 , or nearly as St to 1. But, by Mr Simplon’s table, the chance is fome- thing lefs than that of 4 to i. 2. If the year to which a perfon of a given age has an equal chance of arriving before'he dies, be required, it may be found thus : Find half the number of perfons living at the given age in the tables, and in the column of age you have the year required. ’ Thus, if the qucrtion be put with refpeft to a perfon of 30 years of age,, the number of that age in Dr Hal ley’s table is 531, the half whereof is 265, which, is found in die table' between 57 and 58 years ; fo that a perfon of 30 years, has an equal chance of living between 27 and. 28 years longer. 3. By the tables, the premium of infurance upon lives may in fome meafure be regulated. Thus, The chance that a perfon of 25 years has to live another year, is, by Dr Halley’s table, as 80 to 1 ; but the chance that a perfon of 50 years has to live a year longer is only 30 to 1. And, confequently, the premium for infuring the former ought to be to the pre¬ mium for infuring the latter for one year, as 30 to 80, or as 3 to 8. Prob. I. To find the value of an annuity of il. for the life of a Angle perfon of any given age. Monf. de Moivre, by obferving the decreafe of the probabilities of life, as exhibited in the table, compofed an algebraic theorem or canon, for computing the value' of an annuity for life; which canon I (hail here lay down by way of Rule.

When they have loaded their thighs with wax, they immediately carry it off to the luve»."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"API ( y : liive. The queen and drones, who never colled! wax in this manner, have no fuch cavity. The belly of the bee is'divided into fix rings or joints. In the infide of the belly there is a fmall bladder or refervoir, in which the honey is colledted, after having palled through the pro¬ bofeis and a narrow pipe which runs through the head and bread. This bladder, when full of honey, is about the fize of a fmall pea. The fling is fituate at the extre¬ mity of the belly: It is a homy fubftanee, and hollow within, for tranfmitting the venomous liquor, which lies in a bladder near the anus, into the wound. The fling is generally left in the wound, and frequently’draws af¬ ter it the poifon-bag. As the mellefica, or honey-bee, is both an ufeful in- fedl, and endowed with peculiar inflindts, we {hall give a particular account of its nature and oeconomy. . The queen is the only female in a hive; fhe is' di- flinguifhed from the others by being taller, more of an pblong figure, and having ten joints in each feeler. She is likewife furnifhed with a fling. The fuci, males, or drones, are commonly about 1600 in a hive ; they have po fling, and their feelers have eleven joints. The o- peraria?, fpadones, or working bees, are fometimes 20,000 in a hive; they have fifteen joints in their feel¬ ers, and are armed with flings. After a new fwarm is formed, the bees immediately begin to form their cells. They begin their work at the upper part of the hive, and continue it downwards, and ftom one fide to the other. It is not eafy to difeover the particular manner of their working; for, notwith- flanding the many contrivances ufed for this purpofe, there,are fetch numbers in continual motion, and fucceed one another with fuch rapidity, that nothing but confu- fion appears to the fight. Some of them however have been obferved carrying pieces of wax in their talons, and running to the places where they are at work, upon the combs. Thefe they fallen to the work by means of the fame talons. Each bee is employed but a very fnort tjme in this .way; but there is fo great a number of them t.hat go on in a conftant fucceflion, that the comb increa- fes vevy perceptibly. Befides them, there are others that run about beating the work with their wings and the hinder part of their body, probably with a view .0 make it more firm and folid. 'Fhe order they cbfcrve in the .conftrudtion of their cells is this : They begin with laying the balis, which is compofed of three rhombus’s or lozenges. They build firft one of the rhombus’s, and draw faces on two of its fjdes; they then add a fecond rhombus to the firft in a ' certain inclination, and draw two new faces on its two fides ; and, laft of all, they add a third rhqmbus to the two firft, and rai’e on the two external fides of this rhombus two other faces ; which completes the cell of an hexagonal figure. Whilft part of the bees are occupied in forming the cells, others are employed in pevfedting and polifhiog thofit that are new-modelled. T his operation is perform¬ ed by their talons, taking off every .thing that is rough and uneven. Thefe pohfhers are not fo defultory in their operations as thoie that make the cells; they work long and diligently, neves intermitting their labour, ex- 2 ) API ceptirg to carry out of the cell the particles of wax which they take off in polifhing. Thefe particles are not allowed to be loft ; others are ready to receive them from the polifhers, and to employ them in fome other part of the work. Each comb has two rows of cells oppofite to each 0- ther, which have their common bafes. The thicknefs of every comb is fomething lefs than an inch, and the depth of the cells is about five lines. Almoft all the combs are built with cells of this fize; except a fmall number of a larger kind, that are deftined for the Worms that produce drones. The bafes of all the combs are placed at fuch a di- ftance from one another, that, when the cells are finifhed, there is only a fpace left fufficient for the paffage of two bees abreaft. Thefe combs are not continued from top to bottom, but are often interrupted, and have openings from one paffage to another, which give a more eafy and fhorter communication. The queen-bee i^ generally concealed in the mod fe- fcret part of the hive, and is never vifible but when fl« lays her eggs in fuch combs as are expofed to fight. When fhe does appear, fhe is always attended by ten or a dozen of the common fort, who form a'kind of retinue, and follow her where-ever fhe goes with a fedate and grave tread. Before fhe lays her eggs, fhe examines tho cells v/here fhe defigns to lay them ; and if fhe finds that they contain neither honey, wax, nor any embrio, five introduces the poflerior part of her body into a cell, and fixes to the bottom of it a Fmall white egg, which is compofed of a thin white membrane, full of a whitifh liquor. In this manner fhe goes on, till fhe fills as many cells as fhe has eggs to lay, which are generally many thoufands. After the eggs lie four days in the cells, they appear in the form of fmall caterpillars ; and gene-\" rally Jie twifled round, fo that the two extremities touch each other. 1 he bees then fupply them with a little ho-' ney for food, jthe quantity of which they increafe till the eighth day from the birth of the caterpillar. After this, the bees difeover no more care about their young; but flop up the mouths of the cells with wax. The embrios lie in this ftate twelve days, during which time they un¬ dergo furprifing changes. They firft change their fituation in the cells, and inflead of being rolled up, they extend' themfelves along, and pl;jce their heads towards the mouth of the cell; after this, the head of the worm be¬ gins to have a fmall extenfion, which is the rudiment of the probofeis: Upon the head there is likewife a black point, and at a little diflance from this point, a black flreak upon the back: The firft lineaments of the feet likewife appear; but they are Very fmall. After the head is formed, and the probofeis lengthened, all the other parts difplay themfelves fucceflively; fo that the whole worm or embrio is changed into an aurelia or nymph, which is the fly almoft perfedt, except that it is yet white and foft, and wants that cruft with which it is afterwards covered. By this transformation the worm is dripped of a white thin pellicle, which adheres to the fides of the* cell. The young bee being ftripped of this pellicle, and all th» parts being unfolded by degrees, and changed through fucceffive colours from yellow to black, arrives"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"l J l a fe XXII. /.

When the young bees firft get out of the cell, they appear drowfy, but foon acquire agility and command of their members; for they have often been obferved to go to the fields, and return loaded with wax the fame day that they iflued from the cells. • As foon as a young bee quits its cell, one of the old ones takes off the wax-cover, and kneads and employs the wax for fome other purpofe : Another of them repairs and cleanfes the cell, removing the pellicle and other fordes which was If ft by the young one. It was obferved above, that bees colleft their wax from the pollen or farina of flowers, and carry it to the hive. When they arrive there, they Support themfelves on their two fore-feet, and make a buzz with theft wings,, thereby warning the bees within to affilt them to unload; which they mftantly do, each taking a fmall portion of the wax from the hinder-legs of the loaded ones, till the whole be exhaufted. The wax is not only employed for the original conftruftiorf of the combs and cells, but is col left ed and laid up in confiderable quantities for the purpofes of repairing any damage that may happen to the works during the winter, when they have no opportuni¬ ty of collecting it in the fields, and likewife to flop up the mouths of the cells when full of honey or embrios. Bees have often been obferved to dilute their wax, when too hard, by means of fome liquor or faliva which they emit upon it, ^n order to render it foft and pliable for ufe. The ho/ey, as welf'as the wax, is collected' from flowers. The honey, however, is extracted from a diffe-' rent part of the flower. In the flowers of many plants there are neftaria, or neftariferous glands, which fecret from the plant a pure tranfparent liquor, refembling vir¬ gin-honey both in tafte and appearance, excepting that it is thinner. Perhaps all the change that this neftarife¬ rous juice undergoes, by being fucked up, and depofited in the honey-bag of the bee, is, that the more watery parts may probably be abforbed during the fmall time it remains there. The heat of the hive, after it is depofited in the cells, will (till evaporate more of the watery parts, and bring it to the confiftence of honey. When a bee is collefting honey, fhe'no fooner lights upon a flower than {he extends her probofcis, and fucks up what (he can find: If {he cannot find a fufficient quantity to fill her bag in one flower, {he immediately flies to another, and thus goes on till {he has filled it. She then retires to the hive, goes to the cell, difgorges the honey, and again returns to the fields in queft of more. As the quantity carried home by one bee is but fmall, it requires the labour of many to fill a cell with honey. When the cells are full, they are immediately clofed up with wax, if defigned for winter-provifion; if not, they are allowed to remain open for the common nouriftiment of the fwarm Befides thefe capital inftinfts of bees, they are pofr fefled of others, fome of which are equally neceffary for their prefervation and happinefs. They anxioufly pro¬ vide againft the entrance of infefts into the hive, by glu¬ ing up with wax the fmallcft holes in the fltep. Some - Vol. I.

But if a friail, or other large infeft, {hould get in, notwithftanding all refiftance, they fling it to death, and then cover it-over with a coat of wax, to prevent the bad fmell or maggots which might proceed from the putrefaftion of fuch a large animal. Bees are feldom overtaken with bad weather; they feem to be warned of its appearance by fome particular feeling. Cold is a great enemy to them. To defend themfelves againft its efiefts during a cold winter, they croud together in the middle of the hive, and buzz a- bout, and thereby excite a warmth which is often per¬ ceptible by laying the hand upon the glafs-windows of the hive. They feem to underftand one another by the motions of their wings. When the queen wants to quit the hive, {he gives a little buzz, and all the others im¬ mediately follow her example, and retire along with her. They expell the drones before the wintef, fo that, of feveral hundreds in a hive, not one can be feen after the month of Oftober. This expulfion always occafions a furious battle between the drones and the working bees; but the latter being greatly fuperior in number,, always prevail. With regard to Hives, thofe made of ftraw are the beft, on many accounts: They are not liable to be over¬ heated by the rays of the fun ; they keep out cold better than wood or any other materials; and the cheapnefs renders the purchafe of th- m eafy. As the ingenious Mr Wildman’s hives are reckoned to be of a preferable conftruftion to any other, we {hall give an account of them in his own words. , “ My hives,” fays he, “ are feven inches in height, “ and ten in width. The fides are upright, fo that the “ top and bottom are of the fame diameter. A hive “ holds nearly a peck. In the upper row of ftraw, there “ is. a hoop of about half an inch in breadth, to which. “ are nailed five bars of deals, full a quarter of an inch “ in thicknefs, 'and an inch and quarter wide, and half “ an inch afunder from one another; a narrow fhort “ bar is nailed at each fide, half an inch diftarrt from “ the bars next them, in order to fill up the remaining “ parts of the circle; fo that there are in all feven bars “ of deal, to which the bees fix their combs. The fpace “ of half an inch between the bars allows a fufficient and “ eafy paflage for the bees from one hive to another, la “ cider to give great fteadinefs to the combs, fo that, up- “ on moving the hive, the combs may not f..ll off, or “ incline out of their direftion, a flick {hould be run “ through the middle of the hive, in a direftion direftly “ a crofs the bars, or at right angles with them. When “ the hives are made, a^piece of wood {hould be worked “ into the lower row of ftraw, long enough to allow “ a door for the bees, of four indies in length, and “ half an inch in height. “ The proprietor of the bees {hould provide himfelf “ with feveral flat covers of ftraw, worked of the fame “ thicknefs as the hives, and a foot in diameter, that fo “ it may be of the fame width as the outfide of the hives. “ Before the cover is applied to the hive, a piece of “ clean paper, of the fize of the top of the hive, {hould “ 'be laid over ft, and a coat of cow-dung, which is the 4 P “ lcaft"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"A P I { SS4 ) A P 3 lead apt to crack of any cement-eafily-to-be obtained, (hould be laid all round the circumference of the hive.

This ftand (hould he fupported upon a fingle poft, two and a half feet high; to which it fhould be ferewed very fecurely, that high winds., or other accidents, may not .blow down both ftand and hive. A quantity of foot mixed with barley-chaff (hould be ftrewed on the ground round the poft, which will effectually prevent ants, (lugs, and other vermin, from rifing up to the hive. The foot and chaff (hould, from time to time, he re¬ newed as it is blown or wafhed away: Though, as it is (heltered by the ftand, it remains a confiderable time, efpecially if care be taken that no weeds rife through it. Weeds, indeed, (hould not be permitted to rife near the hive, for they may give (helter to vermin which may be hartful ta the bees. “ The (lands for bees (hould be four yards afonder; or, if the apiary will not admit of fo much, as far a- fundcr as may be, that the bees of one hive may not interfere with thofe of anther hive, as is fometimes the cafe, when the hives are near one another, or on the fame ftand: For the bees, miftaking their own hives, light fometimes at the wrong door, and a fray enfues, in which one or more may lofe their lives. •* The perfon who intends to erefl an apiary, (hould purchafe a proper number of hives at the latter part of the year, when they are cheapeft. The hives (hould be full of combs, and well ftored with bees. The purchafer (hould examine the combs, in order to know the age of the hives. The combs of that feafon are white, thofe of the former year are of a darki(h yel¬ low; and where the combs are black, the hives (hould be rejected, becaufe old hives are mod liable to ver¬ min and other accidents. “ If the number of hives, wanted were not purchafed in <he autumn, it will be neceffary to remedy this negleCl after the feverity of the cold is pad in the fpring. At this feafon, bees which are in good condition will get into the fields early in the morning, return loaded, enter boldly, and do not come out of the hive in bad weather; for when they do, this indicates they are in great want of provifions. They are alert on the leaft difturbanee, and by the loudnefs of their humming we judge of their (Length. They preferve their hives free from all filth, and are ready to defend it againft every enemy that approaches. “ The fummer is an improper time for buying bees, becaufe the heat of the weather foftens the wax-, and •hereby renders the combs liable to break, if they are not very well fccured. The honey too being then thinner than at other times, is more apt to run out of the cells; which is attended with a double difad- vantage, namely, the lofs of the honey, and the daub- ing of the-bees, whereby many of them-maybe-de- 44 ftroyed. A firft and (Long fwarm may indeed be “ purchafed; and, if leave can be obtained, permitted 44 to (land in the fame garden till the autumn; but if 44 leave is not obtained, it may be carried away in the “ night after it has been hived, 44 I fuppofe, that in the (locks purchafed, the bees 44 are in hives of the old eonftruCticm. The only direc- 44 tion here neceffary is, that the firft fwarm from thefe “ (locks (hould be put into one of my hives ; and that 44 another of my hives (hould in a few days be put under 44 the old (lock, in order to prevent its fwarming again.” Bees never fwarm till the hive be too much crouded by the young brood. It is this circumftance that indu^» ces a part of the hive to think of finding a more commo¬ dious jubilation, With this view they fingle out a queen from among the young, with whom they take wing; and where-ever (he lead?, the reft follow. They firft begin to fwarm in May, or in the end of April, but ear¬ lier or later according to the warmth of the feafon. They feldom fwarm before ten in. the morning, and fel- dom later than three in the afternoon. We may know when they are about to fwarm, by clufters of them hang¬ ing on the outfide of the hive, and by the drones appear¬ ing abroad more than ufual: But the mod certain fign is, when the bees refrain from flying into the fields, though the feafon be inviting. Juft before they take flight, there is an uncommon filence in the hive; after this, as foon as one takes flight, they all follow. Before the fubfequent fwarmings, there is a great noife in the hives, which is fuppofed to be occafioned by a coated whether the young or the old queen (hould go out. When the bees of i. fwarm fly too high, they are made to defeend lower, by throwing handfuls of fand or daft among them, which they probably miftake for rain. For the fame purpofe, it is ufual to beat on a kettle or fxying-pan; This prac¬ tice may have taken its rile from obferving that thunder or any great noife prompts fuch bees as are ia the fields to return home. \"When the bees fettle in fwarming, they colled! them- felvcs in a heap, and hang to each other by their feet. When they fettle in two feparate divifions, it generally proceeds from there being two queens in the fwarm. In-, that cafe, each cluller of them may be hived feparately; or one of the queens mufl be deftroyed, to prevent the commotions which the hees would raife in order to de- ftroy her. All the motions and fettling of a fwarm Sre dire&ed by the queen. If (he be weak, and fall to the ground, the whole fwarm fall down along with her; if (he reft upon a branch of a tree, they accompany her; and if the queen be caught into a hive, the fwarm will inftantly follow her. When a (warm is too few in num¬ ber for a hive, another may be added, provided the queen- belonging to it be deftroyed. If that precaution be not taken, a battle will enfue, in which not only one of the queens is killed, but frequently a great maHy of the working bees. Several methods of taking the wax and honey, with¬ out deftroying the bees, have of late been pradlifed. Mr Wildman’s feems both to be the eafieft andfafeft: “ Re- “ move [fays he) the hive from which you would taka “ the."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"API ( 335 ) API the wax and honey into a room, into which admit but »* little light, that it may appear at firft to the bees as if “ it was late in the evening. Gently invert the hive, \" placing it between the frames of a chair, or other “ fteady fupport, and cover it with an empty hive, keej)- “ ing that fide of the empty hive raifed a little which is “ next the window, to give the bees fufiicient light to “ get up into it. While you hold the empty hive, ftea- “ dily fupported on the edge of the full hive, between i‘ your fide and your left arm, keep (hiking with the “ other hand all round the full hive from top to bottom, ** in the manner of beating a drum, fo that the bees “ may be frightened by the continued noifa from all “ quarters^ and they will in confluence mount out of “ the full hive into the empty one. Repeat the ftrokeS «* rather quick than ftrong round the hive, till all the “ bees are got out of it, which in general will be in a- “ bout five minutes. It is to be obferved, that the fuller “ the hive is of bees, the fooner they will have left it. V As foon as a number.of them have got into the empty “ hive, it fhould be raifed a little from the full one, “ that the be-.s may not continue to run from the one to the other, but rather keep afeending upon one another. “ So foon as all rhe bees are out of the full hive, the * f hive in which the bees are muft be placed on the (land “ from which the other hive was taken, in order to “ receive the abfent bees as they return from the fields. “ If this is done early in the feafon, the operator \" fhould examine the royal cells, that any of them that “ have young in them may fee faveeh as well as the combs “ which have young bees in them, which fhould on no account be touched, though, by fparing them, a good deal of honey fhould be left behind. Then take out »• the other combs with a long, broad, and pliable knife, “ fuch as the apothecaries make ufe of. The combs u fhould bo cut from the fides and crown, as clean ** as poffible, to fave the further labour of the bees, * who muft lick up the honey fpilt, and remove eve- ** ry remains of wax ; and then the fides of the hive ** fhould be feraped with a table-fpooo, to clear away “ what was left by the knife. During the whole of this \" operation, the hive fhould be placed inclined to the **. fide from which the combs are taken, that the honey “ which is fpilt may not daub the remaining combs. If “ fome combs were unavoidably taken away, in which \" there are young bees, the parts of the combs in which •* they are fhould be returned into the hive, and fecured by flicks, in the bed manner poffible; Place the hive ** then for fome time upright, that any remaining ho- \" ney may drain out. If the combs are built in a di- “ redion oppolite to the entrance, or at right angles “ with it, the combs which are the furtheft from the “ entrance fhould be preferred, becaufe there they are ** befl ftored with honey, and have the fewefl young bees ” in then*. “ Having thus finifhed taking the wax and honey, “ the next bufineft is to return the bees to their old “ hive • and for this purpofe place, a table, covered “ with a clean cloth, near the fland, and giving the “ hive in which the bees are a fudden (hake, at the fame “ rime finking it pretty forcibly, the bees will be fhaken '* on the cloth. Put their own hive over them imme- “ diately, raifed a little on one fide, that the bees may “ the more eafily enter; and when all are entered, place “ it on the fland as before. If the hive in which the “ bees are, be turned bottom uppermofl, and their own “ hive be placed over it, the bees will immediately afeend “ into it, efpecially if the lower hive is (truck on the f ‘ fides to alarm them. “ The chief objed of the bees during the fpring and beginning of fummer, is the propagation of their kind. “ Honeyduringthat time is not colleded in fnch quanti- “ ties as it is afterwards: and on this account it is M fcarcely worth while to rob a hive before the latter end of June; nor is it fafe to do it after the middle \" July, left rainy weather prevent their reftoring the “ eombs they have loft, and laying in a flock of honey “ fufficient for the winter, urrlefs there is a chance of “ carrying them to a rich pafture.” Mr Wildman, by his dexterity in the management of bees, has lately furprifed the whole kingdom. He can order a fwarm to light where he pleafes, almoft inftanta- neoufly; he can order them to fettle on his head, then remove them to his hand ; command them to depart and fettle on a window, table, 6 c. at plcafure. \"We fhall fubjoin his method of performing thtfe feats, in his.,own words: “ Spectators (fays he) wonder much at my at- “ taching bees to different parts of my body, and wifh “ much to be poffefled of the fecret means by which I “ do it. I bave unwarily promifed to reveal it; and am “ therefore under a neceffity of performing that promife : ** but while I declare, that their fear gnd the queen are “ the chief agents in thefe operations, I muft wain my “ readers that there is an art neceffary tp perform it,. “ namely pradice, which I cannot convey to them, and ** Whidi they, cannot fpeedily attain; yet till this art is • c attained, ihe deftrudion of many hives of bees muft “ be the confequence; as every one will find on their “ firft attempt ;o perform it. “ Long experience has taught me, that as foon as I ‘‘ turn up a hive,, and give it fome taps on the fides and •* bottom, the queen immediately appears, to know the “ caufe of this alarm; but foon retires again amongiher “ people. Being accuftomed to fee herfp often, I readily “ perceive her at.firft glance; and long pradice has en- “ abled me to feiz? her inftantly, with a tendernefs that “ does not in the leaft endanger her perfon. This is tf “ theutmofl importance; for the leaft injury done to her “ brings immediate deftruCtion to the hive, if you have “ not a fpare queen to put in her place, as I have too “ ■ often experienced in my firft attempts. When pof- “ feffed of her, I can, without injury to her, or exci- ” ting that degree of refentment that may tempt her “ to fling me, flip her into my other hand, and, return- “ >ng the hive to its place, hold her there, till the bee3 M miffing her, are all on wing, and in the utmoft confu- ** (ion. When the bees are thus diftrefled, I place the “ queen where-ever I would have the bees to fettle. The “ moment a few of them difeover her, they give notice K to thofe near them, and th'ofe to the reft; the know- “ ledge of which foon becomes fo general, that in a few “ minutes they all colled themfelves round her; and are: “ ■ fo-"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"API ( 33<S ) API M fo happy in having recovered this foie fupport of their “ ftate, that they will long remain quiet in their fituation. “ Nay, the fcent of her body is fo attra&ive of them, 5 * that the flighted touch of her, along any place or fub- “ dance, will attach the bees to it, and induce them to “ purfue any path (he takes. “ My attachment to the queen, and my tender regard “ for her precious life, makes me mod ardendy wifti that “ I might here clofe the detail of this operation, which, “ I am afraid, when attempted by unlkilful hands, will “ cod many of their lives; but my love of truth forces me to declare, that, by practice, I am arrived at fo “ much dexterity in the management of her, that I can, “ without hurt to her, tie a thread of filk round her “ body, and thus confine her to any part in which fhe \" might not naturally wifti to remain ; or I fometimes x< ufe the lefs dangerous way of clipping her wings on “ one fide. “ I ftiall conclude this account in the manner of C. “ Furius Crefinus, who being cited before the Curule “ Edile and an aflembly of the people, to anfwer to a “ charge of forcery, founded on his reaping much larger “ crops from his fmall fpot of ground, than his neigh- “ hours did from their extenfive fields, produced his “ ftrong implements of huft>andry, his well-fed oxen, “ and a/hale young woman, his daughter; and, point- “ ihg to them, faid, Thefe, Romans, are my inftru- “ ments of witchcraft; but I cannot ftiew you my toil, “ my fweats, and anxious cares.

The method is very fimple, and not “ expenfive, for it is no otlier than keeping the bees in a “ cold and dark place. “ My reafon for trying this experiment, was my ha- f' ving obferved, that a certain degree of cold brought “ upon the bees a dupor; and that the fame degree of “ cold continued, kept .them in the lame ftate, till they “ were brought into a warmer fituation, which imme- “ diately reftored their life and vigour # . * This obfervation is confirmed by what Mr White fays, That bees which ft and on the north-ftde of a build¬ ing, wkofe height intercepts the fun's beams all the •win¬ ter, will wafts lefs of their provijions, almoft by half than others which ftand in the fun ; for, feldom coming forth , they eat little, and yet in the fpring are as for¬ ward to work and fwarm as thofe which had twice a* much honey in the autumn before. See the Rev d . Mr White’s method of preferving bees. Third edition. “ With tlii$ view I kept two hives Ihut up in a dark cold “ out-houfe, from the middle of September to the middle “ of April, without ever letting them fee light: Upon “ their being fet out in the warmer air, they recovered im- “ mediately, and ftiewed an appearance of more ftrength “ than the hives did which had been kept out in the u- “ fual way. This appearance of ftrength continued du- “ ring the fummer, and they multiplied fader than I had “ ever obferved them do before. They were rather “ later in fwarming this year than in former fummers ; “ but the fame was the cafe with many hives in this “ neighbourhood: and even though this fhould always “ happen, yet I think other advantages will do more “ than overbalance it. Could I go into the country ear- “ ly in the fpring, to look after the bees myfelf, I “ would bring them into the open air fome weeks fooner, “ carefully attend to the changes of the weather, and “ Ihut up the doors of the hive on a bad day: but this “ degree of care cafi fcarcely be expected from fervants “ and gardeners, who have many other things to attend “ to. “ I intend to have four hives put up this feafon, in the “ coldeft dark place I can find ; and as an ice-houfe is the “ deadied and greateft cold we have, one or two of my “ friends who have ice-houfes, have promifed to put a “ hive upon the ice. By all accounts, the cold in Sibe- “ ria does not kill the bees there; and in Ruflia, where “ the winters are extremely fevere, bees produce much “ honey : fo I think there is not any danger to be “ feared from any degree of cold we can expofe the “ bees to. “ If fuccefs continues to attend this experiment of “ keeping the bees afleep all the winter and fpring, with- “ out confuming their honey, a great point will be gain- “ ed; efpecially as Mr Wildman has taught us to take “ the honey without killing the bees: for, by what;I “ have obferved. in this country, our bees are loft chiefly “ by bqing tempted to go out in a clear fun in the fpring, though perhaps a frofty wind blows, and chills them* “ fo as to prevent their being able to return to the hive; “ or an early warmth induces the queen to lay eggs, and “ a number of young bees are bred, which confume the “ little provifion left, before the fields can afford any fupply.” ?

All the fpecies of fpiders have eight legs, with three joints in each, and terminating in three crooked claws ; eight eyes, two before, two behind, and the reft on the fides of the head. The mouth confifts of two claws or talons, denticulated like a faw. A little below the point of the claw, there is a fmall hole, through which the fpider emits a kind of poifon. Thefe claws are the weapons with which they kill flies, fee. for their food. The belly or hinder part is feparated from the head and breaft by a fmall thread-like tube. The fliin or outer furface is a hard polilhed cruft. Spiders have five tubercles or nipples at the extremity of the belly, whofe apertures they can enlarge or contract at plea- fure. It is through thefe apertures that they fpin a gluey fubftance with which their bellies are full; They fix the end of their threads by applying thefe nipples to any fubftance, and the threads lengthen in proportion as the animal recedes from it. They can flop the ifluing of the threads by contracting the nip¬ ples, and re-afeend by means of the claws on their feet, much in the fame manner as fome men warp up a rope. When the common houfe-fpider begins her web, Ihe generally chufes a place where there is a ca¬ vity, fuch as the corner of a room, that Ihe may have a free paflage on each fide, to make her efcape in cafe of danger. Then Ihe fixes one end of her thread to the wall, and pafles on to the other fide, dragging the thread along with her, (or rather the thread fol¬ lows her as Ihe proceeds), till Ihe arrives at the other fide, and there fixes the other end of it. Thus Ihe pafles and repafles, till Ihe has made as many parallel threads as file thinks neceflary for her purpofe. Af¬ ter this, Ihe begins again and crofles thefe by other parallel threads, which may be named the woof. Thefe are the toils or fnares which Ihe prepares for entangling flies, and other fmall infedls, which happen to light upon it. But, befides this large web, Ihe ge¬ nerally weaves a fmall cell for herftlf, where Ihe lies concealed watching for her prey. Betwixt this cell and the large web, Ihe has a bridge of threads, which, by communicating with the threads of the large one, both give her early intelligence when any thing touch¬ es the web, and enables her to pafs quickly in order to lay hold of it. There are many other methods of weaving peculiar to different fpecies of fpiders. But, as they are all intended for the fame purpofe, it is need- lefs to give particular deferiptions of them.

ARCHITECT, a perfon /killed in architecture. ARCHITECTURE. A RCHITECTURE, or the art of building, ought r to be confidered in a twofold light, as an object of tafte, and as a mechanical art. An examination of its principles improves our tafte; the practical part contains fuch inftruflions as are necefTary for the mechanic. Many books have been compofed upon the mechanical part, but few authors have attempted to unfold the phr- lofophical principles of the art. SECT. I. OF ARCHITECTURE AS AN OBJECT OF TASTE. TV/T A n y ages muff have elapfed before architecture -* came to be confidered as a fine ait. Utility was its original deftination, and /till continues to be its prin¬ cipal end. Experience, however, has taught us, that architecture is capable of exciting a variety of agreeable feelings. Of thefe, utility, grandeur, regularity, or¬ der, and proportion, are the chief. Architecture being an uleful as well as a fine aft, leads vs to diflinguiffi buildings, 'and parts of buildings, into three kinds, viz. what arp intended for ufe folely, what for ornament folely, and what for both. Buildings in¬ tended for utility folely, ought in every part to corre- fpond precifely to that intention: The leaft deviation from ufe, though contributing to ornament, will be dif- agreeable; for every work of ufe being confidered as a mean to an end, its perfection as a mean is the capital circumftance, and every other beauty in oppofition is ne¬ glects d as improper. On the other hand, in fuch things as a, e intended folely for ornament, as columns, obe- lilks, triumphal arches, fcc. beauiy alone ought to be regarded. The principal difficulty in architecture lies in combining ufe and ornament. In order to acconiplifh thefe ends, different and even oppofite means must be employ¬ ed; which is the reafon why they are fo feidom united in perfection; and hence, in buildings of this kind, the only practicable method is, to prefer utility to ornament according to the character of the-building: In palaces, and fuch buildings as admit of a variety of ufeful contri¬ vance, regularity ought to be preferred; but in dwell- ing-houfes that are too fmal|.$>r variety of contrivance, utility ought to prevail, negleCting regularity as far as it Hands in oppofition to convenience. In confidering attentively the beauty of vifible objeCts, we difeover two kinds. The firft may be termed in- trinjic beauty, becaufe it is difeovered in a Angle object, without relation to any other. The fecond may be termed relative beauty, being founded on a combination of relative cbjeCts. Architecture admits of both kinds. We (hall firft give a few examples of relative beauty. The proportions of a door are determined by the ufe to which it is deftined. The door of a dwelling-houfe, which ought to correfpond to the human fize, is confined to feven or eight feet in height, and three or four in breadth. The proportions proper for a liable or coach- houfe are different. The door of a church ought to be wide, in order to afford an eafy paflage for a multitude; and its height mull be regulated by its widenefs, that the proportion may pleafe the eye. The fize of the win¬ dows"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"A R C H I T dows ought always to be proportioned to that of the room they are deftined to illuminate; for if the aper tures be not large enough to convey light to every cor¬ ner, the room mull be unequally lighted, which is a ^reat deformity. Steps of flairs Ihould likewife be ac¬ commodated to the human figure, without regarding any other proportion; they are accordingly the fame in large and in fmall buildings, becaufe both are inhabited by men of the fame fize. We lhall next confider intrinfic beauty, blended with that which is relative. A cube in itfelf is more agree? able than a parallelopipedon; this conftantly holds in ■ fmall figures : But a large building in the form of a cube is lumpifh and heavy; while a parallelopipedon, fet on its fmaller bafe, is more agreeable on account of its ele¬ vation : Hence the beauty of Gothic cowers. But if this figure were to be ufed in a dwelling-houfe, to make way for relative beauty, we would immediately perceive that utility ought chiefly to be regarded; and this figure, inconvenient by its height, ought to be fet on its larger bafe: The loftinefs in this cafe would be loft; but that lofs will be more than fufficiently compenfated by the additional convenience. Hence the form of buildings fpreacfmore upon the ground than ra.fed in height, is always preferred for a dwelling-houfe. With regard to the internal divifions, utility requires that the rooms be reCIangular, to avoid ufelefs fpaces. An hexagonal figure leaves no void fpaces ; but it deter¬ mines the rooms to be all of one fize, which is both in¬ convenient and difigreeable for want of variety. Tho’ a cube be the molt agreeable figure, and may anfwer for a room of a moderate fize; yet, in a very large room, utility requires a different figure. Unconfined motion is the chief convenience of a great room; to obtain this, the greateft length that can be had is neceffary. But a fquare room of a large fize is inconvenient. It removes chairs, tables, 6 c . at too great a diftance from the hand,, which, when unemployed, mull be ranged along the fides of the/room. Utility therefore requires a ikrge room to be a parallellqgram. This figure is likewife belt calcu¬ lated for the admiffion of light; becaufe, to avoid crofs- ■ lights, all the windows ought to be in one wall; and if the oppofite -wall be at fuch a diftance as not to be fully lighted, the room mult be obfeure. The height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet,, has little relation to utility; therefore proportion is the only rule for deter¬ mining the height, when above that number of feet. Artifts who deal in the beautiful, love to entertain the eye; palaces and fumptuous buildings, in which intrinfic beauty may be fully difplayed, give them an opportunity Of exerting their tafte. But fuch a propenfity is pecu¬ liarly unhappy with regard to private dwelling-houfes; becaufe in thefe, relative beauty cannot be difplayed to perfection-, without hurting, intrinfic beauty. There is no opportunity for great variety of form in a.fmall houfe; and in edifices of this kind, internal convenience has not hitherto been happily adjufted to external regularity. Perhaps an accurate coincidence in this refpeCt is beyond the reach of art. Architects, however, conftantly fpllt upon this rock ; for they never can be perfnaded to give over attempting to reconcile, thefe two incompatibks: E C T U R E. 347 How otherwife Ihould it happen, that of the endlefs va¬ riety of private dwelling-houi’es, there ihould not be one found that is generally agreed upon as a good pattern? The unwearied propenfity to make a houfe regular as well as convenient, obliges the architect, in fome arti¬ cles, to facrifice convenience to regularity, and, in o- thers, regularity to convenience; and accordingly the houfe, which turns out neither regular nor convenient, never fails to difpleafe. Nothing can be more evident, than that the form of a dwelling-houfe ought to be fuited to the climate; yet no error is more common than to copy in Britain the form of Italian houfes, not forgetting even thofe parts that are purpofely contrived for collecting air, and for excluding the fun: Witnefs our colonnades and logios, defigned by the Italians to gather cool air, and exclude the beams of the fun, conveniencies which the climate of this country does not require. We lhall next view architecture as one of the fine arts; which will lead us to the examination of fuch buildings and parts of buildings, as are calculated ftdely to pleafe the eye. Variety prevails in the works of nature; but art requires to be guided by rule and compafs. Hence it- is, that in fuch works of art as imitate nature, the great art is, to hide every appearance of art; which is done by avoiding regularity, and indulging variety. Put in works of art that are original and not imitative, fuch as architecture, ftriCt regularity apd uniformity ought to be ftudied, fo far as confiftent with utility. Proportion is not Ids agreeable than regularity and uni¬ formity ; and therefore, in buildings intended to pleafe the eye, they are all equally effential. It is taken for granted by many writers, that in all the parts of a build¬ ing there are certain ftriCt proportions which pleafe the eye, in the fame manner as in found there are certain ftriCt proportions which pleafe the ear; and that, in both, the flighteft deviation is equally difagreeable. Others feeni to relilh more a comparifon between proportion in numbers, and proportion in quantity ; and maintain, that the fame proportions are agreeable in both. The pro¬ portions, for example, of the numbers 16, 24, and 36, are agreeable; and fo, fay they,, are the proportions of a room, whofe height is 16 feet,. the breadth 24, and the length 36. .But it ought to be confidered, that there is no refemblahce or relation between the objeCts of dif¬ ferent fenfes. What plcafes the ear in harmony, is not the proportion of the firings of the inftrument, but of the found which thefe firings produce. In architecture, on the contrary,; it is the proportion of different quantit ties: that pleafes the eye, without the leaft relation to- found. 1 he fame thing may be faid of numbers. Quan¬ tity is a real quality of every body ; number is not a . real quality, but merely an idea that arifes- upon view¬ ing a plurality of things in fucceflion. An arithmetical proportion is agreeable in numbers; but have we from this any reafon to conclude, that it muft alfo be agreed- able in quantity ? At this rate, a geometrical propor¬ tion, and many others, ought alfo to. be agreeable in, both. A certain proportion may coincide in quantity and number; and amongft an endlefs-variety of propor¬ tions,. it would be wonderful if there never fhould be tu coincidence.-."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"34 8 ARCHITECTURE. coincidence. One example is given of this coincidence, in the.numbers i 6 , 24, and 36; but to be convinced that it is merely accidental, we need but reflect, that the fame proportions are not applicable to the external figure of a •houfe, and far lefs to a column. It is'ludicrous to obferve writers acknowledging the neceffity of accurate proportions, and yet differing wide¬ ly about them. Laying afide reafoning and philofophy, one faX univerfally agreed on ought to have undeceived them, that the fame proportions which pleafe in a model are not agreeable in a large building: A room 48 feet •in length, and 24 in breadth and height, is well propor¬ tioned •, but a room 12 feet wide and high, and 24 long, approaches to a gallery. Perrault, in his comparifan of the ancients and mo¬ derns, goes to the oppofice extreme, maintaining, that the different, proportions afligned to each order of co¬ lumns are arbitrary, and that the beauty of thefe pro¬ portions is entirely the effeX of cuftom. But he Ihould have confidered, that if thefe proportions had not origi¬ nally been agreeable, they could never have been efta- blifhed by cuftom. For illuftrating this point, we fhall add a few examples of the agreeablenefs of different proportions. In a fump- tuous edifice, the capital rooms ought to be large, other- wife they will not be proportioned to the fize of the building; for the fame reafon, a very large room is im¬ proper in a fmall houfe. But in things thus related,_the mind requires not a precifeor Angle proportion, rejeXing all others; on the contrary, many different proportions are equally agreeable. It is only when a proportion be¬ comes loofe and diftant, that the agreeablenefs abates, and at laft vanifhes. Accordingly, in buildings, rooms of different proportions are found to be equally agree¬ able, even where the proportion is not influenced by .uti¬ lity. With regard to the proportion the height of a room lhould bear to the length and breadth, it mud be extremely arbitrary, confidering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a room when»it exceeds 16 or 17 feet. In columns, again, every architeX mutt con- fefs, that the proportion of height and thicknefs varies betwixt 8 diameters and 10, and that every proportion between thefe two extremes is agreeable. Befides, there mutt certainly be a further variation of proportion, de- *%. pending on the fize of the column : A row of columns 10 feet high, and a row twice that height, requires different proportions : The intercolumniations mutt alfb differ in proportion according to the height of the row. Proportion of parts is not only itfelf a beauty, but is infeparably conneXed with a beauty of the higheft reJifti, that of concord and harmony ; which will be plain from what follow s : A room, the parts of which are all finely adjufted to each pther, ftrikes us not only with the beau¬ ty cf proportion, hut with a pleafure far fuperior. The length, the breadth, the height, the windows, raifeeach of them a feparate emotion : Thefe emotions are fimilar; and, though faint when feparately felt, they produce, in conjunXion, the emotion of concord or harmony, which js very pleafant. On the other hand, where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth, the mind, comparing together parts fo intimately connedted, immediately per¬ ceives a difagreement or difproportion which difgutts. Hence a long gallery, however convenient for exercife, is not an agreeable figure of a room. In buildings deftined chiefly or folely to pleafe the eye, regularity and proportion are effentially neceffary, be- caufe they are the means of producing intrinfic beauty* But a fkilrul artift will not confine his view to regularity and proportion; he will alfo iludy congruity, which is perceived when the form and ornaments of a ftrudture are fuited to the purpofe for which it is appointed. Hence every building ought to have an exprellion luited to.its deftination. A palace ought to be fumptuous and grand; a private dwelling, neat and modeft; a play- houfe, gay and fplendid; and a monument, gloomy and melancholy. A heathen temple has a double deftination: It is confidered as a houfe dedicated to fome divinity; therefore it ought to be grand, elevated, and magnifi¬ cent : It is alfo confidered as a place of worlhip; and therefore’ ought to be fomewhat dark and gloomy, be- caufe dimnels or obfeurity produces that tone of mind which is favourable to humility and devotion. Columns, befides their chief deftination of being fupports, contri¬ bute to .that peculiar expreflion which the deftination of a building requires: Columns of different proportions ferve to exprefs loftinefs, lightnefs, &c. as well as ftrength. Situation may alfo contribute to expreflion: Conveniency regulates the fitnation of a private dwell- ing-houfe ; and the flotation of a palace ought to be lof¬ ty. This leads to a. queftion, Whether the fituation, where there happens to be no choice, ought, in any meafure, to regulate the form of the edifice t The con¬ nexion between a great houfe and a neighbouring field, though not extremely intimate, demands however fome congruity. It would, for example, difpleafe us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country: Congruity requires a polilhed field for fuch a building. The old Gothic form of building was well fuited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was in¬ vented ; but was very ill adapted to the fine plains of Franee and Italy. The external ftruXure of a houfe leads naturally to its internal ftruXure. A large and fpacious room, which is the firft that commonly receives us, is a bad contri¬ vance in ieveral refpeXs. In the firft place, when im¬ mediately from the open air we ftep into fuch a room, its fize in appearance is diminilhed by contraft ; it looks little, compared with the great canopy of the Iky. In the next place, when it recovers its grandeur, as it foon doth, it gives a diminutive appearance to the reft of the houfe ; palling from it, ev6ry apartment looks little. In the third place, by its fituation it ferves only for a wait¬ ing-room, and a paffage to the principal apartments. Rejecting therefore this form, a hint may be taken from the climax in writing for another that appears more fuit- able: A bandfome portico, proportioned to the fize and falhion of the front, leads into a waiting-room of a lar¬ ger fize, and this to the great room, all by a progrellion from fmall to great. Grandeur is the principal emotion that architeXure is capable of raifing in the mind: it might therefore be the chief iludy of the artift, in great buildings deftined to"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"A R C H I T to pleafe the eye. But as grandeur depends partly on fize, it is unlucky for architecture that it is governed by regularity and proportion, which never deceive the eye by making objects appear larger than they are in reality. But though regularity and proportion contribute nothing to grandeur, fo far as that emotion depends on fize; yet they contribute greatly to it by confining the fize within fuch bounds that it can be taken in and examined at one view; for, when objedts are fo large as not to be com¬ prehended but in parts, they tend rather to diftradt than l'atisfy the mind. We lhall next pafs to Tuch ornaments as contribute to give buildings a peculiar exprelfion. It has been doubt¬ ed, whether a building can regularly admit any ornament but what is ufeful, or at leaft has that appearance. But, confidering the double aim of architecture as a fine, as well as an ufeful art, there is no reafon why orna¬ ments may not be added to pleafe the eye, without any relation to utility. A private dwelling-houfe, it.is true, and other edifices, where ufe is the chief aim, admit hot regularly any ornament but what has' at leaft the appear¬ ance of ufe : But temples, triumphal arches, and other buildings intended chiefly or folely for Ihow, may be highly ornamented. This fuggefts a divifion of ornaments into three kinds, l viz. x. Ornaments that are beautiful without relation to ufe; fuch as ftatues, vafes, baffo- or alto relievo : 2. Things in themfelves not beautiful, but poffefling the beauty of utility, by impofing on the fpedtator, and ap¬ pearing to be ufeful; fucb'as blind windows :• 3. Where things are beautiful in themfelves,_and at the fame time take on the appearance of ufe ; fuch as pilafters. Witfi regard to the firji, we naturally require that a ftatue be fo placed, as to be feen in every direction, and examined at different diftances. Statues, therefore,, are properly introduced to adorn the great ftair that leads to to the principal door of a palace, or to leffen the void be¬ tween pillars. But a niche in the external front is an improper place for a ftatue. There is-an additional rea¬ fon againft placing them upon the roof or top of the walls; their r'cklifii fituation gives pain, as they have the appearance of being in danger of tumbling down ; befides, we are inclined to feel from their being too much expofed to the inclemencies of the weather. To adorn the top of the wall with a row of vafes, is an unhappy conceit, by placing a thing, whofe natural deftination is utility, where it cannot have even the appearance of ufe. As to carvings upon the external furface of a building, termed baffo relievo when flat, and alto relievo when prominent, all contradictory exprefiions ought to be a- voided. Now, firmnefs and foiidity being the proper exprefiions of a pedeftal, and, on the contrary, lightnefs and delicacy of carved work, the pedeftal, whether of a column or of a ftatue, ought to be fparingly ornamented. The ancients never ventured any bolder ornament than the baffo relievo. With rcfpeCt to-ornaments df the. fecond kind, it is a great blunder to contrive them fo as to make them appear ufelefs. A blind window, therefore, when neceffary for regularity,, ought to be fo difguifed as to appear a real window: When it appears without difguife, it is difguft- Vol*. I. Numb. 15. E C T U R E. 349 ful, as a vain-attempt to fupply the want of invention; it fhows the irregularity in a ftronger light, hy fignify- ing that a window ought to be there in point of regu¬ larity, but that the architect had not fkill fufficient to conned external regularity with internal-convenience. As to the third , it is an error to fink pilafters fo fir into the wall, as to remove totally, or moftly, the ap¬ pearance of ufe. They iliould always projcCt fo mue,i from the wall, as to have the appearance of fupporting the entablature over them. From ornaments in general, we defeend to a pillaty the chief ornament in great buildings. - The xleftinatioii of a pillar is to fupport, really or in appearance, another part termed the entablature. With regard to the form of a pillar, it muft be obferved, that a circle is a more agreeable figure than a fquare, a globe than a cube, and a cylinder than a parallellopipedon. This laft, in the language of architecture, is faying, that a column is a more agreeable figure than a pilafter; and for that reafon it ought to be preferred, when all other circumftatces are equal. Another reafon concurs, that a column an¬ nexed to a wall, which is a plain furface, makes a greater variety than a'pilafter. Befides, pilafters at a diftance are apt to be miftaken for pillars; and the fpedtator is dif- appointed when, on a nearer approach, he difeovers them to b*b only pilafters. As to the parts of a column, a bare uniform cylinder, without a capital, appears naked; and without a bale, appears too -ticklilhly placed to ftand firm s- It ought therefore to have fome finilhing at the top and bottom: Hence the three chief parts of a column, the fhaft, the bafe, and the capital. Nature undoubtedly requirgs proportion among thefe parts, but it admits of variety of proportion. Vitruvius and fome of the elder writers feem to think, that the proportions of columns were de¬ rived from the human figure, the capital reprefenting the head, the bafe the feet, and the lhaft the body, The Tufcan has been -accordingly denominated the Gi¬ gantic ; the Doric, the Herculean ; the Ionic, the Ma-, ironal\\ and the Corinthian, the Virginal: —the Com- pofite is a mixture of the Corinthian and Ionic. As to the bafe, the principle of utility interpofes to vary it from the human figure, and to proportion it fo to the whole, as to give the column the appearance of liability. Among the Greeks, we find only three orders of co¬ lumns, the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian, diftiri- guilhed from each other by their deftination as well as by their ornaments. It has been difputed, whether any new order can be added to thefe : Some hold the affirma¬ tive, and give for inftances the Tufcan and Compofite ; others maintain, that thefe properly are not diftindt or¬ ders, but only the original orders with fome flight vari¬ ation. The only circumftances that can ferve to diftin- guifh one order from another, are the form of the co¬ lumn, and its deftination. To make the firft a diftin- guifhing mark without regard to the other, would multi¬ ply orders without end. Deftination is more limited, and it leads us to diftinguifti three kinds of orders ; one plain and ftrong, for the purpofe of fupporting plain and maffy buildings ; one delicate and graceful, for fupport¬ ing buildings of that character; and between thefe, a 4 T third,"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"350 A R C H I T third, fupporting buildings of a mixed nature. So that, if delhnation alone is to be regarded, the Tufcan-is of the fame order with the Doric, and the Compofite with the Corinthian. T he ornaments of thefe three orders ought to be fuit- ed to the purpofes for which they are intended. Plain and ruftic ornaments would be not a little difcordant with the elegance of the Corinthian order, and fweet and delicate ornaments not lefs with the ftrength of the Doric. With refpeft to buildings of every kind, one rule, dilated by utility, is, that they be firm and liable. An- E C T U R E. other, dictated by beauty, is, that they alfo appear fo to the eye; for every thing that appears tottering, and in hazard of tumbling down, produceth in the fpeifta- tor the painful emotion of fear, inllead of the pleafing emotion of beauty; and accordingly it Ihould be the great care of the artift, that every part of his edifice appear to be well fupported. Some have introduced a kind of conceit in architedture, by giving parts of buildings the appearance of falling; of this kind is the church of St Sophia in Conltantinople ; the rdund towers in the up- permolf llories of Gothic buildings is in the fame falfe tafte. SECT. II. OF ARCHITECTURE AS A MECHANICAL ART. Of the Origin of Build ings. T>U ilding s, in the fir ft ages of fociety, behoved to be extremely rude. The firft huts were probably of a conic figure, being the moft fimple, and beft adapted to the materials that could be obtained in fuch an unculti¬ vated ftate of fociety. Thefe huts were formed of branches of trees, covered with reeds, leaves, and clay. But, finding the conic figure inconvenient, on account of its inclined fides, they changed it into a cubical one, in -the following manner: They fixed in the ground fe- veral upright trees to form the fides, filling the intervals between them with branches clofely interwoven, and co¬ vered with clay. The fides being thus compleated, four large beams were placed on the upright trunks, which, being well joined at the angles, kept the fides firm; and likewife ferved to fupport the roof, which was compofed of many joifts, covered with reeds, leaves, and clay. As men improved in the art of building, new methods of rendering their huts lafting and handfome were gra¬ dually invented. Thpy took off the bark and other iln- evennefies from the trunks of the trees that formed the fides, and raifed them above the dirt on ftones. The fpaces between the ends of the joifts were clofed with clay, and the ends of them were covered with thin boards, cut in the form of triglyphs, <bc. From this fimple conftr,uAion the different orders of architedhire took their rife. When buildings of wood were laid afide, they imitated, in their edifices of ftone, *he form which necefiity had introduced into the primi¬ tive huts: Hence the upright trees gave rife to the columns ; and the beams, joifts, rafters, and ftrata of materials that formed the covering, fuggefted architraves, frizes, triglyphs, and cornices. At what time, or by whom, the Grecian orders were invented, is not certainly known. But the following is the account which Vitruvius gives of them. Dor us, king of Achaia, and fon of Helenes and Op¬ tica, built a temple to Juno in the ancient city of Argos, which happened to be in the manner now called Doric, from the name of the inventor. This manner was after- ware’s imitated in many other temples in the feveral cities of Achaia. The Athenians, about the fame time, fent thirteen co¬ lonies into Alia, under the cqmmand of Ion, fon of Xu- thus and Creufa. This Ion conquered all Caria, found¬ ed many cities, and called the country Ionia. The firft temple he built was after the Doric manner. But after¬ wards he built a temple to Diana of a more delicate ftruc- ture, and foymed upon the proportions of a female bo¬ dy, as the Doric had been on thofe of a robuft man. The capital was adorned with volutes, to reprefent the curls of a woman’s hair; and flutings were cut on the lhaft of the column, in imitation of the folds of her garment. This order got the name of Ionic, in honour of the Ioni- ans who invented it. The third fort of columns, called Corinthian, are faid to owe their origin to the following accident :—A young girl of Corinth having died, her nurfe placed on her tomb a balket, containing certain trinkets; in which Ihe delighted when alive, and covered it with a tyle to pre¬ vent the rain from fpoiling them. The balket happened to be placed on a root of acanthus, which pulhing out its leaves in the fpring, covered the fides of the balket; fome of the longeft of which, being obftrudted by the corners of the tyle, were forced downwards, and curled in the manner of volutes. Calimachus the fculptor, paf- fing near the tomb, was fo pleafed with the beautiful ap¬ pearance of the acanthus growing in this manner, that he imitated it in the columns which he afterwards made at Corinth. Vilhlpandus treats this llory of Calimachus as a fa¬ ble, and maintains that the Corinthian capital took its origin from an order in Solomon’s temple; and it muft be acknowledged, that fome deferiptions in the Bible favour this opinion. Befides thefe three orders, faid to be invented by the Greeks, two other, viz. the Tufcan and Compofite, are thought to have been invented by the Romans. The Tufcan firft appeared in Tufcany, before the Romans had any intercourfe with the Greeks. The Compofite is a mixture of the Ionic' and Corinthian. Thefe five man¬ ners of building, invented by the ancients, are called Orders, bn account of the regularity and beauty of their forms. Of"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"35i architecture. Of the• Parts that compofe an Order, and their Ornaments, The parts that compofe an order may be diftributed into two different dalles. In the JirJi may be ranged all that hav^any analogy to the primitive huts, and re- prefent fome part that was necelfary in their condru&ion. Such are t(je fliaft of the column, with the plinth of its bafe, and the abacus of its capital, reprefenting the up¬ right trees, with the dones on which they were placed, and thofe that covered them ; like wife the architrave and triglyphs, reprefenting the beams and joids ; the mutules, modilions, or dentils, which all of them reprefent the rafters, or fome other pieces of timber ufed to fupport the covering; and the corona, reprefenting the beds of materials that compofed the covering. All thefe may properly be didiqguifhed by the name of effential mem¬ bers. The fubfervient parts, contrived for the ufe or ornament of the former, and commonly called mould¬ ings, may conditute the fecond clafs. There are eight regular mouldings in ornamenting columns; the fillet, lillel, or fquare; the adragal, or bead; the torus, or tore; the fcotia, mouth, or cafe- ment; the echinus, ovolo, or quarter-round; the in¬ verted cyma, talon, or ogee; the cyma, cyma reCfa, or cymatium; the cavetto, or hollow. The names of thefe allude to their forms, and their forms are adapted to the purpofes for which they are intended. See Plate XXVII. The ovolo and talon, as they are drong at the extre¬ mities, are fit for fupports ; the cyma and cavetto,. tho* improper for fupports, ferve for coverings to fhelter o- ther members; the torus and affragal, being fhaped like ropes, are intended to bind and fortify the parts with which they are conne&ed: But the ufe of the fcotia and fillet, is only to feparate and diftinguifh the other mouldings, to give a graceful turn to the profile, and to prevent the confufion which would arife from joining fe- veral curved members together. There are various methods of defcribing the contours of moulding#; but the fimpled and bed is to form them of quadrants of circles, as in Plate XXVII. An affemblage of what are called effential parts and mouldings, is termed a profile. The mod perfect pro¬ files are fuch as are compofed of few mouldings, varied in form and fize; and fb difpofed, that the {freight and curved ones fucceed each other alternately. When ornaments are employed in. mouldings, fome of them fhould be left plain, in order to give a proper repofe : For, •when all are ornamented, the figure of the profile is loll. Of the Orders of Architecture. An Order confifls of two principal members, the Column and the Entablature; each of which is compofed of three principal parts. Thofe of the Co-. Jumn are, the Bafe, the Shaft, and the Capital ; and thofe of the Entablature are, the Architrave, the Frize, and the Cornice. All thefe are fubdivided into many leffer parts, whofe number, form, and dimenfions ch»- radenfe each order, and exprefs the degree of flrength, delicacy, richnefs, or fimplicity peculiar to it. i. OF THE TUSCAN. The Tuscan (Plate XXIV.) is the mofl folid and fimple of all the orders. It is compofed of few parts, devoid of ornaments, and fo maffy, that its feems ca¬ pable of fupporting the heavied burden. There are no remains of a regular Tufcan order among the an¬ tiques ; the do&rine of Vitruvius concerning it is ob- fcure ; and the profiles of Palladio, Scamozzi, Serlio, de l’Orme, and Vignola, are all imperfect. The. height of the Tufcan colupin is 14 modules,, or femidiameters, each confiding of 3,0 minutes; aud that of the whole entablature 34 modules ; which being divided into 10 equal parts, three of them' are for the height of the architrave, three for the freeze, and the remaining four for the cornice: The capital is one mo¬ dule; the bafe, including the lower cinChire of the fbaft, is likewife one moduleand the fliaft,. with its upper cinfture and adragal, 12 modules. Thefe are the general dimenfions of the order; the particular dimenfions may be learned by inlpe&ion of the plates. In the remains of antiquity, the quantity of diminu¬ tion at the top of the Tufcan column is various; hut fel- dom lefs than one eighth, nor more than one fixth of the inferior diameter of the column. The lad of thefe is generally preferred ; and Chalmers and others make -the fame diminution in all columns, without regard to their order. 2. OF THE DORIC ORDER. The Doric Order, (Plate XXV.) is next in drength to the Tufcan ; and being of a grave, robud, and mafeuline afpeCf, is by Scamozzi called the Herculean. As it is the mod ancient of all. the orders, it retains more of the drudhire of the primitive huts than any of the reft ; the triglyphs in its freeze reprefenting the £nds of the joids; and the mutules in its cornice, repre¬ fenting the rafters. The height of the Doric column, including its capital and bafe, is 16 modules, and the height of the entabla¬ ture four; the latter of which being divided into'eight parts, two of them are for the architrave, three for the frize, and three for the cornice,. ' In mod of the antiques, the Doric column is executed without a bafe. Vitruvius likewife makes it without one ; the bafe, according to him, having been fird employed in the Ionic order, in imitation of the fandal of a wo¬ man’s foot. Scamozzi. blames this pra&ice, and mod of the modern architects are of his Opinion. In the profile of the theatre of Marcellus, the frize is enriched with hulks and rofes ; the architrave confids only of one fafeia and a fillet; the drops are conical the metope is enriched with a bull’s fkull, adorned with a garland of beads, in imitation of thofe on the temple of Jupiter Tonans at the foot of the Capitol. In fome antique fragments, and in a great many mordern build¬ ings, the metopes are alternately adorned with ox-fkulls and pateras. But they may be filled with any other or¬ naments, according t„ the ckdination of the building. 3 . QE"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"352 A II C II I T OF THE IONIC ORDER. The lo vie Order (PlateXXVI.).isof a more {lender make than the Doric or Tufcan; its appearance is fimple, yet graceful andmajeftic; its ornaments are few; fo that it has been compared to a fedate matron, in decent, rather than magnificent attire. Among the ancients, the form .of the Ionic profile ap¬ pears to have been more pofitively determined than that «f any other order; for, in all the antiques at Rome, (the temple of Concord excepted) it is exactly the fame. The modern artifts have likewife been unanimous in their opinions; all of them, excepting Palladio and his imitators, having employed the dentil, cornice, and the other parts of the profile, nearly as they are found in the Collifcura, the temple of Fortune, and the theatre of Marci.ilus. The height of the Ionic column is 18 modules, and that of the entablature 4-i-r or one quarter of the height of the column, as in the other orders, which is a trifle lefs than in any of the antique Ionics,. In all the an¬ tiques, the bafe is Attic; and the fhaft of the column may either be plain, or fluted with 24 flutings, or 20 on¬ ly, as ,in the temple of Fortune. The plan, of the flu- tings may be a trifle more than, a femicircle, as in the forum of Nerva, becaufe they then appear more diftinCt. The fillets, or intervals between them, mull not be broader than one third of the breadth of a fluting, nor narrower than one fourth. The ornaments of the capital muft correfpond with the flutings of the lhaft ; and there muft be an ove above the middle of each flu¬ ting. The volutes ought to be traced according to Mr Goldman’s method, which is as follows : Plate XXVII. fig. 9. Draw the cathetus F C, whole length muft be 15 minutes, or one fourth of a mo¬ dule ; and, from the point C, deferibe the eye of the volute A E B D, of which the diameter is to be 64 mi¬ nutes; divide it into four equal feftors by the diameters AB, DE. Bifedt the radii C A, C B, in 1 and 4; and on the line 1, 4, conftrudt a fquare 1, 2, 3, 4. From the centre C, to the angles 2, 3, draw the diagonals C 2, C 3, and divide the fide of the fquare 1, -4, into 6 equal parts, at 5, 9, C, 12, 8. Then through the points 5, 9, 12, 8, draw the lines 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, ii, 8, 7, parallel to the diameter E D, which will cut the diago¬ nals in 6, 7, 10, 11 ; and the poibts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, will be the centres of the volute. From the firft centre 1, with the diftance 1 F, deferibe the quadrant F G; from the fecond centre 2, with the diftance 2 G, deferibe the quadrant G H; and, continu¬ ing the fame operation from all the 12 centres, the eon- tour of the volute will be completed. Fig. 10. The centres for deferibing the fillet are found in this manner. ConftruCt a triangle, of which the fide A F is equal to the part of the cathetus contained between A F and the fide F V, equal to C 1 ; place the diftance F S from F towards A, equal to F S the breadth of the fillet, and through the point S draw the line S T, which will be to C 1 in the fame proportion as A S is to A F; place this line on the diameter of the eye AB; E C T U B. E. divide it into three equal parts ; and, through the points of divifion, draw lines parallel to the diameter E D, which will cut the diagonals C 2, C 3, and you will have twelve new centres, from whence the interior contour of the fillet may be deferibed, in the fame manner as the exterior one was from the firft centres. 4. OF THE CORINTHIAN ORDER. The proportions of this order are extremely delicate. It is divided into a great variety of members, and en¬ riched with a profufion of ornaments. Scamozzi calls it the virginal order ; and indeed it has all the delicacy in its make, and all the gaiety in its drefs, peculiar to young girls. See Plate XXVIII. The moll perfect model of the Corinthian order is ge¬ nerally allowed to be in the three columns in the Campo Vaccino at Rome, the remains, as it is thought, of the temple of Jupiter Stator. The Corinthian column fhould be- 20 modules high, and the entablature 5 ; which proportions are a medium between thofe of the Panthreon and the three columns. The bafe of the column may either be Attic or Corin¬ thian : They are both beautiful. If the entablature be enriched, the {haft may be fluted. The flutings may be filled, to one third of their height, with cablings, as in the infide of the Panthfeon; which will ftrengthen the lower part of the column, and make it lefs liable to in¬ jury. . In mod of the antiques at Rome, the capital of this order is enriched with olive-leaves; the acanthus being feldom employed but in the Compofite. De Cordemoy, however, prefers the acanthus. The divifions of the entablature bear the fame propor¬ tions to each other, as in the Tufcan, Ionic, and Compo¬ fite orders. 5. OF THE COMPOSITE. The Composite is, ftridtly fpeaking, only a fpecies of the Corinthian; and therefore retains, in a great meafure, the feme character. See Plate XXIX. It does not appear that the ancients affeCted any parti¬ cular form of entablature to this order. Sometimes the cornice is entirely plain, as in the temple of Bacchus; at others, as in the arch of Septimius Severus, it is enrich¬ ed with dentils differing very little from the Ionic ; and in the arch of Titus, there are both dentils a’nd modilions; the wholeTorm of the profile being the fame with the Corinthian, as executed in the antiques at Rome. The modern architects have varied more in this than in any other order, each following the bent of his own fancy. The height of the Compofite column, and parts of the entablature, is the fame with that of the Corinthian. The foot of the leaves of the capital ought not to pro¬ ject beyond the upper part of the {haft. The different bunches of leaves Ihould be ftrongly marked; the fprigs which arife between the upper ones fhould be kept flat upon the vafe; and the ornaments of the volutes muft not project beyond the fillets that inclofe them."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"PlafeXXiy:"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"!'

Pilasters differ from columns only in their plan; which is fquare, as that of columns round. Their b*afes, capitals, and entablatures, have the fame parts, with the fame heights and projections, as thofe of co¬ lumns : They are alfo diftinguifhed in the fame manner, by the names of Tufcan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Compofite. The column is undoubtedly more perfect than the pi- lafter. However, they may be employed with great propriety on many occafions. Some authors declaim a- gainft pilafters, becaufe, according to them, they do not admit of diminution. But this is a miftake; there are many inftances, in the remains of antiquity, of their be¬ ing diminifhed. Seamozzi always gave his pilafters the fame diminution as his columns : Palladio and Inigo Jones have likewife diminifhed theih in. many of their buildings. Pilafters are employed in churches, galleries, halls, and other interior decorations, to fave room; for, as they feldom project beyond the folid wall above one quarter of their diameter, they do not occupy near fo much fpace as .columns. They are likewife ufed in ex¬ terior decorations ; fometimes alone, inftead of columns, on account of their being lefs ex pen five; and fometimes they accompany columns, being placed behind them to fupport the architraves, where they enter the building, as in the Panthseon at Rome ; or, in the fame line with them, to fortify the .angles, as in the portico of Septi- mius. When pilafters are ufed alone, they fhould project one quarter of their diameter beyond the walls. When placed behind columns, efpecially if they be very near them, they need not projedt above one eighth of their -diameter. But, when placed on a line with columns, their projection muft be regulated by that of the co¬ lumns; and confequently, it can never be lefs than a fe- midiameter, even when the columns are engaged as much as poflible. . The (hafts of pilafters are frequently adorned with flutings, in the fame manner as thofe of colutnns; the plan of which may be a trifle more than a femicircle : Their number muft be feven on each faGe, which makes them nearly of the fame 'fize with thofe of columns. The intervals, or fillets, muft either be one third or one fourth of the fluting in breadth. •ot : . J The capitals of pilafters are profiled neatly in the fame manner as thofe of columns. OF PERSIANS AND CARYATIDES. Besides columns and pilafters, it is fometimes cufto- mary to employ reprefentations of the human figure, to fupport entablatures in buildings. The male figures are called Perjians ; and the female. Car inns, or Caryatides. The ancients made frequent ufe of Perfians and Cary¬ atides,- and delighted in diverfifying them a thoufand ways. The modern artifts have follqwed their example ; and there is a great variety of compofitions of this kind to be met with in different parts of Europe. Vo l. I. No. xy. 3 E X T U R E. * 353 Indecent attitudes, diftorted features, and all mon- ftrous productions, ought to be avoided, of which there are many examples in Gothic bftildings. On the con¬ trary, the attitudes fhould be fimple and graceful, the countenance always pleafing, though varied and ftrongly marked agreeable to the nature of the objeCt reprelented. The Caryatides, or female figures, fhould never much exceed the human fize. But die Perfians, or male fi¬ gures, may be of any fize; and the larger the better, as they will ftrike the beholder with the greater awe and'afto- niftxment. Perfians may be ufed with propriety in arfe- nals, galleries of armour, (3c. under the figures of cap¬ tives, heroic virtues, drc. Their entablature ought to be Doric, and bear the fame proportion to them as to columns of the fame height. The entablature for Ca¬ ryatides ought to be either Ionic or Corinthian, according as the character of the figures is more or lefs delicate. Termini are fometimes employed, inftead of Perfians or Caryatides, to fupport the entablatures of monuments, chimney-pieces, and fuch like compofitions. Thefe fi¬ gures owe their origin to the ftoncs ufed by the ancients tomark the limits of particular poffeffions. NumaPom- pilius, to render thefe inviolable, confecrated the ter¬ minus into a deity, and inftituted feftivals and facrifices to his honour. In a fliort time, what was formerly on¬ ly large upright ftonesf, were reprefented in human fhape ; and afterwards introduced as ornaments to temples and other buildings. The termini are now principally ufed as ornaments for gardens and fields. OF PEDESTALS. Most writers confider the Pedestal as a neceffa- ry part of the order* without which it is not complete. It is indeed a matter of little importance whether it be confidered in that light, or as a diftinCt cOmpofition : We’ {hall therefore treat of a pedeftal as a diftinCt body, ha¬ ving no more connection with the order than an Attic, a bafement, or any other part wiu. which it may on fqpie occafions be affociated. A pedeftal confifts of three principal parts ; the bafe,\" the dye, and the cornice. The dye is always nearly, of the fame figure; being conftantly either a cube or a pa- rallelopipedon: But the bafe and cornice are varied and adorned with more or fewer mouldings, according to the fimplicity or richnefs of the compofition in which the pe¬ deftal is employed. Hence pedeftals are, like columns, diftinguifhed by the names of Tufcan, Doric, Ionic, Co- ripthian, and Compofite. Some authors are averfe to pedeftals, and compare a column raifed on a pedeftal to a man mounted on ftilts; imagining that they were introduced merely from ne- ceffity, and for Want of columns of a fufficient length.\" It is indeed true, that the ancients often made ufe of ar¬ tifices to lengthen their columns; as appears by fome that are in the Baptiftery of Conftantine at Rome; the (hafts of which being too fliort for the building, were lengthen¬ ed and joined to their bafes by an undulated fweep, adorn¬ ed with acanthus leaves. Neverthelefs. there are many occafions where pedeftals are evidently neceffary.; and’ fome in which the order, were it not fo raifed, would' 4 U lofe"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"ARCHITECTURE. 3SA Jol'e much of its beautiful appearance. Thus, in the in- fides of churches, if the columns that fupport the vault were placed immediately on the ground, the feats would hide their bafes, an<L a good part of their lhafts ; and, in the theatres of the ancients, if the columns of the fcene had been placed immediately on the ftage, the aCtors would have hid a part of them from the audience. In interior decorations, a pedeftal diminifhes the parts of the order, which otberwife might perhaps appear too clumfy, and hath the advantage of placing the column in 0 more favourable view, by railing its bafe nearer the level of the fpe&ator’s eye. In a fecond. order of area-, des, there is no avoiding pedeftals; as without them it is impoflible to gives the arches any tolerable proportion. With regard to the proportion that pedeftals ought to bear to that of the column? they fupport, it is by no means fixed. Both the ancients and moderns vary greatly on this head. Vignola’s proportions are general¬ ly reckoned the beft. He makes his pedeftals, in all the orders, of the fame height, viz. one third of the co¬ lumn ; and as their breadth of courfe increafes or dimi- piffies in the fame degree as the diameters of their refpec- tive columns do, the character of the order is always preferved, which, according to any other method, is impoflible. As to the divifions of the pedeftal; if the whole height be divided into nine parts, one of them may be given to the height of the cornice, two to the bafe, and the fix remaining to the dye. The breadth of the dye is always made equal to that of tl\\e plinth of the column. The projection of the cornice may be made, equal to its height; and the bafe being divided into three parts, two of them will be for the height of the plinth, and one for the mouldings, whofe projection muft be lefs than that of the cornice. Thefe meafures are common to all pe¬ deftals. See Plate XXX. .OF INTERCOLUMNIATIONS. Columns are either engaged, or infulated; and, when infulated, are either very near the wall, or at a confiderable diftance from it. Engaged columns, or fuch as are near the walls of a building, are not limited in their intercolumniations, as thefe depend on the breadths of the arches, windows, niches, or other de¬ corations placed between the columns. But columns that are entirely detached, and perform alone the office of fupportmg the entablature, as in periftyles, porches, and galleries, muft be near each other, for the fake both of real and apparent folidity. # The intercolumniations among the ancients were va¬ rious. Thofe ufed in the Ionic and Corinthian orders were the pycncftyle, of which the interval was equal to one diameter and a half of the column; the fyftyle, whofe interval was equal to two diameters; the euftyle, to two and a quarter; the diaftyle to three, and the araeoftyle to four. In the Doric order, they ufed other intercolumniations, regulating them by the triglyphs,, one of which was always placed direCtly over the middle of each column ; fo that they were either fyftyle, mono¬ triglyph, of one diameter and a half; diaftyle, of two diameters and three quarters ; or araeoftyle, of four dia¬ meters ; and the Tufcan intervals were very wide, fome pf them being above feven diameters, which was very practicable, as the architraves weare of wood. Among thefe different intercolumniations, the pyc- noftyle and fyftyle are too narrow; fqr although the an¬ cients made frequent ufe of them, that ought rather to be afq-ibed to peeeffity than choice. For, as the archi¬ traves were compofed of fingle ftones, extending from the middle of one column to the middle of another, it would have been difficult, efpecially, jn large buildings, to find blocks of a fufficient length for diaftyle intervals. With regard to the araeoftyle and Tufcan intercolumnia¬ tions, they are by much too wide, and can only be ufed in ruftic buildings, where the architraves are of wood; neither is the diaftyle fufficiently foiid in large compofi- tions. The euftyle is a medium between the narrow and broad intervals; and, being at the fame time both fpa- cious and foiid, hath been preferred to any of the reft by the ancients as well as the moderns. Vignola obferved nearly the fame proportion in all his intercolumniations; which pra&ice, though condemned by feveral writers, is ce rtainly preferable to any other ; as it preftrves the character of each order, and maintains in all of them an equal degree of real folidity. Setting afide therefore the pycnoftyle and fyftyle difpofitions on account of their want of fpace, arid the araeoftyle for its deficiency in point of ftrength, it may be eftablilhed, that the diaftyle and euftyle iotercoltimniations, (the latter of which, on moft occafions, ought to have the preference), may be employed in all the orders without diftinCtion, ex¬ cepting the Doric; in which the moft perfect interval is ditriglyph; neither the monotriglyph, nor the araeoftyle, being to be fuffiered but in cafes q£ neceffity. Sometimes, on account of the windows, doors, niches, and other decorations, which correfpond with the inter- columniations of the periftyle, or gallery, it is not pofli- ble to make the intervals fo narrow as euftyle, or even qs diaftyle ■ Wherefore the moderns, authorifed by fome few examples of the ancients, where grouped columns are employed, have invented a manner of difpofing them, called by Perrault ar#oJiy.le, which admits of a larger in¬ terval, without any detriment to the apparent folidity of the building. This kind of dilpofition is compofed of two fyftyle intercolumniations; the column that fepa- rates them being approached towards one of thofe at. the extremities, fufficient room only being left between them for the projection of the capitals; fo that the great fpace is three diameters and a half wide, and the little one half a diameter. In periftyles, galleries, or porticos, all the intereo- lumniations muft be equal: But in a logio, or porch, the middle interval may be broader than the others, by a triglyph or modilion, or three or four dentils; unlefs the columns at the angles be coupled, or grouped with pilafters; in which cafe, all the intervals ffiould be of the fame dimen (ions. When buildings are very fmall, as is frequently the cafe in temples and other inventions ufed for ornamenting gardens, the intercolumniations may be broader, in pro¬ portion to the diameter of the columns, than ufual; be- caufe."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"ARCHITECTURE. caufe, when they are nearer each other than three feet, there is hardly room for a bulky perfon to pafs between them. OF ARCHES. Arches are not fo magnificent as colonnades; but they are more folid, and lefs expenfive. They are pro¬ per for triumphal entrances, gates of cities, of palaces, of gardens, and of parks; and, in general, for all openings that require an extraordinary breadth. There are various manners of adorning arches. Some¬ times their piers are rufticated; fometimes they are adorn¬ ed with pilafters, termini, or caryatides ; and fometimes they are made fuJfficiently broad to admit niches, or win¬ dows. The circular part of the arch is either furround- ed with ruftic key-ftones, or with an archivolt enriched with mouldings; which, in the middle, is fometimes in¬ terrupted by a confole, a mafk, ferving at the fame time as a key to the arch, and as a fupport to the architrave of the order. The archivolt is fometimes fupported by an import, at the head of the pier; and, at others, by columns placed on each fide of it, with a regular enta¬ blature, or architrave cornice. There are likewife in- ftances of arcades without piers, the arches being turned on fingle columns, as in the temple of Fauous at Rome, i, 7 c. This pradiice, however, ought to be feldom imi¬ tated, as it is neither folid nor handforoe. When arches are large, the key-ftone fhould never be omitted, but cut in the form of a confole, and carried elofe under the foffit of the architrave, which, on account of its extraordinary length, requires a fupport in the middle. The imports of arches fhould never be omitted; at leaft, if they be, a platform ought to fupply their place. If columns are employed without pedeftals in ar¬ cades, they fhould always be railed on a plinth. In all arches, the circular part ought not to fpring immediately from the import, but take its rife at fueh a diftance above it, as is neceffary in order to have the whole curve feen at the proper point of view. The void or aperture of arches fhould neveT be higher, nor much lower, than double their breadth ; the breadth of the pier fhould feldom-exceed two thirds, nor be lefs than one third, of the breadth of the arch ; and the an¬ gular pier ought to be broader than the others,, by one half, one third, or one fourth; the import fhould not be more than one feventh, nor lefs than one ninth of rite aperture; and the archivolt mart not be more than one eighth, nor lefs than one tenth of it. The breadth of the confole murt, at the bottom, be equal to that of the archivolt ; and its fides murt be drawn from the cen¬ tre of the arch: The length of it murt not be lefs than one and a half of its fmalleft breadth, nor more than double. The thicknefs of the pier depends on the breadth of the portico; for it murt be ftrong enough to refill the preflure Of its vault. But, with regard to the beauty of the building, it fhould not be lefs than one quarter of the breadth of the arch,, nor more than one third. Thefe. are the general dimenfions of arches. OF ORDERS ABOVE ORDERS, When, in a building, two or more orders are employ* 355 ed, one above another, the laws of folidity require, the ftrongeft fhould be placed lowermoft. Hence the Tufcan murt fupport the Doric, the Doric the Ionic, the Ionic the Compofite or Corinthian, and the Compofite the Co¬ rinthian. This rule, however, is not always ftridly adhered to.. Moll-authors place the Compofite above the Corinthian. There are likewife examples where the fame order is repeated, as in the theatre of Statilius Taurus, and the Colifeum ; and others, where an intermediate order is omitted, and the Ionic placed on the Tufcan, or the Co¬ rinthian on the Doric. But none of thefe pi adices ought to be imitated. In placing columns above one another, the axis of all the columns ought to correfpond, or be in the fame per¬ pendicular line, at leaft in front. With regard to the proportions of columns placed a- bove each other, Scamozzi’s rule, That the lower dia¬ meter of the fuperior column fhould conftantlj be equal to the upper diameter of the inferior one, is univerfally efteemed the bell, and gives all the columns the appear¬ ance of one long tapering tree, cut into feveral pieces. According to this rule, the Doric column will be to the Tufcan, as ij-j- to 14; the Ionic to the Doric, as 15 to 16; the Compofite or Corinthian to the Ionic, as 16-fto 18; and the Corinthian to the Compofite, as l6y to 20. In Britain there are few examples of more than two ftories of columns in the fame afped: And, though in Italy, and other parts of Europe, we frequently meet with three, and fometimes more; yet it is a practice by no means to be imitated ; for there is no poflibility of a- voiding many ftriking jneonfiftencies, or of preferving the character of each order in its intercolumnial decorations.. OF BASEMENTS AND ATTICS. Instead of employing feveral orders one above the other in a compofition, the ground-floor is fometimes made in the form of a bafement , on which the order that decorates the principal, ftory is placed, The pro¬ portion of thefe bafements is not fixed, but depends on the nature of the rooms on the ground-floor. In the palace of the. Forti in Vicenza,, the height of the bafe-- ment is- equal to. that of the order. In fome buildings, its height exceeds two thirds of that of the order; and in others only half the height of the order. It is not,, however, advifeable to make the bafement; higher than the order it fupports; neither fhould it be lower than one. half of the order. The ufual method of deeorating bafements is: with rallies of different kinds. The heft, where neatnefs and finifhing is aimed, at, are fuch as have a fin noth furface. Their height, including the joint,.fhould never be lefs, nor much more, than half a module of the order placed c*n the bafement. Their figure may be from a fquare to a fefquiahera ; and their joints may be either fquare or chamfered. The fquare ones fhould not be broader than one eighth of the height of the ruftic, nor narrower than one tenth; and their depth murt be equal to their breadth; thofe that are chamfered, murt form a redangle;. and the breadth"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"35 * A R C H I T breadth of the whole: joint may be from one fourth to one third of the height of the flat furface of the ruftic. Inftead of a fecond order, it is fometimes ufual to crown the firft with an Attic Storyi Thefe Attics ftiould never exceed in height one third of the height of the order on which they are placed, nor be lefs than one quarter of it. Their figure is that of a pedeftal: The bafe, dye, and cornice, .of which they are compofed, may bear the fame proportions to each other as thofe of pedeftals do; and the bafe and cornice may be compofed of the fame mouldings as thofe of pedeftals. Sometimes the Attic is continued throughout; at others, it projects, and forms a pilafter over each column of the order. The breadth of this pilafter is feldom made narrower than the upper diameter of the column below it, and neyer broader. Its projection may be equal to one quarter of its breadth. OF PEDIMENTS. Pediments moft probably owe their origin to the in¬ clined roofs of the primitive huts. Among the Romans, they were ufed only as coverings to their facred build¬ ings, till Caefar obtained leave to cover his houfe with a pointed roof, after the manner of temples. In the re¬ mains of antiquity we meet with two kinds of pediments, the triangular and circular. The former of thefe are promifcuoufly applied to cover fmall or large bodies: But the latter being of a heavier figure, are never ufed but as coverings to doors, niches, windows, or gates. As a pediment reprefents the roof, it lhould never be employed but as a finifliing to the whole compofttion.. The ancients introduced but few pediments into their buildings, ufually contenting themfelves with a fingle one to adorn the middle or principal part. But fome of the moderns, and particularly the Italians, have been fo im¬ moderately fond of them, that their buildings frequently confift of almoft nothing elfe. The girder being a necefiary part in the conftruCtion of a roof, it is an impropriety to intermit the horizontal entablature of a pediment, by which it is reprefented, to make room for a niche, an arch, or a window'. In regular architecture, no other form of pediments can be admitted, befides the triangular and circular. Both of them are beautiful : and when a confiderable number of pediments are introduced, as when a range of windows are adorned with them, thefe two figures may be ufed alternately, as in the niches of the Pan- thaeon, and in thofe of the temple of Diana at Nifraes. The proportion of pediments depends upon their fize ; for the fame proportions will not do in all cafes. When the bale of the pediment is Ihort, its height muft be in- creafed; and w hen the pediment is long, the height muft be diminifhed The beft proportion for the height is from one fifth to one fourth of the bafe, according to the extent of the pediment, and the character of the body it covers. The materials of the roof muft alfo be attended to; for if it be covered with tylcs, it will be necefiary to raife it more than one quarter of the bafe,. as was the cuftom of the ancients in their Tufcan temples.. E C T U R E. The tympan is always on a line with the front of the frize; and, when large, admits of various ornaments. OF BALLUSTRADES. Ballustrades are fometimes of real ufe in build¬ ings ; and at other times they are only ornamental. Such as are intended for ufe, as when they are employed in ft air-cafes, before windows, or to inclofe terrafles, he. muft always be nearly of the fame height; never exceed¬ ing three feet and a half, por ever lefs than three. But thofe that are principally defigned for ornament, as when they finilh a building, fhould be proportioned to the ar¬ chitecture they accompany; and their height ought never to exceed four fifths of the height of the entablature on which they are placed; nor fhould it ever be lefs than two thirds thereof, without counting the zocholo, or plinth, the height of which muft be fufficient to leave the whole balluftrade expofed to view. The beft proportion for balluftrades is to^divide the whole given height into thirteen equal parts; eight of thefe for the height of the ballufter, three for the bafe, and two for the cornice or rail; or into fourteen, (if it be required to make the ballufter lefs), giving eight parts to the ballufter, four to the bafe, and two to the rail. One of thefe parts may be called a module ; and, being divi¬ ded into nine minutes, may ferve to determine the di-; mentions of the particular members. In balluftrades, the di'ftance between two ballufters fhould not exceed half the diameter of the ballufter, meafured in its thickeft part, nor be lefs than one third of it. The breadth of the pedeftals, when they are placed on columns or pilafters, is regulated by them; the dye never being made broader than the top of the fliaft, nor much narrower: and when there are neither columns, nor pilafters in the front, the dye fhould not be much lower than a fquare, and feldom higher. On flairs, or any other inclined planes, the fame proportions are to be. obferved as on horizontal ones, OF GATES, DOORS, AND PIERS. There are two kinds of entrances, viz. doors and gates. The former ferve only for the paffage of perfons on foot; but the latter likewife admit horfemen and car¬ riages. Doors are ufed as entrances to churches, and other public buildings, to common dwelling-houfes, and apartments: And gates ferve for inlets to cities, for- treffes, parks, gardens, palaces, he. The apertures of gates being always wide, they are generally made in the form of an arch, that figure being the ftrongeft. But doors, which are generally of fmall dimenfions, are com¬ monly parallelograms,, and dofed horizontally. The general proportion for the apertures, both of gates and doors, whether arched or fquare, is, that the height be about double the breadth. The ufual ornaments of .gates confift of columns, pi¬ lafters, entablatures, pediments, ruftics of different kinds, imports, archivolts, he .; and the moft common method of adorning doors is with an architrave, for rounding the"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"TliXSTS oir* Pili.V?

Is a ruftic door, compofed by the celebrated Vignola, in which the aperture occupies two thirds of the whole height, and one half of the whole breadth; the figure of it being a double fquare. The nifties may be either fmooth or hatched; their joints muft form a redtangle, and the breadth of each joint may be one third, or two fevenths, of the vertical lurface of a ruftic. The joints of the claveaux, or key-ltones, muft be drawn to the fummit of an equilateral triangle, whofe bafe is the top of the aperture. The architrave furrounding the aperture may be compofed either of a large ogee and fillet, or of a plat-band and fillet. Its whole breadth muft be one tenth of the breadth of the aperture ; the remaining part of each pier being for the ruftics. The entablature is Tufcan: The^irnice is to be one fifteenth of the whole height of the door; and what remains below it being divided into twenty-one equal parts, the two uppermoft of them will be for the frize and architrave, and the remaining nineteen for the ruftics and plinth at the foot of the door. Fig. 2. Is a difpofition of Michael Angelo’s. The windows of the Capitol at Rome are of this kind; and Sir Chriftopher Wren hath executed doors of the fame kind under the femicircular porches in the flanks of St Paul’s. The figure of the aperture may be a double fquare; the architrave one fixth of the breadth of the aperture; and the whole entablature one quarter of its height. The front of the pilafters or columns, on each fide, muft be on a line with the fafeia of the architrave; and their breadth muft be a femidiameter. Fig. 3. Is likewife a defign of Vignola’s. It is of the Corinthian order, and executed in the Cancellaria at Rome. The height is equal to double its breadth; and the whole ornament at the top is equal to one third of the height of the aperture. The architrave is in breadth one fifth of the breadth, of the aperture; and the pila¬ fters that fupport the confoles, are half as broad as the architrave. The whole is well imagined, but rather heavy; and it will be beft to reduce the architrave to one fixth\" of the aperture, diminilhing the entablature proportionally. Fig. 4. Is a defign of Serlio’s.

Is a door in the falon of the Farnefc at Rome, defigned by Vignola. The aperture forms a double fquare. The entablature is equal to three elevenths of its height, the architrave being one of thefe elevenths ; and the whole ornament on the fides, confifting of the architrave and pilafters, is equal to two fevenths of the breadth of the aperture: The cornice is Compofite, en¬ riched with mutules and dentils; and .the frize is adorn¬ ed with a feftoon of laurel. Fig. 6. Is copied from a door at Florence, faid to be a defign of Cigoli’s. The height of the aperture is a trifle more than twice its breadth. It is arched; and the impoft is equal to half a diameter. The columns are Ionic, fomewhat above nine diameters high ; and their fhafts are garnifhed each with five ruftic ciridtures. The entablature is lefs than one quarter of the column ; and the breadth of the tablet, in which there is an in- feriptiem, is equal to the breadth of. the aperture. OF WINDOWS. The firft confideration with regard to windows, is their fize, which varies according to the climate, the de- ftination of the building, &c. In Britain, the windows of the fmalleft private houfes are commonly from 3 to 34 feet broad ; and being generally twice their breadth in height, or fomewhat more, in the principal apartments, they generally rife to within a foot or two of the ceilings of the rooms, which are frequently no higher than 10 feet, and at moft 12 or 13. But, in more confiderabk houfes, the apartments are from x 5 to 20 feet high, and fometimes more; an,d in thefe the windows are from 4 to 5 and 54 feet brOad, and high in proportion. Thefe dimenfions are fufficient for dwelling-honfcs of any fize in this country; when they are larger, they ad¬ mit too much of the cold air in winter. But churches, and other buildings of that kind, may have larger win¬ dows, proportioned to the fize of the ftrudtures. The proportions of the apertures of windows depend upon their fituatibn. Their breadth in all the ftories muft be the fame; but the different heights of the apart¬ ments make it neceffary to vary the height of the win¬ dows likewife. In the principal floor, it may be from 24 of the breadth to 2 -f> according as the rooms have more or lefs elevation. In the ground-ftory, where the apartments are lower, the apertures of the windows fel- dom exceed a double fquare; and, when they are in a ruftic bafement, they are frequently made much lower. The height of the windows of the fecond floor may be from i-i- of their breadth to if; and Attics and Mezza¬ nines may be.either a perfedt fquare, or fomewhat lower. The windows of the principal floor are generally moft enriched. The fimpleft method of adorning them is, with an architrave furrounding the aperture, and crown¬ ed with a frize and cornice. The windows of the ground-floor are fometimes left entirely plain, without 4 X any"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"358 A R C H I T any ornament ; and at others they are furrounded with ruffles, or a regular architrave with a frize and cornice. Thofe of the fecond floor have generally an architrave carried entirely round the aperture; and the fame is the method of adorning Attic and Mezzanine windows s' But the two laft have fcldom either frize or cornice; whereas the fecond-floor windows are often crowned with both. The breads of all the windows on the fame floor fhould he on the fame ‘ level, and raifed above the floor from two feet nine inches to three feet fix inches at the very mod. When the walls are thick, the breads durald be reduced under the apertures, for the conveniency of looking out. In France, the windows are frequently carried quite down to the floor. When the building is Furrounded with gardens, or other beautiful objefls, this method renders the rooms exceeding pleafant. The interval brtween the apertures of windows de¬ pends in a great mead: r e on their enrichments. The breadth of the aperture is the lead didance that can be between them ; and twice that breadth fhould be the lar¬ ged in dwelling-.houfes; otherwife the rooms will not be fufficiently lighted. The windows in all the dories of the fame afpeifl mud be placed exadlly above one another. Plate XXXII. Fig. i. Is a defign of P. Lefcot, ab¬ bot of Clagny, executed in the old Louvre at Paris. The apertures may be a double fquare, or a.trifle more; the architrave from one fixth to one feventh of the btadth of the aperture ; The pilader is equal to that breadth, when the architrave is narrow; or lefs, by one quarter, or ons fifth, when it is broad. The whole entablature fliould not exceed one quarter of the height of the a- perture, nor be much lower. The confoles may be equal in length, to half the breadth of the aperture at mod, and to one third of it at lead. Fig. 2. Is a defiga of Palladio’s, executed at the Chiericato in Vincenza: Its proportions are not much different from the following. The plat-band that dip- ports the window is equal to the breadth of the archi¬ trave. Fig. 3. Is likev/ife a defign of Palladio’s, executed by him in many of his buildings. The aperture is a double fquare. The breadth of the architrave is one dxth of the breadth of the aperture ; and the frize and cornice together are double the height of the architrave. The breadth of the confoles is two thirds of the breadth of the architrave.. Fig. 4. Is a defign of Ludovico Da Cigoli ; and ex¬ ecuted in the ground-floor of the Ranunchini palace at Florence. Fig. 5. Is a defign of Inigo Jones, executed at the Banqueting-houfe.

It hath been cuftomary, in all ages, to enrich differ- E C T U R E. ent parts of buildings with representations of the human body. Thus the ancients adorned their temples, baths, theatres, 6 t. with flatties of their deities, heroes, and legiflators.- The moderns flill preferve the fame cuftom, placing in their churches, palaces, ebc. flames of illu- ftrious perfons, and even groups compofed of various fi¬ gures, reprefenting occurrences coiletfkd from hiiiory, fables, 6c. Sometimes thefe flatues or grouns are de¬ tached, raifed on pedeftals, and placed contiguous to the walls of a building, or in the middle of a room, court, or public fquare. But they are moft frequently placed in cavities made in the walls, called niches. Of thefe there are two forts; the one formed like an arcb in its elevation, and femieircular or femielliptieal in its plan; the other is a parallelogram both in its plan and ele¬ vation. The proportion of both thefe niches depends on the charafter of the flatues, or the general form of the groups placed in them. The loweft are at leaft a double fquare in height; and the higheft never exceed 2-y of their breadth. With regard to the manner of decorating them, when they are alone in a compofition, they are generally in- doled in a panne!, formed and proportioned like the a- perture of a window, and adorned in the fame manner. In this cafe, the niche is Carried quite down to the bot¬ tom ; but on the fides and at the top, a fmall fpace is left between the niche and the architrave of the pannel. And when niches are intermixed with windows, they may be adorned in the fame manner with the windows, provided the ornaments be of the fame figure and dimen- fions with thofe of the windows. The fize of the flatues depends on the dimenfions of the niches. They fhould neither he fo large as to have the appearance of being rammed into the nichek, as in Santa Maria Majore at Rome; nor fo narrow as to feem loft in them, as in the Pantheon. The diftance between the outline of the ftatue and fide of the niche fhould never be lefs than one third of a head, nor more than one half, whether the niche be fquare or arched; and when it is fquare, the diftance from the top of the head to the ceiling of the niche fhould net be greater than die diftance on the fides. Statues are generally raifed on a plinth, the height of which may be from one third to one half of a head; and fometimes, where the niches are large, the ftatues may be raifed on fmall pedeftals. The chara&er of the ftatue fhould always correfpond with the character of the archite&ure with which it is furrouEoed. Thus, if the order be Doric, Hercules,. Jupiter, Mars, ATculapius, and all male ftatues repre- fenting beings of a robuft and grave nature, may be in¬ troduced ; if Ionic, then Apollo, Bacchus, 6c.; and if Corinthian, Venus, Flora, and others of a delicate na¬ ture, fhould be employed. OF CHIMNEY-PIECES. Among the ancients, there are very few examples of chimney-pieces to be met with. Neither the Italians nor French have excelled in compofitions of this kind. Britain, by being paffdled of many able fculptors at , different"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"A R C II I T different times, has furpaffed all other nations, both in tafle of defign, and workmaclhip. The fize of the chimney mud be regulated by the di- menfions of the room ■ where it is placed. In the fmalleft apartments, the breadth of the aperture fiiould never be lefs than three feet, to three feet fix inches. In rooms i»om 20 to 24 feet fquare, or of equal fuperficial dimen- fions, it may be from 4 to 4^ feet broad; in thofe of 24 to 27, from 4I to 5; and, in fuch as exceed thefe dimenfions, the aperture may even be extended to or 6 feet. The chimney fliould always be fituate fo as to be im¬ mediately feen by thofe who enter the room. T he mid¬ dle of the partition wall is the moft proper place in hails, falons, and other rooms of paffage; but in drawing¬ rooms, drefljng-roonre, and the like, the middle of the back wall is the bed flotation. In bed-rooms, the chim¬ ney is always in the middle of one of the partition-walls; and in clofeis, and other very fniall places, to five room, it is putin a comer, Where-ever two chimneys are ufed in the fame room, they fiiould be placed either direftly facing each other, if in different walls^ or at equal di- ftances from the centre of the wall in which they both The proportion of the apertures of chimney-pieces of a moderate fize is generally a perfect fquare; in imall ones, it is a tribe higher; and in large ones, a trifle lower. Their ornaments confift in architraves, frizes, cornices, columns, piktfters, terming caryatides, con- foles, and all kinds of ornaments of fedpture, represent¬ ing animals and vegetables, etre. likewife vafes, cha¬ lices, trophies of arms, ire. In designing them, regard mull: be had to the nature of the place where they are to be employed. Such as are intended for halls, fa¬ lons, guard-rooms, galleries, and other large places, rauft be compofed of large parts, few in number, of diflinft and dimple forms, and having a bold relief; but chimney-pieces for drawing-rooms, drelBng-rooms, ire. may be of a more delicate and complicated nature. Chimney-pieces are compofed of wood, done, or mar¬ ble ; the laft of which ought to be preferred, as figures or profiles are beft reprefented in a pure white. Plate XXXIII. Fig. 1, 2, 3, and 4. are different de- figns for chimney-pieces by Palladio and Inigo Jones. Their proportion may be gathered from the defigns, which, are accurately executed. OF THE PROPORTIONS OF ROOMS. The proportions of rooms depend in a great mcafure on their ufe, and aftual dimenfions: But, with regard to beauty, all figures, from a fquare to a fefquialteral, may be ensloyed for the plan. The height of rooms depends- on their figure. Flat ceiled ones may be lower than thofe that are coved. If their plan be a fquare, their height fhould not exceed five fixths of the fide, nor be lefs-than four fifths ; and when it is oblong, their height may be equal to their breadth. But coved rooms, if fquare, mull be as high as broad ; and wh^ oblong, they may have their height equal to their breaoth, more one fifth, one quarter, or E C T U R E. 35-9 even one third of the difference between the length and breadth: And galleries fliould at lead be in height one and one third of their breadth, and at moft one and a half, or one and three fifths. The coldnefs the Britifh climate is a ftrong objection to high rooms; fo that it is not uncommon to lee the moft magnificent apartments not above 1 j, 16, or at moft 18 feet high ; though the extent of the rooms would re¬ quire a much more confiderable elevation. But, where beauty is aimed at, this p raft ice ought not to be imi¬ tated. When rooms are adorned with an intire order, the en¬ tablature fiiould never exceed one fixth of the whole height in flat-ceiled rooms, and one fixth of the upright part in coved ones; and when there are neither columns nor pilafters, but only an entablature, its height fiiould not be above one feventh of thefe heights. If the rooms be finilhed with a fimple cornice, it fiiould never exceed one fourteenth, nor ever lefs than one fifteenth part of the above-mentioned height. OF CEILINGS. Ceilings are either flat, or coved, in different man¬ ners, The fimpleft of the flat kind are thofe adorn¬ ed with large compartments, furrounded with one or feveral mouldings, either let into the ceiling, or projec¬ ting beyond its furface: And when the mouldings that form the compartments are enriched, and fome of the compartments adorned with well-executed ornaments, fuch ceilings have a good effeft, and are very proper for common dwelling-houfes, and all low apartments. Their ornaments and mouldings do not require a bold relief; but, being near the eye, they muft be finilhed with tafie and neatnefs. For higher rooms, a flat ceiling which has the appearance of being compofed of various joifts framed into each other, and forming compartments of various geometrical figures, fliould be employed. The Cdes of the joifts forming the compartments are general¬ ly adorned with mouldings,, and reprefent either a fimple architrave, or an architrave-cornice, according to the fize of the compartments and the height of the room. Coved ceilings are more expenfive ; but they are like¬ wife more beautiful. They are ufed promifcuoufly in large and frnall rooms, and occupy from one fifth to one third of the height of the room. If the room be low -in proportion to its breadth, the cove muft likewife be low; and when it is high, the cove muft be fo likewife : By which means the excels of the height will be rendered lefs perceptible. But, where the ardiiteft. is at liberty to proportion the height of the room to its fuperficial di¬ menfions, the moft eligible proportion for the cove is one fourth of the whole height. In parallelogram-figured rooms, the middle of the ceiling is generally formed into a large flat pannel,. This pannel, with the border that, furrounds it, may occupy from one half to three fifths of the breadth of the room. The figure of the cove is- commonly either a quadrant of a circle or of an ellipfe, taking its-rife..a little above the cornice, and finilhing at the border round the great pannel in the centre. The border projefts fomewhzt beyond the coves on the out- fidet"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"ARC II I T fide; and, on the fide towards the pannel, it is general¬ ly made of a fufficient depth to admit the ornaments of an architrave, or architrave and cornice. In Britain, circular rooms are not much in ufe; but they are very beautiful. Their height mull be the fame with that of fquare rooms; their ceilings may be flat; but they are handfom'er when coved, or of a concave form. Arcs donbleaux, or foffits of arches, when narrow, are ornamented with guitlochis, or frets; but, when broad, they may be adorned in a different manner. When the profiles of the room are gilt, the ceilings ought likwife to be gilt. The ufual method is to gild all the ornaments, and to leave the grounds white, pearl co¬ lour, light blue, or of any other tint proper to fet off the gilding to advantage. Painted ceilings, fd common in Fiance and Italy, are but little ufed in Britain. OF STAIRS AND STAIR-CASES. There are many kinds of Ikur-cafcs; for in fome the fleps are made ftraight; in others, winding; in others mixt of both. Of ftraight flairs, fome fly dire&ly forward; Others are fquare; others triangular. Others are called French flights, or winding-flairs, (which in general are called fpiral or cockle-flairs); of which fome are fquare; lome circular, or round; and fome elliptical, or oval; and thefe again are various; for fome wind about a fo- lid, others about an open newel. Stairs mixt of ftraight and winding fleps are alfo of various kinds; fome are called dog-legged; fome there are that wind about a folid newel ; and others that fly about a fquare open newel. Great care ought to be taken in placing of the flair- cafe in any building; and therefore flair-cafes ought to be defcribed, and accounted for juftly, when the plan of a building is made. For want of this, fometimes unpar¬ donable errors have been committed: Such as having a little blind flair-cafe to a large houfe; or, on the other hand, to have a large fpacious flair-cafe to a little one. Palladio fays, in placing flair-cafes, the utmoft care ought to be taken, it being difficult to find a place con¬ venient for them, that will not at the fame time preju¬ dice the reft of the building. But commohly the flairs are placed in the angle, wing, or middle of the front. To every flair-cafe are required thred openings. Firft, the door leading thereto. Secondly, the window, or windows, that give light to it; And, thirdly, the landing. Firft, the door leading to a flair-cafe ffiould be fo pla¬ ced, that mod of the building may be feen before you come at the flairs, and in fuch a manner that it may be eafy for any perfon to find out. Secondly, for the windows; if there be but one, it muft be placed in the middle of the flair-cafe, that there¬ by the whole may be enlightened. Thirdly, the landing of flairs ffiould be large and fpa¬ cious, for the convenient.entering into rooms: In a word, flair-cafes ffiould be fpacious, light, and eafy in afcent. E C T U II E. The height of large fleps muft never be lefs than fix inches, nor more than feven inches and a half. The breadth of fleps ffiould never be lefs than io inches, nor more than 18 inches; and the length of them not lefs than three feet, nor more than 12. Plate XXXIV. Fig. 1.

The fcale being thus made, draw the fcroll of fig. 3. by it in the following manner. Set one foot of your compaffes in 1, and defcribe a ftroke at e ; take the fame diftance, and with one-foot in 2, crofs the ftroke at c; then from c, turn the part from 1 to 2, and proceed in the fame manner ; for if the diftance were taken in the fcale from 1 to the centre* it would ftrike the circle too flat; and if taken from 2, it would ftrike the circle too quick. When this is well underftood, there will be little dif- ficulty in drawing the fcroll below fig. 2.; which throws •itfelf out farther in proportion than that in fig. 3.; for this will always be the cafe when the upper line of the fcale, which confifts of four divifions in fig. 4. is made but with three divifions or lefs ; whence it appears, that the tipper line of the fcale may be drawn at what length you pleafe, according as you would bring in or keep out the fcroll.

AREOPAGUS, a fovereign tribunal at Athens, famous for the juftice and impartiality of its decrees, to which the gods themfelves are faid to have fubmitted their differences. Authors are not agreed about the number of judges that compofed this auguft court; fome reckon thirty- one ; others, fifty-one ; and others, five hundred. In effeft, their number feetns not to have been fixed, but to have been more or lefs in different years. At firft, this tribunal confifted only of nine perfons, who had all difeharged the office of Archons, had acquitted themfelves with honour in that truft, and had likewife given an account of their adminiltration before the Logiftte, and undergone a rigorous examination. Their falary was equal, and paid out of the treafury of the j'epublic; they had three oboli for each caufe. The Areopagites were judges for life; they never fat in judgment but in the open air, and that in the night¬ time, to the intent that their minds might be the more prefent and attentive, and that no objed of pity or averfion might make any impreflion on them; and all the pleadings before them were to be in the fimpleft and moft naked terms. At firft they took cognifance of criminal caufes only, but in courfe of time their jurifdidion became of great extent. Mr Spon, who examined the antiquities of that il- luftrious city, found fome remains of the Areopagus ftill exifting in the middle of the temple of Thefeus, which was heretofore in the middle of the city, but is now without the walls. The foundation of the A- reopagus is a femicircle, with an efplanade of 140 paces round it, which properly made the hall of the Areopagus. There is a tribunal cut in the middle of a rock, with feats on each fide of it, where the Areo¬ pagites fat expofed 4 to the open air. It is very uncer¬ tain when this court was inftituted, fince Demofthenes himfelf is at a lofs upon the point: Some think that it was inftituted by Solon; but others carry it much higher, and affert it to have been eftablilhed by Ce- crops, about the time that Aaron died.

From thence it was tranfmitted to the Greeks, who conveyed it to the Romans with additional, improvements. But, from fome treatifes of the ancients remaining on this fub- je<ft, it appears that their arithmetick was much inferior to that of the moderns. Number, which is the obje<ft of arithmetick, is that which anfwers dire&ly to the queftion, How many? and is either an unit, or fome part or pa ts of an unit, or a multitude of units. To a perfon having the idea of number in his mind, the following queftions naturally occur, viz. i. How is fuch a number to be expreffed or written ? Hence we have Notation. 2. What is the fum of two or more numbers? Hence Addition. 3. What is the difference of two given numbers ? Hence Subtra&ion. 4. What will be the refult or produdt of a given number repeated or taken a certain number of times ? Hence Multiplica¬ tion. 5. H-ow often is one given number contained in another ? Hence Divifion. Thefe five, viz. Notation* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Divifion, are the chief parts, or ra¬ ther the whole of arithmetic; as every arithmetical ope¬ ration requires the ufe of fome of them, and nothing but a proper mixture of them is neceffary in any operation whatever ; and, by an Arabic term, thefe are called the algorithm . Chap. I. Notation. Notation is that part of arithmetic which explains the method of writing down, by charafiers or fymbols, any number expreffed in words; as alfo the way of reading or expreffing, in words, any number given in characters- or fymbols. But the firft of thefe is proper¬ ly notation, and the laft is more ufually called numera¬ tion. The things then propor to be comprifed in this chap¬ ter are, 1. The figural notation. 2. Numeration, or the way of reading numbers. 3. Defcriptions of the kinds-or.fpecies of numbers, I. Figural' Notation. Aw unit, or unity, is that number by which any thing is called one of its kind. It is the firft number; and if to it be added another unit, we (hall have another num¬ ber called two; and if to this laft another unit be add¬ ed, we fhall have another number called three ; and thus, by the continual addition of an unit, there, will a- rife an infinite increafe of numbers. On the other hand, if from unity any part be fubtfacted, and again from that part another part be taken away, and this he done continually, we fhall have an infinite decreafe of num¬ bers. But though number, with -relpecS to increafe and decreafe, be infinite, and knows no limits.; yet ten fi¬ gures, varioufly combined or repeated, are found fuffi- eieni to expreft any number whatfoever. Thefe,,, with the method of notation by them, were originally invent¬ ed by fome of the eaftern nations, probably the Indians.; afterwards improved by the Arabians ; and at laft brought over to Europe, particularly into Britain, betwixt the tenth and twelfth century. From the ten fingers of the hands, on which it hath been ufual to compute num¬ bers, figures were called digits. Their form, order, and value, are as follows : 1 One, an unit, or unity, 2^two, 3 three, 4 four, 5 five, 6 fix, 7 feven, 8 eight, 9 nine, o cipher, nought, null, or nothing. Of thefe, the firft nine, in contradi- ftinCtion to the cipher, are called ftgnificant figures. The value of the figures now alfigned is called their Jtmple value , as being that which they have in them- felves, or when they ftand alone. But when two or more figures are joined as in a line, the figures then receive alfo a local value from the place in which they ftand, reckoning the order of places from the right-hand towards the left, thus. 777777777777 A figure (landing in the firft place has only its fimpfe value ; but a figure in the fecond place has ten times the value it would have in the firft place; and a figure in the third place has ten times the value it would have in the fecond place; and univerfally a figure in any fuperior place has. ten times the value it would have in the next inferior place. Hence it is plain, that a figure in the firft place (imply fignifies fo many units as the figure expreffes; but the fame figure advanced to the fecond place will fignify fo many tens; in the third place, it will fignify fo many hundreds; in the fourth place, fo many thoufands; in the fifth place, fo many ten thoufands; in the fixth place, fo many hundred thoufands; and in the feventh place, fo many millions, <bc. Thus, 7 in the firft place, will denote feven units; in the fecond place, feven tens, or feventy ; in the third place, feven hundred; in the fourth place,, feven thoufand, &c. Every three places, reckoning from the right-hand, make a half period; and the right-hand figures of thefe half-periods are termed units and thoufands by turns; the middle figure is always tens, and the left-hand fi¬ gure always hundreds. Two half-periods, or fix places, make a full period and the periods, reckoning from the right-hand towards the left, are titled as follows, viz. the firft is the period of units ] ; the fecond, that of millions ; the third is titled Umillkns, or billions', the fourth, trimillions, or tril¬ lions ; the fifth, quadrillions; the fixth, quintillions ; the feventh fextillions s the eighth, feptillions ; the ninth,. ‘ oliillions ; the tenth, nanillions, &c. Half-periods are ufually diftinguilhed from one an¬ other by a comma, and fall periods by a point or colon; as in the following TABLE."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"A It I T H T A B L E v 3d Period. 2d Period. ift Period.

From the table it is obvious, that though a cipher fig- nify nothing of itfelf, yet it ferves to fupply vacant pla¬ ces, and raifes the value of fignificant figures on its left hand, by throwing them into higher places. Thus, in the firft period, by a cipher’s filling the place of units, the figure 4 is thrown into the place of tens, and figni- fies forty. But a cipher does not change the value of a fignificant figure on its right-hand. Thus, 07, or 007, is the fame as-7. II. Numeration ; Notation and numeration are fo nearly allied, that he who underftands the one cannot fail foon to acquire the other. The method of reading numbers, exprefled by figures, may be eafily learned from the table of the figural notation ; in which obferve the following Rule. Beginning at the left hand* and reading to¬ ward the right; to the Ample value of every figure join the name of its place, and conclude each period by ex> prefling its title, every where omitting the ciphers- M E T I C K. 367 6. An odd number is that which 2 does not meafure, or which cannot be divided by 2, without a remainder ; « 3 > 7> 9 > JI > *3 . 7. A prime number is that which unity, or itfelf, on¬ ly meafures; as 3, y, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. 8. A compoftte number is that which is meafured by fome other number than itfelf, or unity;, as 12, which is meafured by 2, 3, 4, or 6. 9. Numbers are called prime to one another, when unity only meafures them. Thus 13 and 36 are prime to one another; for no number, except unity, meafures both. 10. Numbers are called compojite to one another, when fome number, befides unity, meafures them. Thus 12 and 18 are compofite to one another ; for 3 or 6 mea¬ fures both of them. it. A number which meafures another is called an aliquot part of that other. Thus 6-is an aliquot part of 18, and 3 of 12, and 5 of 20. 12. The number meafured, or which contains the ali¬ quot part a certain number of times, is called a multiple of that aliquot part. Thus 18 is a multiple of 6, and 12 of 3. 13. A number is called an aliquant part of another, when it does not divide that other without a remainder. Thus 7 is an aliquant part of 24. 14. Two, three, or more numbers, which, multiplied together, produce another number, are called Hoe..com¬ ponent parts of the number produced. Thus 3 and 4, 2 and 6, are the component parts of 12; and 2, 3, and 4, are the component parts of 24. 15. The produft of a number multiplied into itfelf is called the fquare, or fecond power, of that number; and the number itfelf is in this cafe called the root. And if the fquare be multipled into the root, the product is called the cube, or third power, of that number. And if the cube be multiplied into the root, the produdt thence arifing is called the biquadrate, or fourth power, &c. Ghaf. II. Ad D 1 T I ON. III. Defcriptions of the kinds or fpecies of numbers * 1. An integer, or whole number, is an unit; or any multitude of units ; as 1, 7, 48, 100, 125, 2. A fraft ion, or broken number, is any part or parts of an unit; and is exprefled by two numbers, which are feparated from one another by a line drawn betwixt them; the under number being c^JIed the denominator, and the upper one the numerator, of the fraction ; as 119 T1 T5* 3. A mixt number is an integer with a fraction joined' to it; as 4^-, 7|, 48^ 4. A number is faid to meafure another number, when it is contained in that other number a certain num¬ ber of times, or when it divides that other number with¬ out any remainder. Thus, 3 meafures 6, 9, or 12. 5. An even number is that which is meafured by 2, or which 2 divides without any remainder; as 2, 4, 6 , 8, to, 12.

Addition may be proved feveral ways. 1. Merchants and men of bufmsfs ufually add each column firft upwards, and then downwards, and, upon finding the fum to be the fame both ways r they conclude the work to be right: and this is all the proof that their time, or the hurry of bufinefs, will admit of; 2. It is a common practice in fchools, to prove the work by a fecond fumming without the top-line ; and if thus fum added to the top-line makes the firft total, the work is fuppofed to be right; as in the following ex-< ample. ‘ L. s. d.

A ddition is alfo proved by calling out the 9’s; for if the excefs above the p’s in the total be the fame as the excefs in the items, the 347 j work may be prefumed right. Thus, to 684 \"VT prove the example in the margin, begin -• ■ - with the items, and fay, 3 + 4=7, and 1031 5 7 + 7=14 = 1 +4=5 • with this 5 pafs to the next item, and fay, 5 + 6 = 11 = 1 + 1=2, and. 2 + 8=10=1, and-i + 4 = 5 ; which' 5 being the ex¬ cefs of the items, place at the top of the crofs, and, proceed to call the p’s out of the total, faying, 1+3=4, and 4+1=5; which 5, being the excefs of the total, place at the foot of the crofs; and becaufe it is the fame with the figure at the top, you conclude the work to be right. , If the items are of different denominations; as pounds, {hillings, pence, eV-; you mull begin with the bigheft denomination; and, after calling out the 9’s, reduce the excefs to the next inferior denomination ; and then call¬ ing out the p’s, reduce the excefs to the next inferior denomination; proceed in like manner with this, and all the other lower denominations, placing the lall excefs at the top of the crofs; then, in the fame manner, call the 9’a out of the total, placing the excels at,.the foot of the crofs; and if the figure at rhe foot and top be the fame, the work may be prefumed right. If any operation, whether in addition, lubtradion, multiplication, or divifion, be right, this kind of proof will always Ihow it to be fo; but if an operation be wrong, by a figure or figures being mifplaced, or by mifeounting 9, or any juft number of 9’s, this kind of proof will not di&over the miftake. 5 A 3 Chap,"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"370 A R I T H Chap: III.

In this example fay, 3 farthings from 1 farthing you cannot, but as directed in Rule II. you fay, 3 from (10) (20) (12) 4, the number of farthings L. s. d. in 1 penny borrowed, and 708 14 67 major. 1 remains; which 1 added 170 17 'xo£ minor. to 1 in the major gives 2- farthings for a remain- 429 16 Ik remainder, der; which fet down, and proceed to the pence, faying, 1 penny borrowed and ro make 11, which from 6 you cannot, but from 12, the number of pence in 1 fhilling, and 1 remains ; which r added to 6 in the major gives a remainder of 7 ; which fet down, and go on to the (hillings ; and becaufe in fub- tradling (hillings we borrow a juft number of tens, viz. 2 tens, or 20, work as diredfed in Rule III.; and in the right-hand column fay, 1 borrowed and 7 make 8, which from 4 you cannot, but from 14, and 6 remains; which being fet down, go on to the left-hand column, and fay, 1 borrowed and 1 make 2, which from 1 you cannot, but from 2, the number of tens in 1 pound, and nothing remains, which o added to 1 in the major gives 1 for a remainder; which fet down, and proceed to the pounds, faying, 1 borrowed and 8 make 9, which front 8 you cannot, but from 18, tec.

Multiplication. under the common name of fattors ; and the number arifing from the multiplication of the one by the other is called the produtt, and fometimes the fat 7 , or the rettangle. If a multiplier confirts of two or more fi¬ gures, the numbers arifing from the multiplication of thefe feveral figures into the multiplicand, are called par¬ ticular, or partial products ; and their fum is called the total produtt. Multiplication then is the taking or repeating of the multiplicand, as often as the multiplier contains unity. Or, Multiplication, from a multiplicand and a multiplier given, finds a third number, called the produtt, which contains the multiplicand as often as the multiplier con¬ tains unity. Hence multiplication fupplies the place of many addi¬ tions ; for if the multiplicand be repeated or fet down as often as there are units in the multiplier, the fum of thefe, taken by addition, will be equal to the product by multiplication. Thus, 5X3 = 13=3+ 5 + 5. The firft and lowert rtep in multiplication is, to mul¬ tiply one digit by another ; and the fad or number thence arifing is called a Jingle produtt. This elementary rtep may be learned from the following table, commonly called Pythagoras's table of multiplication : which is con- Rdtedthus; feek one of the digits or numbers on the head, and the other on the left fide, and in the angle of meeting you have their produd. The learner, before he proceed further, ought to get the table by heart. To Pythagoras’s table are here added, on account of their ufefdlnefs, the produds of the numbers 10, II, 12.

The reafon why the 2 is fet under the multiplying figure, or in the place of tens, is, becaufe the -multiplying figure 6 is really 6 tens or 60, and 60 times 2 make 120; fo that by carrying the 1 to the next place, and fetting down 20, the o would fall into the place of units, and throw the 2 into the place of tens ; but as o can make no alteration in the addition of the par¬ tial products, the fetting of it down is fafely and juftly omitted.

If your multiplier confifts of integers and parts, the operation is performed by a crofs multiplication of the foveral parts of the multiplier into all the parts of the mul¬ tiplicand. The contents of mafon and, joiners work are frequent¬ ly cart up by this kind of multiplication; for underftand- ing of which obferve, that The fuperficial content of any reCtangle is found by multiplying the length into the breadth ; and the content of a right-angled triangle is found by multiplying the bafe into half the perpendicular or height. The dimenfions are ufually taken in lineal feet, inches, and lines ; and the operation is performed by the follow¬ ing rules. I. Any lineal meafure multiplied into the fame li¬ neal meafure produces fquares of that name. Thus, lineal feet multiplied into lineal feet produce fquare feet; lineal inches into lineal inches produce fquare inches, drc. II. Lineal feet into lineal inches produce rectangles 1 foot long and 1 inch broad, which divided by 12 quote fquare feet: and the remainder multiplied by 12, pro¬ duces fquare inches. III. Lineal feet into lineal lines produce rectangles 1 foot long and 1 line broad, which divided by 144 quote fquare feet; and the remainders are rectangles equal to fquare inches. IV. Lineal inches into lineal lines produce fmall rect¬ angles 1 inch long and 1 line broad, $hich divided by 12 quote fquare inches; and the remainder, multiplied ty 12, produces fquare Koes.

The anfwer here is 132434 fquare inches, and 108 fquare lines; and if the inches be divided by 144, you will have 919 fquare feet and a remainder of 98 fquare inches, as before* Or the faClors may be reduced to the lowefl denomi¬ nation, viz. lines, and then the produCt will be fquare lines, which, divided by 144, will quote fquare inches, and the remainder will be fquare lines; and the fquare inches, divided by 144, will quote fquare feet, and the remainder will be fquare inches. Again, the fquare feet, divided by 9, will quote fquare yards, and the re¬ mainder will be fquare feet; and the fquare yards, divi¬ ded by 36, will quote fquare roods, and the remainder will be fquare yards.

III. The Proof of Multiplication. Multiplication may be provedfeveral ways, viz. Here firft multiply r8 feet 6 inches into 2 feet 4 inches;, by multiplication, by divifion, and by carting out the 9’s\". as formerly, and the product is 43 feet 24 inches fuper- I. By-multiplication : Change the places of the fac- ficial ; which next multiply into 2 feet 3 inches li- tors; and make that the multiplier which before was the neal, thus, 43 fuperfieial feet into 2 lineal feet produce multiplicand; and if the \\vork be- right, you will have 86 folid feet, and 24 fuperficial incites into 3 lineal inches- the fame product as before; but this method is tedious., produce 72 folid inches, by Rule V.; then 43 fuperfi- 2.

Division difeovers how often one number is con¬ tained in another: or, Divifion, from two numbers given, finds a third, which contains unity as often as the one given number contains the other. The number to be_divided, or which contains the o- ther, is called the dividend ; the number by which we divide, or which is contained in the dividend, is called the divifor ; and the number found by divifion, or which exprefles how often the dividend contains the divifor, is called the quotient or quot. As multiplication fupplies the place of many additions, fo divifion, which is the reverfe of multiplication, ferves inftead of many fubtradions; as will thus ap¬ pear Suppofe it were required to divide 18 by 6, that is, to find how often 6 is contained in 18, the work by fubtradion will (land as in the margin: by which it appears, that 6 is contained 3 times in the number 18. But this, by divifion, may be found at one trial: thus, 17 35 35 (?) A : ^ 18 6 (°)* Set the divifor on the left of the dividend, leaving room on the right hand for the quotient, as in the margin •, and then fay. How often 6 in 18 ?

Here obferve, that riot only the laft remainder, but A R I T H is 35, in which the divifor 7 is contained 5 times. Now it is evident, that the fum of the partial quots, 125, is the total quot, or a number exprefling how often the di¬ vidend 87 J contains the divifor 7, are dividuals ; or the firft dividual, with the number of fublequent figures in the dividend, is equal to the num¬ ber of places or figures in the quotient. Hence likewife may be inferred, that no divifor is contained in any dividual oftener than 9 times ; for the dividual, excluding the right-hand figure, is always lefs than the divifor by 1 at leaft ; and if both be multiplied by 10, or have a cipher annexed to each of them, the product of the dividual will be lefs than the produd of the divifor by 10 at leaft ; but no right-hand figure can fupply this defed of 10; therefore the divifor is not contained 10 times in any dividual, and confequently not oftener than 9 times. Here too obferve, that the right-hand figure of the firft dividual, and all the fubfequent figures of the dividend, have a point or dot fet below them, as they are brought down ; which is done to prevent miftakes, by diftinguilh- is contained in the two left- ing them, in this manner, from the figures not yet brought hand figures of the dividend down. every other remainder, muft be lefs than the divifor ; for if it be either greater or equal, the divifor might have been oftener got, and the quotient-figure is too little. And ftiould any one in this cafe attempt to continue the operation, the quotient-figures would be all 9’s, the di¬ viduals would proye inexhauftible, and the remaindeis would conftantly increafe. Hence alfo learn, that if any dividual happen to be lefs than the divifor, you muft put o in the quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend;'and if it be ftill lefs than the divifor, you muft put another o in thfe quotient, and bring down the following figure of the di¬ vidend, <bc.

But here obferve, that if, in trying how often the divifor can be had in the dividual, either 9, or a number greater than 9, any where remain, you may conclude, •without further trial, that all the fubfequent figures of the divifor can be had as often as you took the firft; as may be thus demonftrated. Suppofe the fubfequent figures of the divifor to be the iiigheft poflible, that is, all 9’s, and the following fi¬ gures of the dividual the loweft poflible, that is, all o’s ; again, imagine the remainder 9 prefixed to the follow¬ ing figure of the dividual o, that it will make 90 ; now it is plain, that the fubfequent figure of the divifor 9 can be had in 90, the higheft number of times pofKble, viz. q times, and 9 will remain ; which prefixed to the next figure of the dividual o, makes 90, in which the fubfe¬ quent figure of the divifor 9 can again be had 9 times, and 9 will remain as before; therefore all the fubfequent figures of the divifor can be had as often as you took the firft ; ^and if they can be had in this cafe, much more can they be had when a number greater than 9 remains.

The reafon will appear obvious by working a queftion in this manner, and alfo at full length, without cutting off the cipher or ciphers, and then comparing the two operations. V. If, as in the margin, the 48|oo)978o|oo(203^f figures cut off from the right hand of the dividend, happen to be all ciphers; in this cafe, the laft remainder, without regard¬ ing the ciphers cut off, is the numerator of your fradhon, and the fignificant figutes of the di¬ vifor the denominator. The reafon is affigned in the dodtrine of fradtions. In like manner, if there be cut off from the dividend aBy number of fignificant figures, with a cipher or ci¬ phers on their right hand; in this cafe the laft remainder, with the fignificant figures cut off, make the numerator of your fradhon; and the fignificant figures of the di¬ vifor, with as many ciphers as the number of fignificant figures cut off from the dividend, make t$fe denomi¬ nator. Thus, if, in the above example, the figures cut off from the dividend had been 50, the numerator of your fradhon would have been 365, and the denominator 480. 96 180 144 \"( 3 6 ) Contractions in working Divijion of Integers. 1.

The Rule of Three, called alfo, on account of its excellence, the Golden Rule, from certain numbers gi¬ ven finds another ; and is divided into Ample and com¬ pound, or into (ingle and double. Sect. I. The Simple or Single Rule of Three. The fimple rule of three, from three numbers given, finds a fourth, to which the third bears the fame propor¬ tion as the firft does to the fecond. The nature and properties of proportional numbers may be underflood fufliciently for our purpofe from the following obfervations. In comparing any two numbers, with refpeift to the proportion which the one bears to the other, the drib number, or that which bears proportion, is called the antecedent; and the other, to which it bears proportion, is called the confquent; and the quantity of the propor¬ tion or ratio is eftimated from the quot arifing from divi¬ ding the antecedent by the confequent. Thus the ratio or proportion betwixt 6 and 3 is the quot arifing from dividing the antecedent 6 by the confequent 3 ; namely, 2; and the ratio or proportion betwixt 1 and 2 is the quot arifing from the divifion of the antecedent 1 by the confequent 2 ; namely i, or one half. Four numbers are faid to be proportional when the ratio of the firft to the fecond is the lame as that of the third to the fourth; and the proportional numbers are ufually diftinguifhed from one another as in the following examples. 4 : 2 :: 16 : 8 6 : 9 :: 12 : 18. Proportional numbers, Or numbers in proportion, are ufually denominated terms; of which the firft andlaft- are called extremes, and the intermediate ones get the name of means, or middle terms. If four numbers are proportional, they will alfo be inverfely proportional; that is, the firft confequent will be to its own antecedent as the fecond confequent is to its antecedent; or the fourth term will be to the third as the fecond is to the firft. Thus, if 6 : 3 :: 10 : 5, then by inverfion, 3 : 6 :: 5 : 10, or 5 : 10 :: 3 : 6. Euclid v. 4. cor. By either of thefe kinds of invexfioa may any- queftion in the rule of three be proved. If four numbers are proportional, they will alfo be al¬ ternately proportional j that is, the firft antecedent will 5 D be"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"3&2 A R I T H M be to the fecond antecedent as the firft confequent is to the fecond confequent; or the firft term will be to the third term as the fecond term is to the fourth. Thus, if 8 : a :: 24 : 12, then, by alternation, 8 : 24 :: 4 : 12. Euclid v. 16. But the celebrated property of four proportional num¬ bers is, that the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means. Thus, if 2 : 3 :: 6 : 9, then 2X9 = 3X6=18. Euclid Vi.' 16. Hence we have an eafy method of finding a fourth pro¬ portional to three numbers given, viz. Multiply the middle number by the laft, and divide the produdt by the firft, the quot gives the fourth propor¬ tional. Examp. Given 6, 5, and 36, to find a fourth pro¬ portional ; put x equal to the Fourth proportional, then 6 : 5 :: 36 : x, and 5 X 36 = 180 = 6 X x; where¬ fore, dividing the produdi 180 by the faiftor 6, the quot gives the other fatfor x, namely 30, the fourth propor¬ tional fought. Every queftion in the rule of three may be divided into two parts, viz. a fuppofition and a demand ; and of the three given numbers, two are always found in thd fup- pofition, and only one in the demand. Examp. If 4 yards coft 12 (hillings, what will 6 yards coft at that rate ? In this queftion the fuppofition is, If 4 yards coft 12 (hillings-, and the two terms contained in it are 4 yards and t2 (hillings : The demand lies in thefe words, What will 6 yards coft ? and the only term found in it is 6 yards. The fuppofition and demand being thus diftinguifhed, proceed to ftate the queftion, or to put the terms in due order for operation, as the following rules direct. Rule I. Place that term of the fuppofition, which is of the fame kind with the number fought, in the mid¬ dle. The twa remaining terms are extremes, and always of the fame kind. II. Confider, from the nature of the queftion, whether the anfw.er.muft be greater or lefs than the middle term; and if the anfwer muft be greater, the lead extreme is the divifor; but if the anfwer muft be lefs than the mid¬ dle term, the greateft extreme is the divifor. III. Place the divifor on the left hand, and the other extreme on the right; then multiply the fecond and third terms, and divide their produdt by the firft; and the quot gives the anfwer; which is always of the fame name with the middle term. When the divifor happens to be the extreme found in the fuppofition, the proportion is called dire£1; but when the divifor happens to be the extreme in the demand, the proportion is inverfe. The three'rules defivered above are indeed fo framed, as to preelude the diftirsftion of direft and inverfe, or tender it needkfsj. the left-hand term being always the divifor; but yet the direct queftions being plainer in their own nature, and more eafily comprehended by a learn¬ er, we (hall, in the-firft place, exemplify the rules by a fet of queftions of the direft kind, and (hall afterwards adduce an example or two of fuch as are inverfe. E T I C K. I. The Simple Rule of Three Dircft. Quest, i. If 4 yards coft 12 (hillings, what wilt 6 yards coft at that rate ? The fuppofition and demand of this queftion have al¬ ready been diftingui(hed, and the two terms in the former are 4 yards 12 (hillings, and th# only term in the latter is 6 yards. The number fought is the price of fix yards, and the term in the fuppofition of the fame kind is the price of 4 yards, viz. 12 (hillings, which place in the middle, as direfied in Rule I. and the two remaining terms are extremes, and of the fame kind, viz. both lengths. yds. :: 6 It is eafy to perceive Yds. s. that the anfwer muft be If 4 : 12 greater than the, middle 6 term; for 6 yards will coft — more than 4 yards ; there¬ 4 > 7 2 ( fore the lead extreme. 4 viz. 4 yards, is the divi¬ for, according to Rule II. 3 2 32 (”) Wherefore place the divifor 4 yards on the left hand, and the other extreme 6 yards on the right; and multi¬ plying the fecond and third terms, divide their produdt by the firft term, and the quot 18 is the anfwer, and of the fame name with the middle term, viz.

As we have no money under farthings, the Iaft re-- mainder cannot be reduced any lower; • fo there remains 10 farthings to be divided by 13; that is,‘there is want¬ ing to complete the quot, the thirteenth part of 10 far¬ things, or the thirteenth part of every remaining farthing; that is, ten thirteenth parts of one farthing; fo you let the remainder 10 aboye, and the divifor 13 below a line drawn between them, in the form of a fra&ion, of which the remainder is the numerator, and the divifor the de¬ nominator.

In this qaeftion the fuppofition is; If 8 men do a piece of work in 12 days, and the two terms contained in it are 8 men and 12 days: The demand lies in thefe words. In how many days will 16 men do the fame-? and the only term contained in it is 16 nren; The number fought here is the days in which 16 men will'do the work, and the term in the fuppofition of the lame kind is 12 days; wherefore I place 12 days as the middle term, according to Rule I. the two remaining terms are extremes, and of the fame kind, viz. both oP them men. It is obvious that the an- Men. days. men. fwer muft be lefs than the mid- 16 : 12 : : 8 die term; for 16 men will do 8 the work in fewer days than 8 — men; and therefore, by Rule 16)96(6 days.

Then multiplying the fecond and- third, and dividing their produdt by the firft, the quot comes out in days; that is, of the fame name with the- middle term.

If five terms be given, three of thefe are always found in the fuppofition, and two in the demand; if feven • terms be given; four of thefe are in the fuppofition* and three in the demand; if nine terms are given, five of thefe are in the fuppofition, and four in the demand; if eleven terms be given, fix of thefe are in the fuppofition, and five in the demand, dsc. The fuppofition and demand being diftinguilhed, pro¬ ceed to ftate the queftion; that-is,- to- put the terms in due order for operation, as the following rules diredt. Rule I.

Now, though the three rules de¬ livered above make^no difference betwixt direct and in¬ verfe ; yet, to bring the learner to fome meafure of ac¬ quaintance with this ufeful diftindion, we Ihajl, in dating the following queftions, expofe the fame to view, by af¬ fixing an afterilk to the extremes of every inverfe pro¬ portion. ^uejl. If 14 horfes eat 56 buihels of corn in 16 days, in how many days will 20 horfes eat 120 buihels at that rate ? In this queftion the fuppofition is, that 14 horfes eat 56 buihels in 16 daysj and the demand is, In how many days 20 horfes will eat 120 buihels. The number fought is days, and the term in the fup¬ pofition of the fame kind is 16 days; and accordingly place 16 days in the middle. The remaining four terms are extremes; which clafs into fimilar pairs, by ma¬ king each pair confift of one term taken from the fuppo fition, and another of the fame kind taken from the de mand. Thus, 14 horfes and 20 horfes make one-pair again, 56 buihels and 120 buihels make another pair. Out of the fimilar pairs, joined with the middle term form fo many fimple queftions; namely, 1. If 14 horfes eat a certain number of buihels in 16 days, in how many days will 20 horfes eat the fame quantity ? 2. If 56 buihels are eat up in 16 days, in how many days will 120 buihels be eat up by the fame eaters ? In the firfl fimple queftion it is plain, that the anfwer muft be lefs than the middle term; for 20 horfes will ,eat the fame number of buihels in fewer days than 14 horfes ; and fo the greateft extreme, viz. 20, is the di- vifor; and becaufe 20 is an extreme found in the de¬ mand, the proportion is inverfe. In the fecond fimple queftion it is alfo obvious, that the anfwer muft be greater than the middle term ; for 120 buihels will require more days to be eat up in than 56 buihels ; and therefore the leaf! extreme, viz 56, is the divifor; and becaufe 56 is an extreme found in the fup- pofit ; o n, the proportion is direft.

For the firlt term, or divifor, is to be con- fidered as one compound term made up, or produced, by the continual multiplication of the extremes on the left hand, as fo many component parts. In like manner, the third term is to be confidered as one compound term, made up by the continual multiplication of the extremes; on the right, as component parts. Suppofe the queftion to be. If L. 100 in 12 months gain L. 5 intcreft, what will L. 75 gain in 19 months ? Here it is obvious, that it is neither the L. 100 prin¬ cipal, nor the 12 months of time, taken feparately, that gains the L. 5 intereft, but both contribute their fhare ; that is, they confpire, as joint caufes, to produce one effeit; and therefore their product, viz. the firft term, is to be confidered as the caufe producing the effect; that is, the firft term, viz. 100 X 12, caufeth, produ- ceth, or gains L. 5 of intereft.

A Fraction is a part or parts of an unit, or of any integer or whole; and is exprefled by two numbers, one above and the , other below a line drawn between them ; as, ' The number under the line fnews into how many parts the unit or integer is divided; and is called the denominator , becaufe it gives name to the fraction : The number above the line (hews or tells how many of thefe parts the.fra&ion contains.; and is therefore called the numerator . In the fradion ^ 1 . a pound Sterling is the unit, in¬ teger, or wholeand the denominator 4 (hews that the- pound is broken or divided into four equal parts, viz. - 4.crowns; and the numerator 3 (hews that the fradion contains three of thefe parts, that is, three crowns ; and . fo the value of this fraction is fifteen (hillings; Cor. 1. Hence it follows, 1. When .the numera¬ tor of a fradron is lei's than the denominator, the va¬ lue of fuch a fraction is lefs than unity, or the integer,., 2. When ihe numerator is equal to the denominator, the value of the fradion.is exadly an unit or integer. 3. When the numerator is. greater than the denominator, the value of the fradion is more than an unit; and fo often as the denominator is contained in the numerator, do many units or wholes are contained in the fraction. If, therefore the numerator of a fraction be divided by the denomina- ■ tor, the quot will be a number of units or integers, and the remainder fo many parts. The numerator of a fraction is to be confidered as a 420, firft term; dividend, and the denominator as a divifor; and the fradion itfelf may be taken to denote the quotient. :: 120 I.

A mixt number confifts of an integer, and a frac¬ tion joined with it; as 74. Becaufe in molt cafes fradtions can neither be added nor fubtradted, till they be reduced, we begin with re- dudtion. Redufiion of Vulgar Frad ions. Problem I. To reduce an improper fradtion to an integer, or mixt number. Rule. Divide the numerator by the denominator, the quot gives integers ; and the remainder, if there be any, placed over the divifor or denominator, gives the fradtion to be annexed. Examples. 1. *4 s =85 integers, there being no remainder. 2. 544. the remainder being 5. 3. - i 4 -| 1 = 98t 4, the remainder being 10. 4 . 173 4 y 8 <r> the remainder being 48. Prob. II. To reduce a mixt number to an improper fradtion. Rule. Multiply the integer by the denominator; to the produdt add the numerator: The fum is the nume¬ rator of the improper fradtion; and the denominator is the fame as before. Examples. i- S4x = 4 i 7 i for 54 X 8 = 432 + 5 Numerator 437 2. 9845= HI* 5 for 98 X 14= 1372 + 10 Numerator 1382 Pros. III. To reduce a whole number to a fradtion of a given denominator. Rule. Multiply the whole number by the given de¬ nominator; and place the produdt by way of numerator over the given denominator. Examples. 1. Reduce 9 to a fradtion whofe denomination is 5. 9X 5 = 45 ; fo the fradtion is . 2. Reduce 36 to a fradtion whofe denominator is 4. 36 X 4 = 144 ; fo the fradtion is l 4 - 4 . 3. Reduce 8 to a fradtion whofe denominator is 1. 8X1=8; fo the fradtion is E T I C K. The reafon of the rule appears by reverfing the ope¬ ration ; for if the numerator be divided by the denomi¬ nator, it will quot the integer, or whole number. Prob. IV. To reduce a compound fradtion to a fim¬ ple one. Rule. Multiply the numerators continually for the numerator of the fimple fradtion ; and multiply the deno¬ minators continually for its denominator. Example s. Ex. I. y of y = ly-. Ex. 2. y of y of y = yy» Cor. From this problem may be deduced a method of reducing a fradtion of a leffer denomination to a frac¬ tion of a greater denomination ; namely, Form a compound fradtion, by comparing the given fradtion with the fuperior denominations ; and then re¬ duce the compound fradtion to a fimple one. Examples. 1. What fradtion of a pound Sterling is 4 of a penny? 4 d. is \\ of y'y of -5% L^= L. 2. What fradtion of a C. is 4 of a pound ? ■ ylb. is y of yy of y C. = yyyC. Prob. V. To reduce a fradtion of a greater denomi¬ nation to a fradtion of a leffer denomination. Rule. Multiply the numerator of the given fradtion, as in reduction of integers defcending ; and the produdt is the numerator, to be placed over the denominator of the given fradtion. Exam p l e s. 1. What fradtion of a Ihilling is 4 of a pound? Here, as in redudtion defcending, multiply the nu¬ merator 3 by 20, becaufe 20 /hillings make a pound; as under. L. MUng. 4 2. Wbat fradtion of a penny is -f L. ? 4X20X 12 _ 9 5 0 d 5 5 The reafon of this rule will appear by obferving, that every fradtion may be confidered in two views. Thus, 4 may either be confidered as exprelfing three fourths of one unit, or as denoting the fourth part of three units. Now, if the unit be a pound Sterling, the fradtion, in the latter view, will denote the fourth part of three pounds; and by reducing the numerator L. 3 to /hil¬ lings, we have s ; and again reducing 60 /hillings to pence, we have 7 y° d. equal to s. or to -JL. Prob. VI. To find the value of a fradtion. Rule. Reduce the numerator to the next inferior denomination ; divide by the denominator; and the quot, if nothing remain, is the value complete. If there be any remainder, it is the numerator of a fradtion whofe denominator is the divifor. T his frac¬ tion may either be annexed to the quotient, or reduced to value, if there be any lower denomination. Examp. '"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"3 s 9 arithmetics:. Examp.

Reduce 4 and 4 to a common denominator. 4X5=20, the common denominator.. 3X5=15, the firft numerator. 4X4=16, the fecond numerator. So the Dew fractions are and When the denominator of one fraction happens to be an aliquot part of the denominator of another fraction, the former may be reduced to the fame denominator with the latter, by multiplying both its numerator and denominator by the number which denotes how often the lefler denominator is contained in the greater. Thus, -f + Ar = A + A. Here 3 is Contained in 12 four times; fo multiply both 2 and 3 by 4, and you have T \" T = 4 - ■ Again, 4 + 4 + * = t+.I + ®* Sometimes too, the fraction that has the greater de¬ nominator may, iu like manner, be reduced to the fame denominator with that which has the lefler, by divillon.

The reafon of the above rule for reducing fractions to a common denominator is evident from Corollary II.; \\ for both numerator and denominator of every fraction are multiplied by the fame number, or by the fame num¬ bers. After fractions are reduced to a common denominator, they may frequently be reduced to lower terms, by di¬ viding all the numerators, and alfo the common denomi¬ nator, by any diVifor that leaves no remainder, or by cutting off an equal number of ciphers from both.

If it be required to fubtradt a mixt num¬ ber, or a fradtion, from an integer, Arft fubtradt the fraction from an unit borrowed ; that is, fubtradt the nu¬ merator from the denominator, and place the remainder, as a numerator, over tfie denominator, for the fradtional part of the anfwer: Then, for the unit borrowed, add 1 to the integral part of the mixt number; fubtradt the fum from the given integer; and prefix the remainder to the fradtional part of the anfwer. But when a fradtion is fubtradted from an integer, for the unit borrowed, take 1 from the given integer,- and prefix the. remainder to the fradtional part of the anfwer. Ex. 1. From 14 fubtradt y£. Here fay, 5 — 3=2; fo £ ■ is the fradtional part of the anfwer : Then fay, 1 borrowed and 7 make 8, and 8 fubtradted from 14 leaves 6; winch prefix to the frac¬ tional part : So the difference or anfwer is 6 £. Ex. 2. From 12 fubtradt Here fay, 7 — 3;= 4; lo 4 > s the fradtional part; then fay, 1 borrowed from 12, and 11 remains : So u 4 is the differepce, or anfwer. Note , When an integer is given to be fubtradted from a mixt number, you have only to fubtradt the given in¬ teger from the integral part of the mixt number ; ancl to the remainder annex the fradtional part.

In multiplication of fractions there is no occafion to re¬ duce the given fradtions to a common denominator, as in addition and fubtradtipn: only} if a mixt number be given, reduce it to an improper fradtion •, if an integer be given, reduce it to an improper fradtion, by putting an unit for its denominator; if a compound fradtion be given, you may either reduce k to a fimple one, or, in- ftead of the particle of infert the lign of multiplication then work by the following Rule. Multiply the numerators for the numerator of the produdt, and multiply the denominators for its. de¬ nominator. Examp-. 1. 2. 4 * y T = i x V Note 1. If any number be multiplied by a proper frac¬ tion, the produdt will be lefs than the multiplicand; for multiplication is the taking of the multiplicand, as often as the multiplier contains unity; and confequently, if the multiplier be greater than unity, the produdt will be greater than the multiplicand; if the multiplier be unity, the produdt will, be equal to the multiplicand; and if the multiplier be lefs than unity, the produdt will, in the fame prbportion, be lefs than the multiplicand. Thus, fuppbfing the multiplier to be -*• or the produdt, in this cafe, will be equal to one half or to one third of the multiplicand. , 2. Mixt numbers may be multiplied without reducing them to improper fradtions, by work- 2 ^ T ingas .in the margin ; where, firft multiply the . integral parts, viz. 54 by 24; then multiply. 2 * the integral parts crofs-ways into their altern 10 ° fradtions, viz. -54 by and the produdt 27 let 2 J down; in like manner multiply 24 by-I, and 6 the produdt 6 likewife fet down ; then add ; and ' ' to the fum annex l, the produdt of the two i 3 2 9 t fradtions. 3. In'multiplying a fradtion, by an integer, you have only to multiply the numerator by the integer, the put¬ ting one for the denominator being' only matter of form. And to multiply a fradtion by its denominator is to take away the denominator, the produdt being an integer, the fame with, or equal to the numerator. Thus, 7X8=7. For |x|=V= 7 * ' 4. If the-numerators and denominators of two equal fradtions be multiplied crofs-ways,. the produdts will be equal. Thus, if ^= T \\, then will 3 X 1 2 = 9X4 ; for multiplying both by 9, we have 3=—^; and multi¬ plying thefe by 12, we have 3 X 12 “9-X 4. Hence, if four numbers be proportional, the produdt of the ex¬ tremes wilLbe equal to the produdt of- the means : for if . M E T I C Kr. 391- 3 : 9 : : 4:12, then an d it has been proved, . that 3 X 12=9X4. Therefore if, of four proportional numbers, any three be given, the fourth may eafily be found, viz. when one of the extremes is fought, divide the produdt of the means by the given extreme; and when one of the means is fought, divide the produdt of the extremes by the given mean. 5. In multiplying fradtions, equal fadtors above and below may be dalhed or dropt. Thus, 4 of of •£=; 4-X|X|X4; and dropping the fadtors 2, 3, 4, both above and below, the produdt is -f. In like man¬ ner, to facilitate an operation, a fadtor above and ano¬ ther below may be divided by the fame number : Thus, 4 Xt s x =4 X£=~~ = T V Or we may exchange one- 7x2 numerator for another : Thus, % X =-nr X 4 = i X 4 . 6. To take any part of a given number, is to mul¬ tiply the faid number by the fradtion. Thus, 4. of 32a is found thus, {X 1 t- 0 = 4 -X J -g-° = 4X V=- L 7° =200. In like manner, 4 of 45-f, is -fX 45 -§- = :: t X - f 1 = -| X i j- J -=^X~p = L *— =30^. Hence, to reduce a- compound fradtion to a fimple one, is to multiply the parts of it into one another. 7. If a multiplicand of two or lhore denominations be given to be multiplied by a fradtion, reduce the higher part or parts of the multiplicand to the loweft fpecies, and then multiply. Thus, to multiply 8 1 . io|s. by 4, fay, 81 ^ = 8 X 20 s »=i 6 os. and i6o+io|=i7o£s. = -*-’» and 4-X < I -p= i -iv-=ii3TTS-=L. 5: 13 : 10.

In divifion of fradtions, if a mixt number be given, . reduce it to an improper fradtion; if an integer, be given, put an unit for its denominator; if a compound fradtion be given, reduce it. to a fimple one, and then work by the following Rule. Multiply crofs-ways,- viz. the numerator of the divifor into the denominator of the dividend, for the denominator of the quot; and the denominator of th (5 divifor into the numerator of the dividend, for the nu¬ merator of the quot.

Thus, fuppofing the divifor to be -£, or -J-, the quot in this cafe will be double or triple of the dividend. 3. To divide a fradlion by an integer,' is only to mul¬ tiply the integer into the denominator of the fradlion, the numerator being continued. Thus, 7)!(^V» 4. A mixt number may fometimes be divided by an integer, with more eafe, in the following manner. Di¬ vide the integral pa:t of the mixt number by the given integer: and if there be no remainder, divide likewife the fradlion of the mixt number by the given integer, and annex the quot to the integral quot formerly found. But if, in dividing the integral part, there happen to be a remainder, prefix this remainder to the fradlion for a new mixt number; which reduce to an improper frac¬ tion : then divide the improper fradlion by the given in¬ teger, and annex the quot to the integral quot formerly found. Thus, if it be required to divide 15! by 8, fay, 8) ij(i, and 7 remains; which 7, prefixed to the fradlion, gives 7! for a new mixt number; and this, re¬ duced to an improper fradlion, is y, and 8) y : fo the complete quot is y. If the fadlors of the numerator and denominator of the quots, inftead of being adtually multiplied, be only connedled with the fign of multiplication, it will be eafy to drop fuch fadlors, above and below, as happen to be the fame, thus: $)$ of =y. Or a fadtor above and below may be divided by the fame number thus : = T ^. Or the fadlors of the numerator of the quot may be ex- changed, thus, 6. To divide an integer by a fradlion, is to divide the produdl of the denominator and integer by the numerator, thus: t)8(=|—=5X2 = 10. 7.

Rules of Practice. When the firft term of aqueftion in the rule of three happens to be unity, the anfwer may frequently be found more fpeedily and eafily than by a formal ftating or work¬ ing of the rule of three ; a»d the directions to be obfer- ved in fuch operations are called Rules' of Pratticc . The rules of practice naturally follow the doCtrine of vulgar fractions, the operation being nothing elfe but a multiplying the number whofe price is required, by fuch' a fraction of a pound, of a /hilling, or- of a penny, as denotes the rate or price of one. Thus, if the price of 24 yards, at 6 $. 8 d. per yard, be demanded, the anfwer is found by multiplying 24 by ■ f, the fraction of a pound equivalent to 6s. 8d. viz. V 4 X -f=V=c 81 . Hfence, it 19 obvious, that to multiply a number by a fraction whofe numerator is unity, is to divide the faid number by' t he denominator of the fraction. But if the numerator of the fraction be not unity, you mult firft multiply the given number by the numerator, and then divide- the produCt by the denominator. Thus, if the rate be 13 s. 4 d.=|l. the price of 24 yards is found by. faying, j or take 4-of the given num¬ ber twice. When the fraction denoting the rate happens to be compound, the produCt or anfwer is found by dividing the given number by one of the denominators of the compound fraction, the quot by another, and the next quot by the third, <&c. Thus, if the rate be 2 far¬ things^ of ijV of -^l. the price of 1440 yards is found.by faying, and ’’ J % 0 —6o, and f§=3\"l. When the rate is exprefled by two or more fimple fractions, connected with the fign +, the produCt or an¬ fwer is found by dividing' the given number fucce/lively by the feveral denominators, and then adding the quot. Thus, if the rate be 3 the price of 80 yards is found by faying, -J-§ — 3 , and i>°— 4-> and 8+4= 12 1 . ’ The fractions equivalent to any-fiumber of farthings under 4, to any number of pence under 12, -and. to any number of /hillings under 20, are exhibited, in the fol¬ lowing tables.

The variety that occurs in the rules of practice arifes chiefly from the different rates, or prices, of one thing, as a yard, a pound, an ounce, &c. and may be reduced to the eight cafes following, viz.

The reafon of multiplying by half the num¬ ber of (hillings in the rate will appear by confidering, that thefe are the numerators of the fradions denoting the rate. Thus, 2 s. is x ^l. and 4 s, is ^ 1 . and 6 s. is 1. and each unit in the produd is two (hillings. The divifion by the denominator 10 is performed by cut¬ ting off the right-hand figure of the produd, and the fi¬ gure fo cut off is the remainder ; and as each unit in the remainder is two (hillings, the double of them is the re¬ mainder in (hillings. Note 2. From Ex. 1. we may learn, that when the rate is 2 s. the price is found by doubling the right hand figure of the given number for (hillings, and the other fi¬ gure or figures are pounds. Note 3. In Ex. 2. the price may alfo be had by ta¬ king j- of the given number ; and in this way every re¬ mainder will be 4 s. Note 4.

We may conceive the denominator of a decimal ffadtion to be formed by dividing the unit into 10 equal parts, and each of thefe parts into 10 other equal parts, each of thefe again into 10 other equal parts, and fo on, as far as neceffary ; and hence a decimal fradHon will always be fo many tenths, or fo many tenths of or fo many tenths of of &c .; and by reducing the compound fradHon to a fimple one, we have the decimal. Thus, -A of Ar of tV = tAw."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"39 5 _ A R I T H M Or we may candeive the denominator of a decimal to be- f ormed by the continual multiplication-of unity into 10, as often as there are ciphers in it. Thus, i X io-=5-tO; and iXioXio — t o o, and rX ioX iaX to = iooo, fee. Andb’ecaufe the fraftions -rs> fee. have the- .higheft numerators poffible, it is plain, that the numher of figures or places;in the numerator-of a decimal can never exceed the number of ciphers in. the denominator. It-\"is ufual to write down only the numerator of a de- eimtd- fradhon, omitting the denominator ; and when the numerator has the lame number of figures or places as the denominator has ciphers, it is done by writing dbVn the figures of the-numerator, and prefixing a point, to diftinguiffi them from a whole number. So is writ¬ ten thus, .7 ; and 7^ is written thus, .25. The point fhus prefixed is-called the decimal point. But when the numerator has-not fo many figures- or places £s there are ciphers in the denominator, the de¬ feat is fupplied by prefixing a cipher for ev-ery: figure wasting, and then placing the decimal point on the left. So -rtrs- is written thus, .03 ; and T a Vgg thus, .0075 ; and -T55OT tlius » -oooj.. From this manner of notation, it is eafy to read a decimal, or. to know its denominator,, viz. imagine 1 to (land under the decimal point, and a cipher under every decimal place. Thus, .9 is T ® , and .48 is T ^, and .05 is -,W> >00 7 is aD <* *00036 is 1 Hence it is plain, that decimals, like integers, de- creafe from, the left to the right, and increafe from the' right to the left, ip a decuple proportion. On the con¬ trary, any decimal figure, by being removed one place, toward the left, becomes ten times greater. An integer, by annexing ciphers, is raifed to higher places op the left, and may by this means have its value increafed to infinity. On the other hand, a decimal, by prefixing ciphers, is depreffed to lower places on the right, and may by this means have its value diminifhed to infinity. Ciphers annexed to decimals do not change the va¬ lue of the- decimals. Thus, *50=5, and .500=5, for .50= rr!§ = TtJ ~ * 5 > an ^ t 4 | ° § = -t5= * 5 * ' Decimals may be refolved into conftituent parts, and the parts may be read, leparately, thus, -847 = 8 + .'04 + .007 + t^o* In decimals the figure next the point, being the firft decimal place, is fometimes called primes , and the fe- cond figure from the point is called feconds, the next thirds, &c. Thus, in .875 the figure 8 is primes, 7 is feconds, and 5 is thirds. From this brief account of the nature of decimals, it follows, that the manner of operation in decimals will be the fame as in whole numbers ; and alfo, that the-fame number may be differently expreffed, accor¬ ding as the integer is chofen. Thus, the time fince our Saviour’s birth may be written thus, 1769; or thus, 176.9; or thus, 17.69; orthus, 1.769; orthus, .1769, according as one year, a decad, a century, a chiliad, or myriad, is ufed as the integer. Hence arifes the feperior excellency of decimal arithmetic, above every : e~ t r c k. Other fort of numerical computation; as will appear in the fequel. II. Reduftioti of Decimals. Prob. I. To, reduce a vulgar fra&ion to a decimal. Rule. To the numerator of the vulgar fraftion affix a point or comma, then annex a competent number of ciphers, and divide by the denominator; the quotas the numerator of the decimal, and the cyphers annexed fhow the number of decimal places. Examp. I. Reduce to a decimal ? Here to. the numerator 1 annex one cipher, 2)1.o(.5 and dividing by the denominator 2, the quot 1 o is 5, and o remains; and becaufe a fingle ci- — pher only was annexed to the numerator, the (o) decimal numerator will confift but of one fi¬ gure, namely 5 ; to which, therefore, prefix the deci¬ mal point. So v=*J. Hence appears the reafon of the rule ; namely, 2 : I :: 10 : 5; that is, as the vulgar denominator to the vulgar numerator, fo is the decimal denominator to the decimal numerator. Examp. II. Reduce £ to a decimal. To the numerator 3, annex two ciphers; 4)3.oo(.7y and, dividing by the denominator, the quot 28 gives 75 for the numerator of the decimalj. -- - two ciphers having been annexed. So 20 |=. 7 5 * 20 Though ciphers may be annexed at pleafure, yet it is the ciphers ufed that determine the number, of de¬ cimal places in the quot; and at firfl it is fufficienti to annex fo many as ferve to complete the firft dividial, tearing -room to annex more as you proceed in the ope¬ ration ; or rather annex the other ciphers to the remain*, ders, without giving them a place in the dividend. The firft dividual alfo ffiows whether ciphers ought to be prefixed to the quot, and how many. Thus, if the firft dividual take in only one of the annexed ci¬ phers, the figure put in the quot is primes, and no ci-. pher to be prefixed. If the firft dividual comprehend two of the annexed ciphers, the figure put in the quot is feconds, and one cipher muft he prefixed. If the. firft dividual comprehend three of the annexed ciphers,; the figure p.ut in the quot is thirds, and two cipher? muft be prefixed, fee. Hence,. in reducing a vulgar, frac¬ tion to a decimal, the natural and eafy way is, ta place firft the decimal point in the quot, and after it a cipher or ciphers, or the quotientr.figure, as the firft dividual directs. In reducing a vulgar fraction to a decimal, if o at laft remains, as in all the above examples, the'decimal is precifely equal to the vulgar fraction, and is called 2. fi¬ nite or terminate decimal. In finite decimals, the denominator- is always fome a- liquot part of the numerator increafed by annexing ci¬ phers; and fuch • decimals take their rife from vulgar- fractions whofe denominator is 2 or 5, or fome power of 2 ox"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"ARIT'HMETIGK. 397 2 or 5, or the produdl of fome of their powers.

Thus, 2* fignifies the fecond power of and y 3 fignifies the third power of 5 ; and io 4 fignifies the fourth power of 10, &c. The index of the root or firft power is feldom exprefled. Any power of 2 multiplied into the like power of 5 gives a produdl equal to the fame power of 10; as ap¬ pears from the following fpecimen of the powers of 2, y, and 10. 2 1 = 2 5 , = 5 2 X y 2 l = 4 y 2 = 2 s 4 X 2 y : 2 3 — 8 y 3 = i 2 y 8 X i 2 y : 2 4 = 16 y 4 = 62 y 16 X 62 y : 2 f = 32 S s = 3 i 2 y 32 X 3 I 2 y : 2 ® = 64 y«=iy 6 2 y 6 4 X i y 6 2 y ; 2 7 = I 2 8 y 7 = 78 i 2 y i 2 8 X 7 8 i 2 y fee. ire. 10 100 1000 10000 100000 : 1000006 IOOOOOOO The produdl of two different powers of 2 and y, is e- qual.to the product that will arife by railing 10 to the power denoted by the lefler given index, and then multi¬ plying this power of 10 into that power of the other num¬ ber which is denoted by the difference of the two given exponents. Thus, 2 < s X y , = 6 4X2y=io*X2 4 = iooX 16 = 1600 2* Xy s = 4 X iy62y = io*Xy 4 = iooX62y=62yoo From thefe remarks it is eafy to perceive, that 2 or y, or any of their powers, or produdl of their powers, will meafure 10 or its powers, viz. 100, 1000, &c. or their multiples, fuch as, 20, 200, 2000, <bc. 30, 300, 3000, fee .; and fuch every numerator becomes by having ciphers annexed ; and therefore 2 or y, or their powers, or produdl of their powers, ufed as a de¬ nominator, will divide' any numerator with a competent number of ciphers annexed, and leave no remainder ; and confequently the decimal thence refulting will be finite. If the numerator of the vulgar fradtion be unity, and the denominator any Angle power of 2 or y, there will be as many decimal places in the quot as there are units in the index of the given power. Thus, i6 = 2 4 gives a decimal of four places, viz. - r , ^ = *o62y; and, i2y = y 3 gives a decimal of three places, viz. x ^t=.oo8. When the denominator is the produdl of like powers of 2 and y ; in this cafe,, fuch a produdl being equal to the like power of 10, and any power of 10 being equal to 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there are units in the index, it follows, that there will flill be as many de¬ cimal places in the quot as there are units in the index, either of 2, of y, or 10. Thus, 8 X i2y = 2 3 X y 3 =io 3 =iooo, gives a decimal of three places, viz. 'YSc'S — .OOI. When the denominator is the produdl of different powers of 2 or y, find what power of 10, and what power of 2 or y, upon being multiplied, will give the lame produdl, as is taught above ; and the fum of the indices' fhews the number of decimal places ; thus, Vol. I. No. 17. 2 6 X | ‘ = io* X2 4 ; and the fum of the indices, 2+4 = 6, gives the number of decimal places, viz. T - 6 * 0 - 5 = .00062 y. And, in general, to find what number of decimal places any fuch vulgar fradtion will give, divide the de¬ nominator by 2, y, or 10, till the laft quotient be 1, and the remainder o; and the number of divifors fhews the number of decimal places.

If the denominator of a vulgar fradlion be neither 2 nor y, nor any of their powers, nor produdl of their powers, fuch a denominator wdll not divide the nume¬ rator with annexed ciphers without a remainder; and the decimal thence refulting is called infinite , or inter- ruinate. Of infinite or interminate decimals, there are two forts. For fome conftantly repeat the fame figure; and are called repeating decimals , repeaters , or fmgle repe- tends. Others repeat a circle of figures ; and on that account are called circulating decimals , circulates , or compound repetends. Examp. III. Reduce f to a decimal.

Pure repeaters take their rife from vulgar fractions whofe denominator is 3, or its multiple 9; and are but few in number. Mixt repeaters derive their origin from vulgar frac¬ tions whole denominator is the produdl of 3 into 2 or y, or into fome of their powers, or produdl of their powers ; and fuch denominators may be confidered as the produdl of two component parts, whereof one is 2 or y, or fome of their powers, or produdl of their powers ; and hence the finite part. The other component part is 3 ; and hence the repeating figure. Examp. IV. Reduce to a dedrnaJ.

And, univerfally, to find the number of places in the finite part of fuch fractions, divide the denominator firft by 3, and then divide the quot by 2, 5, or 10, till the laft quot be 1 , and & remain ; and the number of divi¬ sors, excluding 3, Avows the number of places in the fi¬ nite part. Repeating decimals are ufually marked by a daft through the right-hand figure, as in the examples a* bove ; But fome chufe to mark them by a point let over the repeating figure, thus, .3, .26. The remainder where the repetition begins is commonly marked with an afterilk. Becaufe arty quotient multiplied by the divifor repro¬ duces the dividend, it follows, that any decimal multi¬ plied by the denominator of the vulgar fraftiort from which it refuhed, will reproduce the numerator with the annexed ciphers. Thus, if .7;, the decimal of be multiplied by 4, it will reproduce the numerator 3 and the two annexed ciphers. Now, fuppofe the given decimal to be a repeater ; fach as .3-, refulting from the vulgar fraftion if the tepeating decimal be multiplied by the denominator 3, it will, by carrying at 9 .on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 1 with the annexed cipher. In like man¬ ner, if the repeater ,& — y, be multiplied by 3, it will, ty carfying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the nu¬ merator 2 with the annexed cipher- Again, if the repeater .?=%, be multiplied by the denominator 9, it will, by carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numera¬ tor 1 with the annexed cipher. And, if the mixt re¬ peater .20 ==-/*-, be multiplied by the denominator 15, it will, by Carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 4 with th.e two annexed ciphers. From thefe remarks we may conclude, that the right- hand figure of every repeating decimal is ninth-parts: and the fame truth may be evinced by refolving the de¬ cimal into its conftituent parts, in the following manner. The vulgar fraction reduced to a decimal gives 4/7, 6 c .; and this repeater refolved into decimal confti- tuetit parts, becomes -fo + v5<y + T5Uo» 6 c. to infinity. But if we elteem the right-hand figure to be ninth-parts, we have of ■ rff7^TU+-sTJ = |4w + -jrff > o = the given vulgar fraftion. And as the vulgar fraftion gives 7, fo $ gives .99; that is, $9 = | = 1. And; univerfally, a feries of nines infinitely continued is equal to unity in the place on the left hand; thus, ,$99=: If the denomin.itor of a vulgar fraftiort hr neither 2 nor 5, ftor any power of 2 or 5, nor any produft of their powers ; nor 3, nor 9, nor any prodrtft '6f 3 into 2 or 5, or into fome of their powers, or product of their powers, the decimal fefolting from fuch i vulgar fraftiort will circulate. Circulates, like repeaters, are of two forts,- viz. pure and mix't. A pure circulate confifts jof the figures -of the circle only; as .09, 09, 6 c. or 18, 18, 6 c* A mixt circulate has a finite part betwixt the decimal point and the figure that begins the circle; as .0, 4;, 4;, 6 c .; or .32, 142857, 143857, 6 c. Some chufe to diftinguift the finite part from the circle, and one circle from another, by a comma, as above. Others daft the firft and Iafl figure of the circle. It is JiheWife uftial to mark the remainder where the new circle begins, by af¬ fixing sin allerift. Examf. V. Reduce T V to a decimal.

Thus, 3X9 . , - 7 X 9 . As the denominator 11, whereof 90 is a multiple, gives a pure circulate of two places, fo any denomina¬ tor, whereof 999, or 9999, or 99999, 6 c. are multi¬ ples, will give a pure circulate of three, four, five, 6 c, places; that is, of as many places as there are 9’s in ‘the multiple. And fuch denominators are all the prime numbers, except 2, 3, and 5, viz. 7, it, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31,, 37, 41, 6 c .; alfo their produfts into 3, viz. 21, 33, 39, ft, 57, 69, 6 c. Such too are all the powers of 3, except 3 and 9, viz. 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6 c. The reafen is plain : for if any divifor, as 37, divide 999, without a remainder, it will alfo divide 1000, and leave a remainder of 1, to begin a new circle. To find how many places the circle will confid cf, divide a competent number of 9’s by any of the ahove denominators,, continuing the operation till o remain ; and the number of 9’s ufed will ftow the number of places.

Univerfally, any vulgar fruition being given, we may determine whether the decimal thence 1 fibbing will be finite or infinite; and if infinite, whether pure or mixt; with the qumber of places, £ic. in the’ following manner. Reduce the given vulgar fraction to its lowed terms, then divide the denominator by jo, 5, cr 2, as often as pofftble; and if the lad quot be unity, without any re¬ mainder, the decimal is finite, amd the number of divi- fors fhews the number of decimal places. If the lad quot be 3, or any power of 3, the refulting decimal will be a mixt repeater, the number of whofe fi¬ nite places will be cqoal to the number of divifors. If the lad quot cannot be divided by 2, 5, 10, or 3, the refulting decimal will be a mixt circulate; and the way of finding the number of places, both in the finite part and circle, is taught above. If the denominator of the given vulgar fraction can be divided, neither by 2, 5, nor 10, the refulting deci¬ mal will be a pure repeater, or a pure circulate, accor¬ ding as the denominator is 3 or 9, or fome of the prime numbers, 7, ir, 13, &c . ; as has been already explained. Every vulgar frafticn may be reduced to a decimal, finite or inftntte; that is, to a finite decimal, to- a re¬ peater, or a circulate. For if the denominator divide the numerator with ciphers annexed, fo as to leave no remainder, the refulting decimal is finite. If the re¬ maining figure be always the fame, the refulting decimal will be a repeater. If neither of tbefe be the cafe, yet, becaufe die divifor is a finite number, the remainder at laft mull either be the fame with the numerator of the vulgar fraction, or the lame with fonae preceding remain¬ der, and then a new circle begins; and confequently the refulting decimal will be a circulate.

And in molt cafes, the decimal may be limited at three places, which divide the integer into 1000 equal parts. Circulates, or finite parts, thus limited, are called ap-- proximate decimals ; and are\" fometimes marked with + or — annexed, according as the right-hand figure is ta¬ ken lefs or greater than juft: for in limiting the decimal, if you foreiee that the fucceeding figure of the quot would be 6 or 7, or any figure above 5, you lefien the error by increafing the right-hand figure of the approxi¬ mate by unity.

Pnok. VI. To reduce unlike circles to others that are fimilar and conterminous. Similar or like circles are fuch as confift of an equal number of places. Thus, .27, and .09, are fimilar circles, as confift- ing of two places each. But .63, and .148, are unlike.; the former confifting of two, and the latter of three places. Conterminous circles are fuch as begin and end at the lame diftance from the decimal point. Thus, .153846, and .384615, are conterminous ; be- 'caufe they both begin at the place of primes, and have an equal number of places. And .0,714285, and .7,857142, are conterminous, becaufe they both begin at the place of feconds, and have the fame number of places. But .81, and .1,36, are not conterminous, the former beginning at the place of primes, and the latter at the place of feoonds. Again, .63, and .481, are not con¬ terminous, becaufe they have not the fame number of places ; for circles cannot be conterminous unlefs they be at the fame time fimilar. Unlike circles are reduced to fimilar ones by the fol¬ lowing Rule. Find the leaft multiple of the numbers de¬ noting the number of places in the feveral given circles, and extend each of the given circles to as many places as there are units in the leaft multiple. Thus, to reduce the unlike circles .63, = -636363, .63, and .148, to fimilar ones, ex- .148,=.148148, tend both circles to fix places, be¬ caufe 6 is the leaft multiple of 2 and 3, the mimber of places in the given circles. In a circle any one of the circulating figures may be The anfwer here made the firft of the circle. Thus,. 7.592, may be ex- is the fame as be- preffed thus, 7.5,925,; or thus, 7.59,259,; and that fore. ! without changing its value : confequently a pure circulate may put on the form of a mixt circulate, if one or more figures on the left he fet afide for the finite part; thus,. • 72,=.7,27, where .7, is the finite part. That the value is not changed may be thus demon- ftrated. .7.27. = -B£ = T5- = -7 2 - Hence two or more given circles may be made conter¬ minous, by the following adcl them as integers, inferting the decimal point diredtly under the column of points. The figures on the left of the point are integers, and thofe on the right are a deci¬ mal of the integer, confifting of as many places as there are figures in the longeft of the given decimals. The operation is the fame here as in Ex. addition of vulgar fraAions; for a cipher .75 =.750 on the right of a decimal does not .895 = .895 change its value: If, therefore, ciphers .5 = .500 be annexed, fo as to give every.decimal .625 = .625 the fime number of places, as is done in .725 = .725 the margin, they will by this means be-- ■ - reduced to a common denominator, 3.495 viz. 1000. Note, If the decimals to be added are of different de¬ nominations, firft reduce them to one denomination, and then add. The reafon is, becaufe like things only can be added or fubtrafled. Ex.

When all or any of the given decimals are repeaters, give every repeater the fame number of places, and one place more than the longeft finite; and for every nine in the right-hand column carry 1. or to its fum add I for every nine, and then carry at ten. ♦ Examp. 7484= 748 - 3'3 <> 53 r- 653.^6 844— 84/1 25 l= 25.83' 37 4= 3 7-5*5 84 — 8-i# J5J7t =1557-06 In this example the fum of the right-hand column is 24, which contains 9 twice, and 6 over ; fo fet down 6 and carry 2: Or to the fum 24 add 2, for the two nines, which makes 26; fo-fet down 6 and carry 2. Proceed with the reft as in integers.- The fums, differences, and prodntts, of interminate decimals, are always interminate, unlefs they end in a cipher. A repeating digit is the numerator of a vulgar frac¬ tion, whofe denominator is 9; and hence, in adding a column of repeating digits, every 9 of the fum is or an unit, to be carried ; and what is over a juft number of nines is lo many ninth-parts. Or, if to the fum of a column of repeating digits, 1 for every 9 contained in it be added, we then carry 1 for every ten; but what is over a juft number of tens will ftill continue to be ninth-parts.. If in any. example the repeating figures happen all to be reiterated, the carriage from the right-hand co¬ lumn adjufts the column on the left, or makes every ten of them equal to an unit of the next fuperior column, &c. Thus, if we imagine a column of the repeating fi¬ gures reiterated on the right of any example, the car¬ riage from it would adjuft the right-hand column of the example. Rule III. When all or any of the given decimals are circulates, make all the circles conterminous, find the number of tens to be carried from the left-hand column E T I C K, .403 of the circles, add this carriage to the right hand column, and proceed as in addition of integers. If repeaters be mixed with the circulates, give the repeaters the form of circulates, by extending the re¬ peating figures till they become conterminous with the other circles. If finite decimals are joined with the circulates, ex¬ tend the finite parts of all the circulates to as many places as there are figures in the longeft finite. Examp. 4 = .428571, = ■ .428571, 4 =.857142,= .857142. rr — *45 > — .454545. tt = *37°» = -370370. 2.110630 In order to find the carriage from the left-hand co¬ lumn of the circles, add the column next to it on the right, faying, 7 + 5 + 5+ 2 = 19; from which carry 1, and fay, 14-3+4 + 8 + 4 = 20; from which carry 2, and go on to add the right-hand column of the circle, faying, the carriage 2 + 5 + 2 + 1=10; fofet down o, and carry 1, and proceed with the reft as in integers. The adding the carriage from the left-hand column of the circles to the column on the right hand, arifes from the flux of numbers; for as the circles repeat infinitely, if we fuppofe a new fett of the fame circles to be repeat¬ ed upon the right of our examples, it is plain, that in adding them the carriage from the left-hand column of the new fett would naturally fall into the right-hand co¬ lumn of our example. The operation here is the fame as in addition of vulgar frattions ; for every circle is the numerator of a vulgar frattion, whole common denominator is 999999 ; and if the circles or numerators be added, without minding any carriage from the left-hand column, the fum will be 2110628.. And 999999)2iio628(244444| 1999998 110630 But, by pointing off from the fum of the circles fix figures towards the right, we divide by 100O000, in- ftead of dividing by 999999 ; which gives indeed the fame quot, but makes the remainder too fmall. Now, that the carriage-figure from the left-hand co¬ lumn of the circles, is the integral part of the quot, and at the fame time the difference between the true and falfe remainder, is evident; for the quotient-figure 2, multiplied into the two. divifors 1000000 and 999999, gives two produttsj whofe difference is 2; and confe- quently, if the greateft produtt, viz. 2 X1000000 = 2000000, be fubtratted from the dividend, the refult will want 2 of the true remainder. To prevent fuch er¬ rors, and to put the work on a fure. footing, find the. carriage from, the left-hand column of the circles, add this carriage to the right-hand column, divide the fum. by 1000000, and you will have a true quot, and a true remainder.

V. Multiplication of Decimals, E X I G k, Geseral Role. Give fo many decimal places to the product, on the righr, as are in both fadtors; and if the product has not fo many figures, fupply that defect by prefixing ci¬ phers. We now proceed to multiplication. Rule I. If both factors are finite or approximate, work exactly as in multiplication of integers. Ex. 1. Ex. 2. •7? 5 .12; •75 •2; 3925 625 5495 250 •58375 .03125 In Ex. 2. the produdt not affording fo many decimal places as are in the multiplicand and multiplier, the defect is fupplied by prefixing ciphers. The reafon of giving as many decimal, places to-the produdt as are in both fadtors, appears by'corifidering that the operation is the fame here as in multiplication of vulgar fradtions. Thus, .785 X .75 = toVs-X i xra-— 5 = • 5 8 8 7 5. To multiply by 10, 100, 100, <bc. move the decimal point fo many places toward the right hand as there are ciphers in the multiplier. In multiplication and divifion there may happen nine varieties, arifing from the different 'nature of the num¬ bers that may occur in the operation; and thefe are of three forts, viz. integers, mixt numbers, and pure de¬ cimals. Now, fince the multiplier or divifor may be of three kinds, and the multiplicand or dividend of as many, there muft of confequence be nine varieties; which are thefe following. * - Gan integer, An integer may multiply or divide 3-a mixt number, C a pure decimal. C an integer, A mixt number may multiply or divide -< a mixt number, Ca pure decimal, C an integer, A pure decimal may multiply or divide < a mixt number, ■ (.a pure decimal; Of thefe.varieties, the firfl belongs properly to vulgar arithmetic, the other eight occur in decimal operations. But in multiplication and divifion of decimals, there will occur other nine varieties, arifing likewife from the nature of the numbers; which may either be finite, re¬ peating, or circulating. And fince the multiplier or divifor may be of three forts, and the multiplicand or dividend of as many, there muft of courfe be nine varieties; and thefe are fo ob¬ vious, that it would be lofing time here to enumerate them. Before entering on multiplication, we (ball lay down a rule for pointing the produdt, which is of a general na¬ ture, and extends to decimals of every fort, whether fi¬ nite, repeating, or circulating,; and is as follows. Voi,. I. Numb. 17. 3 Thus: •4375 X io- = 4.375 •4375 X 100 = 43.75 And thus: 6 875 X 10 = 68.75 6.875 X 100 = 687.5 Approximates. In multiplying approximates, the certain places of the product may be determined by one or other of the two rules following, viz. 1. If . both factors are approximates,, the uncertain places of the product will be one more than the number pf places in the longeft fadtor. 2. If one of the fadtors be finite, and the other ap^ proximate, the uncertain places of the product will be one more than the number of places in the finite faclor. Ex. 1. Ex. 2. 245.118— .210526+ •3529+ 2.875 2206062 490236 1225590 735354 1052630 1473682 1684708 421052 86.5021422 .605262250 Io Ex. 1. the integral part of the produdt, vtei 86, is certain, and all the decimal places on the right are' uncertain. In Ex. 2. only four places on the left, viz. .6052, are certain, and all the other places uncertain. The reafon of Rule 1. is plain. For if in Ex. 1. we make the longeft fadtor the multiplier, and the total produift will be the fame either way, it is obvious, that in this cafe we (hall have fix particular products, in each eff which the right-hand figure wjll be uncertain, and 5 K confequemly"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"4 o6 A R I T H M confequently we fhalJ- have fix uncertain places in the to¬ tal produft toward the right,, and alfo one uncertain place more on account of the uncertain carriage from the co¬ lumn in which the right-hand figure of the laft particular produft ftands. The reafon of Rule 2. is alfo obvious. For in Ex. 2. by making the finite faftor the multiplier, we have four particular produfts, in each of which the right-hand fi¬ gure is uncertain; and fo we have four uncertain places in the total produft, and one uncertain place more arifing from the uncertain carriage. The carriage in forne cafes may afFeft feveral columns on the left, and thereby render fo many more figures un¬ certain. The fureft way therefore to determine the certain places in the produft of approximates, is by a fecond operation, giving the approximates contrary figns; for then, fo far as the two produfts agree, the figures are certain^ The fecond operations of the two former ex¬ amples, follow. T I K. tions, will throw a light upon the matter, and unfold the reafon of the rule. Which take his follows. Multiply 1S.634375' into 9.87 J, and limit the produft to four decimal plac - By the rule. 18.63437? 578.9 By the other method. 18.634375 A 9-875 1677093 149075 I 3 °44 931 184.0143+ 1677093 75 149075 000 13944 0625 93 * 71875 Ex. :. 245.117+ • 3 5 3 — 73535 1 1225585 735351 86.526301 Ex. 2. * .210527.— 2.875 1052635 1473689 1684216 421054 .605265125 l.j is certain, and all the othe« figures In Ex. 2. .60526 are the only certain places. 184.0144153125 B In working by this rule, yon invert the multiplier, and place 9, the units figure, under 3, the fourth place of decimals, becaufe the produft is limited to four deci¬ mal places; then multiply, faying, 9X3 = 27, and 6 carried from the right makes 33, <kc. In multiplying by 8, fay, 8 X4 = 32, and 3 of carriage makes 35 ; fo fet 5 under 3 ; and proceed in like manner ,to multiply the figures on the left. The right-hand figure of the produft is defeftive, as wanting the carriage from the columns cut off on the right by the line A B. The fi¬ gures expreffing the fum of the columns fo cut off, are fo many uncertain places of the preduft, when the fac¬ tors are approximate, and on that account to be rejeft- «d as ufelefs.

Ex. Multiply .S may be multiplied expeditioufly, and at the fame time three decimal places, have the decimal places in the produft limited to any - u - number propoled. This may be effefted by the fol¬ lowing Rule. Under the multiplicand place the multipKet inverted, fo that its units place may ftand under that place of the multiplicand to which you propofe to limit the produft; then multiply the right-hand figure of the multiplier into that figure of the multiplicand which ftands direftly over it, taking m the carriage from the right, _ , . and go on to multiply it into all the other figures on the The decimal places of the frftors. may either be re- kfc. Proceed in like manner with every other figure of tained a* full length, or turned into approximates before the multiplier, placing the right-hand figures of all the you begin to multiply. Ex.

The total pro¬ duft will be approximate, and the right-hand figure un¬ certain. To make this rule more eafily underftood, the reader may look back to the multiplication of integers ; where: il was obfetved, that inftead of beginning with the right- hand figure of the multiplier, we may begin with the left, and ftili have a juft produft, provided the right- hand figure of every particular produft be placed di- ieftly under the multiplying figure.

The belt fecurity on this head is, never to limit the produdt to fewer than four or five decimal places. To conclude, when decimals to be multiplied are long, you may frequently perform the operation more eafily in vulgar fradtions, and then reduce the product to a decimal. Rule II. If the multiplier be finite, and the multi¬ plicand repeat, in multiplying carry at 9 on the right hand ; and before you add, prolong the repetends of the particular produdts, till their right-hand figures Hand di- redtly under one another ; and in adding, carry at 9 on the right hand.

If the multiplier be finite, and the multi¬ plicand circulate, to the produdt of the right-hand figure of the circle add the carriage from the left, then proceed as in multiplication of integers ; but before you add the •particular produdts, make them conterminous, and then add as in addition of circulates. The produdt commonly circulates; and then its circle is fimilar to the circle of the multiplicand, as in Ex. r. and 2.; but the produdt fometimes repeats, as in Ex. 5.; or it may turn out finite, as in Ex. 6. Here it is obvious, that in multiplying .481 Ex. x. by 7, the carriage from the left would be 3 ; .481, fo fay, 7X1 = 7, and 3 of carriage, make 10, 7, <bc.

In Ex. 12. A mixt number divides a mixt number : and after the dividend is exhaufted, by annexing ciphers to the remainder, continue the divifion till the quot has three decimal places; and as there is ftill a remainder, it might be carried further ; but three decimal places being in mod cafes.fufficiently accurate, here you may limit it; fo the quot is approximate. In divifion of decimals, the place of the firft figure of the quot may likewife be known from the firft dividual, much after the fame manner as in divifion of integers, by the following II. General Rule. The place of the firft figure of the quot is the fame ■ with the place of that figure in the dividend which ftands over the units of the firft product. Thus, in the example of integers in 35)32095(917, the margin, the figure o, that ftands o- 3*5 ver 5, the units of the produdl of - 9^X35, is in the place of hundreds; 59 and therefore 9, the firft figure of the 35 quot, is likewife hundreds; and fo the —.— quot is 917 integers. 24 5 245 To ilhftrate the rule, we ihall give decimal places to the dividend of the above example ; and -thereby exhibit, the varieties that will occur in pointing the quot. In all the above varieties, the figure o iti the dividend ftands over the 'units of the firft produft: and in Var. 1. the figure o is in the place of tens, and accordingly 5, the firft figure of the quot, is tens ; in Var. 2. the figure o is in the place of units, and fo 9 is units ; in Var. 3. the figure o is in the place of primes, and fo 9 is primes, foe. Here obferve that 9, the firft fignificant figure of the quot, in all the above varieties, as well as in the varie¬ ties that follow, muft always be confidered, in multi¬ plying the divifor, as an integer; and, in pointing the firft produtt, no decimal place is to be allowed for it.

But here it is to be obferved, that the uncertain car¬ Here we ftop, no more places being certain. - The reafon is obvious; for the right-hand figure of the firft product, viz. 6 , is uncertain; and confequently all the figures under it, on the right of the line A B, will be fo too; that is-, the laft remainder and new dividual are uncertain, and of courfe the figure that would go next to the quot. From this example it appears, that all the figures on the right of the line A B are uncertain and ufelefs; if therefore a way of working, without writing down thefe ufelefs figures, can be found, we-(hall then have a me¬ thod of dividing long decimals, whether finite or approxi¬ mate, fo as to contract the operation, and limit the pro¬ duct to any number of decimal places propofed. And this may be effected by ohferving the following Rule. Write the produdt of'the firft quotient-figure under the dividend; and from the fituation of the units place, confider how many figures of the dividend mult be retained to give the quot the number of decimal places intended; cut off the other figures on the right, and alfo the figures correfponding to them on the right of the divifor; then fubtradt; efteem this and every fol¬ lowing remainder a new dividual; and for each new di¬ vidual drop a figure on the right of the divifor; but in multiplying the quotient-figures into the divifor, take in the carriage from the right hand; as in the following examples.

Find the decimal of the rate, viz. the value of one yard, one pound, one piece, (be. ; and this decimal of the rate multiplied into the number or quan¬ tity of the goods gives the price. Ex. x.

The decimal of the L. s. d. rate is .% 3)439(146.3= 146 6 8 Meth. II. When the rate confifts of pence and far¬ things, find how often it is contained in one pound Ster¬ ling, divide the given number of goods by this numher, or by its component parts, or work by aliquot parts, and the refult will be the price fought. We confine this method to fuch rates as confift of pence and farthings, becaufe when the rate confifts of (hillings, pence, and farthings, or of pounds, fhillings, pence, <bc. it is ftiorter and cafier to work by Me¬ thod I. To make the pradice ready and eafy, it will be pro¬ per to have at hand a table of rates and divifors, fuch as the following one. 6? tl 60 54 *6 Table of Rates and Divisors. Rates. O Forth.

Thus, .570831s the decimal of 11 s. 5d. one pound being the integer ; and .571875 is the deci¬ mal of ns. 5^d. tec. Thofe decimals oppofite to 1 being multiplied through the nine digits, make up or compofe the' reft of the table. The fuperior excellency of tables thus conftru&ed is, that we multiply or divide by 10, 100, 1000, tec. by moving the decimal point fo many places to the right or left as there are ciphers in the multiplier or divifor. Hence the price or value of any number of yards, or other things, denoted by a Angle digit, or by any of its decuples, may be readily found. Thus, the price of 7, 70, 700,. 7000, 70000, 700000 yards, at ns. 5 d. per yard, is found as follows. Examp. i. Required the price of 7956 yards, at 11 s. j^d. per yard. Yards.

If unity be multiplied continually by any given num¬ ber, the protju&s thence arifirig are called powers of that number ; and the given number is called the root, or firjl power. Thus, if 2 be the given number, then 1X2=2 is the root or firR power; and 2X2=4 l ^ le fquare or fecond power; and 4X2=8 is the cube or third power; and 8X2=16 is the biquadrate or fourth power; and 16X 2=32 is the furfolid or fifth power; and 32X2=64 is the fixth power, or cube fquared, <bc. The natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 6 'c. are fometimes placed over thefe powers, denoting the number of ifiul- tiplications ufed in producing them, of ftiowing what powers they are ; and are called indices or exponents , as in the following fcheme.

The railing any root or number given to any power required, is called involution ; and is performed by mul¬ tiplying the given root into unity continually, as taught above. But the finding the root of a given power is called evolution , or extraction of roots.

Again, if the index of the given power be a multiple of 3, by extrafting the cube root you obtain a power ■ whofe index is one third of the index of the power given. Thus the cube root of the ninth power is the cube or third power ; and the cube root of the twelfth power is the biquadrate or fourth power, iyc. Involution is direftly contrary to extraftion or evo¬ lution ; and therefore, if a fquare number be fquared, it will give the biquadrate or fourth power; and if a biquadrate be fquared, it will give the eighth power. A- gain, if a cube number be cubed, it will giye the ninth power; and if the biquadrate.be cubed, it will give the twelfth power, See Algebra, Chap. IX. and X.

This obfervation the great Bochart has confirmed, and fhewn very plainly that no country abounds fo much with this wood as that part of Affyria which lies about Ba¬ bylon. In what place Noah built and finifhed his ark is no left made a matter of deputation. But the molt probable opinion is, that it was built in Chaldaea, in the terri¬ tories of Babylon, where there was fo great a quanti¬ ty of cyprefs in the groves and gardens in Alexander’s time, that that prince built a whole fleet out of it, for want of timber. And this conjecture is confirmed by the Chaldean tradition, which makes Xithurus (another name for Noah) fet fail from that country. The dimenfions of the ark, as given by Mofes, are 300 cubits in length, 50 in breadth, and 30 in height, which fome have thought too fcanty, confidering the number of things it was to contain ; and hence an ar¬ gument has been drawn againfl the authority of the re¬ lation. To folve this difficulty many of the ancient fathers, and the modern critics, have been put to ve¬ ry miferable fhifts; But Buteo and Kircher have proved geometrically, that, taking the common cubit of a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly fufficient for all the animals fuppofed to be lodged in it. Snellius computes the ark to have been above half an acre in area, and father Lamy fhews, that it was 110 feet longer than the church of St Mary at Paris, and 64 feet narrower; and if fo, it mult have been longer than St Paul’s church in London, from weft to eaft; and broader than that church is high in the infide, and 54 feet* of our meafure in height; and Dr Arbuthnot computes it to have been 81062 tuns. \"The things contained in it were, befides eight per- fons of Noah’s family, one pair of every fpecies of un¬ clean animals, and feven pair of every fpecies of clean animals, with provifions for them all during the whole year. The former appears, at firft view, almoft in¬ finite ; but if w-e come to a calculation, the number of fpecies of animals will be found much Iefs than is ge¬ nerally imagined, not amounting to an hundred fpecies of quadrupeds, nor to two hundred of birds ; out of which, in this cafe, are excepted fuch animal? as can live in the water. Zoologifts ufually reckon but an hundred and fe'venty fpecies in all; and bilhop Wilkins Ihews that only feventy-two of the q uadruped kind needed a place in the ark. * By the defeription Mofes gives of the ark, it ap¬ pears to have been divided into three ftories, each ten cubits, or fifteen feet high; and it is agreed on, as mod probable, that the lowed ftory was for ■ the beads, the middle for the food, and the upper ) ARK for the birds, with Noah and his family; each ftory being fubdivided into different apartments, ftalls, <bc . Though Jofephus, Philo, and other commentators, add a kind of fourth ftory under all the reft; being, as it were, the hold of the veffel, to contain the ballaft, and receive the filth and faeces of fo many animals: But F. Calmet thinks, that what is here reckoned a ftory, was no more than what is called the keel of lhips, and ferved only for a confervatory of frelh water. Drexe- lius makes three hundred apartments. F. Fournier, three hundred and thirty-thi ee; the anonymous author of the Queftions on Genefis, four hundred; Buteo, Temporarius, Arias Montanus, Holtus, Wilkins, Lamy, and others, fuppofe a's many partitions as there were different forts of animals. Pelletier makes only fev.enty-two, viz. thirty-fix for- the birds, -and as many for the beafts ; his reafon is, that if we fup¬ pofe a greater number, as 333, or 400, each of the eight perfons in the ark mult have had thirty-feven, forty-one, or fifty ftalls to attend and cleanfe daily, which he thinks impoflible to have been done. But it is obferved, that there is not much in this; to dimi- nifh the number of ftalls without a diminution of ani¬ mals is vain; it being perhaps more difficult to take care of three hundred animals in feventy-two ftalls, than in three hundred. As to the number of animals edntained in the ark, Buteo computes that it could not be equal to five hundred horfes ; he even reduces the whole to fhe dimenfions of fifty-fix pair of oxen. F. Lamy enlarges it to fixty-four pair of oxen, or an hundred and twenty-eight oxen ; fo that fuppofing one ox equal to two horfes, if the ark had room for two hundred and fifty-fix horfes, there muft have been room\" for all the animals. But the fame author de- monftrates, that one floor of it would fuffice for five hundred horfes, allowing nine fquare feet to a horfe. ^s to the food in the fecond ftory, it is obferved by Buteo from Columella, that thirty or forty pounds of hay ordinaiily fuffices for an ox a day, and that a fo- lid cubit of hay, as ufually preffed down in our hay¬ ricks, weighs about forty pounds; fo that a fquare cubit of hay is more than enough for one ox . in one day. Now it appears that the fecond ftory contained 150,000 folid cubits, which divided between two hundred and fix oxen, will afford each more hay by two thirds, than he can eat in a year. Bilhop Wil¬ kins computes all the carnivorous animals, equivalent, as to the bulk of their bodies, and their food, to twen- ty-feven wolves; and all the reft to two hundred and eighty beeves. For the former he allows 1825 Iheep, and for the latter, 109,500 cubits of hay, all which will be eafily contained in the two firft ftories, and a deal of room to fpare. As to the third ftory, no body doubts -of its beipg fufficient for the fowls; with Noah, Lis fons, and daughters. Upon the whole, the learned bilhop remarks, that of the two, it appears much more difficult to affign a number and bulk of neceffary things to anfwer the-capacity of the ark, than to find fufficient room for'the feveral fpecies of ani¬ mals already known to have been there. This he at¬ tributes to the imperfection of our lift of animals, e- fpecially"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"A R M A R M ' ( 425 ) f fpecially thofe of the unknown parts of the earth ; add¬ ing, that the moil expert mathematician at this day could not affign the proportion ■ of a veffel better ac¬ commodated to the purpose than is. here done; and hence finally concludes, that the capacity of the ark, which h d been make an objection againll fcripture, ought to be eileemed a confirmation of its divine autho¬ rity, fince, in thofe ruder ages, men, being lefs verfed in arts and philoiophy, were more obnoxious to vulgar prejudices than now; fo that had it been an human in¬ vention, it. would have been contrived, according to thofe wild apprehenfions which arife from a confufed and general view of things, as much too big, as it had . been reprefented too little. But it mull be obferved, that beffdes the places re- quifite for the beads and birds, and their provifions, there was room required for Noah to lock up houfe- hold utenfils, the inftruments of hulbandry, grains and feeds, to fow the\" earth with after the deluge ; for which purpofe it is thought that he might fpare room in the third dory for fix and thirty cabbins, befides a kitchen, a hall, four chambers, and a fpace about eight and forty cubits in length to walk in.

The whole, according to the rabbins, was made out of the fame mafs, without joining any ofithe parts by folder. Here it was that the Schechinah or Divine Prefence relied, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, and was vifibly feen in the appearance of a cloud over it; and from hence the Divine oracles were given out by an audible voice, as often as God was conlulted in the behalf of his peo¬ ple.

The ancient fort, defcribed by Pliny and Diofcorides, was a native fait, generated in thofe large inns or caravanferas, where the croud of pilgrims, coming from the temple of Jupi¬ ter Ammon, ufed to lodge; who, in thofe parts, travel¬ ing upon camels, and thofe creatures when in Cyrene, a province of Egypt, where that celebrated temple flood, urining in the flables, or, fay fome, in the parched fands, out of this urine, which is remarkably ftrong, arofe a kind of fait, denominated fometimes, from the temple, Ammoniac, and fometimes, from the country, Cyreniac. Since the ceffation of thefe pil¬ grimages, no more of this fait is produced there; and, from this deficiency, fome fufpeft there was never any fuch thing: But this fufpicion is removed, by the large quantities of a fait, nearly of the fame nature, thrown out by mount .Etna. The characters of the ancient fal armoniac are, that it cools water, turns aqua fortis into aqua regia, and confequently diffolves gold. T he modern fal armoniac is entirely factitious, and made in Egypt; where feveral long*-necked glafs bot¬ tles, being filled with foot, a little fea-falt, and the urine of cattle, and having their mouth luted with a piece of wet cotton, are placed over an oven or fur¬ nace, contrived for the purpofe, in a thick bed of afhes, nothing but the necks appearing, and kept there two days and a night, with a continual ftrong fire. The fleam fwells up the cotton, and forms a pafte at the vent-hole, hindering the falts from evaporating; which, being confined, flick to the top of the bottle, and are, upon breaking it, taken out in thofe large cakes, which they fend to England.

An army is compofed of fquadrons and battalions, and is ufually divided into three corps, and formed into three lines ; the firft line is called the van-guard, the fecond the rfiain body, and the third the rear-guard, or body of referve. The middle of each line is pof- fefled by \"the foot; the cavalry form the right and left wing of each line ; and fometimes they place fqua¬ drons of horfe in the intervals between the battalions. When the army is drawn up ih order of battle, the horfe are placed at five feet diftance from each other, and the foot at three. In each line the battalions are diftant from each other one hundred and eighty feet, which is nearly equal to the extent of their front ; and the fame holds of the fquadrons, which are about three hundred feet diflant, the extent of their own front. Thefe intervals are left for the fquadrons and battalions of the fecond line to range themfelves a- gainft the intervals of the firft, that both may more readily march through thefe fpaces to the enemy: the firft line is ufually three hundred feet diftant from the fecond, and the fecond from the third, that there may be fufficient room to rally, when the fquadrons and battalions are broken.

By aftronomy we difcover that the earth is at fo great a diftance from the fun, that if feen from thence it would appear no bigger than a point, although its circumference is known to be 25,020 miles. Yet that diftance is fo fmall, compared with the earth’s diftance from the fixed ftars, that* if the orbit in which the earth moves round the fun were folid, and feen from the neareft ftar, it would like- wife appear no bigger than a point, although it is at leaft 162 millions of miles in diameter. For the earth, in going round the fun, is 162 millions of miles nearer to fome of the ftars at one time of the year than at another; and yet their apparent magnitudes, fituations, and di- ftances from one another ftill remain the fame ; and a te- lefcope which magnifies above 200 times does not fenfi- bly magnify them; which proves them to be at leaft 400 thoufands times farther from us than we are from, the fun. It is not to be imagined that all the ftars are placed in one concave furface, fo as to be equally diftant from us; but that they are fcattered at immenfe diftanc.es from one another through unlimited fpace. So that there may be as great a diftance between any two neighbouring ftars, as between our fun and thofe which are neareft to him. Therefore an obferver,. who is neareft any fixed ftar, will look upon it alone as a real fun; and confider the reft as fo many fhining points, placed at equal diftances from him in the firmament. By the help of telefcopes. we difcover thoufands of ftars which are invifible to the naked eye ; and the better our glaffes are, ftill the hidre become vifible ; fo that no limits can be fet either to their number or their diftances. The fun appears very bright and large in comparifon of the fixed liars, becaufe we keep conftantly near the fun, in comparifon of our immenfe diftance from the ftars. For a fpeCtator, placed as near to any ftar as we are fo the fun, would fee that ftar a body as large and bright as the fun appears to us: and a fpeCtator, as far diftant from the fun as we are from the ftars, would fee the fun as fmall as we fee a ftar, diverted of all its circumvolving planets; and would reckon it one of the ftars in numbring them. The ftars, being at fuch immenfe diftances from the fun, cannot poffibly receive from him fo ftrong a light as they feem to have ; nor any brightnefs fufficient to make them vifible to us. For the fun’s rays mult be fo fcattered and diffipatcd before they reach fuch remote objects, that N O M Y. they can never be tranfmitted back to our eyes, fo as to render thefe objects vifible by reflexion. The ftars there¬ fore Ihine with their own native and unborrowed luftre, as the fun does; and fince each particular ftar, as well ' as the fun, is confined to a particular portion of fpace, it is plain that the ftars are of the fame nature with the fun. It is noways probable that the Almighty, who always ads with infinite wifdom, and does nothing in vain, Ihould create fo many glorious funs, fit for fo many important purpofes, and place them at fuch diftances from one an¬ other, without proper objefts near enough to be benefited by their influences. Whoever imagines 'they were cre¬ ated only to give a faint glimmering light to the inhabi¬ tants of this globe, mud have a very fuperficial know- lege of aftronomy, and a mean opinion of the Divine Wifdom; fince, by an infinitely lefs exertion of creating power, the Deity could have given our earth much more light by one Angle additional moon. Inftead then of one fun and one world only in the uoi- verfe, aftronomy difcovers to us fuch an inconceivable number of funs, fyftems', and worlds, difperfed through houndlefs fpace, that if our fun, with all the planets, moons, and comets belonging to it, were annihilated, they would be no more miffed, by an eye that could take in the whole creation, than a grain of fand from the fea-lhore: The fpace they poffefa being comparatively fo fmall, that it would fcarce be a fenfible blank in the univerfe, although Saturn, the outermoft of our planets, revolves aboutthe fun in an orbit of 4884 millions of miles in circumference, and fome of our comets make excurfions upwards of ten thoufand millions of miles beyond Sa¬ turn’s orbit; and yet, at that amazing diftance, they are incomparably nearer to the fun than to any of the ftars ; as is evident from their keeping clear of the attractive power of all the ftars, and returning periodically by vir¬ tue of the fun’s attraction. From what we know of our own fyftem, it may be reafonably concluded, that all the reft are with equal wifdom contrived, fituated, and provided with accom¬ modations for rational inhabitants. Let us therefore take a furvey of the fyftem to which we belong; the only one accelfible to us; and from thence we Ihall be the bet¬ ter enabled to judge of . the nature and end of the other fyftems of the univerfe. For although there is almoft an infinite variety in the parts of the creation which we have opportunities of examining, yet there is a general analogy running through, and connecting all the parts in¬ to one great and univerfal fyftem. To an attentive confiderer, it will appear highly pro¬ bable, that the planets of our fyftem, together with their attendants called fatellites or moons * are much of the"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"A S T R C the fame nature with bur-.earth, and defined for the like purpofes. For they are folid opaque globes, capa¬ ble'of fupporting animals and vegetable. Some of them are larger, fome lefs, and fome much about the fize of our earth. They all circulate round the fun, as the earth does, in a Ihorter or longer time, according to their refpedtive diftances from him; and have, where it would not be inconveniept, regular returns mf fummer and win¬ ter, fpring and autumn. They.have warmer and cold¬ er climates,, as.the various productions of our earth re¬ quire : And, in fuch as afford a poflibility of difcovering -it, we obferve a regular motion round their axes like that of our earth, caufing an alternate return of day and night ; which is neceiTary for labour, reft, and ve¬ getation, and that all parts of their furfaces may be expofed to the rays of the fun. Such of the planets as are fartheft from the fun, and therefore enjoy leaft of his light, have that deficiency made up by feveral moons, which conftantly accompany and revolve about them, as our moon revolves about the earth. The remoteft planet has, over and above, a broad ring encompalfing it; which like a lucid zone in the heavens reflects the fun’s light very copioufly on that planet; fo that if the remoter planets have the fun's light fainter by day than we,' they have an addition made to it morning and evening by one or more of their moons, and a greater quantity of light in the night-time. On the furface of the moon, becaufe it is nearer us than any other of the celeftial bodies are, we difcover a nearer refemblance of our earth. For, by the afliftance of telefcopes, we obferve the moon to be full of high mountains, large valleys, and deep cavities. Thefe fi- milarities leave us no room to doubt, but that all the planets and moons in the fyftem are defigned as commo¬ dious habitations for creatures endued with capacities of knowing and adoring their beneficent Creator. Since the fixed ftars are prodigious fpheres of fire like our fun, and at inconceivable diftances from one another as well as from us, it is reafonable to conclude they are made for the fame purpofes that the fun is ; each to be¬ llow light, heat, and vegetation, on a certain number of inhabited planets,, kept by gravitation within the fphere of its aftivity. Chap. II. Of the Solar System. The planets and comets which move round the fun as their centre, conftitute the Solar Syftem. Thofe planets which are near the fun not only finilh their circuits foon- er, but likewife move fafter in their refpeCtive orbits, than thofe which are more remote from him. Their motions are all performed from weft to eaft, in orbits nearly circular. Their names, diftances, bulks, and periodical revolutions, are as follow. The Sun 0 , an immenfe globe of fire, is placed near the common centre, or rather in the lower focus, of the orbits qf. all the planets and comets ; and turns round his axis in 25 days 6 hours, as is evident by the motion of fpots leen on-his furface. His diameter is computed to be 763,000 miles; and,, by the various attraChons of the N O M Y. 435 circumvolving planets, he is agitated by a fmall motion round the centre of gravity of the fyftem. All the pla¬ nets, as feen from him, move the fame way, and ac¬ cording to the order of figns in the graduated circle SF d H JZo, fee. Plate XL. fig. 2. which repre- fents the great ecliptic in the heavens: But, as l’een from any one planet, the reft appear fometimes to go backward, fometimes forward, and fometimes to Hand ftill; not in circles nor ellipfes, but in looped curves which never return into themfelves. The comets come from all parts of the heavens, and move in all forts of diredtjons. The axis of a planet is a line conceived to be drawn through its centre, about which it revolves as on a real axis. The extremities of this line, terminating in op- polite points of the planet’s furface, are called its poles. That which points towards the northern part of the hea¬ vens, is called the north pole} and the other, pointing towards the fouthern part, is called the fouth pole. A bowl whirled from one’s hand into the open air turns round fuch a line within itfelf, whilft it moves forward; and fuch are the lines we mean, when we fpeak of the axes of the heavenly bodies. Let us fuppofe the earth’s orbit to be a thin, even, fo¬ lid plane ; cutting the fun through the centre, and ex¬ tended out as far as the ftarry heavens, where it will mark the great circle called the ecliptic. This circle we fuppofe to be divided into 12 equal parts, called figns ; each fign into 30 equal parts, called degrees e ach de¬ gree into 60 equal parts, called minutes ; and every mi¬ nute into 60 equal parts, called feconds : So that a le- cond is the 60th .part of a minute; a minute the 60th part of a degree; and a degree the 360th part of a cir¬ cle, or 30th part of a fign. The planes of the orbits of all the other planets likewife cut the fun in halves; but, extended to thp heavens, form circles different from one another, and from the ecliptic; one half of each being on the north fide, and the other on the fouth fide of it! Confequently the orbit of each planet croffes the ecliptic in two oppofite points, which are called the planet’s nodes. 1 hefe nodes are all in different parts of the e- cliptic; and therefore, if the planetary tracks remained vifible in the heavens, they would in fome meafure re¬ ferable the different ruts of waggon-wheels croffng one another in different parts, but never gomg far afunder. That node, or interfedlion of the orbit of-any planet with the earth’s, orbit, from which the planet afeends northward above the ecliptic, is called the ajeendin? node of the planet; and the other, which is diretfly op¬ pofite thereto, is called its defending node. Saturn’s amending node is in 21 deg. 13 min. of Cancer 03. J a _ Piter’s in 7 deg. 2 9 min. of the fame fign# Mars’s in 17 deg 17 min. of Taurus d, Venus’s in 13 deg. j 9 min. of Gemini H, and Mercury’s in 14 deg. 43 m i n . of Taurus. Here we confider the earth’s orbit as the ftandard, and the orbits of all the other planets as ob¬ lique to it. When we fpeak of the planets orbits, all that is-meant is their paths through the.open and unrefifling fpace in which they move, and are kept in, by the attractive power of the. fun, and the projectile force imprefled up-"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"*1^6 ASTRO on, them at fir ft; between which power and force there is To ex aft an adjtiftment, that they continue in the fame tracks without any folid orbits to confine them. Mercury, the neareft planet to the fun, goes round him (as in a circle marked Plate XXXIX. fig. i.) in 87 days 23 hours of our time nearly ; which is the length of his year. But, being feldom feen, and no fpots ap¬ pearing on his furface or dilk, the time of his rotation on his axis, or the length of his days and nights, is as yet unknown. His diftance from the fun is computed to be 32 millions of miles, and his diameter 2600. In his courfe round the fun, he moves at the rate of 95 thoufand miles every hour. His light and heat from the fun are almoft feven times as great as ours; and the fun appears to him almoft feven times as large as to us. The great heat on this planet is no argument agatnft its being inhabited; fince the Almighty could as ealily fuit the bodies and conftitutions of its inhabitants to the heat of their dwelling, as he has done ours to the tempera¬ ture of our earth. And it is very probable that the peo¬ ple there have fuch an opinion of us, as we have of the inhabitants of Jupiter and Saturn ; namely, that we muft be intolerably cold, and have very little light atfo great a diftance from the fun. This planet appears to us with all the various phafes of the moon, when viewed at different times by a good telefcope; excepting only that he never appears quite full, becaufe his enlightened fide is never turned direftly towards us but when he is fo near the fun as to be loft to our fight in its beams. And, as his enlight¬ ened fide is always toward the fun, it is plain that he ftiines not by any light of his own; for if he did, he would conftantly appear round. That he moves about the fun in an orbit within the earth’s orbit is alfo plain, (as will be (hewn afterwards), becaufe he is never feen oppofite to the fun, nor above 56 times the fun’s breadth from his centre. His orbit is inclined feven degrees to the ecliptic; and that node from which he afeends northward above the ecliptic is in the 14th degree of Taurus; the oppo¬ site, in the 14th degree of Scorpio. The earth is in thefe points on the 6th of November and 4th of May, new lilyle; and when Mercury comes to either of his nodes at his inferior conjunftion about thefe times, he will appear to pafs over the difk or face of the fun, like a dark round fpot; but in all other parts of his orbit his conjunftions are invifible, becaufe he either goes a- bove or below the fun. Mr Whifton has given us an account of feveral pe¬ riods at which Mercury may be feen on the fun’s dilk, viz. in the year 1782, Nov. 12th, at 3 h. 44 m. in the afternoon ; 1786, May 4th, at 6 h. 57 m. in the fore¬ noon; 1789, Dec. 6th, at 3 h. 55 min. in the after¬ noon; and 1799, May 7th, at 2 h. 34 in. in the after¬ noon. There will be feveral intermediate tranfits, but none of them vifible to us. Venus, the next planet in order, is computed to be 59 millions of miles from the fun; and by moving at the rate of 69 thoufand miles every hour in her orbit, (as in the circle marked $), Ihe goes round the fun in 224 N O M Y. days 17 hours of our time nearly. But though this be the full length of her year, as five performs only 9^ re¬ volutions on her own axis in that time, her year confifts only of 9^ days; fo that in her, every day and night together is as long as 24-f days and nights with us. This odd quarter of a day in every year makes every fourth year a leap-year to Venus ; as the like does to our earth. Her diameter is 7906 miles ; and by her diur¬ nal motion the inhabitants about her equatoT are carried 43 miles every hour, befides the 69,000 above men¬ tioned. Her orbit includes that of Mercury within it; for at her greateft elongation, or apparent diftance from the fun, ihe is 96 times his breadth from his centre ; which is almoft double of Mercury’s. Her orbit is included by the earth’s; for if it were not, Ihe might be feen as often in oppofition to the fun, as Ihe is in conjunftion with him; but (he w r as never feen 90 degrees, or a fourth part of a circle, from the fun. When Venus appears weft of the fun, Ihe rifes before him in the morning, and is called the morning-Jiar 5 when Ihe appears eaft of the fun, Ihe Ihines in the even¬ ing after he fets, and is then called the evening-ftar\\ •being each in its turn for 290 days. It may perhaps be furprifing at firft, that Venus fhould keep longer on the eaft or weft of the fun, than the whole time of her pe¬ riod round him. But the difficulty vaniffies when we confider, that the earth is all the while going round the fun the fame way, though not fo quick as Venus; and therefore her relative motion to the earth muft in every period be as much flower than her abfolute motion in her orbit, as the earth during that.time advances forward in the ecliptic, which is 220 degrees. To us ffie appears, through a telefcope, in all the various lhapes of the moon. The axis of Venus is inclined 75 degrees to the axis of her orbit; which is 5 i-4 degrees more than our earth’s axis is inclined to-the axis of the ecliptic; and therefore her feafons vary much more than ours do. The north pole of her axis inclines toward the 20th degree of a- quarius, our earth’s to the beginning of Cancer; confe- quently the northern parts of Venus have fummer in the figns where thofe of our earth have winter, and vice Thq artificial day at each pole of Venus is as long as 1124- natural days on our earth. The fun’s greateft declination on each fide of her e- quator amounts to 75 degrees; therefore her tropics are only 15 degrees from her poles, and her polar circles as far from her equator. Confequently, the tropics of Ve¬ nus are between her polar circles and her poles; contrary to what thofe of our earth are. As her annual revolution contains only 94 of her days, the fun will always appear to go through a whole fign, or twelfth part of her orbit, in little more than three quarters of her natural day, or nearly in‘ 18^ of our days and nights. Becaufe her day is fo great a part of her year, the fun changes his declination in one day fo much, that if he pafles vertically, or direftly over head of any given place on the tropic, the next day he will be 26 degrees from"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"ASTRO from it; and whatever place he paffes vertically over when in the equator, one day’s revolution will remove him 36-4 degrees from it. So that the fun changes his •declination everyday in Venus about 14 degrees more at a mean rate, than he does in a quarter of a year on our earth. This appears to be providentially ordered, for preventing the too great effects of the fun’s heat, (which is twice as great on Venus as on the earth), fo that he cannot Ihine perpendicularly on the fame places for two days together ; and by that means the heated places have time to cool. If the inhabitants about the north pole of Venus fix their fouth or meridian line through that part of the hea¬ vens where the fun comes to his greateft height, or north declination, and call thofe the ealt and welt points of their horizon, which are 90 degrees on each fide from that point where the horizon is cut by the meridian line, thefe inhabitants will have the following remarkable things. The fun will rife 224 degrees north of the ealt; and going on 11 degrees, as meafured on the plane of the horizon, he will crofs the meridian at an altitude of j 24 degrees ; then making an entire revolution without fetting, he will crofs it again at an altitude of 484 de¬ grees ; at the next revolution he will crols the meridian as he comes to his greateft height and declination, at the altitude of 75 degrees ; being then only 15 degrees from the zenith, or that point of the heavens which is diredtly overhead; and thence he will defeend in the like fpiral manner, crofting the meridian firft at the altitude of 484- degrees; next at the altitude of 124 degrees; and go¬ ing on thence 1x24 degrees, he will let 224 degrees north of the weft; fo that, after having been 44 revolutions above the horizon, he defeends below it to exhibit the like appearances at the fouth pole. At each pole, the fun continues half a year without fetting in fumnier, and as long without rifing in winter; confequently the polar inhabitants of Venus have only one day and one night in the year, as it is at the poles of our earth. But the difference between the heat of fummer and cold of winter, or of mid-day and mid¬ night, on Venus, is much greater than on the earth; becaufe in Venus, as the fun is for half a year together above the horizon of each pole in its turn, fohe is fora confiderable part of that time near the zenith; and du¬ ring the other half of the year always below the hori¬ zon, and for a great part of that time at leaft 70 degrees from it. Whereas, at the poles of our earth, although the fun is for half a year together above the horizon, yet he never afeends above, nor defeends below it, more than 234 degrees. When the fun is in the e- equinodtial, or in that circle which divides the northern half of the heavens from the fouthern, he is feen with one half of his dilk above the horizon of the north pole, and the other half above the horizon of the fouth pole; fo that his centre is in the horizon of both poles: and then defeending below the horizon of one, he afeends gradually above that of the other. Hence, in a year, each pole has one fpring, one harveft, a fummer as long as them both, and a winter equal in length to the other three feafons. Vol. I. No. 19. N O M 7 . 43, ? At the polar circles of Venus, the feafons are much the fame as at the equator, becaufe there are only 15 de¬ grees \"betwixt them; only the winters are not quite lo long, nor the fummers fo Ihort; but the four feafons come twice round every year. At Venus’s tropics, the fun continues for about fifteen of our weeks together without fetting in fummer, and as long without rifing in winter. Whilft he is more than Ij degrees from the equator, he neither rifes to the in¬ habitants of the one tropic, nor fets to thofe of the o- ther; whereas, at our terreftrial tropics, he rifes and fets every day of the year. At Venus’s tropics, the feafons are much the fame, as at her poles; only the fummers are a little longer, and the winters a little Ihorter. \"At her equator, the days and nights are always of the fame length, and yet the diurnal and nofkirnal arches are very different, efpecially when the fun’s declination is about the greateft; for then his meridian altitude may fometimes be twice as great as his midnight deprefiiop, and at other times the reverfe. When the fun is at his greateft declination, either north or fouth, his rays are as oblique at Venus’s equator, as they are at London on the fhorteft day of winter. Therefore, at her equator there are two winters, two fummers, two fprings, and two autumns every year. But becaufe the fun ftays for fome time near the tropics, and paffes fo quickly over the equator, every winter there will be almoft twice as long as fummer; the four feafons returning twice in that time, which confills only of 94 days. Thofe parts of Venus which lie between the poles and tropics, and between the tropics and polar circles, and' alfo between the polar circles and equator, partake more or lefs of the phenomena of thefe circles as they are more or lefs diftant from them. From the quick change of the fun’s declination it hap¬ pens, that if he rifes due eaft on any day, he will not fet due weft on that day, as with us ; for if the place where he rifes due eaft be on the equator, he will fet on that day almoft weft-north-weft, or about 184- degrees, north of the weft. But if the place be in 45 degrees north latitude, then on the day that the fun rifes due eaft he will fet north-weft by weft, or 33 degrees north, of the weft, and in 62 degrees north latitude. When he rifes in the eaft, -he fets not in that revolution, but juft touches the horizon 10 degrees to the weft of the north point, and afeends again, continuing for 34 revo¬ lutions above the horizon without fetting. Therefore, no place has the forenoon and afternoon of the fame day equally long, unlelj it be in the equator, or at the poles. The fun’s altitude at noon, or at any other time of the day, and his amplitude at rifing and fetting, being very different at places on the fame paiafltl or latitude, ac¬ cording to the different longitudes of thofe places, the longitude will be almoft as eafily found on Venus as the latitude is found on the earth ; which is an advantage we can never enjoy, becaufe the daily change of the fun’s declination is by much too fmall for that important pur- pofe. On this planet, where the fun. croffes the equator in aDy year, he will have 9 degrees of declination from that 5 S place 3"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"438 ASTRO place on the fame day and hour next year, and will crofs the equator 90 degrees farther to the weft; which makes the time of the equinox a quarter of a day (or about fix of our days) later every year. Hence, although the fpi- ral in which the fun’s motion is performed, be of the fame fort every year, yet it will not be the very fame, becaufe the fun will not pafs vertically over the fame places till four annual revolutions are finifhed. Venus’s orbit is inclined 34. degrees to the earth’s; and erodes it in the 14th degree of Gemini and of Sagit¬ tarius ; and therefore, when the earth is about thefe points of the ecliptic at the time that Venus is in her in¬ ferior conjunction, fhe will appear like a fpot on the fun, and afford a more certain method of finding the diftances of all the planets from the fun, than any other yet known. But thefe appearances happen very feldom. The firft was in the year 1639. The fecond in the year 1761, June 6. In the morning of that day, when the fun rofe at London, Venus had paffed both the external and in¬ ternal contacts. At 38 minutes 21 feconds paft 7 o’clock, (apparent time) at Greenwich, the Rev. Dr Bltfs, aftro- nomer royal, firft faw Venus on the fun; at which in- ftant, the centre of Venus preceded theTun’s centre, by 6 / 18”.9 of right afcenfion, and was fouth of the fun’s centre by i8 / 4 2 w .i of declination.—From that time to the beginning of egrefs, the DoCtor made feveral obfer- vations, both of the difference of right afcenfion and de¬ clination of the centres of the fun and Venus; and-at laft found the beginning of egrefs, on-inftant of the in¬ ternal contact of Venus with the fun’s limb, to be at 8 hours 19 minutes o feconds apparent time.—From the Doctor’s own obfervations, and thofe which were made at Shirburn by another gentleman, he has computed, that the mean time at Greenwich of the ecliptical con¬ junction of the fun and Venus was at 51 minutes 20 fe¬ conds after 5 o’clock in the morning; that the place of the fun and Venus was Gemini ij° 36' 3; that the geocentric latitude of Venus was 9' 44 W .9 fouth,—her horary motion from the fun 3^ 5 7^. 13 retrograde, and the angle then formed by the axis of the equator and the axis of the ecliptic was 6° 9* 34^, decreafing hourly 1 minute of a degree.—By the mean of three good obfer¬ vations, the diameter of Venus on the fun was 58”. Mr Short made his obfervations at Savile-houfe, in London, 30 feconds in time weft from Greenwich, in prefence of his royal highnefs the duke of York, accom¬ panied by their royal highneffes prince William, prince Henry, and prince Frederick.—He firft faw Venus on the fun, through flying clouds, at 46 minutes 37 feconds after 5 o’clock; and at 6 hours 15 minutes 12 feconds he meafured the diameter of Venus 59 W .8.—He after¬ ward found it to be 58 // .9, when the Iky was more fa¬ vourable.—And, through a reflecting telefcope -of two feet focus, magnifying 140 times, he found the internal contaCt of Venus with the fun’s limb, to be at 8 hours 18 minutes 2 It feconds, apparent time; which being redu¬ ced to the apparent time at Greenwich, was 8 hours 18 minutes 5feconds; fo that his time of feeing the con¬ tact was 8-y feconds fooner (in abfolute time) than the in- ftant of its being feen at Greenwich. Meffrs Ellicott and Dollond obferved the Internal con- N O M Y. taCt at Hackney; and their time of feeing it, reduced to the time at Greenwich, was at 8 hours 18 minutes 56 feconds, which was 4 feconds fooner in abfolute time than the contaCt was feen at Greenwich. Mr Canton’ in Spittle-Square, London, 1 1 \" weft of Greenwich, (equal to 16 feconds 44 thirds of time), meafured the fun’s diameter 31' 33\" 24^, and the dia¬ meter of Vehus on the fun 38^; and, by obfervation, found the apparent time of the internal contaCt of Venus with the fun’s limb to be at 8 hours 18 minutes 41 fe¬ conds ; which, by reduction, was only 2^ feconds fliort of the time at the Royal Obfervatory at Greenwich. The Reverend Mr Richard Haydon, at Lelkeard in Cornwall, (16 minutes 10 feconds in time weft from Lpndon, as ftated by Dr Bevis), obferved the internal contaCt to be at 8 hours o minutes 20 feconds, which, by reduction, was 8 hours 16 minutes 30 feconds at Greenwich; fo'that he muft have feen it 2 minutes 30 feconds fooner in abfolute time than it was feen at Green¬ wich ;—a difference by much too great to be occafioned by the difference of parallaxes. But by a memorandum of Mr Hayden’s fome years before, it appears that he then fuppofed his weft longitude to be near two minutes more; which brings his time to agree within half a mi¬ nute of the time at Greenwich; to which the parallaxes will very nearly anfwer. At Stockholm Obfervatory, latitude 59 0 20^ north, and longitude 1 hour 12 minutes eaft from Greenwich, the whole of the tranfit was vifible : the total ingrefs was obferved by Mr Wargentin to be at 3 hours 39 minutes 23 feconds in the morning, and the beginning of egrefs at 9 hours 30 minutes 8 feconds ; fo that the whole du¬ ration between the two internal contacts, as feen at that place, was 5 hours 50 minutes 43 feconds. ’ At Torneo in Lapland, (1 hour 27 minutes 28 feconds eaft of Paris), Mr Hellant, who is efteemed a very good obferver, found the total ingrefs to be at 4 hours 3 mi¬ nutes 39 feconds, and the beginning of egrefs to be 9 hours 54 minutes 8 feconds.—So that the whole dura¬ tion between the two internal contacts was 3 hours 50 minutes 9 feconds. At Hemofand in Sweden, (latitude 6° 38’ north, and longitude 1 hour 2 minutes 12 feconds eaft of Paris), Mr Gifter obferved the total ingrefs to be at 3 hours 38 minutes 26 feconds; and the beginning of egrefs to be at 9 hours 29 minutes 21 feconds;—the duration between thefe two internal contacts 3 hours 30 minutes 56 feconds. Mr De La Lande, at Paris, obferved the beginning of egrefs to be at 8 hours 28 minutes 26 feconds appa¬ rent time.—But Mr Ferner (who was then at Conflans, 14% weft of the Roysl Obfervatory at Paris) obferved the beginning of egrefs to be at 8 hours 28 minutes 29 feconds true time. The equation, or cjjfference between the true and apparent time, was 1 minute 34 feconds.— The total ingrefs, being before the fun role, could not be feen. At Tobol lit in Siberia, Mr Chappe obferved the total ingrefs to be at 7 hours o minutes 28 feconds in the morning, and the beginning of egrefs to be at 49 minutes 2Or feconds after 12 at noon.—So that the whole dura¬ tion of the tranfit between the internal contacts was- 5 hours"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"A S T R O N O M Y. 43? hours 48 minutes 52-y feconds, as feen at that place; which was 2 minutes 34 feconds lefs than as feen at Her- nofand in Sweden. At Madrals, the-Reverend Mr Hirft obferved the total ingrefs to be at 7 hour-s 47 minutes 55 feconds apparent time in the morning, and the beginning of egrefs at 1 hour 39 minutes 38 feconds pad: noon.—The duration between thefe two internal contacts was 5 hours 51 mi¬ nutes 43 feconds. Profeffor Mathenci at Bologna obferved the beginning of egrefs to be at 9 hours 4 minutes 58 feconds. At Calcutta, (latitude 22 0 30' north, nearly 92 0 eaft longitude from London), Mr William Magee obferved the total ingrefs to be at 8 hours 20 minutes 58 feconds in the morning, and the beginning of egrefs to be at 2 hours 11 minutes 34 feconds in the afternoon ; the du¬ ration between the two internal contacts 5 hours 50 mi¬ nutes 36 feconds. At the Cape of Good Hope, (1 hour 13 minutes 35 feconds eaft from Greenwich), Mr Mafon obferved the beginning of egrefs to be at 9 hours 39 minutes 50 fe¬ conds in the morning. All thefe times are collected from the obfervers ac¬ counts, printed in the Philofophical Tranfadfions for the years 1762 and 1763, in which there are feveral other other accounts that are not tranfcribed.—The inftants of Venus’s total exit from the fun are likewife mentioned, but they are here left out, as not of any ule for finding the fun’s parallax. - Whoever compares thefe times of the internal contacts, as given in by different obfervers, will find fuch differ¬ ences among them, even thofe which were taken upon the fame fpot, as will (hew, that the inftant of either contact could not be fo accurately perceived by the ob¬ fervers as Dr Halley thought it could ; which probably arifes from the difference of peoples eyes, and the dif¬ ferent magnifying powers of thofe telefcopes through which the contacts were feen.—If all the obfervers had made ufe of equal magnifying powers, there can be no doubt but that the times would have more nearly coinci¬ ded; fince it is plain, that fuppofing all their eyes to be equally quick and good, they whofe telefcopes magnified moll would perceive the point of internal contact fooheft, and of the total exit lateft. Mr Short, in a paper publifhed in the Philofophical Tranfadtions, Vol; LII. Part II. has taken an incredible deal of pains in deducing the quantity of the fun’s pa¬ rallax, from the beft of thofe obfervations which were made both in Britain and abroad; and finds it to have been 8\". 5 2 on the day of the tranfit when the fun was very nearly at his greateft diftance from the earth; and confequently 8\".65 when the fun is at his mean diftance from the earth. The log. fine (or tangent) of 8\".65 is 5.6219140, which being fubtradled from the radius 10.0000000, leaves remaining the logarithm 4.3780860, whofe num¬ ber is 23882.84; which is the number of femidiameters of the earth that the fun is diftant from it.—And this laft number, 23882.84, being multiplied by 3985, the number of Englifh miles contained in the earth’s femidi- ameter, gives 95,173,117 miles from the earth’s mean diftance from the fun.—But becaufe it is impoflible, from the niceft obfervations of the fun’s parallax, to be fure of his true diftance from the earth within 100 miles, we lhall at prefent, for the fake of round numbers, ftate the earth’s mean diftance frem the fun at 95,173,000 Englifh miles. And then, from the numbers and analogies in § 11. & 14. of Mr Short’s differtation, we find the mean diftances of all the reft of the planets from the fun, in miles, to be as follows.—Mercury’s diftance, 36,841,468 ; Venus’s di¬ ftance, 68,891,486 *, Mars’s diftance, 145,014,148; Ju¬ piter’s diftance, 494,990,976; and Saturn’s diftance, 907,956,130. The femidiameter of the earth’s annual orbit being e- qual to the earth’s mean diftance from the fun, viz. 95,173,000 miles; the whole diameter thereof' is 190,346 ,ooq miles.- And fince the circumference of a circle is to its diameter as 355 is to 113, the circumfe¬ rence of the earth’s orbit is 597,989,646 miles. And, as the earth defcribes this orbit in 365 days 6 hours (or in 8766 houirs) it is plain that it travels at the rate of 68,216.9 miles every hour; and confequent¬ ly 1136.9 miles every minute; fo that its velocity in its orbit is at leaft 142 times as great as the velocity of a cannon-ball, fuppofing the ball to move through 8 miles in a minute, which it is found .to do very nearly: And at this rate it would take 22 years 228 days for a .cannon¬ ball to go from the earth to the fun. Oh the 3d of June, in the year 1769, Venus agairr paffed over the fun’s diflc, in fuch a manner, as to afford a 1 much eafier and better method of inveftigating the fun’s parallax than her tranfit in the year 1761; But as few of the obfervations upon this tranfit have as yet been\" made public, we can only give the following, made by different obfervers at London.

' They all obferved the black pro¬ tuberance in the.internal contact. They likewife, after the internal contadl, faw a luminous ring round the bo¬ dy of Venus, about the thicknefs of half her femi-dia- rneter; it was bl ighted towards Venus’s body, and gra¬ dually dirainiihed in ifplendor at greater diftance, but the whole was excefiive white and faint. Venus may have a fatellite or moon, although it be undifeover-ed by us : which will not appear very fur- piifing, if we confider how inconveniently we are placed from feeing it. For its enlightened fide can never be fully turned towards us, but when Venus is beyond the fun; and then, as Venus appears little bigger than an ordinary /tar, her moon may be too fmall to be percei¬ ved. at fueh a didance. When ihe is between us and the fun, her full moon has its dark fide towards us ; and then we cannot fee it any more than we can our own moon at the time of change. When Venus is at her greated elongation, we have but one half of the enlighten¬ ed fide of her full moon towards us; and even then it may be too far didant to be feen by us. The Earth’ is the-next planet above Venus in the fydem.. It is 82 millions of miles from the fun, and gees round him (as in the circle @) in 365 days 5 hours, 49 minutes, from any equinox or foldice to the fame again; but from any fixed dar to the fame again, as feen from the fun, in 365 days 6 hours and 9 minutes ; the .former being the length of the tropical year, and the latter the length of the fyderiaL It travels the rate of 58 thoufand miles every hour; which motion, though •120 times fwifter than that of a cannon-ball, is little more than half as ftvift as Mercury’s motion in his or¬ bit. The earth’s diameter is 79,70 miles; and by turn¬ ing round its axis every 24 hours from wed to eaft, it ca,ufes an apparent diurnal motion of all the heavenly bo¬ dies from ead to wed. By this rapid motion of the earth on its axis,- the inhabitants about the equator are carried 1042 miles every hour, whild thofe on the pa¬ rallel of London are carried only about 58b, befides the 58 thoufand miles by the annual motion above mention-, ■ ed, which is common to- all places whatever. The earth’s axis makes an angle of 23-r degrees with the axis of its orbit, and keeps always the fame oblique dire&ion, inclining towards the fame fixed dars through¬ out its annual courfe, which caufes the returns of fpring, fummer, autumn, and winter; as will be explained af¬ terwards. The earth is round like a globe; as appears, 1. By its fhadow in eclipfes of the moon, which fhadow is al¬ ways bounded by a circular ring. 2. By our feeing the mads of a /hip whild the hull is hid by the convexity of the v/ater. 3. By its having been failed round by many navigators. The hills take off no more from the round- nefs of the earth in comparifon, than grains of dud do from the roundnefs of a common globe. The feas and unknown parts of the earth (by a mea- N O M Y. furement of the bed maps) contain 160 million 522 thon- fand and 26 fquare miles; the inhabited parts 38 mil¬ lion 990 thoufand 569.: Europe 4 million 456 thoufand and 65; Afia, 10 million 768 thoufand 823; Africa, 9 million 654 thoufand 807 ; America, 14 million no thoufand 874. In all, 199 million 512 thoufand 59s ; which is the number of fquare miles on the -whole fur- face of our globe. The Moon is not a planet, but only a fatellite or at¬ tendant of the earth ; going round the earth from change to change in 29 days 12 hours and 44 minutes; and round the Inn with it every year. The moon’s diameter is 2180 miles; and her didance from the earth’s centre 240 thoufand. She goes round her orbit in 27 days yhouis 43 minutes, moving about 2290 miles every hour; and turns round her axis exactly in the fame time that {ha goes round the earth, which is the reafon of her keep¬ ing always the fame fide towards us, and that her day and night, taken together, is as long as oiir lunar month. The moon is an opaque globe like the earth, and /hines only by reflecting the light of the fun: Therefore whild that half of her which is toward the fun is enlightened, the other half mod be dark and invifible. Hence, (he difappears when ihe comes between us and the fun; be-, caufe her dark fide is then towards us. When /he is gone a little way forward, we fee a little of her enlight¬ ened, fide; which dill encreafes to our view, as /he ad¬ vances forward, until /he comes to be oppofite the fun ; and then her whole enlightened fide is towards the earth, and /he appears with a round, illumined orb, which we call the full moon ; her dark tide being then turned a- way from the earth. From the full file feerns to decreafe gradually as /he goes through the other half of her courfe; /hewing us lefs-and lels of her enlightened “fide every day, till her next change or conjunction with the fun, and then /lie difappears as before. This continual change of the moon’s phafes demon- ftrates that /he /bines not by any light of her own; for if /he did, being globular, we /hould always fee her with a round full orb like the fun. Her orbit is reprefented, in the fclieme by the little circle m, upon the earth’s or¬ bit ©, Plate X.XXIX. fig. 1.; bpt it is drawn fifty times too large in proportion to the earth’s; and yet is al- moft too fmall to be leen in the diagram. The moon has fcarce any difference of feafons ; her axis being almo /1 perpendicular to the ecliptic. What' is very fingular, one half of her has no darknefs at all ? the earth con/fantly affording it a ftrong light in the fun’s abfence; while the other half has a fortnight’s darknefs, and a fortnight’s light by turns. Our earth is a moon to the moon, waxing and waning regularly, but appearing thirteen times as big; and af¬ fording her thirteen times as much light as /he does to us. When /lie changes to us, the earth appears full to her; and when /he is in her firft quarter to us, the earth is in its third quarter to her; and vice verfa. But from one half of the moon, the earth is never feen at all; from the middle of the other half, it is al¬ ways feen ovet head; turning round almoft thirty times as quick as the moon does. From the circle which li¬ mits our view of the moon, only one half of the earth’s fide"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"ASTRO fide next her is feen ; the other half being hid below the horizon of all places on that circle. To her the earth feems to be the largeft body in the univerfe, for it ap¬ pears thirteen times as large as fhe does to us. The moon has no atmofphere of any vifible denfity furrounding her; for if fhe had, we could never fee her edge fo well defined as it appears ; but there would be a fort of a mift or hazinefs around her, which would make the ftars look fainter, when they are feen through it. But obfervation proves, that the ftais which difappear behind the moon retain their full luftre until they l'eem to touch her very edge, and then they vanifli m a mo¬ ment. The faint light which has been feen all around the moon in total eclipfes of the fun, has been obferved, during the time of darknefs, to have its centre coincident with the centre of the fun; and was therefore much more likely to arife from the atmofphere of the fun than from that of the moon ; for if it had been owing to the latter, its centre would have gone along with the moon’s. If there were feas in the moon, flic could have no clouds, rains, nor florms, as we have; becaufe fhe has no fuch atmofphere to fupport the vapours which occafion them. And every one knows, that when the moon is above our horizon in the night'time, fhe is vifible, un- lefs the clouds of our atmofphere hide her from our view, and all parts of her appear conflantly with the fame clear, ferene, and calm afpedt. But thofe dark parts of the moon, which were formerly thought to be feas, are now found to .be only vafl deep cavities, and places which reflect not the fun’s light fo ftrongly as o- thers, having many caverns and pits, whofe fhadows fall within theip, and are always dark on the fides next the fun, which detnonflrates their being hollow; and moll of thefe pits have little knobs like hillocks Handing with¬ in them, and calling fhadows alfo; which caufe thefe thefe places to appear darker than others which have fewer or lefs remarkable caverns. All thefe appear¬ ances fhew, that there are no feas in the moon; for if there were any, their furfaces would appear fmooth and even, like thofe on the earth. There being no atmofphere about the moon, the hea¬ vens in the day-time have the appearance of night to a lunarian who turns his back toward the fun; and when he does, the liars appear as bright to him as they do in the night to us. For it is entirely owing to our atmo¬ fphere that the heavens are bright about us in the day. As the earth turns round its axis, the feveral conti¬ nents, feas, and iflands appear to the moon’s inhabitants like fo many fpots of different forms and brightnefs, mo¬ ving over its furface, but much fainter at fome times than others, as our clouds cover them or leave them. By thefe fpots, the lunarians can determine the time of the earth’s diurnal motion, jufl as we do the motion of the fun; and perhaps they meafure their time by the motion of the earth’s fpots, for they cannot have a truer dial. The moon’s axis is fo nearly perpendicular to the ec¬ liptic, that the fun never removes fenfibly from her equa¬ tor ; and the obliquity of her orbit, being only j-j- de¬ grees, which is next to nothing as feen from the fun, cannot caufe the fun to decline fenfibly from her equator. Yet her inhabitants are not.deftitute of means for afcer- Vol. I. No. 19. 3 N O M Y. 44* taining the length of their year, though their method and ours mull differ. For we can know the length of our year by the return of our equinoxes-; but the luna¬ rians, having always equal day and night, mull have recourfe to another method; and we may fuppofe, they meafure their year by obferving when either of the poles of our earth begins to be enlightened, and the other to difappear, which is always at our equinoxes, they being conveniently fituated for obferving great tracks of land about our earth’s poles, which are entirely unknown to us. Hence we may conclude, that the year is of the fame abfolute length both to the earth and moon, though very different as to the number of days ; we having 365 } natural days, and the lunarians only i2-r?> every day and night in the mqon-being as long as 29* on the earth. The moon’s inhabitants on the fide next the earth may as eafily find the longitude of their places as we can find the latitude of ours. For the earth keeping conflantly, or very nearly fo, over one meridian of the moon, the eafl or weft diftances of places from that meridian are as eafily found as we can find our diflance from the equator by the altitude of our celeftial poles. The planet Mars is next in order, being the firft above the earth’s orbit. His diflance from the fun is computed to be 125 millions of miles; and by travelling at the rate of 47 thoufand miles every hour, as in the circle cf, he goes round the fun in 636 of our days and 23 hours; which is the length of his year, and contains 6674 of his days, every day and night together being 40 minutes longer than with us. His diameter is 4444 miles, and by his diurnal rotation the inhabitants about his equator are carried 556 miles every hour. His quan-' tity of i : g ht and heat is equal but to one half of ours ; and the fuu appears but half as big to him as to us. This planet being but a fifth part fo big as the earth, if any moon attends him, fhe muft be very fmall, and has not yet been difeovered by our beft telefcopes. He is of a fiery red colour, and by his appulfes to fome of the fixed ftars feems to be encompaffed by a very grofs atmofphere. He appears fometimes gibbous, but never horned; which both fhews that his orbit includes the earth’s within it, and that he fliines not by his own light. To Mars, our earth and moon appear like two moons, a bigger and a lefs, changing places with one another, and appearing fometimes horned, fometimes half or three quarters illuminated, but never full, nor at molt above one quarter of a degree from each other, although they are 240 thoufand miles afunder. Our earth appears almoft as big to Mars as Venus does to us, and at Mars it is never feen above 48 degrees from the fun; fometimes it appears to pafs over the diflc of the fun, and fo do Mercury and Venus ; but Mercury can never be feen from Mars by fuch eyes as ours, unaf- fifted by proper inflruments; and Venus will be as feldom feen as we fee Mercury. Jupiter and Saturn are as vi¬ fible to Mars as to us. His axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic, and his orbit is 2 degrees inclined to it. Jupiter, the largeft of all the planets, is Hill higher in the fyfteni, being about 426 millions of miles from the fun; and going at the rate of 2 5 thoufand miles every hour in his orbit, as in the circle 2/, finifhes his annual 5 T period"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"44 2 ASTRO Period in eleven of oar years 314 days-and 12 hours. He is about 1000 times as big as the earth, for his dia¬ meter is 8t,ooomiles ; which is more than ten times the diameter of the earth. Jupiter turns round his axis in 9 hours 56 minutes; fo that his year contains 10 thoufand 470 days; and the diurnal velocity of his equatoreal parts is greater than the dwiftnefs-with which he moves in his annual orbit; a lingular circumflance, as far as we know By this pro¬ digious quick rotation, his equatoreal inhabitants are car¬ ried 25 thoufand 920 miles every hour, (which is 920 miles an hour more than an inhabitant of our earth’s e- quator moves in twenty-four hours), befidesthe 25 thou¬ fand above mentioned, which is common to all parts of his fur face, by his annual motion. Jupiter is furrounded by faint fubft&nces, called belts, in which fo many changes appear, that they are generally thought to be clouds; for fome of them have been firft interrupted and broken, and then have vanilhed entirely. They have fometimes been obferved of different breadths, and afterwards have all become nearly of the fame breadth. Large fpots have been feen in thefe belts ; and when a belt vanifhes, the contiguous fpots difappear with it. The broken ends of fome belt9 have been ge¬ nerally obferved to revolve in the fame time with the fpots; only thofe nearer the equator in fomewhat lefs time than thofe near the poles, perhaps on account of the fun’s greater heat near the equator, which is parallel to the belts and courfe of the fpots. Several large fpots, which appeaf round at one time, grow oblong by de¬ grees, and then divide into two or three round fpots. The periodical time of the fpots near the equator is 9 hours 50 minutes, but of thofe near the poles 9 nours 56 minutes. The axis of Jupiter is fo nearly perpendicular to his orbit,, that he has no fenfible change of feafons; which is a great advantage, and wifely ordered by the Author of nature. For if the axis of this planet were inclined any confiderable number of degrees, juft fo many degrees round each pole would in their turn be almoft fix of our years together in darknefs. And -as each degree of a great circle on Jupiter contains 706 of our miles at a mean rate, it is eafy to judge what vaft tradls of land would be rendered uninhabitable by any confiderable in¬ clination of his axis. The fun appears but part fo big to Jupiter as to us ;. and his light and heat are in the fame fmall proportion, but compenfated by the quick returns thereof, and by four moons (fome larger and fome lefs than our earth) which revolve about him ; fo that there is fcarce any part of this huge- planet but what is, \"during the whole night, enlightened by one or more of thefe moons, ex¬ cept his poles, whence only the fartheft moons can be feen, and where their light is not wanted, becaufe the fun conftantly circulates in or near the horizon, and is very probably kept in view of both poles by the refrac¬ tion of Jupiter’s atmofphere, which, if it be like ours, has certainly refractive power enough for that purpofe. 'I he orbits of thefe moons are reprefented in the fcheme’of the folar fyftenti by four fmall- circles marked i\\ 2,3,4, on, Jupiter’s orbit ; but they are drawn fifty N O M Y. times too large in proportion to it. The firft moon, or that neareft to Jupiter, goes round him in 1 day 18 hours and 36 minutes of our time; and is 229 thoufand miles diftant from his centre; the fecond performs its revolution in three days 13 hours and 15 minutes, at 364 thoufand miles diftance; the third in feven days three hours and 59 minutes, at the diftance of 580 thoufand miles; and the fourth, or outermoft, in 16 days 18 hours and 30 minutes, at the diftance of one million of miles from his centre. The periods of thefe moons are fo incommen- furate to one another, that if ever they were all in a right line between Jupiter and the fun, it will require more than 3,000,000,000,000 years from that time to bring them all intothe fame right line again, as any one will find who reduces all their periods into feconds, then mul¬ tiplies them into one another, and divides the product by 432 ; which is the higheft number that will divide the produCl of all their periodical times, namely,. 42,085,303,376,931,994,955,1,04 feconds, without a remainder. The angles under whjch the orbits of Jupiter’s moons • are feen from the earth, at its mean diftance from Jupi¬ ter, are as follow: The firft, 3' 55\": the fecond, b' 14\"; the third, 9' 58''’; and the fourth, 17' d And their diftances from Jupiter, meafured by his lemi- diameters, are thus: The firft, 54; the fecond, 9; the, third, 14II; and the fourth, 25f-|. This planet, feen from its neareft moon, appears 1000 times as large as our moon does to us; waxing and waning in ali her monthly fhapes every 42^ hours. Jnpiter’s three neareft moons fall into his fhadow, and are eclipfed in every revolution; but the orbit of the fourth moon is fo much inclined, that it pafleth by its oppofition to Jupiter, without falling into his Ihadow, two years in every fix. By thefe eclipfes, aftronomers have not only difeovered that the fun’s light takes up eight m'nutes of time in coming to us, but they have al- fo determined the longitudes of places on this eartn with greater certainty and -facility than by any other method yet known. The difference between the equatoreal ' and polar dia¬ meters of Jupiter is 6230 miles; for his equatoreal dia¬ meter is to his polar, as 13 to 12. So that his poles are 3115 miles nearer his centre than his equator is. Jupiter’s orbit is 1 degree 20 minutes inclined to the ecliptid. His north node is in the 7th degree of Cancer, \"and his fouth node in the 7th degree of Capricorn. SaturjT, the remoteft of all the planets, is about 7S0 millions t)f miles from the fun; and, travelling at the rate of 18 thoufand miles every hour, as in the circle marked performs its annual circuit in 29 years 167 days and 5 hours of our time; which makes only one year to that planet. Its diameter is 67,600 miles; and therefore it is near 600 times as big as the earth. 't his planet is furrounded by a thin broad ring, as an artificial globe is by a horizon,, fig. 5. The ring ap¬ pears double when feen through a good telefcope, and is reprefented by the figure in fuch an oblique view as it is generally feen. It is inclined 30 degrees to the ecliptic, and is about 21 thoufand miles in breadth; which is e- qual to its diftance from Saturn on all fides. There is reafon"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"A S T R C reafon to believe that the ring turns round its axis, be- caufe, when it is almoft edge-wife to us, it appears fome- what thicker on one fide of the planet than on the other; and the thickeft edge has been feen on different fides at different times. But Saturn having no vifible fpots on his body, whereby to determine the time of liis turn¬ ing round his axis, the-length of his days and nights, and the pofition of his axis, are unknown to us. To Saturn, the fun appears only ^th part fo big as to us ; and the light and heat he receives from the fun are in the fame proportion to ours. But to compenfate for the fmall quantity of fun-light, he has five moons, all going round him on the outfide of his ring, and near¬ ly on the fame plane with it. The firff, or nearelf moon to Saturn, goes round him in i day 21 hours 19 minutes; and is 140 thoufand miles from his centre: The lecond, in 2 days 17 hours 40 minutes ; at the diltanec of 187 thoufand miles: The third, in 4 days 12 hours 25 mi¬ nutes,. at 263 thoufand miles dillance : T he fourth, in 15 days 22 hours 41 minutes, at the diftance of 600 thoufand miles : And the fifth or outermoll, at one million 800 thoufaftd miles from Saturn’s centre, goes round him in 79 days 7 hours 48 minutes. Their or¬ bits, in the fcheme of the folar fyftem,. are reprefent- ed by the fmall five circles, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on Saturn’s orbit; but thefe, like the orbits of the other fatellites, are drawn fifty times too large in proportion to the orbits of their primary planets. The fun Urines aim oft fifteen of our years together cn one fide of Saturn’s ring without fetting, and as long on the other in its turn. So that the ring is vifible to the inhabitants of that planet for almoft fifteen of oyr years, and as long invifible by turns, if its axis has no inclina¬ tion to its ring: But if the axis of the planet be inclined to the ring, fuppofe about 30 degrees, the ring Will ap¬ pear and difappear once every natural day to all the inha¬ bitants within 30 degrees of the equator, on both fides, frequently eclipfing the fun in a Saturnian day. More¬ over, if Saturn’s axis be fo inclined to his ring, it is per¬ pendicular to his orbit; and thereby the inconvenience of different feafons to that planet is avoided. For con- fulering the length of Saturn’s year, which is almoft e- qual to thirty of ours, what a dreadful condition mull' the inhabitants of his polar regions be in, if they be half that time deprived of the light and heat of the fun ? ■ which is not their cafe alone, if the axis of the planet be perpendicular to the ring, for then the ring muft hide the fun from vaft tracks of land on each fide of the equa¬ tor for 13 or 14 of our years together, on the louth fide and north fide by turns, as the axis inclines to or from the fun : The reverfe of which inconvenience is another good prefumptive proof of the inclination of Saturn’s axis to its ring, and aifo of his axis being perpendicular to his. orbit. This ring, feen from Saturn, appears like a vaft lumi? nous arch in the heavens, , as if it did not belong to the planet. When we fee the ring moft open, its lhadow up¬ on the planet is broadeft; and from that time the lhadow grows narrower, as the ring appears to do to us; until, by Saturn’s annual motion, the fun comes to the plane of the ring, or even with its edge; which being then direct- 1 N O M Y. *H3 ed towards us, becomes invifiule on account of its tliin- nefs ; as lhall be explained afterwards. The ring difap- pears twice in every annual revolution of Saturn, namely, when he is in the 19th degree both of Pifces and of Vir¬ go. And when Saturn is in the middle between thefe points, or in the 19th degree either of Gemini or of Sa¬ gittarius, hiS ling appears moft open to us ; and then its longeft diameter is to its Ihorteft, as 9 to 4. To fuch eyes as ours, unaffifted by inftruments, Ju¬ piter is the only planet that can be feen from Saturn, and Saturn the only planet that can be feen froip Jupiter. So that the inhabitants of thefe two planets muft either fee much farther than we do, or have equally good in¬ ftruments to carry their fight to remote objefts, if they know that there is fuch a body as our earth iri the uni- verfe: For the earth is no bigger, feco from Jupiter, than his moons are feen from the earth ; and if his large body had not firft attracted our fight, and prompted our curie- fity to view him with the telefcope, we Ihould never have know'll any thing of his moons ; unlefs by chance we had directed the telefcope toward that fmall part of the heavens where they were at the time of obfervation. And the like is true of the moons of Saturn. The orbit of Saturn is 2-J degrees inclined to the e- cliptic, or orbit of our earth, and interfefts it in the 21ft degree of Cancer and of Capricorn; fo that Saturn’s nodes are only 14 degrees from Jupiter’s. The quantity of light, afforded by the fun to Jupiter, being but ^th part, and to Saturn only -^th part, of what we enjoy, may, at firft thought, induce ns to be ¬ lieve that thefe two planets are entirely unfit for rational beings to dwell upon. But, that their light is not fo weak as we imagine, is evident from their brightnefs in the night-time ; and alfo front this remarkable pheno¬ menon, that when tlte fun is fo much eclipfed to us, as to have only the 40th part of his -<Mc left uncovered by the moon, the decreafe of light is not very fenfible; and juft at the end of darknefs in total ecfpfes, when his weftern limb begins to be vifible, and feems no bigger than a bit of fine filver wire, every one is furprifed'at the brightnefs wherewith that fmall part of him fhines. The moon, when full,, affords travellers light enough to keep' them from mittaking their way; and yet, according to Dr Smith, it is equal to no more than a 90 theufandth part of the light of the fan : That is, the fttn’s light is- 90 thoufand times as ftrong as the light of the moon when full, Confequently, the fun gives a thoniand times as much light to Saturn a* the full moon does to- us; and above three thoufand times as much to Jupiter. So that thefe two planets* even without any moons,, would be much more enlightened than we at firft ima¬ gine ; and by- having fo many, they may be very com¬ fortable places of residence. Their hear, fo far as it de¬ pends on the force of the fun’s rays* is certainly much lefs than ours-; to which no doubt the bodies of their inhabitants-are as well adapted as ours are to the feafons we enjoy.. And if we confider, that Jupiter never has any winter, even at his poles, which probably is alfo the cafe with Saturn, the cold cannot be fo iatenfe on thefe two planets as is generally imagined. Befide§* there may be fomething in their naturo or foil much warmer than"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"444 A S T R O than in that of our earth : And we find that all our heat depends not on the rays of the fun; for if it did, we fliould always have the fame months equally hot or cold at their annual returns. But it is far otherwife, for Fe¬ bruary is fometimes warmer than May ; which mull be owing to vapours and exhalations from the earth. Every perfon who looks upon, and compares the fyf- tems of moons together, which belong to Jupiter and Sa¬ turn, mull be amazed at the vaft magnitude of thefe two planets, and the noble attendance they have in refpeCt of our little earth ; and can never bring himfelf to think, that an infinitely wife Creator Ihould difpofe of all his animals and vegetables here, leaving the other planets bare and deftitute of rational creatures.' To fuppole that he had any view to our benefit, in creating thefe moons, and giving them tlreir motions round Jupiter and Saturn; to imagine that he intended thefe vaft bodies for any ad¬ vantage to us, when he well knew' that they could never be fecn but by a few aflronomers peeping through tele- fcopes ; and that lie gave to the planets regular returns of days and nights, and different feafons to all where they would be convenient; but of no manner of fervice to us, except only what immediately regards our own planet the eat th ; to imagine that he did all this on our account, would be charging him impioufly with having done much in vain; and as abfurd, as to imagine that lie has created a lit¬ tle fun and a planetary fyftem within the (hell of our earth, and intended them for our ufe. Thefe confede¬ rations amount to little lefs than a pofitive proof, that all the planets are inhabited : For if they are not, why all this care in furnifhing them with fo many moons, to fupply thofe with light which are at the greater diftances from the fun ? Do we not fee, that the farther a planet is from the fun, the greater apparatus it has for that pur- pofe ? fave only Mars, which being but a fmall planet, may have moons too fmall to be feen by us. We know that the earth goes round the fun, and turns round its own axis, to produce the viciffitudes„ of fummer and winter by the former, and of day and night by the latter motion, for the benefit of its inhabitants. May we not then fairly conclude, by parity of reafon, that the end and defign of all the other planets is the fame ? and is not this agreeable to the beautiful harmony which exifts throughout the liniverfe ? In fig. 2. we have a view of the proportional brehdth of the fun’s face or diflc, as feen from the different planets. The fun is reprefented, N° i, as feen from Mercury; N° 2, as feen from Venus; N° 3, as feen from the earth ; N° 4, as feen from Mars; N° 5, as feen from Jupiter ; and N° 6, as feen from Saturn. Let the circle B, (fig. 3.) be the fun as feen from any pla¬ net, at a given diftance ; to another planet, at double that diftance, the fon will appear juft of half that breadth, as A, which contains only one fourth part of the area, or furface of B. For all circles, as well as fquare furfaces, are to one another as the fquares of their dia¬ meters. Thus, (fig. 4.) the fquare A is juft half as broad as the fquare B ; and yet it is plain to fight, that B contains four times as much furface as A. Hence, by comparing the diameters of the above circles (fig. 2.) together, it will lie found, that, in round numbers, the fun appears N O M Y. 7 times larger to Mercury than to us, 90 times larger to us than to Saturn, and 630 times as large to Mercury as to Saturn. In fig. 5. we have a view of the bulks of the planets in proportion to each other, and to a fuppofed globe of two feet diameter for the fun. The earth is 27 times as big as Mercury, very little bigger than Venus, five times as big as Mars ; but Jupiter is 1049 times as big as the earth ; Saturn 586 times as big, exclufive of his ring ; and the fun is 877 thoufand 650 times as big as the earth. If the planets in this figure were fet at their due diftances from a fun of two feet diameter, according to their proportional bulks, as in our fyftem, Mercury would be 28 yards from the fun’s centre ; Venus y t yards 1 foot; the earth 70 yards 2 feet; Mars 107 yards 2 feet; Jupiter 370 yards 2 feet; and Saturn 760 yards two feet; the comet of the year 1680, at its greateft diftance, 10 thoufand 760 yards. In this pro¬ portion, the moon's diftance from the centre of the earth would be only 74 inches. To aflift the imagination in forming an idea of the vaft diftances of the fun, planets, and liars, let us fuppofe, that a body projected from the fun fliould continue to fly with the fwiftnefs of a cannon-ball, /. e. 480 miles every hour; this body would reach the orbit of Mercu¬ ry, in 7 years 221 days ; of Venus, in 14 years 8 days; of the earth, in 19 years 91 days; of Mars, in 29 years 85 days ; of Jupiter, in 100 years 280 days; of Sa¬ turn, in 184 years 240 days ; to the comet of 1680, at its greateft diftance from the fun, in 2660 years; and to the neareft fixed Itars, in about 7 million 600 thou¬ fand years. As the earth i« not the centre of the orbits in which the planets move, they come nearer to it and go farther from it, and at different times; on which account they appear bigger and lefs by tuens. Hence, the apparent magnitudes of the planets are not always a certain rule to know them by. Under fig. 3. are the names and characters of the twelves figns of the zodiac, which the reader fhould be perfectly well acquainted with, fo as to know the cha¬ racters without feeing the names. Every fign contains 30 degrees, as in the circle bounding the folar fyftem; to which the characters of the figns are fet in their pro¬ per places. The Comets are folid opaque bodies, with long tranfparent trains or tails, iffuing from that fide which is turned away from the fun. They ipove about the fun in very excentric ellipfes ; and are of a much greater den- fity than the earth; for fome of them are heated in eve¬ ry period to fuch a degree, as would vitrify or diflipate any fubftance known to uj. Sir Ifaac Newton computed the heat of the comet which appeared in the year 1680, when neareft the fun, to be 2000 times hotter than red- hot iron; and that, being thus heated, it mult retain its heat until it conies .round again, although its period fliould be more than twenty thoufand years ; and .it is computed to be only 575. .

It is believed that"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"'rruru', -— T“- I □"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"ASTRO that there are at leaft 21 'comets belonging to our fyftem, moving in all forts of directions ; and all thofe which have ^ been obferved, have moved through the etherial regions and the orbits of the planets without fuffering the leaft fenfible reliftance in their motions; which plainly proves that the planets do not move in folid orbs. Of all the comets, the periods of the above mentioned three only are known with^any degree of certainty; The firft of thefe comets appeared in the years 1531, 1607, and 1682; was expeCled to appear again in the year 1758, and every 75th year afterwards. The fecond of them appeared in 1532 !arid 1661, and may be expe&ed to re¬ turn in 1789, and every 129th year afterwards. The third, having 1 aft appeared in 1680, and its period being no lefs than 575 years, cannot return until the year 2 225. This comet, at its greateft diftance, is about 11 thonfand two hundred millions of miles from the fun; and at its leaft diftance from the fun’s centre, which is 490,000 miles, is within lefs than a third part of the fun’s femi- diameter from his fuiface. In that part of its orbit which is neareft the fun, it flies with the amazing fwift- nefs of 880,000 miles in an hour; and the fun, as feen from it, appears an hundred degrees in breadth, confe- quently 40 thoufand times as large as he appears to us. The aftonilhing length that this comet runs out into empty fpace, fuggefts to our minds an idea of the vaft diftance between the fun and the neareft fixed ftars; of of whofe attractions all the comets muft keep clear to return periodically, and go round the fun ; and it Ihews us alfo, that the ' neareft ftars, which are probably thofe that feem the largeft, are as big as our fun, and of thd fame nature with him ; otherwife they could not appear fo laVge and bright to us as they do at fuch an immenfe diftance. The extreme heat, the denfe atmofphere, the grofs vapours, the thaotic ftate of the comets, feem at firft fight to indicate them altogether unfit for the purpofes of animal life, and a moft miferable habitation for ra¬ tional beings ; and therefore fome are of opinion that they are fo many hells for tomenting the damned with perpetual viciflitudes of heat and cold. But when we coniider, on the other hand, the' infinite power 'and goodnefs of the # Deity, the latter inclining, and the former enabling him to make creatures fuited to all ftates and circumftances; that matter exifts only for the fake of intelligent beings ; and that where-ever we find it, we always find it pregnant with life, or neceflarily fubfervient thereto; the numberlefs fpecies, the afto- nilhing diverfity of animals in earth, air, water,.and e- ven on other animals; every blade of grafsj every leaf, every fluid fwarming with life; and every one of thefe enjoying fiich gratifications as the nature and ftate of each requires : When we reflect moreover, that fome centuries ago, till experience undeceived us, a great part of the earth was judged uninhabitable, the torrid zone by reafon of exceflive heat, and the frigid zones be- Caufe of their intolerable cold ; it feems highly pro¬ bable, that fuch numerous and large mafles of durable matter as the comets are, however unlike they be to our earth, are not deftitute of beings capable of contempla¬ ting with wonder, and acknowledging with 'gratitude, Vol. I. Numb. 19. 3 N O M Y. 445 the wifdom, fymmetry, and beauty of the creation ; which is more plainly- to be obferved in their extenlive tour through the heavens, than in our more confined circuit. If farther conjetfture is permitted, may we not fuppofe them inftrumental in recruiting the expanded fuel of the fun, and fupplying the exhaufted moifture of the planets ? However difficult it may be, circumftanced as we are, to find out their particular deftination, this is an undoubted truth, that where-ever the Deity exerts his power, there he alfo manifefts his wifdom and goodnels. The folar fyftem here defcribed is not a late inven¬ tion, for it was known and taught by the wife Samian philofopher Pythagoras, and others among the ancients ; but in latter times was loft, till the 15th century, when it was again reftored by the famous Polifh philofopher, Nicholas Copernicus, who was born at Thorn in the year 1473. In this he was followed by the greateft mathe¬ maticians and philofophers that have fince lived ; as Kepler, Galileo, Defcartes, Gaflendus, and Sir Ifaac Newton; the laft of whom has tftablifhed this fyftem on fuch a foundation of mathematical and phyfical de- monftration, as can never be fhaken. In the Ptolemean fyftem, the earth was fuppofed to be fixed in th etentre-of the univerfe ; and that the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, moved round the earth : Above the planets this hypo- thefis placed the firmament of ftars, and then the two cryftalline fpheres; all which were included in and recei¬ ved motion from the primum mobile, which conftantly resolved about the earth in 24 hours from eaft to weft. But as this rude fcheme was found incapahle to ftandthe teft of art and obfervation, it was foon rejected by all true philofophers. The Tychonic fyftem fucceeded the Ptolemean, but was never fo generally received. In this the earth was fuppofed to ftand ftill in the centre of the univerfe or fir¬ mament of ftars, and the fun to revolve about it every 24 hours 4 the planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, going round the fun in' the times already mentioned. But fome of Tycho’s difciples fuppofed the earth to have a diurnal motion round its axis, and the fun, with all the above planets, to go round the earth in a year; the planets moving round the fun in the forefaid times. This hypothefis, being partly true, apd partly' falfe, was embraced by few ; and foon gave way to the only true and rational fcheme, reftored by Copernicus, and demonftrated by Sir Ifaac Newton. Chap. III. The Phenomena of the Heavens as feen from different Parts of the Earth. We are kept to the earth’s furface on all fides by the power of its Central attraction ; which, laying hold of all bodies according to their denfities or quantities of matter, without regard to their bulks, conftitutes what we call their weight. And having the Iky over our beads, go where we will, and our feet towards the centre of the earth, we call it up over our heads, and down under our feet: Although the fame right line which is down to us, if continued through, and beyond tfie oppolite fide of the 5 U earth."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"^6 A S’ T R C earth, would be up to the inhabitants on the oppofite fide; For, the inhabitants n, i, e, m, s, o, q, 1 , (Plate XXXIX. fig. 6.) ftand with their feet towards the earth’s centre C ; and have the fame figure of iky, N, /, E, M, Sj O, L over their heads. Therefore the point 5 is as diredtly upward to the inhabitant (s) on the fouth pole, as N is to the inhabitant n on the north pole ; fo is E to the inha¬ bitant e, fuppofed to be on the north end of Peru; and ^to the oppofite inhabitant q on the middle of the ifland of Sumatra. Each of thefe obfervers is furpriled that his oppofite or antipode can ftand with his head hanging downwards. But let either go to the other, and he will tell him that he ftood as upright and firm upon the place where he was, as he now ftands where he is.' To all thefe obfervers, the fun, moon, and ftars, feem to turn round the points N and S, as the poles of the fixed axis NCS ; becaufe the earth does really turn round the mathematical line nCs as round an axis, of which n is the north pole, and s the fouth pole. The inhabitant U (PlateXL. fig. i.) affirms that he is on the uppermoft fide of the earth, and wonders how another at L can ftand on the undermoft fide with his head hanging downwards. But U, in the mean time, forgets that in twelve hours time he will be carried half round with the earth’, and then be in the very fitu r ation that L now is, although as far from him as before. And yet, when U comes there, he will find no difference as to his manner of Handing; only he will fee the oppo¬ fite half of the heavens, and imagine the heavens to have gone half round the earth. Wheh we fee a globe hung up in a room, we cannot help imagining it to have an upper and an under fide, and immediately form a like idea of the earth ; from whence we conclude, that it is as impoflible for people to ftand on the under fide of the earth, as for pebbles to lie on the under fide of a common globe, which inftantly fall down from it to the ground; and well they may, becaufe the attraction of the earth, being greater than the attraction of the globe, pulls them away. Juft fo would be the cafe with our earth, if it were placed near a globe much bigger than itfelf, fuch as Jupiter; for then it would really have an upper and an under fide, with refpeCt to that large globe; which, by its attrac¬ tion, would pull away every thing from the fide of the earth next to it; and only thofe on the top of the oppo¬ fite or upper fide could remain upon it. But there is no larger globe near enough our earth to overcome its central attraction ; and therefore it has no fuch thing as an upper and an under fide; for all bodies, on or near its furface, even to the moon, gravitate -.towards its centre. The earth’s bulk is but a point, as that at C, com¬ pared to the heavens; and therefore every inhabitant upon it, let him be where he will, as at n, e, m, s, &c, fees half of the heavens. The inhabitant n, on the: north pole of the earth, conftantly fees the hemifphere EN^_\\ and having the north pole N of the heavens juft over his head, his horizon coincides with the celeftial equator EC<iK Therefore, all the ftars in the northern hemifphere E NQ, between the equator and north pole,, appear to turn round the line YC, moving parallel to theJiorizon.. The equatoreal ftars keep in the horizon, N O M Y. and all thofe in the fouthern hemifphere. ESQ_z.ve invt- fible. The like phenomena are feen by the oblerver (s) on the fouth pole, with refpeCt to the hemifphere ES^_-, and to him the oppofite hemifphere is always invifible. Hence, under either pole, only half of the heavens is feen; for thofe parts which are once vifible never fet, and thofe which are once invifible never rife. But the ecliptic TCX, or orbit which the fun appears to deferibe once a year by the earth’s annual motion, has the half YC conftantly above the horizon ECij>_ of the north pole n ; and the other half CX always below it. Therefore, whilft the fun deferibes the northern half YC pf the e- cliptic, he neither fets to the north pole, nor rifes to the fouth; and whilft he deferibes the fouthern half CX, he neither fets to the fouth pole nor rifes to the north. The fame things are true with refpeCt to the moon; on¬ ly with this difference, that as the fun deferibes the e- cliptic but once a year, he is for half that time vifible to each pole in its turn, and as long invifible; but as the moon goes round the ecliptic in 27 days 8 hours, ffie is only vifible for 13 days 16 hours, and as long invifible to each pole by turns. All the planets likewife rife and fet to the poles, becaufe their orbits are cut obliquely in halves by the horizon of the poles. When the fun (in his apparent way from X) arrives at C, which is on the 20th of March, he is juft riling to an obferver n on the north pole, and letting to another at s on the fouth pole* From C he rifes higher and higher m every apparent di¬ urnal revolution, till he comes to the higheft point of the ecliptic^, on the 21ft of June, and then he is at his greateft altitude, which is 234 degrees, or the arc Ey, equal to his greateft north declination; and from, thence he fesms to defeend gradually in every apparent circumvolution, till he lets at C on the 43d of Septem¬ ber; and then he goes to exhibit the like appearances at the fouth pole for the other half of the year. Hence, the fun’s apparent motion round the earth is not in parallel circles, but in fpirals ; fuch as might be reprefented by a thread wound round a globe from tropic to tropic; the fpirals being at fome diftance from one another about the equator, and gradually nearer to each other as they ap¬ proach toward the tropics. If the obferver be any where on the terreftrial equa¬ tor eCq, as fuppofe at e, he is in the plane of the cele¬ ftial equator; or under the equinoxial ECQj and the axis of the earth n( 7 s is coincident with the plane of his horizon, extended out to N and S,. the north and fouth poles of the heavens. As the earth turns round the line NCS, the whole heavens MO LI feem to turn round the fame line, but the contrary way. It is plain that this obferver has the celeftial poles conftantly in his horizon ; and that his horizon cuts the diurnal paths of all the ce¬ leftial bodies perpendicularly and in .halves. Therefore the fun planets and ftars, rife every day, and afeend per¬ pendicularly above the horizon for fix hours; and, paf- fing over the meridian, defeend in the fame manner for the fix following hours; then fet in the horizon, and continue twelve hours below it. Confequently at the equator the days and nights are equally long throughout the year. W r hen the obferver is in the fituation e, he fees the hemifphere SEN} but in twelve hours after,."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"ASTRO he is carried half round the earth’s axis to q, and then the hemifphere S^JV becomes vifible to him; and SEN difappears. Thus we find, that to an obferver at either of the poles, one half of the fky is always vifible, and the other half never fcen ; but to an obferver on the e- quator, the whole Iky is feen every 24 hours. The figure here referred to, reprefents a celeftial globe of glafs, hating a terreftial globe within it ; after the manner of the glafs-fphere invented by Dr Long, Lowndes’s profeflbr of aftronomy in Cambridge. If a globe be held fidewife to the eye, at feme diftance, and fo that neither of its poles can be feen, the equator EC§>_, and all circles parallel to it, as DL, yzx, abX, MO, See. will appear to be ftraight lines, as projected in this figure; which is requifite to be mentioned here, becaufe we lhall have occafion to call them circles in the following articles of this chapter. Let us now fuppofe that the obferver has gone from the equator e towards the north pole n, and that he flops at i, from which place he then fees the hemifphere MEINL ; his horizon MCL having fhifted as many degrees from the celeflial poles A\" and S, as he has tra¬ velled from under the equinoctial E. And as the heavens feem conftantly to turn round the line NCS as an axis, all thofe ftars which are not fo many degrees from the north pole N as the obferver is from the equinoctial, namely, the ftars north of the dotted parallel DL, never fet below the horizon ; and thofe which are fouth of the dotted parallel MO never rife above it. Hence the for¬ mer of thefe two parallel circles is called the circle of ferpetual apparition, and the latter the circle of perpe¬ tual eccultation ; but all the ftars between thefe two cir¬ cles rife and fet every day. Let us imagine many circles to be drawn between thefe two, and parallel to them; thofe which are on the north fide of the equinoctial will be unequally cut by the horizon MCL, having larger portions above the horizon than below it; and the more fo, as they are nearer to the circle of perpetual appari¬ tion ; but the reverfe happens to thofe on the fouth fide of the equiqoftial, whilft the equinoctial is divided in. two equal parts by the horizon. Hence, by the appa¬ rent turning of the heavens, the northern ftars deferibe greater arcs or portions of circles above the horizon than below it; and the.greater, as they are farther from the equinoctial towards the circle of perpetual apparition ; whilft the contrary happens to all ftars fouth of the equi¬ noctial ; but thofe. upon it deferibe equal arcs both above and btjlow the horizon, and therefore they are . juft.as long above as below it. An obferver on the equator has no circle of perpetual apparition or occultation, becaufe all the ftars, together with the fun and moon, rife and fet to him every day* But, as a bare view of the figure is fufficient to Ihew thatjjhefe two circles DL and MO are juft as far from the poles A 7- a nd S as the obferver at i (or one oppofite to him at o) is from the equator ECQ, it is plain, that if an obferver begins to travel from the equator towards either pole, his circle of perpetud apparition rifes from that pole as from a point, and his circle of perpetual oc-. cultationfrom the other. As the obferver advances tor ward the nearer pole, thefe two circles enlarge their dia«- N O M ?. 447 meters, and come nearer one another, until he comes to the pole; and then they meet and coincide in the equi¬ noctial. On different fides df the equator, to obfervers at equal diftances from it, the circle of perpetual appari¬ tion to one is the circle of perpetual occultation to the other. Becaufe the ftars never vary their diftances from the equinoctial, fo as to be fenfible in an age, the lengths of their diurnal and noCturnal arcs are always the fame to the fame places on the earth. But as the earth goes round the fun every year in the ecliptic, one half of which is on the north fide of the equinoctial, and the other half on its fouth fide, the fun appears to change his place every day, fo as to go once round the circle TCX every year. Therefore whilft the fun appears to advance northward, from having deferibed the parallel^ ab-X\" touching the ecliptic in X, the days continually lengthen and the nights Ihorten, until he comes to y and deferibes the parallel yzx, when the days are at the long- eft and the nights at the lhorteft; for then, as the fun goes no farther northward, the greateft portion that is polfible of the diurnal arc yz is above the horizon of the inhabitant i, and the fmalleft portion zx below it. As the fun declines fouthward from y, he deferibes fmaller diurnal and greater noCturnal arcs, or portions of circles every day ; which caufeth the days to fliorten and nights to lengthen, until he arrives again at the parallel abX\\ which having only the fmall part ab above the ho¬ rizon MCL, and the great part bX below it, the days are at the lhorteft and the nights at the longeft; becaufe the fun recedes no'farther fouth, but returns northward as before-. It is eafy to fee that the fun muft be in the equinoCtial twice every year, and then the days and nights are equally long; that is, 12 hours each, Thefe hints ferve at prefent to give an idea of fome of the appearances refulting from the motions of the earth j . which will be more particularly deferibed in the tenth* chapter. To an obferver at either pole, the horizon and equi¬ noctial are coincident; and the fun and ftars feem to move parallel to the horizon; therefore, fuch an obfer¬ ver is faid to have a parallel pofitioo of the fphere. To an obferver any where between either pole and equator, the parallels deferibed by the fun aod ftars are cut obliquely by the horizon, and therefore he is faid to have an ob¬ lique pofition of the fphere. To an obferver any where on the equator, the parallels of motion, deferibed by the fun and ftars, are gut perpendicularly, or-at right angles, by the horizon ; and therefore he is faid to have a right pofition of the fphere. And thefe three are all the dif¬ ferent ways that the fphere can .be pofited to all people on the earth. . Chap. IV.

The fun and liars would all ■ feem to be fixed on one concave furface, of which the fpe&ator’s eye would be the centre. But the planets be¬ ing much nearer than the liars, their appearances will vary confiderably wicli the place from which they are viewed. ■ If the fpedlator is at reft without their orbits, the pla¬ nets will feem to be at the fame diftance as the liars, but continually Changing their places with refpedt to the liars and to one another, aflufning various phafes of in- creafe and decreafe like the moon; and, notwithftand- ing their regular motions about the lun, will fometimes appear to move quicker, fometimes flower, be as of¬ ten to the weft as to the eaft of the fun, and at their grea'teft diftances feem quite llationary. The dura¬ tion, extent, and diftance of thofe points in the heavens where thefe digreflions begin and end, would be more or lefs, according to the refpedtive diftances of the feveral planets from the fun * but in the fame planet they would continue invariably the fame at all times; like pendu¬ lums of unequal lengths ofcillating together, the ihorter move quick and go over a fmall place, the longer move- llow and go over a large fpace. If the obferver is at reft within the orbits of the planets, but not near the common centre, their apparent motions will be irregular, but lefs fo than in the former cafe. Each, of the feveral planets will appear larger and lefs by turns, as they ap¬ proach nearer or recede farther from the obferver, the nearell varying moll in their lize. They will alfo move quicker or flower with regard to their fixed liars, but will never be retrograde or llationary. If an obferver in motion views the heavens, the fame apparent irregularities will be obferved, but with fonie variation refulting from its own motion. If he is on a planet which has a rotation on its axis, not being fen- fible of his own motion, he will imagine the whole hea¬ vens, fun, planets, and liars, to revolve about him in the fame time that his planet turns round, but'the con¬ trary way, and will not be eafily Convinced of the decep¬ tion. If his planet moves round the fun, the fame irre¬ gularities and afpedts as above mentioned will appear in the motions of the other planets; and the fun will feem to move among the fixed liars or figns, diredtly oppolite to thofe in which his planet moves, f changing its place every day as he does. In a word, whether our obferver be in motion or at reft, whether within or without the orbits of the planets, their motions will feert irregular, intricate, and perplexed, unlefs he is in the centre of the fyflem; and from thence the moll beautiful order and harmony will be feen by him. The fun being the centre of all the planets motions, the only place fron\\ which their motions could be truly feen is the fun’s centre; where the obferver, being fup- pofed not to turn round with the fun, (which, in this cafe, we mull imagine to be a tranfparent body), would fee all the liars at reft, and feemingly equidiltant from him. To fuch an obferver, the pfanets would appear to move among the fixed liars, in a Ample, regular, and u- niform manner; only, that as in equal times they de- fcribe equal areas, they would defcribe fpaces fomewhat N O M Y. unequal, becaufe they move in elliptic orbits. .Thtii* motions would alfo appear to be what they are in fadl, the fame way round the heavens, in paths which crofs at fmall angles in different parts of the heavens, and then feparate a little from one another: fo that if the folar aftronomer Ihould make the path or orbit of any one pla¬ net a ftandard, and confider it as having no obliquity, he would judge the paths of all the reft to be inclined to it, each planet having one half of its path on one fide, and the other half on the oppolite fide of the ftandard path or orbit. And if he Ihould ever fee all the planets ftart from a conjundtion with each other, Mercury would move fo much fafter than Venus, as to overtake her again (though not in the fame point of the heavens) in a quan¬ tity of time alrooft equal to 14 5 of our days and nights, or, as we commonly call them, natural days, which include both the days and nights; Venus would move fo much falter than the earth, as to overtake it again in 585 na¬ tural days; the earth fo much fafter than Mars, as to overtake him again in 778 fuch days; Mars fo much fafter than Jupiter, as to overtake him again in 817 fuch days; and Jupiter fo much fafter than Saturn, as to o- vertake him again in 7236 days, all of our time. But as Our folar aftronomer could have no idea of mea- furing the courfes of the planets by our days, he would probably take the period of Mercury, which is the quick- eft moving planet, for a meafure to compare the periods of the others by. As all the ftars would appear quief- cent to him, he would never think that they had any de¬ pendence upon the fun ; but would naturally imagine that the planets have, becaufe they move round the fun. And it is by no means improbable, that he would con¬ clude thofe planets whofe periods are quickeft, to move in orbits proportionably lefs than thofe do which make flower circuits. But being deftitute of a method for finding their parallaxes, or, more properly fpeaking, as they could have no parallax to him, he could never know any thing of their real diftances or magnitudes. Their relative diftances he might perhaps guefs at by their pe¬ riods, and from thence infer fomething of truth concern¬ ing their relative bulks, by comparing their apparent bulks with one another. For example, Jupiter appearing big¬ ger to him than Mars, he would conclude it to be much bigger in fadl; becaufe it appears fo, and muft be farther from him on account of its longer period. Mercury and the earth would feem much of the fame bulk; but, by comparing its period with the earth’s, he would conclude that the earth is much farther from him than Mercury, and confequently that it muft be really larger, though apparently of the fame bulk; and fo of the reft. And as each planet would appear fomewhat larger in one part of its orbit than in the oppolite, and to move quickeft when it feems biggeft, the obferver would be at no lofs to determine that all the planets move in Orbits, of which the fun is not precifely in the centre. The apparent magnitudes of the planets continually change as feen from the earth ; which demonftrates that they approach nearer to it, and recede farther from it by turns. From thefe phenomena, and their apparent motions among the ftars, they feem to defcribe looped curves which never return into themfelves, Venus’s path. excepted."},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"ASTRO excepted. And if we were to trace out all their appa¬ rent paths, and put the figures of them together in one diagram, they would appear fo anomalous and confufed, that no man in his fenfes could believe them to be repre- fentations pf their real paths; but would immediately conclude, that fuch apparent irregularities mull be owing to fome optic illufions : And after a good deal of in¬ quiry, he might perhaps be at a lofs to find out the true caufe of thefe inequalities ; efpecially if he were one of thofe who would rather, with the greateft juftice, charge frail man with ignorance, than the Almighty with being the author of fuch codfufion. ' Dr Long, in his firft volume of Aftronomy, has given us figures of the apparent paths of all the planets fepa- rately from Caflini; from them Mr Fergufon firft thought of attempting to trace fome of them by an orrery, that thews the motions of the fun, Mercury, Venus, the earth, and moon, according to the Copernican fyftem. Having taken off the fun, Mercury, and Venus, he put.black lead pencils in their places, with the points turned up¬ ward, and fixed a circular Iheet of pafteboard fo that the earth kept conftantly under its centre in going round the fun, and the pafteboard kept its paralleliim. Then, prefling gently with one hand upon the pafteboard to make it touch the three pencils, with the other hand he turned the winch that moves the whole machinery: and ■ as the earth together with the pencils in the places of Mercury and Venus had their proper motions round the fun’s pencils, which kept at reft in the centre of the machine, all the three pencils deferibed a diagram, from which fig. 2. of Plate XL. is truly copied in a lmaller fize. As the earth moved round the fun, the fun’s pencil deferibed the dotted circle of months, whilft Mercury’s pencil drew the curve with the greateft num¬ ber of loops, and Venus’s that with the feweft. In their inferior conjunctions they come as much nearer the earth, or within the circle of the fun’s apparent motion round the heavens, as they go beyond it in their fuperior con¬ junctions. On each fide of the loops they appear fta¬ tionary; in that part of each loop next the earth retro¬ grade ; and in all the reft of their paths direCt. If Caflini’s figures of the paths of the fun, Mercury, and Venus, were put together, the figure as above traced put would be exactly like them. It reprefents the fun’s apparent motion round the ecliptic, which is the fame e- very year; Mercury’s motion for feven years, and Ve¬ nus’s for eight; in which time Mercury’s path makes 23 loops, eroding itfelf fo many times, and Venus’s only five. In eight years, Venus falls fo nearly into the fame apparent path again, as to deviate very little from it in fome ages; but in what dumber of years Mercury and the reft of the planets would deferibe the fame vifible paths over again, it is hard to determine. Having fi- nilhed the above figure of the paths of Mercury and Ve¬ nus, he put the ecliptic round them as in the Doctor’s book, and added the dotted lines from the earth to the ecliptic for {hewing Mercury’s apparent or geocentric motion therein for one year; in which time his path makes three loops, and goes on a little farther; which thews that he has three inferior, and as many fuperior conjunctions with the fun in that time ; and alfo that he Von. I. No. 19. 3 N O M Y. 449 is fix times ftationary, and thrice retrograde. Let -us now trace his motion for one year in the figure. In Plate XL. fig. 2. fuppqfe Mercury to be fetting out from A towards B, (between the earth and left hand corner of the Plate), and as feen from the earth, his motion will then be direCt, or according to the order of the figns. But when he comes to B, he appears to ftand ftill in the 23d degree of ft£ at F, as {hewn by the line BF. Whilft he goes from B to C, the line BF, fuppofed to move with him, goes backward from F to E, or contrary to the order of figns ; and when lie is at C, he appears fta¬ tionary at E, having gone back 11'- degrees. Now, fuppofe him ftationary on the firft of January at C , on the 10th thereof he will appear in the heavens as at 20, near Fy on the 20th, he will be feen as at G \\ on the 31ft, at H \\ on the 10th of February, at /; on the 20th, at K\\ and on the 28th, at L; as the dotted lines {hew, which are drawn through every tenth day’s motion in his looped path, and continued to the ecliptic. On the 10th of March, he appears at At ; on the 20th, at N; and on the 31ft, at 0 . On the lothof April, he appears ftationary at P; on the 20th, he feems to have gone back ggain to 0 ; and on the 30th, he appears ftationary. at J-P_, having gone back 114. degrees. Thus Mercury feems to go for¬ ward 4 figns 11 degrees, or 131 degrees, and to go back only 11 or 12 degrees, at a mean rate.

From the uniform projectile motion of bodies in ftraight lines, and the universal power of attraction which draws them off from thefe lines, the curvilineal motions of all the planets arife. In Plate XL. fig. 3. if the body A be projected along the right line ABX, in open fpace, where it meets with no refiftance, and is not drawn afide by any other power, it will for ever go on with the fame velocity, and in the fame direction. For the force which moves it from A to B in any given time, will carry it from B to X in as much more time, and fo on, there being nothing to obftruCt orViter its motion. But if when this projectile force has carried it, fuppofe to B, the body S begins to attract it, with a power duly adjufted, and perpendicular to its motion at B, it will then be drawn from the ftraight line ABX, and forced to revolve about S in the circle BYTU. When the body A comes to U, or any other' part of its orbit, if the fmall body ti, within the fphere"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"45© ASTRO of U’s attraction, be projected as in the right line Z, ■ with a force perpendicular to the attraction of U, then a ■ will go round U in the orbit W, and accompany it in its whole courfe round the body S. Here S may reprefent the fun, U the earth, and u the moon. If a planet at B gravitates, oris attracted toward the fun fo as to fall from B to y in the time that the projec¬ tile force would have carried it from B to X; it will de¬ feribe the curve BY by the combined action of thefe two forces, in the fame time that the projeCtile force fingly would have carried it from B to X, or the gravitating power fingly have caufed it to defcend from B to y ; and thefe two forces being duly proportioned, and perpendi¬ cular to one another, the planet obeying them both, will move in the circle BYTU. But if, whilft the projeCtile force carries the planet from B to b, the fun’s attraction (which conftitutes die planet’s gravitation) Ihould bring it down from i to i, the gravitating power would then be too ftrong for the projeCtile force, and would caufe the planet to deferibe the curve BC. When the planet comes to C, the gra¬ vitating power (which always increafes as the fquare of the diftance from the fun S diminishes) will be yet ftronger for the projeCtile force; and by confpiring in fome de¬ gree therewith, will accelerate the planet’s motion all the way from C to K, caufing it to deferibe the arcs, BC, CD, DE, EF, See. all in equal times. Having its mo¬ tion thus accelerated, it thereby gains fo much centrifu¬ gal force, or tendency to fly off at K in the line Kk, as overcomes the fun’s attraction; and the centrifugal force being too great to allow the planet to be brought nearer the fun, or even to move round him in the circle Klmn, etc. it goes off, and afeends in the curve KLMN, See. its motion decreafing as gradually from K to B, as it in- creafed from B to K, becaufe the fun’s attraction aCts now again!! the planet’s projeCtile motion juft as much as it aCted with it before. When the planet has got round to B, its projeCfile force is as much diminilhed from its mean ftate about G or N, as it was augmented at K ; and fo, the fun’s attraction being more than fufficient to keep the planet from going off at B, it deferibes the fame orbit over again, by virtue of the fame forces or powers. A double projeCtile force'will always balance a qua¬ druple power of gravity. Let the planet at B have twice as great an impulfe from thence towards X, as it had before; that is, in the fame length of time that it was projected from B to b, as in the laft example, let it now be projected from B to c, and it will require four times as much gravity to retain it in its orbit; that is,, it muft fall as far as from B to 4 in the time that the pro¬ jeCtile force would carry it from B to c, otherwife it could not deferibe the curve BD, as is evident by the fi¬ gure. But in as much time as the planet moves from B to C in the higher part of its orbit, it moves from / to K, or from K to L, in the lower part thereof; becaufe, from the joint aCtion of thefe two forces^ it muft always deferibe equal areas in equal times, throughout its annual courfc. Thefe areas are reprefented by the triangles BSC, CSD, DSE, ESF, See. whofe contents are equal to one another, quite round the figure. . N O M Y. As the planets approach nearer the fun, and recede farther from him in every revolution,' there may be fome difficulty in conceiving the reafon why the power of gra¬ vity, when it once gets the better of the projeCtile force, does not bring the planets nearer and nearer the fun in every revolution, till they fall upon and unite with him ; or why the projeCtile force, when it once gets the better of gravity, does not carry the planets farther and farther from the fun, till it removes them quite out of the fphere of his attraction, and caufes them to go on in ftraight lines for ever afterward. But by confidering the effeCts of thefe powers, this difficulty will be removed - . Sup- pofe a planet at B to be carried by the projeCtile force as far as from B to b, in the time that gravity would have brought it down ftom B to 1 ; by thefe two forces it will deferibe the curve BC. When the planet comes down to K, it will be but half as far from the fun S as it was at B; and therefore, by gravitating four times as ftrongly towards him, it would fall from K to V in the fame length of time that it would have fallen from B to 1 in the higher part of its orbit, thaf is, through four times as much fpace; but its projeCtile force is then fo much increafed at K, as would carry it from K to k in the fame time; being double of what it was at B, and is therefore too ftrong for the gravitating power, either to draw the planet to the fun, or caufe it to go round him in the circle Klmn, &c. which would require its falling from K to w, through a greater fpace than gra¬ vity can draw it, whilft the projeCtile force is fuch as would carry it from K to k; and therefore the planet a- feendsin its orbit KLMN, decreafing in its velocity, for the caufe already affigned. The orbits of all the planets are ellipfes, very little different from circles; but the orbits of the comets are very long ellipfes, and the lower focus'of them all is in the fun. If we fuppofe the mean diftance (or middle between the greateft and leaft) of every planet and co¬ met from the fun to be divided into 1000 equal parts, the excentricities of their orbits, both in fuch parts and in Englilh miles, will be as follow. Mercury’s 210 parts, or 6,720,000 miles; Venus’s, 7 parts, or 413,000 miles; the earth’s, 17 parts, or 1,377,000 miles; Mars’s, 93 parts, or 11,439,000 miles; Jupiter’s, 48 parts, or 20,352,000 miles; Saturn’s, 55 parts, or 42,735,° 0 ° miles. Of the nearefl of the three Tore- mentioned comets, 1,458,000 miles; of the middle- moft, 2,025,000,000 miles; and of the outermoft, 6,600,000,000. By the laws of gravity and the projeCtile force, bodies will move in all kinds of ellipfes, whether long or fliort, if the fpaces they move in be void of refiftanc.e; only thofe which move in the longer ellipfes, have fo much the lefs projeCtile force impreffed upon them in the higher parts of their orbits; and their velocities in coming down towards the fun are fo prodigioufly increafed by his attraction, that their centrifugal forces in the lower parts of their orbits are fo great, as to overcome the fun’s at¬ traction there, and caufe them to afeend again towards the higher parts of their orbits; during which time, the fun’s attraction aCtir.g fo contrary to the motions of thefe bouies, caufes them to move flower and flower, until their,"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"ASTRO their projeftile forces are diminifhed almoft to nothing; and then they are brought baek again by the fun’s attrac¬ tion, as before. If the projeftile forces of all the planets and comets were deftroyed at their mean diftances from the fun, their gravities would bring them down fo, as that Mercury would fall to the fun in 15 days 13 hours; Venus, in 39 days 17 hours; the earth or moon, in 64 days 10 hours; Mars, in 121 days; Jupiter, in 290; and Sa¬ turn, in 767. The neareft comet, in 13 thoufand days; the middlemoft, in 23 thoufand days ; and the outermoft, in 66 thoufand days. The moon would fall to the earth in 4 days 20 hours: Jupiter’s firft moon would fall to him in 7 hours; his fecond, in ij; his third, in 30; and his fourth, in 71 hours : Saturn’s firft moon would fall to him in 8 hours; his fecond, in 12 ; his third, in 19; his fourth, in 68 ; and the fifth, in 336. A ftone would fall to the earth’s centre, if there were an hollow paflage, in 21 minutes 9 feconds. Mr Whifton gives the following rule for fitch computations. “ It is de- “ monftrable, that half the period of any planet, when “ it is diminifhed in the fefquialteral proportion of the ** number 1 to the number 2, or nearly in the proportion of 1000 to 2828, is the time that it would fall to the “ centre of its orbit.” This proportion is, when a quantity or number contains another once and a half as much more. The quick motions of the moons of Jupiter and Sa¬ turn round their primaries, demonftrate that thefe two planets have ftronger attraftive powers than the earth has : for the ftronger that one body attrafts another, the greater muft be the proje&ile force, and confequently.the quicker muft be the motion of that other body to keep it from falling to its primary or central planet. Jupiter’s fecond moon is-124 thoufand miles farther from Jupiter than our moon is from us; and yet this fecond moon goes almoft eight times round Jupiter whilft our moon goes only once round the earth. What a prodigious at- traftive power muft the fun then have, to draw all the planets and fatellites of the fyftem towards him; and what an amazing power muft it have required to put all thefe planets and-moons into fuch rapid motions at firft 1 Chap.

And as, in both cafes, they are feen much under the fame angle, we naturally judge them to be large!! when they feem fartheft from us. Any one may fatisfy himfelf that the moon appears under no greater angle in the horizon than on the meri¬ dian, by taking a large fheet of paper, and rolling it up in the form of a tube, of fuch a width, that'obferving the moon through it when !he rifes, !he may* as it were, juft fill the tube; then tie a thread round it to keep it of that fize; and when the moon comes to the meridian, and appears much lefs to the eye, look at her again through the fame tube, and !he will fill it juft as much, if not more, than !he did at her rifing. When the full moon is in her perigeo , or at her leaft diftance from the earth, !he is feen under a larger angle, and muft therefore appear bigger that when !he is full at other times : And if that part of the atmofphere where Hie rifes be more-replete with vapours than ufual, file appears fo much the dimmer ; and therefore we fancy her to be ftill the bigger, by referring her to an un- ufually great diftance, knowing that no objedts which are very far-diftant can appear big unlefs they be really fo.

The better way is not to look at the fun through the light-holes, but to hold the quadrant facing the eye, at a- little diftance, and fo that the fun Ihining through one hole, the ray may be feen to fall on the other.] In fig 2. Plate XLI. let BAG be one half of the earth, AC its femidiameter, S the fun, tn the moon, and EKOL a quarter of the circle deferibed by the moon in revolving from the meridian to the meridian again. Let CRS be the rational horizon of an obferver at A, ex¬ tended to the fun in the heavens; and HAO his fenfible horizon, extended to the moon’s orbit. ALC is the angle under which the earth’s femidiameter AC is feen from the moon at L, which is equal to the angle OAL, becaufe the right lines AO and CL which include both thtfe angles are parallel. ASC is the angle under whi~h the earth’s femidiameter AC is feen from the fun at S, and is equal to the angle 0 A f, becaufe the lines AO and CRS are parallel. Now, it is found by obferva¬ tion, that the angle OAL is much greater, than the an¬ gle OAf; but OAL is equal to ALC, and OAf is e- qual to ASC. Now, as ASC is much lefs than ALC, it proves that the earth’s femidiameter AC appears much greater as feen from the moon at L, than from the fun at S; and therefore the earth is much farther from the fun than from the moon. The quantities of thefe angles are determined by obfervation in the following manner. Let a graduated inftrument, as DAE (the larger the better) having a moveable index with fight-holes, be fixed in fuch a manner, that its plane' furface may be parallel to the plane of the equator, and its edge AD in the meridian: fo that when the moon is in the equi¬ noctial, and on the meridian at E, {he may be feen through the fight-holes when the edge of the moveable index cuts the beginning of the divisions at o, on the graduated limb DE; and when (he is fo feen, let the precife time be noted. Now, as the moon revolves a- bout the earth, from the meridian to the meridian again, in 24 hours 4*8 minutes, {he will go a fourth part round it in a fourth part of that time, viz ,. in 6 hours 12 mi¬ nutes, as feen from C, that is, from the earth’s centre or pole. But as feen from A, the obferver’s place on the earth’s furface, the moon will feem to have gone a quarter round the earth when {he comes to the fenfible horizon at 0 ; for the index, through the fights of N O M Y. which {he is then viewed, will be at d , 90 degrees from D, where it was when flie was feen at E. Now, let the exadt moment when the moon is feen at 0 (which will be when {he is in or near the fenfible horizon) be carefully noted, that it may be known in what time {he has gone from E to 0 ; which time fubtradted from 6 hours 12 minutes (the time of her going from E to L) leaves the time of her going from 0 to L, and affords an eafy me¬ thod for finding the angle OAL (called the moon's hori¬ zontal parallax, which is equal to the angle ALC) by the following analogy. As the time of the moon’s de- feribing the arc EO is to 90 degrees, fo. is 6 hours 12 minutes to the degrees of the arc DdE, which meafures the angle EAL; from which fubtract 90 degrees, and the're remains the angle OAL, equal to the angle ALC, under which the earth’s femidiameter AC is feen from the moon. Now, fince all the angles of a right-lined triangle are equal to 180 degrees, or to two right angles, and the fidcs of a triangle are always proportional to the fines of the oppofite angles, fay, by the Rule of Three, as the fine of the angle ALC at the moon L is to its oppofite fide AC, the earth’s femidiameter, which is known to be 3985 miles, fo is the radius, wz, the fine of 90 degrees, or of the right angle ACL, to its oppofite fide AL, which is the moon’s diftance at L, from the obferver’s place at A, on the earth’s furface , or, fo is the fine of the angle CAL to its oppofite fide CL, which is the moon’s diftance from the earth’s centre, and comes out, at a mean rate, to J)e 240,000 miles The angle CAL is equal 10 what OAL wants' of 90 degrees. The fun’s diftance from the earth is found the fame way, but with much greater difficulty; becaufe his ho¬ rizontal parallax, or the angle OAS equal to the angle ASC, is fo fmall as to be hardly perceptible, being only iofeconds of a minute, or the 360th part of a degree. But the moon’s horizontal parallax, or angle OAL, equal to the an^le ALC, is very difcernible, being 57' 49\", or 2469' at its mean ftate ; which is more than 340 times as great as the fun’s: And therefore the diftances of the heavenly bodies being inverfely as the tangents of their horizontal parallaxes, the fun’s diftance from the earth is at leaft 340 times as great as the moon’s ; and is rather underftated at 81 millions of miles, when the moon’s diftance is certainly known to be 240 thoufand. But becaufe, according to fome aftronomers, the fun’s horizontal parallax is 11 feconds, and according to o- thers only 10, the former parallax making the fun’s di¬ ftance to be about 75,000,000 of miles, and the latter 82,000,000 .; we may take it for granted, that the fun’s diftance is not lefs than as deduced from the former, nor more than as ffiewn by the latter: And every one who is accuftomed to make fuch obfervations, knows how hard it is, if not impoflible, to avoid an error of a fecond, efpecially on account of the inconftancy of ho¬ rizontal refra< 5 tions : And here, the error of one fecond, in fo fmall an angle, will make an error of feven millions of miles in fo great a diftance as that of the fun’s.

The earth’s axis produced to the ftars, being carried parallel to itfelf durisg the earth’s annual revolution, de- fcribes a circle in the fphere of the fixed ftars equal to the orbit of the. earth. But this orbit, though very large, would feem no bigger than a point if it were viewed from the ftars; and confequently, the circle de fcribed in the fphere of the ftars, by the axis of the earth produced, if viewed from the earth; muft appear but as a point ; that is. its diameter appears too little to be meafurcd by obfervation : For Dr Bradley has affured us, that if it had amounted to a fingle fecond, or two at moil, he fhould have perceived it in the great number of ©bfervations he has made, efpecially upon y dragonis ; and that it feemed to him very probable that the annual parallax of this ftar is not fo great as a fingle fecond ; and confequently, that it is above 400 thoufand times far¬ ther from us than the fun.

Hence, the velocity of light is 10 thoufand 2 10 times as great as the earth’s velocity in its orbit; which velocity (from what we know already of the earth’s diftance from the fun) may be alferted to be at leaft between 57 and 58 thoufand miles every hour : And fuppofing it to be 58000, this number, multiplied by the above 10210, gives 592 million 180 thoufand miles for the hourly motion of light; which laft number, divided by 3600, the number of feconds in an hour, (hews that light flies at the rate of more than a hundred and fixty-four thoufand miles every fecond of time, or fwing of a com¬ mon clock pendulum, S Y Chap,"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"54 ^ ASTRO Chap.

The following experiment will give a plain idea of the diurnal and annual motions of the earth, together with the different lengths of days and nights, and all the beautiful variety of feafons, depending on thofe mo¬ tions. Take about feven feet of ftrong wire, and bend it in¬ to a circular form, as abed, which being viewed oblique¬ ly, appears elliptical, Plate XLI. fig. 3. Place a lighted candle on a table, arid having fixed one end of a filk thread K, to the north pole of a fmall terreftrial globe H, about three inches diameter, caufe another perfon to. hold the wire circle, fo that jt may be parallel to the table, and as high as the flame of the candle /, which, fhoukl be in or near the centre. Then, having twilled the thread as towards the lefpftftnd, that by untwilting it may turn the globe round eallward, or contrary to the way that the hands of a watch move ; hang the globe by the thread within this circle, alinoft. contiguous to it; and as the thread' untwills, the globe (which is enlight¬ ened half round by the candle as the earth is by the fun) ■ will turn round its axis, and the different places upon it will be carried through the light and dark hemifpheres, and have the appearance of a regular fucceflion of days and nights, as our earth has in reality by fuch a motion. As the globe turns, move your hand flowly, fo as to carry the globe round the candle according to the order of the letters abed, keeping its centre even with the wire circle ; and you will perceive, that the candle be¬ ing Hill perpendicular to the equator, will enlighten the globe from pole to pole in its whole motion round the circle; and that every place on the globe goes equally through the light and the dark, as it turns round by the untwilting of the thread, and therefore has a perpetual equinox. The globe, thus turning round, reprefents the earth turning round its axis ; and the motion of the globe round the candle reprefents the earth’s annual mo¬ tion round the fun, and (hews, that if the earth’s orbit had no inclination to its axis, all the days and nights of the year would be equally long, and there would be no different feafons. But how, defire the perfon who holds the wire, to hold it obliquely in the pofition ABCD, raifing the fide 3s> jut! as much as he depreffes the fide > j, that the flame may be ilill in the plane of the circle ; and twilling the thread as before, that the globe may turn round its axis the fame way as you. carry it round thr candle, that is, from, weft to eaft, let the globe down into the lowermoft part of the wire circle at rs, and if the circle be properly inclined, the candle will fhine perpendicularly on the tropic of Cancer, and the frigid zone,Jying within the ar&ic or north polar circle, will be all in the light, as in the figure; and will, keep in the light, let the globe turn round its axis ever fo often. From the equator to the north polar circle all the places have longer days and Ihorter nights j but from the equa- N O M Y. tor to the fouth polar circle juft the reverfe. The fun does not fet to any part of the north frigid zone, as Ihewn by the candle’s Ihining on it, fo that the motion of the globe can carry no place of that zone info the dark : And, at the fame time, the fouth frigid zone is involved in darknefs, and the turning of the globe brings none of its places into the light. If the earth were to continue, in the like part of its orbit, the fun would never fet to the inhabitants of the north frigid zone, nor rife to thofe of the fouth. At the equator it would be al¬ ways equal day and night; and as places are gradually more and more dillant from the equator, towards the ardtic circle, they would have longer days .and Ihorter nights ; whilft thofe on the fouth fide of the equator would have their nights longer than their days. In this cafe there would be continual fummer on the north fide of the equator, and continual winter on the fouth fide of it. But as the globe turns round its axis, move your hand flowly forward, fo as to carry the globe from H towards E, and the boundary of light and darknefs will approach towards the north pole, and recede towards the fouth pole; the northern places will go through lefs and lefs of the light, and the fouthern places through more and more of it; (hewing how the northern days decreafe in length, and the fouthern days increafe, whilft the globe proceeds from H to E. When the globe is at E, it is at a mean (late between the loweft and higheft part of its orbit; the candle is diredtly over the equator, the boun¬ dary of light and darknefs juft reaches to both the poles,, and all places on the globe go equally through the light and dark hemifpheres, (hewing that the days and nights are then equal at all places of the earth, the poles only excepted; fpr the fun is then fetting to the north pole, and rifing to the fouth pole. Continue moving the globe forward, and as it goes thro’ the quarter A, the north pole recedes dill farther into the dark hemifphere, and the fouth pole advances more into the light, as the globe comes nearer to 3F> : And when it comes there at F, the candle is diredtly over the tropic of Capricorn, the days are at the (horteft, and nights at the longed, in the northern hemifphere, all the way from the equator to the arctic circle; and the re¬ verfe in the fouthern hemifphere from the equator to the antardtic circle; within which circles it is dark to the north frigid zone, and light to the fouth. Continue both motions, and as the globe moves through the quarter B, the north pole advances towards the light, and the fouth pole recedes towards the dark ; the days lengthen in the northern hemifphere, and (horten.in the fouthern; and when the globe comes to G, the candle will be again over tl>e equator (as when the globe was at E ) ana the days and nights will again be equal as formerly; and the north pole will be juITco- ming into the light, the fouth pole going out of it. Thus we fee the reafon why the days lengthen and (horten from the equator to the polar circles every year why there is no day or night for feveral turnings of the earth, within the polar circles ; why there is but one day and one night in the whole year at the poles ; and why the days and nights are equally long all the year."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"A S T II O year round at the equator, which is always equally cut by the circle bounding'light and darknefs.

And if this book be held fo that the circle ABCD be parallel to the horizon, both the circle abed, and the thread or axis K, will be incli¬ ned to it. But if the book or plate be held fo that the thread be perpendicular to the horizon, then the orbit ABCD will be inclined to the thread, and the orbit abed perpendicular to it, and parallel to the - horizon. We generally-confider the earth’s annual orbit as having no inclination, and the orbits of ail the other planets as in¬ clined to it. Let us now take a view of the earth in its annual courfe round the fun, Confidering its orbit as having no inclination, and its axis as inclining 234 degrees from a line perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, and keeping the fame oblique direction in all parts of its annual courfe; or, as commonly termed, keeping always paral¬ lel to itfelf. In Plate XLI. fig. 4. let alcdefgb be the- earth in eight different parts of its orbit, equidillant from one another, Ns its axis, N the north pole, s the fouth pole, and S the fun nearly in the centre of the earth’s orbit, As the earth goes round the fun according' to the order' of the letters abed, &c. its axis Ns keeps the fame obliquity, and is flill parallel to the line MNs. When the earth is at a, its north pole in* dines toward the fun S, and brings all the northern places more into the light than at any other time of the year. But when the earth is at e in the oppofite time of the year, the north pole declines from the fun, which oc- cafions the northern places to be more in the dark than in the light; and the reverfe at the fouthern places, as is evident by the figure. When the earth is either at c or g, its axis inclines not either to or from the fun, but lies lidewife to him, and then the poles are in the boun. dary of light and darknefs ; and the. fun, being dirc£Uy over the equator, makes equal day and night at all places. When the earth is at b, it is half way between the fum* mer folftice and harvefl equinox; W'hen it is at d, it is half way from the harvefl equinox to the winter folftice; at f, half way from the winter folllice to the fpring e* quinox; and at h, half way from the fpring equinox to the fummer folftice. From this oblique view of the earth’s orbit, let us fuppofe ourfelves to be raifed far above it, and placed juft over its centre S ,- looking down upon it from its north pole ; and as the earth’s orbit differs but very little from a circle, we fhalLhave its figure in fiieh a view xepre- fented by the circle ABCDEFGH (Plate XL 1 I. fig. 1.). Let us fuppofe this circle to be divided into- 12 equal parts, called Jtgns, having their names affixed to them ; and each fign into 30 equal parts, called degrees, num¬ bered xo, 20, 30, as in the outermoft circle of. the fi- N O M V. 455 ' giire, which reprefents the great ecliptic in the heavens. The earth is fhewn in eight different pofitions in this circle, and in each pofition JE is the equator, T the tro¬ pic of Cancer, the dotted circle the parallel of London, U the arAic or north polar circle, and P the north pole, where all the meridians or hour-circles meet. As the earth goes round the fun, the north pole keeps conftantly towards one part of the heavens, as it keeps in the figure towards the right-hand fide of the plate. When the earth is at the beginning of Libra, namely, on the 20th of March, in this figure (as at£ in Plate XLI. fig. 4.) the fun S asfeen from the earth appears at the begin¬ ning of Aries in the oppofite part of the heavens, the north pole is 'juft coming into the light, and the fun is vertical to the equator; which, together with the tropic of Can¬ cer, parallel of London, and arAic circle, are all equal¬ ly cut by the circle bounding light and darknefs, coinci¬ ding with the fix o’clock hour-circle, and therefore the days and nights are equally long at all places; for every part of the meridian JE TLa. comes into the light at fix in the morning, and revolving with the earth according to the order of the hour-letters, goes into the dark at fix in the evening. There are 24 meridians or hour-cir¬ cles drawn on the earth in this figure, to ffiew the time of fun-rifing and fettiDg at different feafons of the year. As the earth moves in the ecliptic according to the or¬ der of the letters ABCD, See. through the figns Libi'a, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, the north pole comes more and more into the light; the days increafe as the nights de- creafe in length, at all places north of the equator JE ; which is plain by viewing the earth at b on the jth of May, when it is in the i jth degree of Scorpio, and the fun as feen from the earth appears in the 15 th degree of Taurus ; for then the tropic of Cancer 7 \" is in the light from a little after five in the morning till almoft feven in the evening; the parallel of London from half an hour part four till half an hour paft feven; the polar circle U ' from three till nine; and a large track round the north pole P has-day. all the 24 hours, for many rotations of the earth on its axis-.- When the earth comes to cat the beginning of Capricorn; . and the fun as feen from the earth appears at the beginning of Cancer on the 2 lft of June, as in this figure, it is in the pofition a in Plate XLI. fig. 4.; and its north pole inclines towards the fun, fo as-to bring all the north fri¬ gid zone into the light, and the northern parallels of la¬ titude more into the light than the dark from-the equator to the polar circle, and the more fo as they are farther from the equator. The tropic of Cancer is in the light from five in the morning till feven at night; the parallel of London from a quarter before four till a quarter af¬ ter eight; and the polar circle juft touches the dark, fo that the fun has only the lower half of his di(k hid from the inhabitants on that circle for a few minutes about midnight, fuppofing no inequalities in the horizon, and no refraAions. A bare view of the figure is enough to ffiew, that as the earth advances-from Capricorn towards Aries, and the- fun appears to move from Cancer towards Libra, the north pole recedes towards the dark, which caufes the.days to decreafe, and the nights to increafe in length, ‘’till."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"4jf5 ASTRO rill tbs earth comes to the beginning of Aries, and then they\" are equal as before ; for the boundary of light and darknefs cut the equator and all its parallels equally or in halves. The north pole then goes into the dark, and continues therein until the earth goes half way round its orbit, or from the 23d of September till the 20th of March. In the middle between thefe times, viz. on the 2 ed of December, the north pole is as far as it can be in the dark, which is 234 degrees, equal to the incli¬ nation of the earth’s axis from a perpendicular to its or¬ bit; and then the northern parallels are as much in the dark as they were in the light on the 21ft of June; the winter nights being as long as the fummer days, and the winter days as {hort as the fummer nights. It is nee 3 lefs to enlarge farther on this fubjeCt, as we lhall have occa- fion to mention the l'eafons again in defcribing the orrery. Only this mull be noted, that all that has been faid of the northern hemifphere, the contrary mull be underdood of the fouthern ; for on different fides of the equator the fcafons are contrary, becaufe when the northern hemi¬ fphere inclines towards the fun, the fouthern declines from him. As Saturn goes round the fun, his obliquely poGted ring, like our earth’s axis, keeps parallel to itfelf, and is therefore turned edgewife to the fun twice in a Saturnian year, which is almod as long as 30 of our years. But the ring, though confiderably broad, is too thin to be feen by us when it is turned round edgewife to the fun, at which time it is alfo edgewife to the earth, and there¬ fore it difappears once in every fifteen years to us. As the fun Ihines half a year together on the north pole of our earth, then difappears to it, and Ihines as long on the fouth pole ; fo, during one half of Saturn’s year, the fun Ihines on the north fide of his ring, then difap¬ pears to it, and Ihines as long on its fouth fide. When the earth’s axis inclines neither to nor from the fun, but hdewife to him, he indantly ceafes to Ihine on one pole, and begins to enlighten the other; and when Saturn’s ring inclines neither to nor from the fun, but fidewife to him, he ceafes to Ihine-on the one fide of it, and begins to Ihine upon the other. The earth’s orbit being elliptical, and the fun con- ftantly keeping in its lower focus, which is 1,377,000 miles from the middle point of the longer axis, the earth comes twice fomuch, or 2,754,000 miles nearer the fun at one time of the year than at another; for the fun ap¬ pearing under a larger angle in our winter than fummer, proves that the earth is nearer the fun in winter. But here this natural queflion will arife, Why have we not the hotted: weather when the earth is neared the fun ? In anfwer, it mud be obferved, that the excentricity of the earth’s orbit, or 1 million 377 miles, bears no great¬ er proportion to the earth’s mean didance from the fun than 17 does to 1000; and therefore this fmall differ¬ ence of didance cannot occafion any great difference of heat or cold. But the principal caufe of this difference is, that in winter the funs rays tall fo obliquely upon us, that any given number of them is fpread over a much greater portion of the earth’s furface where we live, and ’therefore each point mud then have fewer rays than in f ummer. Moreover, there conies a greater degree of cold N O M Y. in the long winter nights than there can return of heat in fo thort days; and on both thefe accounts the cold mud increafe. But in fummer, the rays fall more per¬ pendicularly upon us, and therefore come with greater force, and in greater numbers on the fame place; and by their long continuance, a much greater degree of heat is imparted by day than can fly off by night.

Geographers arbitrarily chufe to call the meridian of fome remarkable place the firJl meridian. There they begin their reckoning ; and jufl fo many degrees and minutes as any other place is to the eadward or wedward of that meridian, fo much eafl or wed longitude they fay it has. A degree is the 360th part of a circle, be it great or fmall; and a minute the 60th part of a de¬ gree. The Englifh geographers reckon the longitude from the meridian of the Royal Obfervatory at Green¬ wich, and the French from the meridian of Paris. If we imagine 12 great circles, (Plate XLII. fig. 1.) one of which is the meridian o : any given place, to interfecl each other in the two poles of the earth., and to cut the equator JE at every 1 5th degree, they will be divided by the poles into 24 femicircles which divide the equator in¬ to 24 equal parts; and as the earth turns on its axis, the planes of thefe femicircles come fucceffiv Jy after one an¬ other every hour to the fun. As in an hour of time tf^ere is a revolution of 15 degrees of the equator, in a mintite of time there will be a revolution of iy minutes of the equator, and in a fecond of time a revolution of 15 fe- conds. Becaufe the fun enlightens only one half of the earth at once, as it turns round its axis, he rifes to fome places at the fame moments of abfolute time that he fets to o- thers; and when it is mid-day to fome places, it is mid¬ night to others. The XII on the middle of the earth’s enlightened fide, next the fun, dands for mid-day; and the oppofite XII on the middle of the dark fide, for mid¬ night. If we fuppofe this circle of hours to be fixed in the plane of the equinoctial, and the earth to turn round within it, any particular meridian will come to the dif¬ ferent hours fo as to (hew the true time of the day or night at all places on that meridian. Therefore, To every place 15 degrees eadward from any given meridian, it is noon an hour fooner than on that meri¬ dian, becaufe their meridian comes to the fun ap hour fooner; and to all places 15 degrees wedward, it is noon an hour later, becaufe their meridian comes an hour later to the fun, and fo on ; every 15 degrees of motion caufing an hour’s difference in time. Therefore, they who have noon an hour later than we, have their meri¬ dian, that is, their longitude, 15 degrees wedward from us; and they who have qoon an hour fooner than we, have their meridian 1 5 degrees eadward from ours ; and fo for every hour’s difference of time 15 degrees differ¬ ence"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Kl.ut-XLl."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":";V .';'"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"ASTRO rence of longitude. Confequently, if the beginning or .ending of a lunar eclipfe be obferved, fuppofe at Lon¬ don, to be exactly at midnight, and in fome other place at 11 at night, that place is i 5 degrees weft ward from the meridian of London ; if the fame eclipfe be obferved at 1 in the morning at another place, that place is 15 de¬ grees eaftward from the laid meridian. But as it is not eafy to determine the exaCt moment either of the beginning or ending of a lunar eclipfe, be- caufe the earth’s lhadow, through which the moon pafles, is faint and ill defined about the edges, we have recourfe to the eclipfes of Jupiter’s fatellites, which difappear fo inftantaneoully as they enter Jupiter’s lhadow, and e- merge fo fuddenly out of it, that we may fix the pheno¬ menon to half a fecond of time. The lirft or neareft fatellite to Jupiter is the mod advantageous for this pur- pofe, becaule its motion is quicker than the motion of any of the reft, and therefore its immerfions and emer- lions are more frequent. The Englilh allronomers have calculated tables for Ihewing the times of the eclipfes of Jupiter’s fatellites to great precifion, for the meridian of Greenwich. Now, let an obferver, who has thefe tables, with a good tele- fcope and a well-regulated clock at any other place of the earth, obferve the beginning or ending of an eclipfe of one of Jupiter’s fatellites, and note the precife mo¬ ment of time that he faw the fatellite either immerge into, or emerge out of the lhadow, and compare that time with the time Ihewn by the tables for Greenwich ; then, 15 degrees difference of longitude .being allowed for e- very hour’s difference of time, will give the longitude of that place from Greenwich, as above; and if there be any odd minutes of time, for every minute a qua ter of a degree, eaft or weft, muft be allowed, as the time of obfervation is later or earlier than the time flicwn by the tables. Such eclipfes are very convenient for this purpofe at land, becaule they happen altnoft every day ; but are of no ufe at fca, becaufe the rolling of the fhip hinders all nice telefcopical obfervations. . To explain this by a figure, in Plate XLII. fig. 1. let / be Jupiter, A', L, M, JVhis four fatellites in their rtfpedfive orbits, 1, 2, 3, 4; and let the earth be at f, (fuppofe in November, although that month is no other- wife material than, to find the earth readily in this fcheme, where it is (hewn in eight different parts of its orbit). Let ^be a place on’the meridian of Green¬ wich, and R a place on fome other meridian eaftward from Greenwich. Let a perfon at R obferve the inftan- taneous vanifhing of the firft fatellite K into Jupiter’s fhadow, fuppofe at three o’clock in the morning; but by the tables he finds the immerfion of that fatellite to be at midnight.at Greenwich; he can then immediately de¬ termine, that as there are three hours difference of time be¬ tween island R; and that R is three hours forwarder in reckoning than it muft be 45 degrees of eaft longitude from the meridian of Were this methed as practicable at fea as at land, any failor might almoll as eafily, and with equal certainty, find the longitude as the latitude. Whilft the earth is going from C to F in its orbit, only the immerfions of Jupiter’s fatellites into hijs fha¬ dow are generally feen; and their emerfions out of Vol. I. Numb. 19. 3 N O M Y. 457 it while the earth goes from G to B. Indeed, bo'h thefe appearances may be leen of the fecond, third, and fourth fatellite when eclipfed, whilft the earth is between D and E, or between G and A ; but never of the firff fatellite, on account of the fmallnefs of its orbit and the bulk of Jupiter, except only when Jupiter is diredtly oppofite to the fun, that is, when the earth is at g; and even then, ftriCtly fpeaking, we cannot fee either the immerfions or emerfions of any of his fatellites, becaufe his body being diredtly between us and his conical fha¬ dow, his fatellites are hid by his body a few moments before they touch his fhadow; and are quite emerged from thence before we can fee them, as it were, juft dropping from him. And when the earth is at c, the fun, being between it and Jupiter, hides both him and his moons from us. In this diagram, the orbits of Jupiter’s moons are drawn in true proportion to his diameter; but, in pro¬ portion to the earth’s orbit, they are drawn 81 times too large. In whatever month of the year Jupiter is in ronjunc¬ tion with the fun, or in opposition,to ..him, in the next year it will be a month later at leaft. For whilft the earth goes once round the fun, Jupiter defcribes.a twelfth part of his orbit. And therefore, when the earth has finilhed its annual period, from being in a line with the fun and Jupiter, it muft go as much forwarder as Jupiter has moved in that time, to overtake him again ; juft like the minute-hand of a watch, which muft, from any con¬ junction with the hour-hand, go once round the dial-plate and fomewhat above a twelfth part more, to overtake the hour hand again. It is found by obfervation, that when the earth is be¬ tween the fun and Jupiter,, as at g, his fatellites are ec¬ lipfed about 8 -minutes fooner than they Ihould be Accor¬ ding to the tables; and when the earth is at B or C, thefe eclipfes happen about 8 minutes later than the tables predict them Hence it is undeniably certain, that the motion of light is not inftantaneous, fince it takes about 16*- minutes of time to go through a fpace equal to die diameter’of the earth’s orbit, which is 162 millions of miles in length ; and confcquently the particles of light fly about 164 thoufand 494 miles every fecond of time, which is above a million of times fwifter than the motion of a cannon-bullet. And as light is 16-jr minutes in tra¬ velling acrofs the earth’s orbit, it muft be 84 minutes in coming from the fun to us ; therefore if the furt were annihilated, we Ihould fee him for 8~ minutes after; and if he were again created, he would be 84 minutes old before we could fee him. To illuftrate this pregreffive motion of light, (Plate XLII. fig. 2.), let AAn& B be the earth in two dif¬ ferent parts of its orbit, whofe diftance from each other is 81 millions of miles, equal to the earth’s diftance from the fun S. It is plain, that if the motion of light were inftantaneous, the fatellite 1 would appear to enter Into Jupiter’s lhadow FF at the fame moment of time to a fpccUtor in A, as to another in B. But by many years obfervations it has been fouud, that the immerfion of the fatellite mo the lhadow is feen 84 minutes fooner when the earth is at B, than when it is at A. And fo, as 5 Z Mr"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"453 ASTRO Mr Romeur firft difcovered, the motion of light is there¬ by proved to Lc progreflive, and not inftantaneous, as was formerly believed. It is eafy to compute in what time .the earth moves from A to B ; for the chord of 60 degrees of any circle is equal to the femidiameter of that circle; and as the earth goes through all the 360 degrees of its orbit in a year, it goes through 60 of thofe degrees in about 61 days. Therefore, if on any given day, fup- pofe the firft of June, the earth is at A, on the firft of Auguft it will be at B ; the chord, or ftraight line AB , being equal to DS the radius of the earth’s orbit, the fame with' AS its difiance from the fun. As the earth moves from D to C, through the fide AB of its orbit, it is conftantly meeting the light of Ju¬ piter’s fatellites fooner, which occafions an apparent ac¬ celeration of their eclipfes ; and as it moves through the other half H of its orbit, from C to D, it is receding from their light, which occafions an apparent retardation of their eclipfes, boeaufe their light is then longer be¬ fore it overtakes the earth. That thefe accelerations of the immerfions of Jupi¬ ter’s fatellites into his lhadow, as the earth approaches Towards Jupiter, and the retardations of their emerfions out of his lhadow, as the earth is going from him, are not occafioned by any inequality arifing trom the motions of the fatellites in excentric orbits, is plaiij, becaufe it affedls them all alike, in whatever parts of their orbits they are eclipfed. Befides, they go often round their orbits every year, and their motions are no way commen- furate to the earth’s. Therefore, a phenomenon not to be accounted for from the real motions of the fatellites, but lo eafily deducible from the earth’s motion, and fo anfwerable 1 hereto, mud be allowed to refult from it. This affords one very good proof of the earth’s annual motion. Chap. X. Of Solar and Sydereal Time. The fixed ftars appear to go round the earth in 23 hours ;6 minutes 4 feconds, and the fun in 24 hours; fo that the ftars gain three minutes 56 feconds upon the fun every day, which amounts to one diurnal revolu¬ tion in a year; and therefore, in 365 miles, as mea- fured by the returns of the fun to the .meridian, there are 366 days, as meafured by the ftars returning to it; the former are called fclar days , and the latter fyderzal. The diameter of the earth’s orbit is but a phyfical point in proportion to the ilfance of the ftars ; for which reafon, and the earth’s uniform motion on its axis, any given meridian will revolve from any ftar to the fame ftar again in every abfolute turn of the earth on its axis, without the leaft perceptible difference of time fhewn by a clock which goes exadtly true. If the earth had only a diurnal motion, without an an¬ nual any given meridian would revolve from the fun to the fan again in the fame quantity of time as from any ftar to the fame ftar again, becaufe the fun would never change his place with refpe<Et to the ftars. But as the earth advances ahnoft a degree eaftward in its orbit in the time that it turns eaft ward round its ajys*. whatever N O M Y. ftar pafles over the meridian on any day with the fun, will pafs over the fame meridian on the next day when the fun is almoll a degree fhort of it; that is, 3 minutes 56 feconds fooner. If the year contained only 360 days, as the ecliptic does 360 degrees, the fun’s appa¬ rent place, fo far as his motion is equable, would change a degrfee every day; and then the fydercal days would be juft four minutes fhorter than the folar. In Plate XU I. fig. 3. let ABCDEFGH1KLM be the earth’s orbit, in which it goes round the fun every . year, according to the order of the letters, that is, from weft to eaft; and turns round its axis the fame way from the fun to the fun again every 24 hours. Let S be the fun, and R a fixed ftar, at fuch an immenfe diftance, that the diameter of the earth’s orbit bears no fenfible pro¬ portion to that diftance. Let N>n be any particular me¬ ridian of the earth, and N a given point or place upon that meridian. When the earth is at A, the fun -S'hides the ftar R, which would always be hid if the earth ne- . ver removed from A ; and confequently, as the earth turns round its axis, the point N would always come round to the fun and ftar at the fame time. But when the earth has advanced, fuppofe a twelfth part of its orbit from A to B , its motion round its axis will bring the point N a twelfth part of a natural day, or two hours, fooner to the ftar than to the fun ; for the angle NBn is equal to the angle ASB ; and therefore any ftar, which comes to the meridian at noon with the fun when the eaith is at A, will come to the meridian at IO in the forenoon when the earth is at B. When the earth comes to C, the point N will have the ftar on its meridian at 8 in the morning, ;r four hours fooner than it comes round to the fun ;foi it muft revolve from Nu> n> before it has the fun in its meridian/ When the earth comes to D, the point N will have the ftar on its meri¬ dian at 6 in the morning, but that point muft revolve fix hours more from N t6 #, before it has mid-day b> the fun : For now the angle ASD is a right angle, and fo is NDh ; that is, the earth has advanced 90 degrees in its orbit, and muft turn 90 degreee on its axis to carry the point N from the ftar to the fun : For the ftar always comes to the meridian when N?u is parallel to RS A ; becaufe DS is but a point in refpeft oT RS. When the earth is at E, the ftar comes- to the meridian at 4 in the morning; at F, at 2 in the morning; and at G, the earth having gone half round its orbit, N points to the ftar R at midnight, it being then direftly oppofite to the fun ; and therefore, by the earth’s diurnal motion, the ftar comes to the meridian 12 hours before the fun. When the earth is at H, the'ftar comes to the meridian at 10 in the evening; at I, it comes to the meridian 8,. that is, 16 hours before the fun; at K , 18 hours be¬ fore him ; at L, 20 hours; at M, 22 ; ancf at A, equal¬ ly with the fun again. Thus' it is plain, that an abfolute turn of the earth on its axis (which is always completed when any particular meridian comes to be parallel to its fituation at any time of the day before) never brings the fame meridian round from the fun to the fun again ; but that the earth requires as much more than one turn on its axis to finifh a natural day, as it lias gone forward in that time; which, at a mean"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"ASTRO mean date, is a 365th part of a circle. Hence, in 365 days the earth turns 366 times round its axis; and therefore, as a turn of the earth ©n its axis completes a fydereal day, there mult be one fydereal day more in H year than the number of lolar days, be the number \\vhat it will, on the earth, or any other phm« One turn being loll with re(pe& to the number of folar days in a year, by the planets going round the fun.; ju(t as it would be lolt to a traveller, who,' in going round the earth, would lofe one day by Following the apparent diurnal motion of the fun ; and consequently would reckon otle day lefs at his return (let him .take what time he would to go round the earth) than thofe who remained all the. while at the place from which they fet out. So, if there were two earths revolving equably on their axes, and if one remained at A until the other travelled round the fun from A to A again, that earth which kept its place at A would have its lolar and fvde- rial days always of the fame length; and fo would have one folar day more than the other at its return. Hence, if the earth turned but once round its axis in a year, and if that turn was made the fame way as the earth goes round the fun, there would be continual day on one. fide of the earth, and continual , night on the other. Chap. XI. Of the Equation of Time. The earth’s motion on its axis being perfectly uni¬ form, and equal at all times of the year, the fydereal days are always precifely of an equal length; and io would the folar or natural days be, if the earth’s orbit were a perfect circle, and its axis perpendicular- to its orbit. But the earth’s diurnal motion on an incli¬ ned axis, and its annual motion in an elliptic orbit; Caufe the funs apparent motion in the heavens to be unequal : For fometimes he revolves from the meridian to the meridian again in fomewhat lefs than 24 hours, (hewn by a well-regulated clock; and at other times in fomewhat more : So that the time (hewn by an equal going clock and a true fun-dial is never the fame but on the 1 cth'oP 1 April, the 16th of June, the 31ft of Augud,. and the 24th of Decemb r. The clock, if it goes equal¬ ly and true all the year round, will be before. the fun from the 24th of December till the 15th of April ; from that time till tlte 16th of June the fun will be before the clock; from the i<>th o' June till the 31ft of Auguft,-' the dock will be again before the fun; and from thence to the 24th of December the fun will be fader than the. clock. The eafied and mod expeditions way of drawing a me¬ ridian line is this : Make four or five concentric circles, about a quarter of an inch from one another, on a flat board, about a foot in breadth ; and let the outmolt cir¬ cle be but little lefs than the board will contain.. Fix a pin perpendicularly in the centre, aiid of fuch a length that its whole (hadow may fall within-the innermolt cir¬ cle, for at lead four hours in the middle of the day. . The pin ought to'be about an eighth part of an inch ■ thick* and to have a round blunt point. The board ‘ being,fet exa&ly level in a place where the fun (hines. N O M Y. 45 9 fuppofe from eight in the morning till four in the after¬ noon, about which hours the end of the (haclow (hould fall without all the circles ; watch the times in the forenoon, when the extremity of the (hortening (hadow jud touches the leveral circles, and there make marks. Then, in the afternoon of the fame day, watch the lengthening (hadow, and where its end touches the feve- ral circles in going over them, make marks alio. Lad- Jy, with a pair of compaiTes, find exadtly the. middle point between the two marks on any circle, and draw a (traight line from the centre to that point; which line will be covered at noon by the (hadow of a fnvall upright, wire, which (hould be put in'the place of the pin. The reafon for drawing feveral circles is, that in cale one part of the day (hould prove clear, and the other part fome¬ what cloudy, if you mifs the time when the point of the (hadow (hould touch one circle, yon may perhaps catch it in touching another. The bc(t time for drawing a me¬ ridian line, in this manner, is about the (ummer foldice; becaufe the lun changes his declination (lowed, and his altitude faded in the longed days. If the cafement of a window, on which the fun (hines at noon, be quite upright, you may draw a line along the edge of its (hadow on the floor, when the (hadow of the pin is exailly on the meridian line of the board ; and as the motion of the (hadow of the cafement will be much more fenfible on the floor, than that of the (hadow of the pin on the board, you may,know to a few fe- conds-when it touches the meridian line on the floor; and fo regulate your clock for the day of obfervation by that line and any good equation table.. As the equation of time, or difference between the time (hewn by a well-regulated clock and a true fun-dial, depends upon two caufes, namely, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the unequal motion of the earth in it, we (hall fird explain the efFedts of thefe caufes feparately confidered, and then the united effects refultitig from their combination. 7 he earth’s motion on its axis being perfeftly equable, , or always at the fame rate, and the plane of the equator being perpendicular to its axis* it is evident, that in equal times equal portions of the equator pais over the meri¬ dian ; and fo would equal portions of the ecliptic, if it were parallel to or coincident with the equator. But, as the ecliptic is oblique to the equator, the equable, motion of the earth carries unequal portions of ilee- cliptic over the meridian in equal times, the difference being proportionate to the obliquity ; and, as fome parts of the ecliptic are much more oblique than others, thofd differences are unequal among themfelves. . Therefore, if two funs (hould dart either from the beginning of Aries or Libra, and continue to move through- equal arcs in e- qual times, one in the equator, and the other in the e- cliptic, the equatoreal fun would always run to the me¬ ridian in 24 hours time, as-meafured by a well-regula¬ ted clock ; but the fun in the ecliptic would return to the meridian fometimes fooner, and fometimes later than the equatoreal fun ; and only at the fame moments ; with him on four days of the year; namely, the 20th of March, when the fun enters Aries; the 2id of June, when he enters Cancer; the 23d of September, when he. enters s"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"4 60 ASTRO enters Libra; and the 2 id of December, when he en¬ ters Capricorn. But, as there is only one fun, and his apparent motion is always on the ecliptic, let us hence¬ forth call him the real fun ; and the other, which is fup- poled to move in the equator, the fittitious ; to which ialt, the motion of a well-regulated clock always an- fwers. In PlateXLII. fig. 4. let Z’Y’zQ. be the earth, ZFRz its axis, abode be. the equator, ABODE <kc. the northern half of the ecliptic from 'Y’ or on the fide of the globe .next the eye ; and MNQP See. the fouthern half on the oppofite fide from to c Y r> . Let the points at ABCDEF See. quite round from fto f again bound equal portions of the ecliptic, gone through in equal times by the real fun ; and thofe at abode/ be. equal portions of the equator, deferibed in equal times by the fictitious fun ; and let Z'Y'Z be the meridian. As the real fun meres obliquely in the ecliptic, and the fictitious fun dire&ly in the equator, with refpedt to the meridian ; a degree, or any number of degrees, be¬ tween Ojp and F on the ecliptic, mud be nearer the me¬ ridian Z°{ J z; than a degree, or any cot !d'ponaing num¬ ber of degrees on the equator from YP to f\\ and the mote fo, as they are the more oblique : And therefore the true fun comes fooner to the meridian every day whild he is in the quadrant c y F, than the fictitious fun does in the quadrant C V\\/'; for which reafon, the folar noou precedes no:, by the clock, until the real fun comes to F, and the fictitious to f ; which two points, being equididant fi cm the meridian, both funs will come .to it precifely at noon by the clock. Whild the real fun deferibes the fecond quadrant of the ecliptic FGHIKL from F to Q, he comes later to the meridian every day, than the fictitious fun moving through the fecond quadrant of the equator from f to ; for the points at GHIK and L, being farther from the meridian than their correfponding points at ghik and /, they mud be later of coming to it: And as both funs coine at the farqe moment to the point they come to the meridian at the moment of noon by the clock. In departing from Libra, through the third quadrants, the real fun going through MNOPHf towards rs at R, and the fictitious fun through mnopq towards r, the former conies to the meridian every day fooner than the latter, until the real fun comes to n, and the fictitious to r* and then they both come to the meridian at the lame time. Ladly, as the real fun moves equably through STUVJV, from rs towards °f ; and the fictitious fun xhra’-stuvw, from r towards y ; the former comes later every day to the meridian than the latter, until they both arrive at the point c f, and then they make noon at the fame time with the clock. This part of the equation of time may perhaps be (omewhat difficult to underhand by a figure, becaufe b nh halves of the ecliptic feem to be on the fame fide of the globe ; but it may be made very eafy to any per- fun who has a real globe before him, by putting fmall patches on every tenth or fifteenth degree, both of the e quator and ecliptic, beginning at Aries c y; and then, turning the bull dowly rouad welhvard, he will fee all N O M Y. the patches from Aries-to Cancer come to the brazen me¬ ridian fooner than the correfponding patches on the equa¬ tor; all thofe from Cancer to Libra will come latter to the meridian than their correfponding patches on the e- quator; thofe from Libra to Capricorn foqner, and thofe from Capricorn to Aries latter: And the patches at the beginnings of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capri-, corn, being either on, or even with thofe on the-equa- tor, (hew that the two funs either meet there, or are e- ven with one another, and fo come to the meridian at the fame moment. Let us fuppofe that there are two little balls moving equably round a celeftial globe by clock-work, one al¬ ways keeping in the ecliptic, and gilt with gold, to re- prefent the real fun ; and the other keeping in the equa¬ tor, and filvered, to reprefent the fictitious fun : And that whild thefe balls move once round the globe, ac¬ cording to the order of figns, the clock turns the globe 366 times-round its axis weft ward. The ftars will make 366 diurnal revolutions from the brafen meridian to it a- gain; and the two balls reprefenting the real and fic¬ titious fun always going farther eaftward from any gi¬ ven Itar, will come later than-it to the meridian every fol¬ lowing day; and each bail will make 365 revolutions to the meridian; coming equally to it at the beginnings of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn: But in every o- ther point of the ecliptic, the gilt ball will come either fooner or latter to the meridian than the filver bail, like the patches above mentioned. This would be a pretty enough way of ffiewing the rea¬ fon Why any given liar, which, on a certain day of the year, comes to the meridian with the fun, paffes over it fo much fooner every following day, as on that day twelvemonth to come to the meridian with the fun again ; and alfo to Ihew the reafon why the real fun conies to the meridian fometimes fooner, fometimes later, than it is noon by the clock; and, on four days of the year, at the fame time; whild the fictitious fun always comes to the meridiafl when it is twelve at noon by the clock. This would be no difficult talk for an artift fo perform ; for the gold ball might be carried round the ecliptic by a wire from its north pole, and the filver ball round the equator by a wire from its fouth pole, by medn - a few wheels to each. It is plain, that if the ecliptic were more obliquely po- fited to the equator, as the doted circle the equal divifions from T to X would come (till fooner to the meridian Zo'Y 5 than thofe marked A BCD and E do ; for two divifions containing 30 degrees, from y-to the fecond dot, a little ffiort of the figure 1, come fooner to the meridian than one divifion containing only 1 5 degrees from ty to A does, as the ecliptic now (lands: and thofe of the fecond quadrant from X to Zb would be fo much later. The third quadrant would be as the firft, and the fourth as the fecond. And it is likewife plain, that where the ecliptic is moil oblique, namely, about Aries and Libra, the difference would be greateft; and lead about Cancer and Capricorn, .where the obliquity Is lead. Having explained one cailfe of the difference of time (hewn by a well-regulated clock and a true fun-dial; and confidered the fun, not die eart-b, as.moving in the ecliptic"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"ASTRO ecliptic : We now proceed to explain the other caufe of this difference, namely, the inequality of the fun’s ap¬ parent motion, which is flowed in the fummer, when the the fun is farthefl from the earth, andfwiftefl in winter when he is neared to it. But the e;- th’s motion on its axis is equable all the year round, and is performed from wed to ead; which is the way that the fun appears to change his place in the ecliptic. If the fun’s motion were equable in the ecliptic, the whole difference, between the equal time as (hewn by a clock, and the unequal time as fhewn by the fun, would arife from the obliquity of the ecliptic. But the fun’s motion fometimes exceeds a degree in 24 hours, though generally it is lefs: And when his motion is flowed, any particular qjeridian will revolve fooner to him than when his motion is quicked; for it will overtake him in lefs time when he advances a lefs fpace than when he moves through a larger. Now, if there were two funs moving in the plane of the ecliptic, fo as to go round it in a year ; the one defcri- bing an equal arc every 24 hours, and the other defcri- bing fometimes a lefs arc 24 hours, and at other times a larger, gaining at one time of the year what it lod at the oppofite; it is evident that either of thefe funs would come fooner or latter to the meridian than the other, as it happened to be behind or befor.e the other: and when they were both in conjunftion, they would come to the meridian at the fame moment. As the real fun moves unequably^n the ecliptic, let us fuppofe a fictitious fun to move equably in a circle'coinci¬ dent with the plane of the ecliptic. In Plate XLIII. fig. 1. let ABCD be the ecliptic or orbit in which the real fun moves, and the doted circle abed the imaginary orbit of the fictitious fun ; each going round in a year according to the order of letters, or from wed to ead. Let HIKL be the earth turning round its axis the fame wayfevery 24 hours ; and fuppofe both funs to dart fri>m A and a , in a right line with the plane of the meridian EH, at the fame mo¬ ment; the real fun at A being then at his greated di¬ dance from the earth, at which time his motion is flowed ; and the fictitious fun at a, whofe v motion is al¬ ways equable, becaufe his didance from the earth is fup- pofed to be always the fame. In the time that the meridiSn revolves from H to H again, according to the order of the letters HIKL, the real fun has moved from A to F ; and the fictitious with a^quicker motion from a to f through a larger arc . Therefore, the meridian EH will revolve fooner from H to h under the real fun at F, than from H to b under the fictitious fun at/~; and confequent- ly it will then be noon, by the fun-dial fooner than by the clock. As the fccal fun moves from A towards C, the fwi£t- nefs of his motion increafes all the way to C, where it is at the quicked. But notwithdanding this, the fictitious fun gains fo much upon the real, foon after his departing from A, that the increafing velocity of the. real fun does not bring him up with the equally moving fictitious fun till -the former comes to C, and the latter to c, when each has gone half round its refpeCtive orbit •, and then being in conjunction, the meridian EH relvolving to EK comes Vol. I. No. 20.. 3 N O M Y\\ 461 to both funs at the fame time, and therefore it is noon by them both at the.fame moment. But the increafing velocity of the real fun, now be¬ ing at the quicked, carries him before the fictitious one ; and therefore, the fame meridian will come to the ficti¬ tious fun fooner than to the real : For, whild the ficti¬ tious fun moves from c to g, the real fun moves through a greater arc from C to G ; confequently the point K has its noon by the clock when it comes to k, but not its noon by the fun till it come to /. And although the velo¬ city of the real fun diminiflies all the way from C to A, and the fictitious fun by an equable motion is dill coming nearer to the real fun, yet they are not in conjunction till the one comes to A and the other to a; and then it is noon by them both at' t he fame moment. Thus it appears, that the folar noon is always later than noon by the clock, whild the fun goes from C to A\\ fooner whild he goes from A to C ; and at thefe points the fun and clock being equal, it is noon by them both at the fame moment. The point A is called, the fun’s apogee, becaufe when he is there he is at his greated diflance from the earth; the point C his perigee, becaufe when in it he is at his lead diflance from the earth ; and'a right line, as AEG, drawn through the earth’s centre, from one of thefe points to the other, is called the line of the apjides. The diflance that the fun has gone in any time from his apogee (not the diflariee he has to go to it, thqugh ever fo little) is called his mean anomaly, and is reckon¬ ed in figns and degrees, allowing 30 degrees to a fign,. Thus, when the fun has gone, fuppofe 174 degrees from his apogee at A, he is faid to be 5 figns 24 degrees from it, which is his mean anomaly: And when he is gone, fuppofe 355 degrees from his apogee, he is faid to be 11 figns 25 degrees*from it, although he be but 5 degrees Ihort of A in coming round to it again. From what was faid above, it appears, than when the fun’s anomaly is lefs than 6 figns, that is, when he is any where between A and C, in the half ABC of his orbit, the folar noon precedes the clock noon; but when his anomaly is more than 6 figns, that is, when he is a-' ny where between C and A, in the half CD A of his orbit, the clock noon precedes the folar. When his ano¬ maly is o figns o degrees, that is, when he is in his a- pogee at A ; or 6 figns o degrees, which is when he is in his perigee at C; he comes to the meridian at the* mo¬ ment that the fictitious fun dSes, and then it is noon by them both at the fame indant. The obliquity of the ecliptic to the equator, which is the firfl mentioned caufe of the equation of time, would make the fun and clocks agree on four days of the year; which are, when the fun enters Aries, Cancer, Libra, an 4 Capricorn: But the other caufe, now explained, wpuld make the fun and clocks equal only twice a, year ; that is, when the fun k in his apogee and perigee. Con¬ fequently, when thefe two points fall in the beginnings of Cancer and Capricorn, or of Aries and Libra, they concur in^uaking the fun and clocks equal in thefe points. But the apogee at prefent is in the 9th degree of Cancer, 6 A and"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"562 ASTRO and the perigee In the 9th degree of Capricorn, and there¬ fore the fun and clocks cannot be equal about the begin¬ ning of thefe figns, nor at any time of the year, except when the fwiftnefs or flownefs of equation refulting from One caufe juft balances the flownefs or fwiftnefs a riling from the other* Chap. XII. Of the PreceJJion of the Equinoxes. It is a known fa<ft, that there is a greater quantity of matter accumulated -all round the equatoreal parts of the earth than any where elfe. The fun and moon, by attracting this redundancy of matter, bring the equator fooner under them in every return towards it, than if there was no fuch accumula¬ tion. Therefore, if the fun fets out, as from any ftar, or other fixed point in the heavens, the moment when he is departing from the equinoctial or from either tropic, he will come to the fame equinox or tropic again 20 min. 1 74 fee. of time, or 50 feconds of a degree, be¬ fore he completes his courfe, fo as to arrive at the fame fixed ftar or point from whence he fet out. For, the equinoctial points recede 50 feconds of a degree weftward every year, contrary to the fun’s annual pro- greflive motion. When the fun arrives at the fame equinoctial or folfti- ticil point, he finilhes what we call the tropical year ; which, by obfervation, is found to contain 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 57 feconds : And, when he ar¬ rives at the fame fixed ftar again, as feen from the earth, he completes the fyderealyear , which contains 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 14! feconds. The fydereal year is therefore 20 minutes 174 feconds longer than the folar or tropical year; and 9 minutes 144 feconds longer than the Julian or civil year, which we-ftateat 365 days N O M Y. 6 hours: So that the civil year is almoft a mean be* twixt the fydereal and tropical. As the fun deferibes the whole ecliptic, or 360 de¬ grees, in a tropical year, he moves 59 minutes 8 fe¬ conds of a degree -.very day at a mean rate ; and con- fequently 50 feconds of a degree in 20 minutes 174 fe¬ conds of time : Therefore, he will arrive at the fame e- quinox or folftice when he is 50 feconds of a degree Ihort of the fame ftar or fixed point in the heavens from which he fet out in the year before. So that, with re- fped to the^ fixed ftars, the fun and equinoftial points fall back (as it were) 30 degrees in 2160 years ; which will make the ftars appear to have gone 30 degrees forward, with refpedt to the figns of the ecliptic in that time : For the fame figns always keep in the fame points of the ecliptic, without regard to the conftellations. To explain this by a figure, (Plate XLIII. fig. 1.) let the fun be in conjun&ion with a fixed ftar at S, fuppofe inthe3oth degree of ^ on the 21ft of May 1756. Then, making 2160 revolutions through the ecliptic VIVX, at the end of fo many fydereal years, he will be found again at S : But at the end of fo many Julian years, he will be found at M, (hort of S ; and at the end of fo many tropical years, he will be found (hort of M in the 30th degrees of Taurus at T, which has receded back from S to T in that time, by the preceflion of the equinoctial points T Aries and Libra. The arc ST will be equal to the amount of the preceflion of the equinox in 2160 years, at the rate of 50 feconds of a degree, or 20 mi¬ nutes 174 feconds of time, annually : This, in fo many years, makes 30 days 104 hours ; which is the difference between 2160 fydereal and tropical years : And the arc MT w ill be equal to the fpace moved through by the fun in 2160 times xi minutes 3 feconds, or 16 days 13 hours 48 minutes, which is the difference between 2x60 Julian and tropical years.

The above 11 minutes 3 feconds, by which the civil or Julian year exceeds the folar, amounts to 11 days in r 4 33 years; and fo much our feafons have fallen back with refpedt to the days of the months, fince the time of the Nicene Council in A. D. 325, and therefore in order to bring back all the fafts and feftivals to the days then fettled, it was requifite to fupprefs 11 nominal days. And that the fame feafons might be kept to the fame times of the year for the future, to leave out the biffex- tile day in February at the end of every century of years not divifible by 4 ; reckoning them only common years, as the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, viz. the years 1700, 1800, 1900, he. becaufe a day intercalated e- very fourth year was too much, and retaining the biffex- tile-day at the end of thofe centuries of years which are divifible by 4, as the 16th, 20th, and 24th centuries, viz. the years 1600, 2000, 2400, he. Otherwife, in length of time, the feafons would be quite reverfed with regard to the months of the year; though it would have required near 23,783 years to have brought about fuch a total change. If the earth had made exactly 3654 diurnal rotations on its axis, whilft it revolved from any equinodlial or folftitial point to the fame again, the civil and folar years would always have kept pace together, and the ftyle would never have needed any alteration. Having already mentioned the caufe of the preceffion of the equinodlial points in the heavens, which occafions a flow deviation of the earth’s axis from its parallelifm, and thereby a change of the declination of the ftars from the equator, together with a flow apparent motion of the ftars forward with refpedt to the figns of the eclip¬ tic; we/hall now deferibe the phenomena by a diagram. In Plate XLIII. fig 2. let NZSVL be the earth, SON A its axis produced to the ftarry heavens, and ter¬ minating in A, the prefent north pole of the heavens, which is vertical to N the north pole of the earth. Let E 0 §>_be the equator, T 2 LZ the tropic of Cancer, and VTrs the tropic of Capricorn ; VOZ the ecliptic, and DO its axis, both which are immoveable among the ftars. But as the equinodlial points recede in the ecliptic, the earth’s axis SON is in motion- upon the earth’s centre 0 , in fuch a manner as to deferibe the double cone NOn and and SOs, round the axis of the ecliptic BO, in the time that the equinodlial points move quite round the ecliptic, which is 25,920 years; and in that length of time, the north pole of the earth’s axis produced, deferibes the circle ABCDA in the ftarry heavens, round the pole of the ecliptic, which keeps immoveable in the centre of that circle. The earth’s axis being 234 degrees inclined to the axis of the ecliptic, the circle ADCDA, deferi- bed by the north pole of the earth’s a?ds produced to A, is 47 degrees in diameter, or double the inclination of the eardi’s axis. In confequence of this, the point A, which at prefent is the north pole' of the heavens, and near to a ftar of the fecond magnitude in the tail of the conftellation called the Little Bear, muft be deferted by the earth’s axis, which moving backwards a degree every 72 years, will be diredted towards the ftar or point B in"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"ASTRO 6480 years hence; and in double of that time, or 12,960 -years, it will be directed towards the dar or point C ; which will then be the north pole of the heavens, al¬ though it is at prefent 8-§- degrees fouth of the zenith of London L.

The moon’s furface mountain¬ ous : Her phafes deferibed . Her path and the paths of Jupitermoons delineated: The proportions of the diameters of their or¬ bit s t and thofe of Saturn’s moons , to each other , and tod he diameter of the Sun. By looking at the moon with an ordinary telefcope, we perceive that her furface is diverfified with long traits of prodigious high mountains and deep cavities. Some of her mountains, by comparing their height with her diameter (which is 2180 miles) are found to be three times higher than the highed hills on our earth. This ruggednefs of the moon’s furface is of great ufe to us, by reflecting the fun’s light to all fides; for if the moon .were fmooth and polilhed like a lookingrglafs, or covered with water, die could never diflribute the fun’s light all round ; only in fome pofitions (he would (hew us his image no bigger than a point, but with fuch a ludre as would be hurtful to our eyes. The moon’s furface being fo uneven, many have won¬ dered why her edge appears not jagged, as well as the curve bounding the light and dark places. But if we confider, that what we call the edge of the moon’s di(k is not a Angle line fet round with mountains, in which cafe it would appear irregularly indented, but a large zone having many mountains lying behind one another from the obferver’s eye, we (hall find that the mountains in fome rows will be oppofite to the vales in others, and fo fill up the inequalities as to make her appear quite round; jud as when one looks at an orange, although its roughnefs be very difcernible on the fide next the eye, efpecially if the fun or a canflle fliines obliquely on that fide, yet the line terminating the vifible part dill appears fmooth and even. As the fun can only enlighten that half of the earth whicj) is at any moment turned towards him, and being withdrawn from the oppofite half, leaves it in darknefs; Vox. I. No. 20. 3 N O M Y. 465 fo he likewife doth to the moon ; only with this differ¬ ence, that the earth being furrounded by an aqnofphere, and the moon having none, we have twilight after the fun fets; but the lunar inhabitants have an immediate tranfition from the brighted fun-fhine to the blacked darknefs. For, (Plate XLIII. fig. 3.) let tkrsiu be the earth, and ABCDEFGH the moon in eight different parts of her orbit. As the earth turns round its axis from wed to eall, when any place comes to t the twilight begins there, and when it revolves from thence to r the the fun S rifes ; when the place comes to s the fun fets, and when it comes to w the twilight ends. But as the moon turns round her axis, which is only once a-month, the moment that any point of her furface comes , to r (fee the moon at G J the fun rifes there without any pre¬ vious warning by twilight ; and when the fame point comes to s the fun fets, and that point goes into darknefs as black as at midnight. The moon being an opaque fpherical body, (for her hills take off no more from her roundnefs than the ine¬ qualities on the furface of an orange takes off from its roundnefs), we can only fee that part of.the enlightened half of her which is towards the earth. And therefore, when the moon is at A , in conjunction with the fun S, her dark half is towards the earth, and (he difappears, as at a, there being no light on that half to render it vi¬ fible. When ihe conies to her fird oCtant at B, or has gone an eighth part of her orbit from her conjunction, a quarter of her enlightened fide is towards the earth, and Ihe appears horned, as at b. When Ihe has gone a quar¬ ter of her orbit from between the earth and fun to C, Ihe Ihews us one half of her enlightened fide, as at c, and we fay, Ihe is a quarter old. At D in her fecond oCtant, and by (hewing us more of her enlightened fide (he appears gibbous, as at d. At E her whole enlight¬ ened fide is towards the earth, and therefore Ihe ap- ears round, as at ,e, when we fay, it is full moon, n her third oflant at F, part of her dark fide being to¬ wards the earth, (he again appears gibbous, and is on the decreafe, as at f. At G we fee jud one half of liet enlightened fide, and (he appears half decreafed, dr in her third quarter, as at g. At H we only fee a quarter of her enlightened fide, being in her fourth oftant, where (he appears horned, as at 1^. And at A, having com- pleated her courfe from the fun to die fun again, Ihe dit- appears, and we fay, it is new moon. r l hus in going from A to E, the moon feems continually to increafe; and in going from E to A, to decreafe in the fame pro¬ portion ; having like phafes at equal didances from A or E, but as feen from the fun S, (he is always foil. The moon appears not perfectly round when (he is foil in the highed or lowed part of her orbit, becaufe we have not a full view of her enlightened fide at that tifne. When full in the highed part of her orbit, a fmall defi¬ ciency appears on her lower edge ; and the contrary when full in the lowed part of her orbit. It is plain by the figure, that when the moon changes to the earth, the earth appears full to the moon ; and vice verfa. For when the moon is at A, new to the earth, the whole enlightened fide of the earth is towards the moon.; and when the moon is at E, full to the earth, 6 B its"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"^ 6 ASTRO its dark fide is towards her. Hence a new moon anfwers to a full earth, and a full moon to a new earth. The quarters are alfo reverfed to each other. . Between the third quarter and change, the moon is frequently vifible in the forenoon, even when the fun fhines; and then (he affords us an opportunity of feeing a very agreeable appearance, where-ever we find a glo¬ bular ftone above the level of the eye, as fuppofe on the top of a gate. For, if the fun Ihines on the ftone, and ■ we place ourfclves fo as the upper part of the fun may juft feem to touch the point of the moon’s lowermoft horn, we lhall then fee the enlightened part of . the ftone exaftly of the fame fitape with the moon, horned as (he is, and inclining the fame way to the horizon. The reafon is plain, for the fun enlightens the ftone the fame way as he does the moon ; and both being globes, when we put ourfelves into the above fituation, the moon and ftone have tlie fame pofition to our eyes, and therefore we niuft fee as much of the illuminated part of the one as of the other. The pofition of the moon’s cufps, or a right line touching the points of her horns, is very differently in¬ clined to the horizon at different hours of the fame days of her age. Sometimes fhe ftands, as it were, upright en her lower horn, and then fuch a line is perpendicular to the horizon : when this happens, fhe is in what the aftronomers call the nonageftmal degree , which is the bigheft point of the ecliptic above the horizon at that time, and is 90 degrees from both fides of the horizon, where it is then cut by the ecliptic. But this never hap¬ pens when the moon is on* the meridian, except when fhe is at the very beginning of Cancer or Capricorn. The inclination of that part of the ecliptic to the ho¬ rizon in which the moan is at any time when horned, may be known by the pofition of her horns; for a right line touching their points is perpendicular to the ecliptic. And as the angle that the moon’s orbit makes with the ecliptic can never raife her above, nor deprefs her below the ecliptic, more than two minutes of a degree, as feen from the fun, it can have no fenfible effedt upon the pofi¬ tion of her horns. Therefore, if a quadrant be held up, fo as one of its edges may feem to touch the moon’s horns, the graduated fide being kept towards the eye, and as far from the eye as it can be conveniently held, the arc between the plumb-line and that edge of the qua¬ drant which feems to touch the moon’s horns, will fhew the inclination of that part of the ecliptic to the hori¬ zon. And the arc between the other edge of the qua¬ drant and-plumb line will {hew the inclination of the moon’s horns to the horizon. The moon generally appears as large as the fun ; for the angle vkA, { P late XL 1 II. fig. 3.) under which the moon is Ken from the earth, is the fame with the angle LkM, under which the fun is feen from it. And therefore the moon may hide the fun’s whole dilk from us, as fhe fome- tint s does in folar eclipfes The reafon why Ihe does not eclipfe the fun at every change lhall be explained afterwards. If the moon were farther from the earth, as at a, Ihe could never hide the whole of the fun from us ; for then (he would appear under the angle NkO, eclipfing\"’ only that part of. the fun which lies between N and O'. were fhe N O M Y. ftill further from the earth, as at X, fhe would appear under the fmall angle TkIV, like a fpot on the fun, hi¬ ding only the part TJV from our fight. The moon turns round her. axis in the time that fhe goes round her orbit; which is evident from hence, that a fpe&ator at reft, without the periphery of the moon’s orbit, would fee all her fides turned regularly towards him in that time. She turns round her axis from any ftar to the fame ftar again in 27 days 8 hours; from the fun to the fun again in 29} days : the former is the length of the fydereal day, and the latter the length of her fo¬ lar day. A body moving round the fun would have a folar day in every revolution, without turning on its axis, the fame as if it had kept all the while at reft, and the fun moved round it; but without turning round its axis it could never have one fydereal day, becaufe it would always keep he fame fide towards any given ftar. If the earth had no annual motion, the moon would go round it fo as to.compleat a lunation, a fydereal, and a folar day, all in the fame time. But, becaufe the earth goes forward in its orbit, while the moon goes round the earth in her orbit, the moon muff go as much more than, round her orbit from change to change in compleating a folar day, as the earth has gone forward in its orbit du¬ ring that time, i. e. almoft a. twelfth part of a circle. The moon’s periodical and fynodical revolution may be familiarly reprefented by the motions of the hour and minute-hands of a watch round its dial-plate, which is divided into 12 equal parts or hours, as the ecliptic is divided into 12 figns, and the year into 12 months. Let us fuppofe thefe 12 hours to be 12 figns, the hour- hand the fun, and the minute-hand the moon ; then will the former go round once in a year, and the latter once in a month; but the moon, or minute-hand, muft go more than round from any point of the circle where it was laft conjoined with the fun, or hour-hand, to over¬ take it again : For the hour-hand being iff motion, can never be overtaken by the minute-hand at that point from which they ftarted at their laft conjunction. If the earth had no annual motion, the moon’s mo¬ tion round the earth, and her track in abfolute fpace, would be always the fame. But as the earth and moon move round the fun, the moon’s real path in the hea¬ vens is very different from her vifible path round the earth; the latter being in a progreflive circle, and the former in a curve of different degrees of concavity, which would always be the fame in the fame parts of the hea¬ vens, if the moon performed a complete number of lu¬ nations in a year without any thing over. Let a nail in the end of the axle of a chariot-wheel reprefent the earth, and a pin in the nave the moon ; if the body of the chariot be propped up fo as to keep that wheel from touching the ground,, and the wheel be then turned round by hand, the pin will deferibe a circle both round the nail, and in the fpace it moves through. But if the props be taken away, the horfes put to, and the chariot driven over a piece of ground which is circu¬ larly convex, the nail in the axle will deferibe a circular curve, and the pin in the nave -will ftill deferibe a circle round the progreflive nail in the axle, but not in the fpace through which it moves. In this cafe, the curve delcribed."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"A S T R C defcribed by the nail will refemble in miniature as much of the earth’s annual path round the fun, as it defcribes whilft the moon goes as often round the earth as the pin does round the nail; and the curve defcribed by the nail will have fome refemblance of the moon’s path du¬ ring fo many lunations. Let us now fuppofe that the radius of the circular curve delcribed by the nail in .the axle is to the radius of the circle which the pin in the nave defcribes round the axle, as 3374- t° 1 ; which is the proportion of the ra¬ dius or femidiameter of the earth’s orbit to that of the moon’s, or of the circular curve i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 B, See. to the little circle .a ; and then, whilft the pro- greffive nail defcribes the faid curve from A to E, the pin will go once round the nail with regard to the cen¬ tre of its path, and in fo doing, will deferibe the curve abode. The former will be a true reprefentation of the earth’s path for one lunation, and the latter of the moon’s for that time. Here we may fet afide the inequalities of the moon’s motion, and alfo. the earth’s moving round its common centre of gravity and the moon’s : All which,, if they were truly copied in this experiment, would not fenfibly alter the figure of the paths defcribed by the nail and pin, even though they Ihould rub againft a plain up¬ right furface all the way, and leave their tracks vifible upon it. And if the chariot was driven forward on fuch a convex piece of ground, fo as to turn the wheel feve- ral times round, the track of'the pin in the nave would Hill be concave toward the centre of the circular curve defcribed by the pin in the axle ; as the moon’s path is always concave to the fun in the centre of the earth’s annual orbit. In this diagram, the thickeft curve line ABC 1 ), with the numeral figures fet to it, reprefents as much of the earth’s annual orbit as it defcribes in 32 days from weft to eaft; the little circles at abode Ihew the moon’s orbit in due proportion to the earth’s ; and the fmalleft curve abedef reprefents the line of the moon’s path in the hea¬ vens for 3 2 days, accounted from any particular new moon at a The machine, Plate XLIX. fig. 2. is for delineating the moon’s path, and will be delcribed,.with the reft of the aftronomical machinery, in the laft chapter. The fun is fuppofe.d to be in the centre of the curve i 1 2 3. 4567 B, See. and the fmall’dotted circles upon it repre- lent the moon’s orbit, of which the radius is in the fame proportion to the earth’s- path in this fcheme, that the radius of the moon’s brbit in- the heavens bears to the ra¬ dius of the earth’s annual path round the fun; that is, as. 240,000 to 81,000,000, or as-1 to 3 3 74». When the earth is at A, the new moon is.at a ; and in the feven days that the earth defcribes’ the curve 1 2 3 4567, the moon, in accompanying the earth de- feribes the curve ab\\ and is in her firft quarter at b when the earth is at B. As the earth defcribes the curve B 89 xo il 12 13 14, the moon defcribes the • curve bc\\ and is at c, oppofite to the fun, when the earth is at C. Whilft jhe earth defcribes the curve C 15 16 1748 19 20 21 22, the moon defcribes the curve cd ; and is in her third quarter at d when the . earth is at D. Once more, whilft the earth defcribes the curve D 23 24 25 26 27 28 29, the moon defcribes > N O M Y. 467 the curve Je, and is again in conjunction at e with the fun when the earth is at E, between the 29th and goth- day of the moon’s age, accounted by the numeral figures from the new moon at A. In deferibing the curve abode, the moon goes round the progreflive earth as really as if Ihe had kept in the dotted circle A, and the earth conti¬ nued immoveable in the centre of that circle. And thus we fee, that although the moon goes round the earth in a circle, with refpeCt to the earth’s centre, her real path in the heavens is not very different in ap¬ pearance frpm the earth’s path. To Ihew that the moon’s path is concave to the fun, even at the time of change, it is carried on a little farther into a fecond lunation, as to/. The moon’s abfolute motion from her change to her firft quarter, or from a to b, is fo much flower than the earth’s, that Ihe falls 240 thoufand miles (equal to the femidiameter of.he*f orbit) behind the earth at her firft quarter in b, when the earth is in B ; that is, Ihe falls back a fpace equal to her diftance from the eajth. From that time her motion is gradually accelerated to her op- pofition or full at e, and then Ihe is come up as far as the earth, having regained what fheloft in her firft quar¬ ter from a to b. From the full to the laft quarter at d, her motion continues accelerated, fo as to be juft as far before the earth at D, as Ihe was behind it at her firft quarter in b. But, from d to e her motion is retarded fo, that Ihe lofes as much with refpeCt to the earth as is equal to her diftance from it, or to the femidiameter of her orbit; and by that means Ihe comes to e, and is • then in conjunction with the fun, as feen from the earth at E. Hence we find, that the moon’s abfolute motion is flower than the earth’s from her third quarter to her firft ; and fwifter than the earth’s from her firft quarter to her third: Her path being lefs curved than the earth’s in the former cafe, and more in the latter. Yet it is ftill bent the fame way towards the fun; for if we imagine the concavity Of the earth’s- orbit to be meafured by the length of a perpendicular line Cg, let down from the earth’s place upon the ftraight line bgd at the full of the moon, and connecting the places of the earth at the end of the moon’s firft and third quarters, thqt length will be about 640 thoufand miles; and the moon, when new, . only approaching nearer to the fun by 240 thoufand miles than the earth is,- the length of the perpendicular let down from her place at that time upon the fame ftraight line, and which Ihews the concavity of that part of her path, will be about 400 thoufand miles. The moon’s path being concave to the fun throughout, , demoftrates that her gravity towards the fun, at her conjunction, exceeds her gravity towards the earth. And if we confider that the quantity of matter in the fun is almoft 230 thoufand times as great as the quantity of matter in the earth, and that the attraction of each body diminilhes as the fquare of the diftance from it increafes, we Ihall foon find, that the point of equal attraction be¬ tween the earth and the fun is about 70 thoufand miles nearer the earth than the moon is at her change. It may now appear furprifing, that the moon does not abandon the earth when Ihe is between' it and the fun, becaufe the k confiderably more attracted by the fun than by the earth.:!"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"463 ASTRO earth at that time. But this difficulty vanilhes when we confider, that a common impulfe on any fyftem of bodies affeCts not their relative motions; but that they will continue to attract, impel,-or circulate round one an¬ other, in the fame manner as if there was no fuch im¬ pulfe. The moon is fo near*the earth, and both of them fo far from the fun, that the attractive power of the fun may be conlidered as equal on both ; and therefore, the moon will continue to circulate round the earth in the fame manner as if the fun did not attract them at all; like bodies in the cabbin of a Ihip, which move round, or impel one another, in the fame manner when -the (hip is under fail, as when it is at reft, becaufe they are all equally affected by the common motion of the fliip. If by any other caufe, fuch as the near approach of a comet, the moon’s diflance from the eanh fhould happen to be fo much increafed, that the difference of their gravita¬ ting forces towards the fun fliould exceed that of the moon towards the earth ; in that cafe, the moon, when in conjunction, would abandon the earth, and be either drawn into the fun, or comet, or circulate round a- bout it. The curves which Jupiter’s fatellites defcribe, are all of different forts from the path defcribed by our moon, although thefe fatejlites go round Jupiter, as the moon goes round the earth. In Plate XLIII. fig. 3. let ABODE, &c. be as much of Jupiter’s orbit as he de- fcribes in 18 days from A to T • and the curves abed will be the paths of his four moons going round him in his progreffive motion. Now let us fuppofe all thefe moons to fet out from a conjunction with the fun, as feen from Jupiter at A ; then his firft or neareft moon will be at a, his fecondat b, his third at c, and his fourth at d. At the end of 24 terreftrial hours after this conjunction, Jupiter has moved to B, his firft moon or fatellite has defcribed the curve a\\, his fecond the curve b t , his third c 1, and his fourth di. The next day, when Jupiter is at C, his firft fatellite has defcribed the curve a2, from its con¬ junction, his fecond the curve b2, his third the curve C2, and his fourth the curve d 2 , and fo on. The numeral figures under the capital letters fhew Jupiter’s place in his path every day for 18 days, accounted from A to T; and the like figures fet to the paths of his fatellites, Ihew wherq they are at the like times. The firft fatellite, al- moft under C, is ftationary at + as feen from the fun ; and retrograde from + to 2 : at 2 it appears ftationary again, and thence it moves forward until it has paft 3, and is twice ftationary, and once retrograde, between 3 and 4. The path of this fatellite interfeCts itfelf every 42! hours, making fuch loops as in the diagram at 2 3 5 7 9 10 12 14 16 18, a little after every con¬ junction. The fecond fatellite b, moving flower, barely croffes its path every 3 days 13 hours; as at 4 7 11 14 18, making only five loops and as many conjunctions in the time that the firft makes ten. The third fatellite c moving ftill flower, and having defcribed the curve £ ■ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 , comes to an angle at 7 in con¬ junction with the fun at the end of 7 days 4 hours ; and lo goes on to defcribe fuch another curve 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14, and is at 14 in its next conjunction. The N O M Y. fourth fatellite d is always progreffive, making neither loops nor angles in the heavens ; but comes to its next conjunction at e between the numeral figures 16 and 17, or in 16 days 18 hours. In order to have a tolerably good figure of the paths of thefe fatellites, take the following method. It appears by the fcheme, that the three firft fatellites come almoft into the fame line or polition every feventh day ; the firft being only a little behind with the fecond, a d the fecond behind with the third. But the period of the fourth fatellite is fo incommenfurate to the periods of the other three., that it cannot be gueffed at by the dia¬ gram when it would fall again into a line of conjunction with them, between Jupiter and the fun. And no won¬ der ; for fuppofing them all to have been once in con¬ junction, it will require 3,087,043,493,260 years to bring them in conjunction again. In Plate XLIV. fig. 1. we have the proportions of the orbits of Saturn’s five fatellites, and of Jupiter’s four, to one another, to our moon’s orbit, and to the dilk of the fun. S is the fun ; M m the moon’s orbit, (the earth fuppofed to he at E ;), J Jupiter ; 1234 the orbits of his four moons or fatellites ; Sat Saturn ; and 12345 the orbits of his five moons. Hence it ap¬ pears, that the fun would much more than fill the whole orbit of the moon ; for the fun’s diameter is 763,000 miles, and the diameter of the moon’s orbit />nly 480,000. In proportion to all thefe orbits of th$ fatel- lites, the radius of Saturn’s annual orbit would be 21-f yards, of Jupiter’s orbit 1 i-J-, and of' the earth’s 2^, taking them in round numbers. Chap. XIV. The Phenomena of the Harvefl- moon explained by a common Globe: The years in which the Harvejl-moons are leajl and mojl beneficial from 1751, to 186,1. The long Duration of Moon-light at the Poles in Winter. It is generally believed that the moon rifes about 48 minutes later every day than on the preceding; but tb s is true only With regard to places on the equator. In places of confiderable latitude there is a remarkable dif¬ ference, efpecially in the harveft time ; with which far¬ mers were better acquainted than aftronomers till of late ; and gratefully aferibed the early rifing of the full moon at that time of the year to the goodnefs of God, in ordering it fo on purpofe to give them an immediate fupply of moon-light after fun-fet for their greater con- veniency in reaping the fruits of the earth. And indeed, In this inftance of the harveft-.moon, as in many others difcoverable by aftronomy, the wifdom and beneficence of the Deity is confpicuogs, who really ordered the courfe of the moon fo, as to beftow more or lefs light on all parts of the earth as their feveral circumftances and feafons render it more or lefs ferviceable. About the equator, where there is no variety of feafons, and the weather changes feldom, and at ftated times, moon¬ light is not neceflary for gathering in the produce of the ground ;"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"ASTRO ground 5 and there the moon rifes about 48 minutes later every day or night than on the former. At 'con¬ fiderable diftances from the equator, where the weather and feafons are more uncertain, the autumnal full moons rife very foon after fun-fet for feveral evenings together. At the polar circles, where the mild feafon is of very Ihort duration, the autumnal full moon rifes at fun-let from the firft to the third quarter. And at the poles, where the fun' is for half a year abfent, the winter full moons Ihina conftantly without letting from the firft to the third quarter. It is foon faid that all thefe phenomena are owing to the different angles made by the horizon and different parts of the moon’s orbit; and that the moon can be full but once or twice in a year in thofe parts of her orbit which rife with the leaft angles. But to explain this fubjedt intelligibly, we muft dwell much longer upon it. The plane of the equinodlial is perpendicular to the earth’s axis : and therefore, as the earth turns round its axis, all parts of the equinoctial make equal angles with the horizon both at riling and fetting ; fo that equal portions of it always rife or fet in equal times. Confe- quently, if the moon’s motion were equable, and in the equinodlial, at the rate of 12 degrees from the fun every day, as it is in her orbit, flie would rife and fet 48 mi¬ nutes later every day than on the preceding c for 12 de¬ grees of the equinodlial rife or fet in 48 minutes of time , in all latitudes. But the moon’s motion is fo nearly in the ecliptic, that we may confider her at prefent as moving in. it. Now the different parts of the ecliptic, on account of its obliquity to the earth’s axis, make very different angles with the horizon as they rife or fet. Thofe parts or figns which rife with the fmalleft angles fet .with the greateft, and vice verfa. In equal times, whenever this angle is leaft, a greater portion of the ecliptic rifes than when the angle is larger ; as may be feen by elevating the pole of a globe to any confiderable latitude, and then turning it round its axis in the horizon. Confequently, when the moon is in thofe figns which rjfe or fet with the fmalleft angles, fhe rifes or fets with the leaft difference of time ; and with the greateft difference in thofe figns which rife or fet with the greateft angles. But, becaufe all who reackthis treatife may not be pro¬ vided with globes, though in this cafe it is requifite to know how to ufe them, we fliall fubftitute the figure of a globe; (Plate XLIV. fig. 2.) in which FUP is the axis, 25 T R the tropic of Cancer, LTrs the tropic of Ca¬ pricorn, 2 oEUrj the ecliptic touching both the tro¬ pics, which are 47 degrees from each other, and AB the horizon. The equator, being in the middle between the tropics, is cut by the ecliptic in two oppofite points, which are the beginnings of qp Aries and Libra. K is the hour-circle with its index, F the north pole of the globe elevated to a confiderable latitude, fuppofe 40 degrees above the horizon, and P the fouth pole de- preffed as much below it. Becaufe of the oblique pofi- tion of the fphere in this latitude, the ecliptic has the high elevation N £5 above the horizon, making the angle NUSB of 73-i degrees with it when 23 Cancer is on the meridian, at which time Libra rifes in the Vol. I. Ncu 20. 3 N O M Y. 469 eaft. But let the globe be turned half round its axis* till ri Capricorn comes to the meridian and °f Aries rifes in the eaft, and then the ecliptic will have the low elevation NL above the horizon, making only an angle NUL of 26^ degrees with it; which is 47 degrees lefs than the former angle, equal to the diftance between the tropics. In northern latitudes, the fmalleft angle made by the ecliptic and horizon is when Aries rifes, at which time Libra fets ; the greateft when Libra rifes, at which time Aries fets. From the riling of Aries to the rifing of Libra, (which is twelve fydereal hours), the angle in- creafes ; and from the rifing of Libra to the rifing of Aries, it decreafes in the fame proportion. By this ar¬ ticle and the preceding, it appears that the ecliptic rifes fafteft about Aries, and flowed about Libra. On the parallel of London, as much of the ecliptic 'rifes about Pifces and Aries in two hows as the moon goes through in fix days ; and therefore whilft the moon is ill thefe figns, lhe differs but two hours in rifing for fix days together ; that is, about 20 minutes later every day or night than on the preceding, at a mean rate. But in 14 days afterwards, the moon comes to Virgo and Libra, which are the oppofite figns to Pifces and Aries ; and then lhe differs almoft four times as much in rifing ; namely, one hour and about fifteen minutes later every day or night than the former, whilft lhe is in thele figns. All thefe things will be made plain by putting fmall * patches on the ecliptic of a globe, as far from one ano¬ ther as the moon moves from any point of the celeftial ecliptic in 24 hours, which at a mean rate is 13^ de¬ grees ; and then in turning the globe round, obferve the rifing and fetting of the patches in the horizon, as the index points out the different times in the hour-circle. A few of thefe patches are reprefented by dots at o 1 2 3, <bc. on the ecliptic, which has the pofition LUI when Aries rifes in the eaft; and by the dots 0123, when Libra rifes in the eaft; at which time the ecliptic has the pofition EUrs ; making an angle of 62 degrees with the horizon in the latter cafe, and an angle of no more than 15 degrees with it in the former ; fuppofing the globe rectified to the latitude of London. Having rectified the globe, turn it until the patch at o, about the beginning of X Pifces in the half LUI of the ecliptic, comes to the eaftern .fide of the horizon; and then keeping the ball fteady, fet the hour-index to XII, becaufe that hour may perhaps be more eafily re¬ membered than any other. Then turn the globe round weftward, and in that time, fuppofe the patch o to have moved thence to 1, 13^ degrees, whilft the earth turns once round its axis, and you will fee that 1 rifes only about 20 minutes later than o did on the day hefore. Turn the globe round again, and in that time fuppofe the fame patch to have moved from 1 to 2 ; and it will rife only 20 minutes later by the hour-index than it did at 1 on the day or turn before. At the end of the next turn, fuppofe the patch to have gone from 2 to 3 at U, and it will rife 20 minutes later than it did at 2. And fo on for fix turns, in which time there will fcarce be two hours difference : nor would there have been fo much if 6 C the"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"47° ASTRO the 6 degrees of the fun’s motion in that time had been allowed for. At the fir ft turn the patch rifts fouth of the eaft, at the middle turn due eaft, and at the laft turn north of the eaft. . But thefe patches will be 9 hours of fetting on the weftern fide of the horizon, which (hews that the moon will be fo much later of fetting in that week in which (he moves through thefe two figns. The riaufe of this difference is evident ; for Pifces and Aries make only an angle of 15 degrees with the horizon when they rife ; but they make an angle of 62 degrees with it when they fet. As the figns Taurus, Gemini, Can¬ cer, Leo, Virgo, and Libra, rife fucceflively, the angle increafes gradually which they make with the horizon; aiftl decreafes in the fame proportion as they fet. And for that reafon, the moon differs gradually more in the time of her rifing every day whilft lhe is in thefe figns, 1 and lefs in her fetting : after which, through the other fix figns, viz. Scorpio, Sagittary, Capricorn, Aqua¬ rius, Pifces, and Aries, the rifing difference becomes lefs- every day, until it be at the leaft of all, namely, ift Pifces and Aries. The moon goes round the ecliptic in 27 days 8 hours; but not from change to change in lefs than 29 days 12 hours : fo that (he is in Pifces and Aries, at leaft once in every lunation, and in fome lunations twice. If the earth had no annual motion, the fun would ne¬ ver appear to Ihift his place in the ecliptic. And then every new moon would fall in the fame fign and degree' of the ecliptic, and every full moon in the oppofite ; for the moon would go precifely round the ecliptic from change to change. So that if the moon was once full in Pifces or Aries, lhe would always be full when lhe came round to the fame fign and degree again. And as the full moon rifes at fun-let (becaufe when any point of the ecliptic fets, the oppofite point rifes) lhe would con- ftantly rife within two hours of fun-fet, on the parallel of London, during the week in which flie were full. But in the time that 'the moon goes round the ecliptic Horn any conjunction or oppofition, the earth goes almoft a fign forward ; and therefore the fun will feem to gp as far forward in that time, namely, 274 degrees; fo that the moon muft go-2 71- degrees more than round, and as much farther as the fun advances in that interval, which is 2 jV degrees, before lhe can be in conjunction with, or oppofite to, the fun again. Hence it is evident, that there can be but one conjunction or oppofition of the fun and moon in a year in any particular part of the ecliptic. This may be familiarly exemplified by the hour and mi¬ nute-hands of a watch, which are.never in conjunction or oppofition in that part of the dial-plate where they were fo laft before. And indeed, if we compare the twelve hours on the dial-plate to the twelve figns of the ecliptic, the hour-hand to the fun, and the minute-hand to the moon, we ftiall have a tolerably near refemblance in mi¬ niature to the motions of our great celeftial luminaries. The only difference is, that whilft- the fun goes once round the ecliptic, the moon makes 12 \\ conjunctions with him : but whilft the hour hand goes round the dial- plate, the minute-hand makes only 11 conjunctions with it; becaufe the minute-hand moves flower in refpeCt of the hour-hand than the moon does with, regard m the fun. N O M Y. As the moon can never be full but when lhe is oppo- ftte to the fun, and the fun is never jn Virgo, and Libra, but in our autumnal months, it is plain that the moon is never full in'the oppofite figns, PifceS and Aries, but in' thefe two months. And therefore we can have only two full moons in the year, which rife fo near the time of fun-fet, for a week together, as above mentioned. The former of thefe is called the harveji-moon, and the latter the hunter's moon. Here it will probably be aflced, Why we never ob- ferve this remarkable rifing of. the moon, but in harveft, fince (he is, in Pifces and Aries twelve times in the year befides.; and muft then rife with as little difference of time as in harveft ? The anfwer is plain: for in winter thefe figns rife at noon ; and being then only a quarter of a circle diftant from the fun, the moon in them is in her firft quarter: But when the. furi is above the horizon, the moon’s rifing is neither regarded, nor perceived. In fpring thefe fi^ns rift, with the fun, becaufe he is then in them ; and as the moon changeth in them at that time of the year, (he is quite invifible. In furomef they rife a- b'out midnight,' and the furi being then three figns, or a quarter of a circle before them, the moon is in them a- bout her thir.d quarter.; - when riling fo late, aod givipg but very little light, her rifing paifes unobferved. And in autumn, thefe. figns, being oppofite to the fon, rife when he fets, with the moori in oppofition, or at the full, which makes her rifing very conlpicuous. At the equator, the north and fouth poles lie ip the, horizon; and therefore the ecliptic makes the lame an¬ gle fouthward with the horizon when Arjes rifes, as it does northward when Libra rifes. Confequently, as the moon at all the fore-mentioned patches rifes and fets nearly at equal angles with the horizon all the year round, and about 48 minutes later every'day’or night than on the preceding, there caD be no particular har- veft-moort at the equator. The farther that any place is from the equator, if it be riot beyond the polar circle, the angle gradually dimi- nfthes which the ecliptic and horizon make when Pifces and Aries rife: And therefore, when the moon is in thefe figns (he rifes with a nearly proportionable difference later every day than on the former; and is for that rea¬ fon the more remarkable about the full, until we come to the polar circles, or 66 degrees from the equator ; in which latitude the ecliptic and horizon become coincident eVery day for a moment, at the fame fydereal hour, (or 3 minutes 56 feconds fooner every day than the former), and the very next moment one half of the ecliptic, con¬ taining Capricorn, Aquarius, Pifces, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini rifes, and the oppofite half fets. There¬ fore, whilft the moon is going from the beginning of Ca¬ pricorn to the beginning of Cancer, which is almoft 14 days, (he rifes at the fame fydereal hour; and in autumn, juft at fun-fet, becaufe all that half of the ecliptic, in which the fun is at that time, fets at the fame fy- dereal hour, and the oppofite half rifes; that is,. 3 mi¬ nutes 56 feconds, of mean folar time, fooner every day than on the day before. So, whilft the moon is going from Capricorn to Cancer, (he rifes earlier every day than on the preceding, contrary to what lhe does at alt places"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"ASTRONOM Y. places between the polar circles. But, during the above fourteen days, the moon is 24 fydereal hours later in fetting ; for the fix figns, which rife all at once on the eaftern fide of the horizon, are 24 hours in fetting on the weftern fide of it; as any one may fee by ma¬ king chalk-marks at the beginning of Capricorn and of Cancer, and then, having elevated the pole 664- degrees, turn the globe flowly round its axis, and obferve the ri- fing and fetting of the ecliptic. As the beginning of Aries is equally diftant from the beginning of Cancer and of Capricorn, it is in the middle of that half of the the ecliptic which rifes all at once. And when the fun is at the beginning of Libra, he is in the middle of the o- ther half. Therefore, when the fun is in Libra, and the moon in Capricorn, the moon is a quarter of a cir¬ cle before the fun; oppofite to him, and confequently full in Aries, and a quarter of a circle behind him, when in Cancer. But when Libra rifes, Aries fets, and all: that half of the ecliptic of which Aries is- the middle ; and therefore, at that time of the year, the moon rifes at fun-fet from her firft to her third quarter. In northern latitudes, the autumnal full moons are in Pifces and Aries, and the vernal full moons in Virgo and Libra: In fouthern latitudes juft the reverfe, becaufe the feafons are contrary. But Virgo and Libra rife at as fmall angles with the horizon in fouthern latitudes, as Pifces and Aries do in the northern; and therefore the harveft-moons are juft as regular on one fide of the equar tor as on the other. As thefe figns, which rife with the leaft angles, fet with the greateft, the vernal full moons differ as much in their times of rifing every night, as the autumnal full moons differ in their times of fetting; and fet with as little difference as the autumnal full moons-rife; the one being in all cafes the reverfe of the other. Hitherto, for the fake of plainnefs, we have foppofed the moon to move in the ecliptic, from which the fun never deviates. But the orbit in which the moon really moves is different from the ecliptic; one half being ele¬ vated 5-3- degrees above it, and the other half as much depreffed below it. The moon's orbit therefore inter- feAs the ecliptic in two points diametrically oppofite to each other ; and thefe interfeclions are called the moons nodes,' So the moon can never be in the ecliptic but when (he is in either of her nodes* which is at leaft twice in every courfe from change to change, and fome- times thrice. For, as the moon goes almoft a whole lign more than round her orbit from change to change, if file paffes by either node about the time of change, fire will pafs by the other in about fourteen days after, and come round to the former node two days again before the next change.. That node, from which the moon be¬ gins to afcend northward, or above the ecliptic, in nor¬ thern latitudes, is called the amending* node ; and the o- ther, the dejsending node ; becaufe the moon, when (he pafles by it, defcends below the ecliptic fouthward. The moon’s oblique motion, with regard to the eclip¬ 4 n tic, caufes fome difference in tlje times of her rifing and fetting from what is already mentioned. For whilft Ihe is northward of the ecliptic, Ihe rifes fooner and fets later than if Ihe moved in the ecliptic; and when Ihe is fouthward,of the ecliptic, Ilie rifes later, and fets fooner. This difference is variable, even in the fame figns, be- caufe the nodes Ihift backward about 19^- degrees in the ecliptic every year; and fo go round it contrary to the order of figns in 18 years 225 days. When the afcending node is in Aries, the fouthern half of the moon’s orbit makes an angle of degrees lefs with the horizon than the ecliptic does, when A- ries rifes in northern latitudes: For which reafon the moon rifes with lefs difference of time whilft Ihe is in Pifces and Aries, than there would be if Ihe kept in the ecliptic. But in 9 years and 112 days afterward, the defeending node comes to Aries; and then the moon’s orbit makes an angle 5-j- degrees greater with the hori¬ zon when Aries riles, that the ecliptic does at that time;: which caufes the moon to rife with greater difference of time in Pifces and Aries than if Ihe moved in the e- cliptic. To be a little more particular ; when the afcending node is in Aries, the angle is only 9^- degrees on the parallel Of London when Aries rifes. But when the defeending node comes to Aries, the angle is 20-}- degrees ; this oc- Caftons as great - a difference of the moon’s rifing in the fame figns every 9 years, as there would be on two pa¬ rallels to jOj degrees from one another, if the moon’s courfe were in the ecliptic. As there is a complete revolution of the nodes in i8y years, there muft-he a regular period of all the varieties which can happen in the rifing and fetting of the moon during that time. But this fluffing of the nodes never affefts the moon’s rifing fo much, even in her quickeft defeending latitude, as not to allow us ftill the benefit of her rifing nearer the time of fun-fet for a few days toge¬ ther about the full in harveft, than when Ihe is full at a- ny other time of the year. The following table Ihews in what years the harveft-moons are leaft beneficial as to the times of their rifing, and in what years moft, from 1751 to 1861. The column* of years under the letter L are thofe in which the harveft-moons are leaft of alt beneficial, becaufe they fall about the defeending node; and thofe under M are the moft of all beneficial, becaufe they fall about the afcending node. In all the columns from N to S, the harveft-moons defeend gradually in the lunar orbit, and rife to lefs heights above the hori¬ zon. From S to N they afcend in the fame proportion,. and rife to greater heights above the horizon. In both the columns under S, the harveft-moons are in the lowcft part of the moon’s orbit, that is, fartheft fouth of the- ecliptic; and therefore ftay fitorteft of all above the ho¬ rizon; in the columns under N, juft the reverfe. And, in both cafes, their rifing, though not at the fame times, are nearly the fame with regard to difference of time, as if the moon’s.orbit were coincident with the ecliptic.

For the fame reafon, the full moon neither rifes in fummer, nor fets in winter, confidering her as moving in the ec¬ liptic. For the winter full moon being as high in the ecliptic as the fummer fun, mull therefore continue as long above the horizon; and the fummer full moon being as low in the ecliptic as the winter fun, can no more rife than he does. But thefe are only the two full moons which happen about the tropics, for all the others rife and fet. In fummer, the full moons are low, and their flay is Ihort above the horizon,' when the nights are Ihort, and we have leaft occafion for moon-light: In.winter, they go high, and (lay long above the horizon, when the nights are long, and we want the greateft quantity of moon-light. At the poles, one half of the ecliptic never fets, and the other half never rifes; and therefore, as the fun is always half a year in defcribing one half of the ecliptic, and as long in going through the other half, it is natural to imagine that the fun continues half a year together a- bove the horizon of each pole in its turn, and as long below it, rifing to one pole when he fets to the other. This would be exactly the cafe if there were no refrac¬ tion ; but by the atmofphere’s refracting the fun’s rays, he becomes vifible fome days fooner, and continues fome days longer in fight than he would otherwife do: fo that he appears above the horizon of either pole before he has got below the horizon of the other. And as he ne¬ ver goes more than* 23^ degrees below the horizon of the poles, they have very little dark night; it being twi¬ light there as well as at all other places till the fun be 18 degrees below the horizon. The full moon being al¬ ways oppofite to the fun, can never be feen while the fun is above the horizon, except when the moon falls in the northern half of her orbit; for whenever any point of the ecliptic rifes, the oppofite point fets. Therefore, as the fun is above the horizon of the north pole from the 20th of March till the 23d of September, it is plain, that the moon, when full, being oppofite to the fun, mull be below the horizon during that half of the year. But when the fun is in the fouthern half of the ecliptic, he never rifes to the north pole, during which half of the year, every full moon happens in fome part of the north¬ ern half of the ecliptic, which never fets. Confequent- ly, as the polar inhabitants never fee the full moon in fummer, they have her always in the winter, before, at, and after the full, Ihining for 14 of our days and nights. And when the fun is at his greateft depreflion below the horizon, being then in Capricorn, the moon is at her firft quarter in Aries,- full in Cancer, and at her third quarter in Libra. And as the beginning of Aries is the rifing point of the ecliptic, Cancer the higheft, and Li¬ bra the fetting point, the moon rifes at her firft quarter in Aries, is moft elevated above the hqrizon, and full in Cancer, and fets at the beginning of Libra in her third quarter, having continued vifible for 14 diurnal rotations of the earth. Thus the poles are fupplied one half of the winter time with conftant moon-light in the fun’s ablence; and only lofe fight of the moon from her third to her firft quarter, while Ihe gives but very little light, and could be but of little, and fometimes of no fervice to them. A bare view of the figure (Plate XLIV. fig. 3.) will make this plain; in which let S be the fun, e the earth in fummer when its north pole n inclines to¬ ward the fun, and E the earth in winter, when its north -north pole declines from him.

But then lhe is full in view to the fouth pole p, which is as much turned from the fun as the north pole inclines towards him.

Ch:af. XV. Of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea. The caufe of the tides was difcovered by Kepler, who, in his Introduflion to the Phfjics of the Heavens , thus explains it: “ The orb of the attrafting power, “ which is in the moon, is extended as far as the earth, “ and draws the waters under the torrid zone, afting “ upon places where it is vertical, infenfibly oh confined “ feas and bays, but fenfibly on the ocean, whofe beds “ are large, and the waters have the liberty of recipro- “ cation; that is, of rifing and falling.” And in the 70th page of his Lunar Aflronomy : —“ But the caufe “ of the tides of the fea appears to be the bodies of the “ fun and moon drawing the waters of the fea.” This hint -being given, Sir Ifaac Newton improved it, and wrote fo amply on the fubjedl, as to make the theory of the tides in a manner quite his own; by difcovering the caufe of their rifing on the fide of the earth oppofite to the moon. For Kepler believed, that the prefence of the moon occafioned an impulle which caufed another in her abfence. The power of gravity diminifltes as the fquare of the diftance increafes; and therefore the waters (Plate XLIV. fig. 4.) at Z on the fide of the earth ABCDEFGH next the moon M are more at traded than the central parts of the earth 0 by the moon, and the central parts are more attraded by her than the waters on the oppo¬ fite fide of the earth at n ; and therefore the diftance be¬ tween the earth’s centre and tne waters on its furface under and oppofite to the moon will be increafed. For, let there be three bodies at H, 0 , and D, if they are all equally attraded by the body M, they will all move equally faft toward it, their mutual diftances from each other continuing the fame. If the attradion of M is unequal, then that body which is molt ftrongly attraded will move fafteft, and this will increafe its diftance from the other body. Therefore, by the law of gravitation, M will attrad H more ftrongly than it does 0 , hy which the diftance between H and 0 will be increafed, and/a Vol. I. Numb, 20. 3 N O M Y. 473 fpedator on 0 will perceive H rifing higher toward Z. In like manner, 0 being more ftrongly attraded than D, it will move farther towards M than D does ; confe- quently the diftance between 0 and D will be increafed, and a fpedator on 0 , not perceiving his own motion, will fee D receding farther from him towards n ; all ef- feds and appearances being the fame, whether D recedes from 0 , or 0 from D. Suppofe now there is a number of bodies, as ABCDEEGH, placed round 0 , fo as to form a flexible or fluid ring •, then, as the whole is attraded towards M, the parts at H and D will have their diftance from 0 increafed; whilft the parts at B and F, being 'nearly at the fame diftance from -M as 0 is, thefe parts will not recede from one another, but rather, by the ob¬ lique attradion of M, they will approach nearer to 0 . Hence the fluid ring will form itfelf into an ellipfe ZIBLnKFNZ, whofe longer axis n OZ produced will pafs through M, and its Ihorter axis BOF will terminate in B and F. Let the ring be filled with bodies, fo as to form a fluid fphere round G ; then, as the whole moves toward M, the fluid fphere being lengthened at Z and n, will aflume an oblong or oval form. If M is the moon, 0 the earth’s centre, ABCDEFGH the fea co¬ vering the earth’s furface, it is evident, by the above reafoning, that whilft the earth by its gravity falls .to¬ ward the moon, the water diredly below her at B will fwell and rife gradually towards her; alfo the water at D will recede from the centre, (ftridly fpeaking the cen¬ tre recedes from D), and rife on the oppofite fide. o f the earth, whilft the water at B and F is depreffed, and falls below the former level. . Hence,, as the earth turns round its axis from the moon to the moon again in 24^ hours, there will be two tides of flood and two of ebb in that time, as we find by experience. As this explanation ©f the ebbing and flowing of the fea is deduced from the earth’s conftantly falling toward the moon by the power of gravity, fome may find a dif¬ ficulty in conceiving how this is polfible, when the moon is full, or in oppofition to the fun, fince the earth re¬ volves about the fun, and muft continually fall towards it, and therefore cannot fall contrary ways at the fame time; or if the earth is conftantly falling towards the moon, they muft come together at laft. To remove this difficulty, let it be confidered, that it is not the centre of the earth that defcribes the annual orbit round the fun, but the common eentre of gravity of the earth and moon together; and that whilft the earth is moving round the fun* it alfo defcribes a circle round that centre of gravity, going as many times round it in one revolu¬ tion about the fun as there are lunations or courfes of the moon round the earth in a year; and therefore the earth is conftantly falling towards the moon from a tan¬ gent to the circle it defcribes round the faid common centre of gravity. In Plate XLV, fig. 1, let M be the moon, 7 W.part of the tnoon’s orbit, and C the centre of gravity of the earth and moon ; whilft the moon goes round her orbit, the centre of the earth defcribes the circle ged round C, to which circle gak is -a tangent ; and therefore when the moon has gone from M to a lit¬ tle paft IV, the earth has moved from g to a j and in that 6 D time"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"474 ASTRO time has fallen towards the moon, from the tangent at a to e , and fo round the whole circle. The fun’s influence in railing the tides is but fmall in comparifon of the moon’s: For though the earth’s dia¬ meter bears a confiderable proportion to its diftance from the moon, it is next to nothing when compared with the diftance of the fun. And therefore, the difference of the fun’s attraction on the fides of the earth under and oppofite to him, is much lefs than the difference of the moon’s attraction on the fides of the earth under and oppofite to her; and therefore the moon muft raife the tides much higher than they can be raifed by the fun. On this theory, fo far as we have explained it, the tides ought to be higheft direCtly under and oppofite to the moon; that is, when the moon is due north and fouth. But we find, that in open Teas, where the water flows free¬ ly, the moon M (Plate XJLIV. fig. 4.) is generally part the north and fouth meridian, as at />, when it is high water at Z and at n. The reafon isiobvious; for though the moon’s attraction wias to ceafe altogether when (he was palt the meridian, yet the motion of afcent communi¬ cated to the water before that time would make it con¬ tinue to rife for fome time after; much more mud it do fo when the attraction is only diminifhed: as a little <m- pulfe given to a moving ball will caufe it ftill tp move farther than otherwife it could have done. And as ex¬ perience fhews, that the day is hotter about three in the afternoon, than when the fun is on the meridian, becaufe of the increment made to the heat already imparted. The tides anfwer not always to the fame diftance of the moon from the meridian at the fame places, but are varioufly affeCted by the aftion of the fun, which brings them on fooner when the moon is in her firft and third quarters, and keeps them back later when fhe is in her fecond and fourth; becaufe in the former cafe the tide railed by the fun alone would be earlier than the tide raifed by the moon, and in the latter cafe later. The moon goes round the earth in an elliptic orbit, and therefore fhe approaches nearer to the earth than her mean diftance, and recedes farther from it, in every lu¬ nar month. When fhe is neareft, fhe attracts ftrongeft, and fo raifes the tides molt; the contrary happens when the is fartheft, becaufe of her weaker attraction. When both luminaries are in the equator, and the moon in Pe- ligeo, or at her leafl diftance from the earth, fhe raifes the tides higheft of all, efpecially at her conjunction and oppofition ; both becaufe the equatoreal parts have the greateft centrifugal force from their defcribing the largeft circle, and from the concurring actions of the fun and moon. At the change, the attractive forces of the fun and moon being united, they diminifh the gravity of the waters under the moon, and their gravity on the op¬ pofite fide is diminifhed by means of a greater centrifugal force. At the full, whilft the moon raifes the tide un¬ der and opppfite to her, the fun aCting in the fame line, raifes the tide under and oppofite to him; whence their conjoint effect is the fame as at the change; and in both cafes, occafion what we call the fpring-tides. But at the quarters, the fun’s aCtion on the waters at 0 and H (Plate XLV. fig. 2.) diminifhes the efFeCt of the moon’s aCtion on the waters at Z and N\\ fo that they rife a N O M Y. little under and oppofite to the fun at 0 and //, and fall as much under and oppofite to the moon at Z and N, making what we call the neap-tides , becaufe the fun and moon then aCt crofs-wife to each other. But, ftriCtly fpeakipg, thefe tides happen not till fome time after; be¬ caufe in this, as in other cafes, the actions do not pro¬ duce the greateft efFeCt when they are at the ftrongeft, but fome time afterward. The fun being nearer the earth in winter than in fum- mer, is of courfe nearer to it in February and October than in March and September; and therefore the greateft tides happen not till fome time after the autumnal equi¬ nox, and return a little before the vernal. The lea being thus put in motion, would continue to ebb and flow for feveral times, even though the fun and moon wpre annihilated, or their influence ftjould ceafe: as if a bafon of water were agitated, the water would continue to move for fome time after the bafon was left to ftand Hill. Or like a pendulum, which having been put in motion by the hand, continues to make feveral vi¬ brations without any new impulfe. When the moon is in the equator, die tides are e- qually high in both parts of the lunar day, or time of the moon’s revolving from the meridian to the meridian a- gain, which is 24 hours 48 minutes. But as the moon declines from the equator towards either pole, the tides are alternately higher and lower at places having north or fouth latitude. For one of the higheft elevations, which is that under the moon, follows her towards the pole to which (he is neareft, and the other declines towards the oppofite pole ; each elevation defcribing parallels as far diftant from the equator, on oppofite fides, as the moon declines from it to eidier fide ; and confequently, the 'parallels defcribed by thefe elevations of the water are twice as many degrees from one another, as the moon is from the equator ; incieafing their diftance as the moon increafes her declination, till it be at the greateft, when the faid parallels are, at a mean ftate, 47 degrees from one another : and on that day, the tides are moft unequal in their heights. As the moon returns toward the equator, the parallels defcribed by the oppofite ele¬ vations approach towards each cither, until the moon comes to the equator, and then they coincide. As the moon declines toward the oppofite pole, at equal di- ftances, .each elevation defcribes the fame parallel in the other part of the lunar day, which its oppofite elevation defcribed before. Whilft the moon has north declina¬ tion, the greateft tides in the northern hemifphere are when (he is above the horizon ; and the reverfe whilft her declination is fouth.

All places in the northern hemifphere have the higheft tides when they come into the pofition bSE> under the moon; and the lowed tides when the earth’s diurnal rotation carries them into the pofition aTE , on the fide oppofite to the moon ; the reverfe happens at the fame time in the fouthern hemifphere ES^_, as is evident to fight. The axis of the tides aCd has now its poles a and d (be¬ ing always 90 degrees from the higheft elevations) in the ardtic and antardlic circles ; and therefore it is plain, that at thefe circles there is but one tide of flood, and one of ebb, in the lunar day. For, when the point a revolves half round to b, in 12 lunar hours, it has a tide of flood ; but when it comes to the fame point a again in 12 hours more, it has the loweft ebb. In feven days afterward, the moon M comes to the equinodtial circle, and is over the equator EQ, 'when both elevations de- fcribe the equator ; and in both hemifpheres, at equal diftances from the equator, the tides are equally high in both parts of the lunar day. The whole phenomena be¬ ing reverfed, when the moon has fouth declination, to what they were when her declination was north, require no farther defcription. In Plate XLV. fig. 3, 4. 5. the earth is ortho- graphically projected on the plane of the meridian ; but in order to defcribe a particular phenomenon, we now projedt it on the plane of the ecliptic. In the fame Plate fig. 2. let HZONbe. the earth and fea, FED the equa¬ tor, T the tropic of Cancer, C the ardtic circle, P the north pole, and the curves 12 24 meridians, or hour-circles, interfering each other in the poles; AGM is the moon’s orbit, S the Sun, M the moon, Z the water elevated under the moon, and . J V the oppofite e- qual elevation. As the loweft parts of the water are al¬ ways 90 degrees from the higheft, when the moon is in either of the tropics, (as at M), the elevation Z is on the tropic of Capricorn, and the oppofite elevation N on the tropic of Cancer, the low-water circle HCO touches the polar circles at C a nd the high-water circle ETP 6 goes over the poles at P, and divides every parallel of latitude into two equal fegments. In this cafe the tides upqn every parallel are alternately higher and lower ; but they return in equal times : The point T, for example, on die tropic of Cancer, (where the depth of the tide is- reprefented by the breadth of the dark Ihade), has a fliallower tide of flood at T than when it revolves half round from thence to, (t, according to the order of the numeral figures ; but it revolves as foon from 6 to T as it did from T to 6. When the moon is in the equi¬ noctial, the elevations Z and N are transferred to the equator at 0 and H, and the high and low-water circles are got into each other’s former places ; in which cafe the tides return in unequal times, but are equally high in both parts of the lunar day : for a place at 1 (under D) revolving as formerly, goes fooner from 1 to 11 , (un- der F), than from 11 to 1, becaufe the parallel it de- fcribes is cut into unequal fegments by the high-water circle HCO : but the points 1 and 11 being equidiftant from the pole of the tides at C, which is direCtly under the pole of the moon’s orbit MG^A, the elevations are e- qually high in both parts of the day. N O M V*. 475 And thus it appears, that as the tides are governeft by the moon, they muft turn on the axis of the moon’s orbit, which is inclined 234 degrees to the earth’s axis at a mean ftate : and therefore the poles of the tides muft be fo many degrees from the poles of the earth, or in oppofite points of the polar circles, going round thefe circles in every lunar day. It is true, that, according to Plate XLV. fig. 4. when the moon is vertical to the equator EC t he poles of the tides feem to fall in with the poles of the world N and S : but when we confider that FHG is under the moon’s orbit, it will appear, that when the moon is over H, in the tropic of Capricorn, the north pole of the tides (which can be no more than 90 degrees from under the moon) muft be at c in the arCtic circle, not at N, the north pole of the earth ; and as the moon afcends from H to G in her orbit, the north pole of the tides muft ftiift from c to a in the arCtic circle, and the fouth pole as much in the antarCtic. It is not to be doubted, but that the earth’s quick rotation brings the poles of the tides nearer to the poles of the world, than they would be if the earth were at reft, and the moon revolved about it only once a month for otherwife the tides would be more unequal in their heights, and times of their returns, than we find they are. But how near the earth’s rotation may bring the poles of its axis and thofe of the tides together, or how far the preceding tides may affeCt thofe which follow, fo as to make them keep up nearly to the fame heights, and times of ebbing and flowing, is a problem more fit to be folved by obfervation than by theoiy. Thofe who have opportunity to make obfervations,- and chufe to fatisfy themfelves whether the tides are really affeCled in the above manner by the different pofi- tions of the moon, efpecially as to the unequal times of their returns, may take this general rule for knowing when they ought to be fo affected. When the earth’s axis inclines to the moon, the northern tides, if not re¬ tarded in their paffage through fhoals and channels, nor af¬ fected by the winds, ought to be greateft when the moon is above the horizon, lea/t when flie is below it, and quite the reverfe when the earth’s axis declines from her ; but, in both cafes, at equal intervals of time.. When the earth’s axis inclines fidewife to the moon, both tides are equally high, but they happen at unequal intervals of time. In- every lunation the earth’s axis inclines once to the moon, once from her; and twice fidewife to her, as it does to - the fun every year ; . becaufe the moon goes round the ecliptic every month, and the fun bnt once in a year. In fummer, the earth’s axis inclines towards the moon when, new ; and therefore the day-tides in the north- ought to be higheft, and night-tides loweft about the change ; at the full the reverfe. At the quarters they ought to be equally high, but unequal in their returns ; becaufe the earth’s axis then inclines fidewife to the moon. In winter the phenomena are the fame at full- moon as in fummer at new. In autumn the earth’s axis inclines fidewife to the moon -when new and full; there¬ fore the tides ought to be equally high-,, and unequal in their returns at thefe times. At the firlt quarter the tides of flood (hould be leaft when the moon is above the horizon, greateft when Ihe is below it ; and the reverfe"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"47 6 ASTRO at her third quarter. In fpring, the phenomema of the firft quarter anfwer to thofe of the third quarter in au¬ tumn ; and vice verfa. The nearer any time is to ei¬ ther of thefe feafons, the more the tides partake of the phenomena of thefe feafons ; anu in the middle between any two of them the tides are at a mean (fate between thofe of both. In open Teas, the tides rife but to very fmall heights in proportion to what they do in wide-mouthed rivers, opening in the direction of the ftream of tide/ For, in channels growing narrower gradually, the water is accu¬ mulated by the oppofition of the contracting bank ; like a gentle wind, little felt on an open plain, but ftrong and brifk in a ftreet; efpecially if the wider end of the ftreet be next the plain, and in the way of the wind. The tides are fo retarded in their paffage through dif¬ ferent fhoals and channels, and otherwile fo varioufly af¬ fected by ftriking againft capes and headlands, that to different places they happen at all diftances of the moon from the meridian ; confequently at all hours of the lu¬ nar day. The tide propagated by the moon in the Ger¬ man ocean, when fhe is three hours part the meridian, takes 12 hours to come from thence to London-Jlridge; where it arrives by the time that a new tide is raifed in the ocean. And therefore when the moon has north de¬ clination, and we fhould expeCt the tide at London to be greateft when the moon is above the horizon, we find it is leaft; and the contrary when fhe has fouth decli¬ nation. At feveral places it is high water three hours before the moon comes to the meridian ; but that tide which the moon pufhes as it were before her, is only the tide oppofite to that which was raifed by her when fhe was nine hours part the oppofite meridian. There are no tides in lakes, becaufe they are generally fo fmall, that when the moon is vertical fhe attrads e- every part of them alike, and therefore, by rendering all the water equally light, no part of it can be raifed higher than another. The Mediterranean and Baltic feas fuffer very fmall elevations, becaufe the inlets by which they communicate with the ocean are fo narrow, that they cannot, in fo fhort a time, receive or difcharge enough to raife or fink their furfaces fenfibly. Air being lighter than water, and the furface of the atmofphere being nearer to the moon than the furface of the fea, it cannot be doubted that the moon raifes much higher tides in the air than in the fea. And there¬ fore many, have wondered why the mercury does not fink in the barometer when the moon’s adlion on the particles of air makes them lighter as fhe partes over the meridian. But we muft confider, that as thefe particles are ren¬ dered lighter, a greater number of them is accumulated, until the deficiency of gravity be made up by the height of the column ; and then there is an equilibrium, and confequently an equal prerture upon the mercury as be¬ fore ; fo that it cannot be affedted by the aerial tides. Chap. XVI. Of Eclipfes : Their Number and Periods. A large Catalogue of ancient and modern Eclipfes. Every planet and fatellite is illuminated by the fun j N O M Y. and carts a fhadow towards that point of the heavtns which is oppofite to the fun. This fhadow is nothing but a privation of light in the fpace hid from the fun by the opaque body that intercepts his rays. When the fun’s light is fo intercepted by the moon, that to any place of the earth the fun appears partly or wholly covered, he is faid to undergo an eclipfe ; though, properly fpeaking, it is only an eclipfe of that part of the earth where the moon’s fhadow or penumbra falls. When the earth comes between the fun and moon, the moon falls into the earth’s fhadow; and, having no light of her own, fhe fuffers a real eclipfe from the in¬ terception of the fun’s rays. When the fun is eclipfed to us, the moon’s inhabitants, On the fide next the earth, fee her fhadow like a dark fpot travelling over the earth, about twice as fart as its equatoreal parts move, and the fame way as they move. When the moon is in an e clipfe, the fun appears eclipfed to her, total to all thofe parts on which the earth’s fhadow falls, and of as long continuance as they are in the fhadow. That the earth is fpherical (for the hills take off no more from the roundnefs of the earth, than grains of duft do from the roundnefs of a common globe) is evi¬ dent from the figure of its fhadow on the moon; which is always bounded by a circular line, although the earth is incertantly turning its different fides to the moon, and very feldom fhews the fame fide to her in different eclip¬ fes, becaufe they feldom happen at the fame hours. Were the earth fhaped like a round flat plate, its fhadow would only be circular when either of its fides diredtly faced the moon; and more or lefs elliptical as the earth happened to be turned more or lefs obliquely towards the moon when fhe is eclipfed. The moon’s different phafes prove her to be round; for, as fhe keeps ftill the fame fide towards the earth, if that fide were flat, as it appears to be, fhe would never be vifible from the third quarter to the firft; and from the firft quarter to the third, fhe would appear as round as when we fay Jhe is full ; be¬ caufe, at the end of her firft quarter, the fun’s light would come as fuddenly on all her fide next the earth, as it does on a flat wall, and go off as abruptly at the end of her third quarter. If the earth and fun were equally large, the earth’s fhadow would be infinitely extended* and all of the fame bulk ; and the planet Mars, in either of its nodes and oppofite to the fun, wou)d be eclipfed in the earth’s fhadow. Were the earth larger than the fun, its fhadow would in- creafe in bulk the farther it extended, and would eclipfe the great planets Jupiter and Saturn, with all their moons, when they were oppofite to the fun. But as Mars, in oppofition, never falls into the earth’s fhadow, although he is not thin above 42 millions of miles front the earth, it is plain that the earth is much lefs than the fun ; for otherwife its fhadow could not end in a-point at fo fmall a diftance. If the fun and moon were equally large, the moon’s fhadow would go on to the earth with an equal breadth, and cover a portion of the earth’s furface more than 2000 miles broad, even if it fell diredtly againft the earth’s centre, as feen from the moon ; and much more if it fell obliquely on the earth : But the moon’s fhadow is feldom 150 miles broad at the earth, unlefs when it falls • very"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"riafe.XLY; fe—4 q! FIX"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"ASTRONOMY. very obliquely on the earth, in total eclipfes of the fun. In annular eclipfes, the moon’s real Ihadow ends in a point at fome .diltance from the earth. The moon's fmall diflance from the earth, and the Ihortnefs of hfr Ihadow, prove her to be lefs than the fun. And, as the earth’s fhadow is large enough to cover the moon, if her diameter were three times as large as it is (which is evi¬ dent from her long continuance in the Ihadow when Ihe goes through its centre) it is plain, that the earth is much bigger than the moon. Though all opaque bodies, on which the fun ihines, have their fhadows, yet fuch is the bulk of the fun, and- the diftances of the’ planets, that the primary planets can never eclipfe one another. A primary can eclipfe only its fecondary, or be eclipfed by it; and never but when in oppofition or conjundtion with the fun. The primary planets are very feldom in thefe pofitions, but the fun and moon are fo every month : Whence one may imagine, that thefe two luminaries fhould be eclipfed e- very month. But there are few eclipfes in refpedt of the number of new and full moons; the reafon of which we fhall now explain. If the moon’s orbit were coincident with the plane of the ecliptic, in which the earth always moves and the fun appears to move, the moon’s Ihadow would fall upon the earth at every change, and eclipfe the fun to fome parts of the earth. In like .manner, the moon would go through the middle of the earth’s Ihadow, and be eclipfed at eve¬ ry full ; but with this difference, thatfhe would be totally darkened for above an hour and an half; whereas the fun never was above four minutes totally eclipfed by the in- terpofition of the moon. But one half of the moon’s orbit is elevated 5-J. degrees above the ecliptic, and the other half as much depreffed below it; xonfequently, the moon’s orbit interfedls the ecliptic in two oppofite points called the moon's nodes, as has been already taken notice of. When thefe points are in a right line with the cen¬ tre of the fun at new or full moon, the fun, moon, and earth, are all in a right line; and if the moon be then new, her fhadow falls upon the earth ; if full, the earth’s Ihadow falls upon her. When the fun and moon are more than 17 degrees from either of the nodes at the time of conjundtion, the moon is then generally too high or too low in her orbit to call any part of her ihadow upon the earth ; $hen the fun is more than 12 deg. from either of the nodes at the time of full moon, the moon is generally too high or too low in her orbit to go thro’ any part of the earth’s ihadow: And in both thefe cafes there will be no eclipfe. But when the moon is lefs than 17 de¬ grees from either node at the time of conjundtion, her iha¬ dow or penumbra falls more or lefs upon the earth, as ihe is more or lefs within this limit. And when ihe is lefs than 12 degrees from either node at the time of oppofition, ihe goes through a greater or lefs portion of the earth’s iha¬ dow, as flie is more or lefs within this limit. Her orbit contains 360 degrees; of which 17, the limit of folar e- clipfes on either fide of the nodes, and 12, the limit of lunar eclipfes, are but fmall portions : And as the fun commonly paifes by the nodes but twice in a year, it is no wonder that we have fo many new and full moons without eclipfes. To illuitrate this, (Plate XLVI. fig. 1.) let ABCD Vol. I. No. 20. 3 477 be the ecliptic, RSTU a circle lying in the fame plane with the ecliptic, and VIVXY t he moon’s orbit, all thrown into an oblique view, which gives them an elliptical Ihape * to the eye. One half of the moon’s orbit, as VfVX, is always below the ecliptic, and the other half XYV above it. The points V and X, where the moon’s orbit inter- fedts the circle RSTU, which lies even with the ecliptic, are the moon’s nodes ; and a right line, as XEV, drawg from one to the other, through the earth’s centre, is the line of the nodes, which is carried almofl parallel to it- felf round the fun in a year. If the moon moved round the earth in the orbit RSTU, which is coincident with the plane of the eclip¬ tic, her Ihadow would fall upon the earth every time Ihe is in conjundtion with the fun, and at every oppofition Ihe would go through the earth’s Ihadow. Were this the cafe, the fun would be eclipfed at every change, and the moon at every full, as already mentioned. But although the moon’s Ihadow N mult fall upon the earth at a, when the earth is at A, and the moon in con¬ jundtion with the fun at /, becaufe Ihe is then very near one of her nodes ; and at her oppofition « Ihe muft go through the earth’s fhadow /, becaufe fhe is then near the other node ; yet, in the time that fhe goes round the earth to her next change, according to the order of the letters XTVIV, the earth advances from F. to e, accord¬ ing to the order of the letters EFGH, and the line of the nodes VEX being carried nearly parallel to itfelf, brings the point f of the moon’s orbit in conjundtion with the fun at that next change; and then the moon being at/, is too high above the ecliptic to cart her fha¬ dow on the earth : And as the earth is ftill moving for¬ ward, the moon at her next oppofition will be at g, too far below the ecliptic to go through any part of the earth’s fhadow; for by that time the point g will be at a confiderable diflance from the earth as feen from the fun. When the earth comes to F, the moon in conjundlion with the fun Z is not at k in a plane coincident with the ecliptic,, but above it at Y in the highefl part of her orbit: and then the point b of her fhadow 0 goes far a- bove the earth (as in fig. 2. which is an edge view of fig. 1.) The moon, at her next oppofition, is not at o (fig. 1.) but at IV, where the earth’s fhadow goes far a- bove her (as in fig. 2.) In both thefe cafes the line of the nodes VFX (fig. 1.) is about 90 degrees from the fun, and both luminaries are as far as pofiible from the limits of the eclipfes. When the earth has gone half round the ecliptic from E to Gy the line of the nodes VGX is nearly, if not ex¬ actly, directed towards the fun at Z; and then the new- moon l carts her fhadow P on the earth G ; and the full moon p goes through the earth’s fhadow L ; which brings on eclipfes again, as when the earth was at E. When the earth comes to H, the new moon falls not at in in a plane coincident with the ecliptic CD, but at W in her orbit below it; and then her fhadow ^ (fee fig- 2.) goes far below the earth. At the next full fhe is not at q (fig. 1.) but at Y in her orbit 5-f degrees a- bove q, and athergreatefl height above the ecliptic CD; being then as far as pofiible, at any oppofition, from the earth’s fhadow M, as in fig. 2. So, when the earth is at E and G, the moon is about 6 E her"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"478 ASTRO her nodes at new and full ; and in her greateft north and fouth declination (or latitude, as it is generally call¬ ed) from the ecliptic at her quarters ; But when the earth is at F or H, the moon is in her greateft north and fouth declination from the ecliptic at new and full, and in the nodes about her quarters. The point X where the moon’s orbit crofles the e- eliptic, is called the afcending node, becaufe the moon afcends from it above the ecliptic : And the oppofite point of interfe&ion V is called the defending node , be¬ caufe the moon defeends from it below the ecliptic. When the moon is at Tin the higheft point of her orbit, lhe is in her greateft north latitude ; and when (he is at W in the loweft point of her orbit, fhe is in her greateft fouth latitude. If the line of the nodes, like the earth’s axis, was car¬ ried parallel to itfelf round the fun, there would be juft half a year between the conjunctions of the fun and. nodes. But the nodes fliift backward, or contrary to the earth’s annual motion, 19-j-deg. every year ; and therefore the fame node comes round to the fun 19 days fooner e- very year than on the year before. Confequently, from the time that the afcending node X (when the earth is at E) piffles by the fun as feen from the earth, it is only 173 days (not half a year) till the defeending node V paffes by him. Therefore, in whatever time of the year we have eclipfes of the luminaries about either node, we may be fure that in 173 days afterward we fhall have e- clipfes about the other node. And when at any time of the year the line of the nodes is in the fituation VCX, at the fame time next year it will be in the fituation rGs\\ the afcending node having gone backward, that is, contrary to the order of figns, from X to /, and the de- • feending node from V to r \\ each 19^ deg. At this rate the nodes fhift through all the figns and degrees of the ecliptic in 18 years and 225 days ; in which time there would always be a regular period of eclipfes, if any complete number of lunations were finifhed without a fraction. But this never happens; for if both the fun and moon fhould ftart from a fine of conjunction with either of the nodes in any point of the ecliptic, the fun would perform 18 annual revolutions and 222 degrees over and above, and the moon 230 lunations and 85 degrees of the 231ft, by the time the node came round to the fame point of the ecliptic again: So that the fun would then be 138 degrees from the node, and the moon 85 degrees from the fun. But, in 223 mean lunations, after the fun, moon, and nodes, have been once in a line of conjunction, they re¬ turn fo nearly to the fame ftate again, as that the fame node, which was in'conjunction with the fun and moon at the beginning of the firft of thefe lunations, will be within 20 12\" of a degree of a line of conjunction with the fun and moon again, when the laft of thefe luna¬ tions is completed. And therefore, in that time there will be a regular period of eclipfes , or return of the fame eclipfe, for many ages.—In this period, (which was firft difeovered by the Chaldeans), there are 18 Julian years I I davs 7 hours 43 minutes 20 feconds, when the laft day of February in leap-years is four times included:. N Q M Y„ But when it is five times included, the period conftfts of only 18 years 10 days 7 hours 43 minutes 20 feconds. Confequently, if to the mean time of any eclipfe, either of the fun or moon, you add 18 Julian years 11 days 7 hours 43 minutes 20 feconds, when the laft day of Fe¬ bruary in leap-years comes in four times, or a day lefs when it comes in five times, you will have the mean time of the return of the fame eclipfe. But the falling back'of the line, or conjunctions, or oppofitions of the fun and moon 28 r 12” with refpeCt to the line of the nodes in every period, will wear it out in pvocefs of time ; and after that, it will not return a- gain in lefs than 12492 years. — Thefe eclipfes of the fun, which’ happen about the afcending node, and begin to come in at the north pole of the earth, will go a little foutherly at each return, till they go quite off the earth at the fouth pole ; and thofe which happen about the de¬ feending node, and begin to come in at the fouth pole of the earth, will go a little northerly at each return, till at laft they quite leave the earth at the north pole. To exemplify this matter, we fhall firft confider the fun’s eclipfe, (March 21ft old ftyle, April ift new ftyle), A. D. 1764, according to its mean revolutions, without equating the times, or the fun’s diftance from the node ; and then according to its true equated times. This eclipfe fell in open fpace at each return, quite clear of the earth, even fince the creation, till A. D- 1295:, June 13th old ftyle, at 12 h 52 m. 59 fee. pojl meridiem, when the moon’s fhadow firft touched the earth at the north pole; the fun being then 17 0 48' 27^ from the aicending node.—In each period fince that time, the fun has come 28* 12” nearer and nearer the fame node, and the moon’s fhadow has therefore gone more and more foutheily.*—In the year 1962, July 18th old ftyle, at jo h. 36 m. 21 fee. />. w. when the fame eclipfe will have returned 38 times, the fun will .be only 24' 45'* from the afcending node, and the centre of the moon’s fhadow will fafl a little northward of the earth’s centre. —At the end of the next following period, A D. 1980, July 28th old ftyle, at 18 h. 19 m. 41 fee. p m. the fun will have receded back 3\" 27” from t)ie afcending node, and the moon will have a very fmall degree of fouthern' latitude, which will caufe the centre of her fhadow to pafs a very fmall matter fouth of the earth’s centra — After which, in every following period, the fun will be 28' 12^ farther back from the afcending node than in the period laft before ; and the moon’s fhadow will go ftill farther and farther fouthward, until September 12th- old ftyle, at 2.3 h. 46 m. 22 fee. p. ?n. A. D. 2665 ; when the eclipfe will have compleated its 77th periodical return, and will go quite off the earth at the fouth pole (the fun being then 17 0 55' 2 2 \" back from the node) and cannot come in at the north pole, fo as to begin the fame courfe over again, in lefs than 12492 years after¬ ward.—And fuch will be the cafe ofVvery .other eclipfe! of the fun: For, as there is about 18 degrees on eauh fide of the node within which there is a poffibility of e- clipfes, their whole revolution goes through 36 degrees about jhat node, which, taken from 366 degrees, leaves remaining 324 degrees for the eclipfes to travel in ex~.-"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"AST R O panfutn. And as this 36 degrees is not gone through in lefs than 77 periods* which takes up 1388 years, the remaining 324 degrees cannot be fo gone through in lefs than 12492 years. For, as 36 is to 1388, fo is 324 to 12492. To illuftrate this a little farther, we (hall examine fome of the mod remarkable circumftances of the returns of the eclipfe which happened July 14th 1748, about noon. This eclipfe, after traverling the voids of fpace from the creation, at laft began to enter the Terra Au- flralis Incognita about 88 years after the conqueft, which was the laft of king Stephen’s reign ; every Chal¬ dean period it has crept more northerly, but was ftill in- vifible in Britain before the year 1622; when, on the 30th of April, it began to touch the fouth parts of Eng¬ land about 2 in the afte rnoon ; its central appearance ri¬ ling in the American fouth feas, and traverfing Peru and the Amazon’s Country, through the Atlantic ocean into Africa, and fetting in the ^Ethiopian continent, not far from the beginning of the Red fea. Its next vifible period was after three Chaldean revo¬ lutions in 1676, on the firft of June, riling central in the Atlantic ocean, palling us about 9 in the morning, with four digits eclipfed on the under limb, and fetting in the gulf of Cochinchina in the Eaft Indies. It being now near the folftice, this eclipfe, was vilible the very next return in 1694,. in the evening; and in two periods more, which was in 1730, on the 4th of July, was feen about half eclipfed jult after fun-rife, and obferved both at Wirtemberg in Germany, and Pekin in China, foon after Which it went off.. Eighteen years more afforded us the. eclipfe which fell on the 14th of July 1748. The next Vifible jeturn happened on July 25th 17 66, in the evening, about four digits- eclipfed; and after two periods more, will happen on Auguft 16th 1802, early in the morning, about five digits, the centre coming from the north frozen continent, by the capes of Norway, through Tartary China and Japan, to the Ladrone iflands, where it goes off. Again, in 1820, Auguft 26th, between one-and two, there will be another gi;eat eclipfe at London, about 10 digits; but, happening fo near the equinox, the centre will leave every part of Britain to the weft, and enter Germany at Emden, palling by Venice, Naples, Grand Cairo, and fet in the gulf of BafTora near that city. It will be no more vifible till 1874, when five digits will be obfeured (the centre being now about to leave the earth) on September 28th. In 1892, the fun will go down eclipfed in London; and again, in 1928, the paf- fage of the centre will be* in the expanfum, though there will be two digits eclipfed-at London, Oflober the 31ft of that year, and about the year 2090 the whole pe¬ numbra will be wore off; whence no more returns of This eclipfe can happen till after a revolution of io.ihou* fand years. N O M Y. 4)79 From thefe remarks on the entire revolution of this eclipfe, we may gather, that a thoufand years, more Or lefs, (for there are fome irregularities that may protrndfc or lengthen this period 100 years), complete the whole terreftrial phenomena of any Angle eclipfe: and lince 20 periods of 54 years each, and about 33 days, compre¬ hend the entire extent of their revolution, it is evident, that the times of the returns will pafs through a circuit of one year and ten months, every Chaldean period being ten or eleven days later, and of the equable appearances, about 32 or 33 days. Thus, though this eclipfe hap¬ pens about the middle of July, no other fubfequent ec¬ lipfe of this period will return till the middle of the fame month again ; but wear conftantly each period 10 or 11 days forward, and at laft appear in winter, but then it begins to ceafe from affedting us. Another conclufion from t ! > is revolution may be drawn, that there will feldom be any more than two great echpfes of the fun in the interval of this period, and thefe follow fometimes next return, and often at greater diftances. That of 1713 returned again in 1733 very great; but this prefent eclipfe will not be great till the arrival of 1820, which is a revolution of four Chal¬ dean periods ; fo that the irregularities of their circuits muft undergo new computa ions to affign them exadtly. Nor do ali.eclipfes come in at the fouth pole : That de¬ pends altogether on the pofition of the lunar nodes, which will bring in as many from the expanfum one way as the other; and fuch eclipfes will wear more foutherly by degrees, contrary to what happens in the prefent cafe. The eclipfe, for example, of 173d in September, had its centre in the expanfum, and let about the middle of its obfeurity in Britain; it will wear in at the north pole, and in.the year 2600, or thereabouts, go off into the expanfum- on the fouth fide, of the earth. The eclipfes therefore which happened about the cre¬ ation are little more than half way yet of their etherial circuit; and will be 4000 years before they, enter the earth any more. This-grand revolution feems to have heen intirely unknown to the ancients. - It is particularly,to be noted, tbat eclipfes.which have happened many centuries ago, will not be. found by our prefent tables to agree exactly with, ancient obfervations, by reafon of the great anomalies in. the lunar motions; which appears an inconteftable demonftration of the non- eternity of the univerfe.. For it feems confirmed by un¬ deniable proofs, that the moon now finilhes her period in . lefs time than formerly, and will-continue, by the cen¬ tripetal law, to approach nearer and nearer the earth, and to go fooner and fooner round it: Nor will the cen¬ trifugal power be fufficient to compenfate the different gravitations of fuch an affemblage of bodies as conftitute the folar fyftem, which would come to ruin of itfelf, with¬ out fome new regulation and .adjuftment of their original motions *..

That year correfponds to the 585th year before Chrift ; when accordingly there happened a very fignal eclipfe of the fun, on the 28th of May, anfwering to the prefent 10th of that month, cen¬ tral through North America, the fouth parts of France, Italy, fee. as far as Athens, or the ides in the Aegean fea ; which is the fartbeft that even the Caroline tables carry it; and confequently make it invifible to any part of Afiai in the total character ; though there are good rea- fons to believe that it extended to Babylon, and went down central over that city. We are not however to imagine, that it was fet before it pad: Sardis and the Aliatic towns, where the prediflor lived ; becaufe an in- vilible eclipfe could have been of no fervice to demon- itrate his ability in aftronomical fciences to his country¬ men, as it could give no proof of its reality; For a farther illuftration, Thucydides relates. That a folar eclipfe happened on a fummer’s day in the after¬ noon, in the firft year of the Peloponnefian war, fo great, that the ftars appeared. Rhodius was vidtor in the Olympic games the fourth year of the faid war, be¬ ing alfo the fourth of the 87th Olympiad, .on the 428th year before Chrift. So that the eclipfe muft have hap¬ pened in the 431ft year before Chrift ; and by computa¬ tion it appears, that on the third of Auguft there was a fignal eclipfe which would have paft over Athens, cen¬ tral about 6 in the evening, but which our prefent tables bring no farther than the ancient Syrtes on the African coaft, above 400 miles from Athens ; which differing in that cafe but 9 digits, could by no means exhibit the re¬ markable darknefs recited by this hiftorian ; the centre therefore feems to have paft Athens about 6 in the even¬ ing, and probably might go down about Jerufalem, or near it, contrary to the conftrudtion of the prefent tables. Thefe things are only obviated by way of caution to the prefent allronomers, in re-computing ancient e- clipfes ; and they may examine the eclipfe of Ni- cias, fo fatal to the Athenian fleet; that which over¬ threw the Macedonian army, fee. In any year, the number of eclipfes of both luminaries cannot be lefs than two, nor more than feven ; the moft ufual number is four, and it is very rare to have more N O M Y. than fix. For the fun paffes by both the nodes but one* a-year, unlefs he paffes by one of them in the beginning of the year; and if he does, he will pafs by the fame node again a little before the year be finifhed ; becaufe, as thefe points move 19^ degrees backward every year, the fun will come to either of them 173 days after the other. And when either node is within 17 degrees of the fun at the time of new moon, the fun will be e- clipfed. At the fubfequent oppofition, the moon will be eclipfed in the other node, and come round to the next conjunction again ere the former node be 17 degrees paft the fun, and will therefore eclipfe him again. When three eclipfes fall about either node, the like-number ge¬ nerally falls -about the oppofite ; as the fun comes to it in 173 days afterward; and fix lunations contain but four days more. Thus, there may be two eclipfes of the fun, and one of the moon, about each of her nodes. But when the moon changes in either of the nodes, (he- cannot be near enough the other node at the next full to be eclipfed ; and in fix lunar months afterward Ihe will change near the other node : in thefe cafes there can be but two eclipfes in a year, and they are both of the fun. A longer period than the above mentioned, for com¬ paring and examining eclipfes which happen at long in¬ tervals of time, is 557 years, 21 days, 18 hours, 30 mi¬ nutes, 11 feconds ; in which time there are 6890 mean lunations ; and the fun and node meet again fo nearly as to be but 11 feconds diftant; but then it is not the fame eclipfe that returns, as in the fhorter period above men¬ tioned.

The fecond eclipfe was obferved at Alexandria, Septem. 228, the year before Chrift 201 ; where the moon rofe fo much eclipfed, that the eclipfe muft have begun about half an hour before fhe rofe: Whereas, by moft of our tables, the beginning of this eclipfe was not till about 10 minutes after the moon roje at Alexandria. Had thefe eclipfes begun and ended while the fun was below the horizon, we might have imagined, that as the ancients had no certain way of mea- furing time, they might have been fo far miftaken in the hours, that we could not have laid any ft refs on the acounts given by them. But as, in the firft eclipfe, the moon was fet, and confequently the fun rifen, before it was over ; and in the fecond eclipfe the fun was fet , and the moon not rifen, till fome time after it began ; thefe are fuch circumftances as the obfervers could not pojfibly be miftaken , in. Mr Struyk, in the following catalogue , notwithftanding the exprefs words of Ptolemy, puts down thefe two eclipfes as obferved at Athens; where they might have been feen as above, without any acceleration of the moon's motion, Athens being 20 degrees weft of Babylon, and 7 degrees weft of Alexandria.

Eclipfes of the fun are more frequent than of the moon, Vol. I. No. 21. 3 N O M V. 481- becaufe the fun’s ecliptic limits are greater than the moon’s ; yet we have more vifible eclipfes of the moon than of the fun, becaufe eclipfes of the moon are feen from all parts of that hemifphere of the earth winch is next her, and are equally great to each of thofe parts ; but die fun’s eclipfes are vilible only to that fmall portion of the hemifphere next him whereon the moon’s lhadow falls. The moon’s orbit being elliptical, and the earth in one of its focufes, (he is once at her leaft diftance from the earth, and once at her greateft, in every lunation. When the moon changes at her leaft diftance from the earth, and fo near the node that her dark lhadow falls upon the earth, Ihe appears big enough to cover the whole dilk of the fun from that part on which her lha¬ dow falls ; and the fun appears totally eclipfed there' for fome minutes : but when the moon changes at her greateft diftance from the eaith, and fo near the node that her dark lhadow is dire&ed towards the earth, her diameter fubtends a lefs angle than the fun’s ; and therefore Ihe cannot hide his whole dilk from any part of the earth, nor does her lhadow reach it at that time ; and to the place over which the point of her lhadow hangs, the eclipfe is annular, the fun’s edge appearing like a lumi¬ nous ring all around the body of the moon. When the change happens within 17 degrees of the node, and the moon at her mean diftance from the earth, the point of her lhadow juft touches the earth, and Ihe eclipfeth the fun totally to that fmall fpot whereon her lhadow falls j but the darknefs is not of a moment’s continuance. The moon’s apparent diameter, when largeft, exceeds the fun’s, when leaft, only 1 minute 38 feconds of a de¬ gree ; and in the greateft eclipfe of the fun that can hap¬ pen at any time and place, the total darknefs continues no longer than whilft the moon is going 1 minute 38 fe¬ conds from the fun in her orbit, which is about 3 mi¬ nutes and 13 feconds of an hour. The moon’s dark lhadow covers only a fpot on the earth’s furface, about 180 Englilh miles broad, when the moon’s diameter appears largeft, and the fun’s leaft ; and the total darknefs can extend no farther than the dark lhadow covers. Yet the moon’s partial lhadow or penumbra may then cover a circular fpace 4900 miles in diameter, within all which the fun is more or lefs eclipfed, as the places are lefs or more diftant from the centre of the penumbra. When the moon changes exaftly in the node, the penumbra is circular on the earth at the mid¬ dle of the general eclipfe ; becaufe at that time it falls perpendicularly on the earth’s furface ; but at every o- ther moment it falls obliquely, and will therefore be el¬ liptical ; and the more fo, as the time is longer before or after the middle of the general eclipfe ; and then, much greater portions of the earth’s furface are involved in the penumbra. When the penumbra firft touches the earth, the ge¬ neral eclipfe begins ; when it leaves the earth, the ge¬ neral eclipfe ends : from the beginning to the end the fun appears eclipfed in fome part of the earth or other. When the penumbra touches any place, the eclipfe be¬ gins at that place, and ends when the penumbra leaves it. When the moon changes in the node, the penumbra 6 F goes"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"482 ASTRO goes over the centre of the earth’s diflc as feen from the moon ; and confequently, by defcribing the longeft line poflible on the earth, continues the longeft upon it ; namely, at a mean rate, 5 hours 50 minutes ; more, if the moon be at her greateft diftance from the earth, be- caufe flie then moves flowed ; lefs, if fhe be at her leaft diftance, becaufe of her quicker motion. To make feveral of the above and other phenomena plainer, (Plate XLVI. fig. 3.), let S be the fun, E the the earth, M the moon, and AMP the moon’s orbit. Draw the right line JVc 12 from the weftern fide of the fun at W, touching the weftern fide of the moon at c, and the earth at’ 12 : draw alfo the right line Vd 12 from the eaftern fide of the fun at V, touching the eaftern fide of the moon at d, and the earth at 12 : the dark fpace cei2d included between thofe lines is the moon’s fha- dow, ending in a point at 12, where it touches the earth ; becaufe in this cafe the moon is fuppofed to change at M in the middle between A the apogee, or fartheft point of her orbit from the earth, and P the perigee, or neareft point to it. For, had the point P been at M, the moon had been nearer the earth ; and her .dark ihadow at e would have covered a fpace upon it about 180 miles broad, and the fun would have been totally darkened,' with fome continuance : but had the point A been at M, the moon would have been farther from.the earth, and her fhadow would have ended in a point about e, and therefore the fun would have appeared like a luminous ring all around the moon. Draw the right lines IVXdh and VXcg, touching the contrary fides of the fun and moon, and ending on the earth at a and b : draw alfo the right line SXM\\2, from the centre of the fun’s diflc, through the moon’s centre, to the earth at 12; and fuppofe the two former lines WXdh and VXcg to. revolve on the line SXM 12 as an axis, and their points a and h will defcribe the limits of the penumbra T'T on the earth’s furface, including the large fpace aob\\2a ; within which the fun appears more or lefs eclipfed, as the places are more or lefs di- ftant from the verge of the penumbra aob. Draw the right linear2 acrofs the fun’s.diflc, perpen¬ dicular to SXM the axis of the penumbra : then, divide the line ^12 into twelve equal parts, as in the figure, for the twelve digits or equal parts of the fun’s diameter ; and, at equal diftances from the. centre of the penumbra at 12 (on the earth’s furface TY) to its edge aob, draw twelve concentric circles, as marked with the numeral figures 1234 < be.' and remember that the moon’s mo¬ tion in her orbit AMP is from weft to eaft, as from t to /. Then, To an obferver on the earth at b, the eaftern lipib of the moon at d feems to touch the weftern limb of the fun at IV, when the moon is at M; and the fun’s eclipfe be¬ gins at b, appearing as. at A in Plate XLV 1 I. fig. 1. at the left hand ; but, at the fame moment of abfolute time to an obferver at a in Plate XLVI. fig. 3. fhe weftern edge of the moon at e leaves the eaftern edge of the fun at V, and the eclipfe ends, .as at the right hand C, Plate XLVII. fig 1.

N O M Y. Plate XLVII. fig. 1. : to thofe who live on the circle marked 2 in Plate XLVI. fig. 3. the moon cuts off two twelfth parts of the fun, as at 2 in Plate XLVIL fig. I. ; to thofe on the circle 3, three parts ; and fo on to the centre at 12 in Plate XLVI. fig. 3. where the fun is centrally eclipfed, as at B in the middle of fig. 1. Plate XLVIL ; under which figure there is a fcale of hours and minutes, to fliew at a mean ftate how long it is from the beginning to the end of a central eclipfe of the fun on the parallel of London ; and how many di¬ gits are eclipfed at any particular time from the beginning at A to the middle at B, or the end at C. Thus, in 16 minutes from the beginning, the fun is two digits e- clipfed ; in an hour and five minutes, eight digits ; and in an hour and 37 minutes, 12 digits. By Plate XLVI. fig. 3. it is plain, that the fun is totally or centrally eclipfed but to a fmall part of the earth at any time ; becaufe the dark conical ihadow e of the moon M falls but on a fmall part of the earth ; and that the partial eclipfe is confined at that time to the fpace in¬ cluded by the circle aob, of which only one half can be rojeded in the figure, the other half being fuppofed to e hid by the convexity of the earth E: and likewife, that no part of the fun is eclipfed to the large fpace YY of the earth, becaufe the moan is not between the fun and any of that part of the earth : and therefore to all that part the eclipfe is invifible. The earth turns eaft- ward on its axis, as from g to h, which is the fame way that the moon’s Ihadow moves; but the moon’s motion is much fwifter in her orbit from s to / : and therefore, although eclipfes of the fun are of longer duration on account of the earth’s motion on its axis than they would be if that motion was ftopt, yet, in four minutes of .time at molt, the moon’s fwifter motion carries her dark iha- dow quite over any place that its centre touches at the time of greateft obfeuration. The motion of the iha¬ dow on die earth’s diflc is equal to the moon’s motion from the fun, which is about 30* minutes of a degree every hour at a mean rate ; but fo much of the moon’s orbit is equal to 30!- degrees of a great circle on the earth; and therefore the moon’s ihadow goes 3c>4- de¬ grees. or 1830 geographical miles on the earth in an hour, or 30-* miles in a minute, which is almoft four times as fwift as the motion of a cannon-balL As feen from the fun or moon, the earth’s axis ap¬ pears differently inclined every day of the year, on ac¬ count of keeping its parallelifm throughout its annual courfe.

The north pole N at that timejnclining 234 degrees towards the fun, falls fo many degrees within the earth’s en¬ lightened dilk, becaufe the fun is then vertical to D, 23-r degrees north of the equator and the equator with all its parallels feem elliptic curves bending down¬ ward, or towards the fo'uth pole, as feen from the fun ; which pole, together with 234 degrees all round it, is hid behind the dilk in the dark hemilphere of the earth. At the autumnal equinox, the earth’s axis has the po¬ rtion NOS, lying to the left hand as feen from the fun or new moon, which are then vertical to 0, where the ecliptic cuts the equator Both poles now lie in the circumference of the dilk, the north pole juft going to difappear behind it, and the fouth pole juft entering into it ; and the equator, with all its parallels, feem to be ftraight lines, becaufe their planes pafs through the obferver’s eye, as feen from the fun, and very nearly fo as feen from the moon. At the winter lolftice, the earth’s axis has the pofition NNS ; when its fouth pole S inclining 234 degrees toward the fun, falls 234 de¬ grees within the enlightened dilk, as feen from the fun or new moon, which are then vertical to the tropic of Capricorn t, 234 degrees fouth of the equator and the equator, with all its parallels, feem elliptic curves bending upward ; the north pole being as far hid be¬ hind the dilk in the dark hemifphere, as the fouth pole is come into the light. The nearer that any time of the year is to the equinoxes or folftices, the more it partakes of the phenomena relating to them. Thus it appears, that from the vernal equinox to the autumnal, the north pole is enlightened ; and the equai tor, and all its parallels, appear elliptical as feen from the fun, more or lefs curved as the time is nearer to, of farther from, the fummer folftice ; and bending down¬ wards, or towards the fouth pole ; the reverie of which happens from the autumnal equinox to the vernal. A little confideration will be fufficient to convince the reader, that the earth’s axis inclines towards the fun at the fummer folftice ; from the fun at the winter folftice ; and fidewife to the fun at the equinoxes ; but towards the right hand, as feen from the fun at the vernal equi¬ nox ; and towards the left hand at the autumnal. From the winter to the fummer folftice, the earth’s axis in-, dines more or lefs to the right hand, as feen from the fun; and the contrary from the fummer to the winter folftice. The different pofuions of the earth’s axis,- as feen from the fun at different times of the year, affedt folar eclipfes greatly &ith regard to particular places ; yea, fo far as would make central eclipfes-which fall at one time of the year invifible if they fell at another, even though the moon Ihould always change in the nodes, and at the fame hour of the day; of which indefinitely various af¬ fections, we (hall only give examples for the times of the equinoxes and folftices. In the fame diagram, (Plate XLVTI. fig. 2.), let FG be part of the ecliptic, and IK, ik, ik, ik, part of the; moon’s orbit; both feen edgewife, and therefore pro¬ jected into right lines; and let the intetfedions NODE N O M Y. 48 >- be one and the fame node at the above times, when the; earth has the forementioned different pofitions ; and let the fpaces included by the circles Pppp be the penumbra at thefe times, as its centre is palling over the centre of the earth’s dilk. At the winter folftice, when the earth’s- axis has the pofition NNS, the centre of the penumbra P touches the tropic of Capricorn / in AC at the middle of the general eclipfe ; but no part of the penumbra touches the tropic of Cancer T. At the fummer fol¬ ftice, when the earth’s axis has the pofition NDS (iDk being then part of the moon’s orbit, whofe node- is at D) the penumbra p has its centre at D, on the tropic of Cancer T, at the middle of the general eclipfc, and then no part of it touches the tropic of Capricorn t. At the autumnal equinox, the earth’s axis has the po¬ fition NOS, (iOk being then part of the moon’s orbit), and the penumbra equally includes part of both tropics T and t at the middle of the general eclipfe : at the ver¬ nal equinox it does the fame, becaufe the earth’s axis has the pofition NFS ; but, in the former of thefe two laft cafes, the penumbra enters the earth at A, north of the tropic of Cancer T, and leaves it at m, fouth of the tropic of Capricorn t ; having gone over the earth ob¬ liquely fouthvvard, as its centre deferibed the line AOm : whereas, in the latter cafe, the penumbra touches the earth at n, fouth of the equator JE§>_, and delcribing the line nEq, (limilar to the former line AOm in open fpace), goes obliquely northward over the earth, and. leaves it at q, north of the equators In all thefe circumftances, the moon has been fuppo- fed to change at noon in her defeending. node: Had lhe> changed in her afeending node, the phenomena would have been as various the contrary way, with refped to; the penumbra’s going northward or fouthward over the earth. But becaufe the moon changes at all hours, as- often in; one node as in the other, and at all. diftances from them both at different times as it happens, the va¬ riety of the phafes of eclipfes are almoft innumerable, e- ven at the fame places; confidering alfo how varioufly the fame places are fituated on the enlightened dilk of the earth, with refped to the penumbra’s motion, at the ; different hours when eclipfes happen. When the moon .changes 17 degrees ftrort of her de¬ fending, node, .the penumbra P 18 juft touches the nor¬ thern part of the earth’s dilk, near the north pole W; and, as feen from that place, the moon appears to touch the fun, but hides no, part of him from light; Had the change been as far Ihort of the afeending node, the pe¬ numbra would have touched the fouthern part of the dilk. near the fouth pole S. When the moon changes 12 de¬ grees Ihort of the defeending node, more than a third part of the penumbra.

When the moon., changes 6 degrees from the node, almoft the whole penumbra P 6 falls on the earth at the.middle of the general eclipfe. And laftly, when- the moon changes in the node at N, the penumbra PN takes the longeft courfe poflible on the earth’s dilk.; its centre"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"484 ASTRO centre falling on the middle thereof, at the middle of the general eclipfe. The farther the moon changes from either node, within 17 degrees of it, the fhorter is the penumbra’s continuance on the earth, becaufe it goes o- ver a lefs portion of the dillc, as is evident by the fi- gure. The nearer that the penumbra’s centre is to the equa¬ tor at the mifldle of the general eclipfe, the longer is the duration of the eclipfe at all thofe places where it is central; becaufe, the nearer that any place is to the e- quator, the greater is the circle it defcribes by the earth’s motion on its axis: And fo, the place moving quicker, keeps longer in the penumbra, whofe motion is the fame way with that of the place, though farter, as has been already mentioned. Thus (fee the earth at D and the penumbra at 12) whilft the point b in the polar circle abed is carried from b to c by the earth’s diurnal motion, the point d on the tropic of Cancer T is carried a much greater length from d to D ; and there¬ fore, if the penumbra’s centre goes one time over c and another time over D, the penumbra will be longer in parting over the moving place d than it was in parting o- ver the moving place b. Confequently, central eclipfes about the poles are of the fhorteft duration ; and about the equator of the longeft. In the middle of fummer, the whole frigid zone, in¬ cluded by the polar circle abed, is enlightened ; and if it then happens, that the penumbra’s centre goes over the north pole, the fun will be eclipfed much the fame num¬ ber of digits at a as at c •, but whilft the penumbra moves eaftward over c, it moves weftward over a\\ becaufe, with refpedt to the penumbra, the motions of a and c are contrary : For c moves the fame way with the pe¬ numbra towards d, but a moves the contrary way to¬ wards b ; and therefore the eclipfe will be of longer du¬ ration at e than at a. At a the eclipfe begins on the fun’s caftern limb, but at c on his weftern : At all places lying without the polar circles, the fun’s eclipfes begin on his Weftern limb, or near it, and end on of near his eaftern. At thofe places where the penumbra touches the earth, the eclipfe begins with the rifing fun, on the'top of his weftern or uppermoft edge; and at thofe places where the penumbra leaves the earth, the eclipfe ends with the fetting fun, on the top of his eaftern edge, which is then the uppermoft, juft at its difappearing in the horizon. If the moon were furrounded by an atmofphere of any confiderable denfity, it would feem to touch the fun a little before the moon made her appulfe to his edge, and we'fhould fee a little faintnefs on that edge before it were eclipfed by the moon : But as no fuch faintnefs has been ob'ferved, it feems plain, that the moon has no fuch atmofphere as that of the earth. The faint ring of light furrounding the fun in total eclipfes, called by Caflini la ckevelure du foleil, feems to be the atmofphere of the fun; becaufe it has been obferved to move equally with the fun, not with the moon. Having been fo prolix concerning eclipfes of the fun, we ftiall drop that fubjedt at prefent, and proceed to the dodtrine of lunar eclipfes ; which, being more Ample, may be explained in lefs time. That the moon can never be eclipfed but at the time N O M Y. of her’ being full, and the reafon why fhe is not eclipfed at every full, has been flie wn already. In Plate XLVI. fig. 3. let S be the fun, E the earth, RR the earth’s fhadow, and and B the moon in oppofition to the fun: In this fitua- tion the earth intercepts the fun’s light in its way to the moon ; and when the moon touches the earth’s fhadow at v, flie begins to be eclipfed on her eaftern limb x, and continues eclipfed until her weftern limb y leaves the fha- dow at tv: At B flie is in the middle of the fhadow, and confequently in the middle of the eclipfe. The moon, when totally eclipfed, is not invifible if flie be above the horizon and the fky be clear; but appears generally of a dulky colour, like tarnirtied copper, which fome have thought to be the moon’s native light. But the true caufe of her being vifible is the fcattered beams of the fun, bent, into the earth’s fliadow by going through the atmofphere; which, being more or leis denfe near the earth than at confiderable heights above it, refradts or bends the fun’s rays more inward, the nearer they are parting by the earth’s furface, than thofe rays which go through higher parts of the atmofphere, where it is lefs denfe according to its height, until it be fo thin or rare as to lofe its refradtive power. Let the circl zfghi, concentric to the earth, include the atmo¬ fphere whofe refradtive power vaniflies at the heights f and i ; fo that the rays Wfw and Viv go on ftraight without fuffering the leaft refradtion : But all thofe rays which enter the atmofphere between f and k, and be¬ tween i and /, on oppofite fides of the earth, are gradual¬ ly more bent inward as they go through a greater por¬ tion of the atmofphere, until the rays Wk and /^/touch¬ ing the earth at m and n, are bent fo much as to meet at q, a little fliort of the moon ; and therefore the dark fhadow of the earth is contained in the fpace moqpn, where none of the fun’s rays can enter: All the reft RR, being mixed by the fcattered rays which are refradted as above, is in fome meafure enlightened by them ; and fome of thofe rays falling on the moon, give her the colour of tarnirtied copper, or of iron almoft red hot. So that if the earth had no atmofphere, the moon would be as invifible in total eclipfes as flie is when new. If the moon were fo near the earth as to go into its dark fliadow, fuppofe about po, Ihe would be invifible during her ftay in it; but vifible before and after in the fainter fhadow RR. When the moon goes through the centre of the earth’s fhadow, Ihe is diredtly oppofite to the fun : Yet the moon has been often feen tptally eclipfed in the horizon when the fun was alfo vifible in the oppofite part of it: For, the horizontal refradlion being almoft 34 minutes of a degree, and the diameter of the fun and moon being each at a mean date but 32 minutes, the refradtion caufes both luminaries to appear above the horizon when they are really below it. When the moon is full at 12 degrees from either of her nodes, flie juft touches the earth’s fliadow, but en¬ ters not into it.

The reafon of this difference is, that when the moon is far- theft from the earth, (he moves flowed; and when near- eft to it,” quickeft. The moon’s diameter, as well as the fun’s, is fuppo- fed to be divided into twelve equal parts, called digits ; and fo many of thefe parts as are darkened by the earth’s (hadow, fo many digits is the moon eclipfed. All that th*e moon is eclipfed above 12 digits, (hew how far the (hadow of the earth is over the body of the moon, on that edge to which (he is neareft at the middle of the e- clipfe. It is difficult to obferve exactly either the beginning or ending of a lunar eclipfe, even with a good telefcope ; becaufe the earth’s (hadow is fo faint and ill defined a- bout the edges, that when the moon is either juft touch¬ ing or leaving it, the obfeuration of her limb is fcarce fenfible ; and therefore the niceft obfervers can hardly be certain to four or five feconds of time. But both the beginning and ending of folar eclipfes are vifibly inftan- taneous ; for the moment that the edge of the moon’s diflt touches.the fun’s, his roundnefs feems a little broke on that part; and the moment (he leaves it, he appears perfedlly round again. In aftronomy, eclipfes of the moon are of great ufe for afeertaining the periods of her motions ; efpecially fuch eclipfes as are obferved to be alike in all her circumftan- ces, and have long intervals of time between them. In geography, the longitudes of places are found by eclip¬ fes : But for this purpofe eclipfes of the moon are more ufeful than thofe of the fun, becaufe they arc more fre¬ quently vifible, and the fame lunar eclipfe is of equal, largencfs and duration at all places where it is feen. In chronology, both folar and lunar eclipfes ferve to deter¬ mine exadtly the time of any paft event: for there are fo many particulars obfervable in every eclipfe, with refpeft to its quantity, the places where it is vifible (if of the fun) and the time of the day or night, that it is impof- fible there can be two folar eclipfes in the courfe of ma¬ ny ages which are alike in all circumitances. Prom the above explanation of the dodtrine of eclip¬ fes it is evident, £fiat the darknefs at our Saviour’s cru¬ cifixion was fuperiiatural. For he fullered on the day on which the paffover was eaten by the Jews, on which day it was impoflible that the moon’s (hadow could fall on the earth ; for the Jews kept the paffover at the time of full moon : Nor does the darknefs in total eclipfes of the fun laft above four minutes in any place; whereas the darknefs at the crucifixion lafted three hours, Matth. xxviii. 15. and oveifpread at leaft all the land of Ju¬ dea. Vol. I. Numb. 21, 3 N O M Y. 485 With regard to the method of calculating and pro\" jefting eclipfes, we muft refer the reader to the aftrono- mical tables of Mr Fergufon and others. When the principles are explained, the application and ufe of the tables is a matter of fmall difficulty, and eafily acquired by a little practice. Chap. XVII. Of the fixed Stars. The ftars are faid to be fixed, becaufe they have been generally obferved to keep at the fame diftanCes from each other : their apparent diurnal revolutions be¬ ing caufed folely by the earth’s turning on its axis. They appear of a fenfible magnitude to the bare eye, becaufe the retina is affedted not only by the rays of light which are emitted dire&ly from them, but by many thoufands more, which, falling upon our eye-lids, and upon the aerial particles about us, are reflefted into our eyes fo ftrongly as to excite vibrations not only in thofe points of the retina where the real images of the ftars are form¬ ed, but alfo in other points at fome diftance round a- bout. This makes us imagine the ftars to be much big¬ ger than they would appear, if we faw them only by the few rays which come diredlly from them, fo as to enter our eyes without being intermixed with others. Any one may be fenfible of this, by looking at a ftar of the firft magnitude through a long . narrow tube; which, though it takes in as much of the (Icy as would hold a thoufand fuch ftars, yet fcarce renders that one vi¬ fible. The more a telefcope magnifies, the lefs is the aper¬ ture through which the ftar is feen; and confequently the fewer rays it admits into the eye. Now fince the ftars appear lefs in a telefcope which magnifies 200 times, than they do to the bare eye, infomuch that they feem to be only indivifible points, it proves at once that the ftars are at immenfe diftances from us, and that they (hine by their own proper light. If they (hone by bor¬ rowed light, they would be as invifible without tele- fcopes as the fatelhtes of Jupiter are; for thefe fatellites appear bigger when viewed with a good telefcope than the largeft fixed ftars do. The number of ftars difcoverable, in either hemifphere, by the naked eye, is not above a thoufand. This at firft may appear incredible; becaufe they feem to be with¬ out number: But the deception arifes from our looking confufedly upon them, without reducing them into order. For, look but ftedfaftly upon a pretty large portion of the Iky, and count the number of ftars in it, and you will be furprifed to find them fo few. Or, if one con- fiders how feldom the moon meets with any ftars in her way, although there are as many about her path as in other parts of the heavens, he will foon be convinced that the ftars are much thinner fown than he was aware of. The Britifli catalogue, which, befides the ftars vi¬ fible to the bare eye, includes a great number which cannot be feen without the afliftance of a telefcope, con¬ tains no more than three thoufaud, in both hemifpheres. As we have incomparably more light from the moon than from all the ftars together, it were the greateft ab- 6 G furdity"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"4 S 6 ASTRO furdity to imagine that the ftars were made for no other purpofe than to caft a faint light upon the earth; efpe- cially fince many more require the afliftance of a good te- lefcope to find them out, than are vilible without that inftrument. Our fun is furrounded by a fyftem of pla¬ nets and comets ; all which would be invifible from the neareft fixed ftar. And from what we already know of the immenfe diftance of the ftars, the neareft may be computed at 32,000,000,000,000 of miles from us, which is farther than a cannon-bullet would fly in 7,000, 0 00 of years. Hence it is eafy to prove, that the fun, feen from fuch a diftance, would appear no bigger than a ftar of the firft magnitude. From all this it is highly probable, that each ftar is a fun to a fyftem of worlds moving round it, though unfeen by us ; efpe- cially as the dodtrine of a plurality of worlds is rational, and greatly manifefts the power, wifdom, and goodnefs of the great Creator. The ftars, on account of their apparently various mag¬ nitudes, have-been diftributed into feveral clafles, or or¬ ders. Thofe which appear largeft, are called Jiars of the fitji magnitude’, the next to them in luftre, f urs of the fecond magnitude’, and fo on the fxth, which are the fmalleft thj.t are vifible to the bare eye. This diftri- bution having been made long before the. invention of telefcopes, the ftars which cannot be feen without the affiftance of thefe inftrumerits, are diftinguifhed by the name of te/efccpk f are. The ancients divided the ftarry fphere into particular conftellations; or fyftems of ftars, according as they lay near one another, fo as to occupy thofe fpaces which the figures of different forts of animals or things would take up, if they were there delineated. And thofe ftars ■ which could not be brought into any particular conftella- tion, were called unformed fan. This drvifion of the ftars into different conftellations or afterifms, ferves to diftinguifh them from one another, fo that any particular ftar may be readily found in the heavens by means of a celeftial globe; on which the conftellations are fo delineated, as to put the moft remark¬ able ftars into fiich parts of the figures as are moft eafily diftinguifhed; The number of the ancient conftellations is 48, and upon our prefent globes about 70. On Se- nex’s globes are inferted Bayer’s letters; the firft in the Greek alphabet being put to the biggeft ftar in each con- flellation, the fecond to the next, and fo on: By which N O M Y. means, every ftar is as eafily found as if a name were given to it. Thus, if the ftar y in the conftellation of the ram be mentioned, every alfronomer knows as well what ftar is meant as if it were pointed out to.him in the heavens. There is alfo a divifion of the heavens into three parts, I. The Zodiak (£&>§<«x:?) from zodion, an animal, becaufe moft of the conftellations in it, which are twelve in number, are the figures of animals : As Aries the ram, Taurus the bull, Gemini the twins, Cancer the crab, Leo the lion, Virgo the virgin, Libra the balance, Scorpio the fcorpion, Sagittarius the archer, Capricor- nus the goat, Aquarius the water-bearer, and Pifces the fifties. The zodiac goes quite round the heavens r it is about 16 degrees broad, fo that it takes in the orbits of all the planets, and likewife the orbit of the moon. Along the middle of this zone or belt is the ecliptic, or circle which the earth defcribes annually as feen from the fun ; and which the fun appears to defcribe as feen from the earth. 2. All that region of the heavens, which is on the north fide of th6 zodiac, containing twenty-one conftellations. And, 3. That on the fouth fide, containing fifteen. The ancients divided the zodiac into the above twelve conftellations or figns in the following manner. They took a veflel with a fmall hole in the bottom, and having filled it with water, fuffered the fame to diftil drop by drop into another veflel fet beneath to receive it; be¬ ginning at the moment when fome ftar rofe, and conti¬ nuing until it rofe the next following night. The water fallen down into the receiver they divided into twelve e- qual parts; and having two other fmall veflels in readi- nefs, each of them fit to contain one part, they again poured all the water into the upper veflel, and obferving the rifing of fome ftar in the zodiac, they at the fame time fuffered the water to drop into one of the fmall veflels; and as foon as it was full, they'fluffed it, and fet an empty one in Its place. When each veflel was full, they took notice what ftar of the zodiac rofe ; and though this could not be done in one night, yet in ma¬ ny they obferved the rifing of twelve ftars or points, by which they divided the zodiac into twelve parts. The names of the conftellations, and the number of ftars obferved in each of them by different aftronomers, are as follow. The. ancient Conftellations. Ptolemy. Tycho. Hevelius. Flamfeed.

A fourth, of a fraaller fize, is before Antinous’s right foot; having a liar-, in it, which makes it appear more bright. A fifth is in the contlellation of Hercules, between the ftars ^ and jj, which fpot, though but final), is ; vifible to the bare eye, if the Iky be ckar and the moon abient. Cloudy fiars are fo called from their mifty appearance. They look like dim ftars to the naked eye-; but through a telefcope they appear broad illuminated parts of the iky ; in lome of which is one liar, in others more. Five of thefe are mentioned 'by Ptolemy, i. One at the ex¬ tremity of the right hand of Pei feus. 2. One in the middle of the Crab. 3. One unformed, near the fting of the Scorpion. 4.

Both Caflini and Flamfteed difcovered one between the Great and Little Dog, which is very full of ftars vifible only by the telefcope. The two whitifli fpots near the fouth pole, called the Magellanic Clouds by Sailors, which to tlie bare eye refemble part of the Milky Way, appear through tdefcopes to be a mixture of fmall clouds and ftars. But the moft re¬ markable of all the cloudy ftars is that in the middle of Orion’s Sword, where feven ftars (of which three are very clofe together) feem to fliine through a cloud, very lucid near the middle, but faint and ill defined about the edges. It looks like a gap in the Iky, through which one may fee (as it were) part of a much brighter re¬ gion. Although moft of thefe fpaces are but a few mi¬ nutes of a degree in breadth, yet, fince they are among the fixed ftars, they muft be fpaces larger than what is occupied by our folar fyftem ; and in which there feems to be a perpetual uninterrupted day among numberlefs worlds, which no human art ever can difcover. Several ftars are mentioned by ancient aftronomers, -which are not now to be found ; and others are now vi¬ fible to the bare eye which are not recorded in tire ancient catalogues. Hipparfhus obferved a new ftar about 120 years before Chrift ; but he has not mentioned in what part of the heaven it was feen, although it oceafioned his making a catalogue of the ftars ; which is the moft ancient that we have. The firft new ftar that we have any good account of, was difcovered by Cornelius Gemma on the 8th of No¬ vember 4 . -D. 1572, in the chair of Caffiopea. It fur- N O M Y. parted Sirius in brightnefs and magnitude ; and was feen for 16 months fucceflively. At firft it appeared bigger than Jupiter to fome eyes, by which it was feen at mid¬ day : afterwards it decayed gradually both in magnitude and Iuftre, until Mhrch 1573, when it became invifi'ole. On the 13th of Auguft 1596, David Fabricius ob¬ ferved the Stella Mira, or wonderful ftar, in the neck of the Whale ; which has been fince found to appear and difappear periodically, feven times in fix years, conti¬ nuing in the greateft Iuftre for 15 days together ; and is never quite extinguilhed. In the year 1600, William Janfenius difcovered a changeable ftar in the neck of the Swan ; which, in time, became fo fmall as to be thought to difappear entirely, till the years 1657, 1658, and 1659, when it recovered its former Iuftre and magnitude ; but foon decayed, and is now of the fmalleft fize. In the year 1604 Kepler and feveral of his friends faw a new ftar near the heel of the right foot of Serpenta- rius, fo bright and fparkling, that it exceeded any thing they had ever feen before •, and took notice that it was every moment changing into fome of the colours of the rainbow, except when it was near the horizon, at which time it was generally white. It furpafled Jupiter in mag¬ nitude, which was near it all the month of Odtober, but eafily diftinguirtied from Jupiter, by the fteady light of Jupiter. It difappeared between Oftober 1605 and the February following, and has not been feen fince that time. In the year 1670, July 15, Hevelius difcovered a new ftar, which in Oflober was fo decayed as to be fcarce perceptible. In April following it regained its Iuftre, but wholly difappeared in Auguft. In March 1672 it was feen again, but very fmall; and has not been vifible fince. In the year 1686 a new ftar was difcovered by Kirch, which returns periodically in 404 days. In the year 1672, Caflini faw a ftar in the neck of the Bull, which he thought was not vifible in Tycho’s time, nor when Bayer made his figures. Many ftars, bolides thofe above mentioned, have been obferved to change their magnitudes : and as none of them could ever be perceived to have tails, it is plain they could not be comets ; efpecially as they had no pa¬ rallax, even when largeft and'brighteft. It would feem, that the periodical ftars have vaft clufters of dark fpots, and very flow rotations on their axes ; by which means, they muft difappear when the fide covered with fpots is turned towards us. And as for thofe which break out all of a fuddcn with fuch Iuftre, it is by no means im¬ probable that they are funs whofe fuel is almoft fpent, and again fupplied by fome of their comets falling upon them, and occafioning an uncommon blaze and fplendor for fome time ; which indeed appears to be the greateft ufe of the cometary part of any fyftem # .

But whether this be owing to any real motion in the ftars themfelves, muft require the obfervations of many ages to determine. If our folar fyftem changeth its place, with regard to abfolute fpace, this muft in procefs of time occafion an apparent change in the diftances of the ftars from each other : and in fuch a cafe, the places of the neareft ftars to us being more af¬ fected than thofe which are very remote, their relative pofitions muft feem to alter, though the ftars themfelves were really immoveable. On the other hand, if our own fyftem be at reft, and any of th<^ ftars in real motion, this muft vary their pofitions ; and the more fo, the nearer they are to us, or fwifter their motions are, or the more proper the direction of their motion is for our perception. The obliquity of the ecliptic to the equinoctial is found at prefent to be above the third part of a degree lefs than Ptolemy found it. And moft of the obfervcrs after him found it to decreafe gradually down to Tycho’s time. If it be objected, that we cannot depend on the ob¬ fervations of the ancients, becaufe of the incorreCt- nefs of their inftruments; we have to anfwer, that both Tycho and Flamfteed are allowed to have been very good obfervers ; and yet we find that Flamfteed makes this obliquity minutes of a degree lefs than Tycho did about ioo years before him : and as Pto¬ lemy was 1324 years before Tycho, fo the gradual de¬ creafe anfwers nearly to the difference of time between thefe three aftronomers. If we confider, that the earth is not a perfect fphere, but an oblate fpheriod, having its axis (horter than its equatorial diameter ; and that the fun and moon are conftantly aCting obliquely upon the greater quantity of matter about the equator, pulling it, as it were, towards a nearer and nearer co-incidence with the ecliptic ; it will not appear improbable that thefe aCtions fhould'gradually diminifh the angle between thofe planes. Nor is it lefs probable that the mutual attrac¬ tions of all the planets fhould have a tendency to bring their orbits to a coincidence : but this change is too finall to becom&fenfible in many ages.

N O M Y. 4«<? is a year; which is determined by the revolution of fome celeftial body in its orbit, viz. the fun or moon. The time meafured by the fun’s revolution in the ecliptic, from any equinox or folftice to the fame again, is called the Solar or Tropical Tear, which contains 365 days, y hours, 48 minutes, 57 feconds ; and is the only proper or natural year, becaufe it always keeps the fame feafons to the fame months. The quantity of time meafured by the fun’s revolu¬ tion, as from any fixed ftar to the fame ftar again, is called the fydereal year ; which contains 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 144 feconds; and is 20 minutes iyj- feconds longer than the true folar year. The time meafured by twelve revolutions of the moon, from the fun to the fun again, is called the lunar year ; it contains 354 days 8 hours 48 minutes 36 feconds; and is therefore 10 days 21 hours o minutes 21 feconds fhorter than the folar year. This is the foundation of the epaCt. The civil year is that which is in common ufe among the different nations of the world; of which, fome rec¬ kon by the lunar, but moft by the folar. The civil fo¬ lar year contains 365 days, for three years running, which are called common years; and then comes in what is called the bijfextile or leap-year, which contains 366 days. This is alfo called the Julian year, on account of Julius Caefar, who appointed the intercalary-day every fourth year, thinking thereby to make the civil and folar year keep pace together. And this day, being added to the 23d of February, which in the Roman kalendar was the fixth of the kalends of March, that fixth day was twice reckoned, or the 23d and 24th were reckoned as one day, and was called bis fextus dies ; and thence came the name bijfextile for that year. But in our com¬ mon almanacks this day is added at the end of February. The civil lunar year is alfo common or intercalary. The common year confifts of 12 lunations, which con¬ tain 354 days; at the end of which, the year begins a- gain. The intercalary, or embolimic year is that where¬ in a month was added, to adjuft the lunar year to the folar. This method was ufed by the Jews, who kept their ac¬ count by the lunar motions. But by intercalating no more than a month of 30 days, which they called Ve- Adar, every third year, they fell 3^ days fhort of the folar year in that time. The Romans alfo ufed the lunar embolimic year at firft, as it was fettled by Romulus their firft king, who made it to confift only of ten months or lunations, which fell 61 days fhort of the folar year, and fo their year be¬ came quite vague and unfixed; for which reafon, they Were forced to have a table publifhed by the high-prieft, to inform them when the fpring and other feafons began. or be reduced to flat circular planes, fo thin as to be quite inviftble •when their edges are turned towards us ; as Saturn's ring is in fuch pofitions. But when very excentric plan'ets or comets go round any flat far, in orbits much inclined to its equator, the at trail ion of the planets or comets in their perihelions mufl alter the inclination of the axis of'that far ; on which account it will appear snore or lefs large and luminous, as its broad ftde is more or lefs turned towards us. And thus he imagines we may account for the apparent changes of magnitude and lufre in thofe flars, and likewife for their appearing and difappearing. Vol. I.

But Julius Csefar, as already mentioned, taking this troublefome affair into confideration, reformed the ka- lendar, by making the year to confift of 365 days 6 hours. The year thus fettled, is what we ftill make ufe of in Britain; but as it is fomewhat more than 11 minutes longer than the folar tropical year, the times of the e- quinoxes go backward, and fall earlier by one day in a- bout 130 years. In the time of the Nicene Council, (A. D. 325), which was 1444 years ago, the vernal equinox fell on the 21ft of March; and if we divide 1444 by 130. it will quote it, which is the number of days which the equinox has fallen back fince the Council of Nice. This caufing great difturbances, by unfixing the times of the celebration of Eafter, and confequently of all the other moveable feafts, Pope Gregory XHIth, in the year 1582, ordered ten days to be at once ftruck out of that year; and the next day after the 4th of Oc¬ tober was called the 15th. By this means the vernal e- qijinox was reftored to the 21ft of March; and it was endeavoured, by the omiflion of three intercalary days in 400 years, to make the civil or political year keep pace with the folar for time to come. This new form of the year is called the Gregorian account , or new jlyle\\ which is received in all countries where the pope’s authority is acknowledged, and ought to be in all places where truth is regarded. The principal divifion of the year is into months, which are of two forts, namely, agronomical and civil. The aftronomical month is the time in which the moon runs through the zodiac, arid is either periodical or fy- nodical. The periodical month is the time fpent by the* moon in making one complete revolution from any point of the zodiac to the fame again; which is 27 J 7 h 43°'. The fynodical month, called a lunation , is the time contained between the moon’s parting with the fun at a conjunction, atid returning to him again, which is 2 9 J I2 h 44 ra . -The civil months are thofe which are framed for the ufe9 of civil life; and are different as to their names, num¬ ber of days, and times of beginning, in feveral different cduntries. The firft month of the Jewiih year fell ac¬ cording to the moon in our Auguft and September, old ftyle; the fecond in September and October; and fo on. The firft month of the Egyptian year began on the 29th of our Auguft. The firft month of the Arabic and Turkilh year began the 16th of July. The firft month of the Grecian year fell according to the moon in June and July, the fecond in July and Auguft, and fo on, as in the following table. A month is divided into four parts called weeks, and a week into feven parts called days-, fo that in a Julian year there are 13 fuch months, or 52 weeks, and one day over. The Gentiles gave the names of the fun, moon, and planets, to the days of the week. To the firft, the name of the Sun ; to the fecond, of the Moon ; to the third, of Mars ; to the fourth, of Mercury ; to the fifth, of Jupiter ; to the fixth, of Venus ; and to the feventh, of Saturn.

A day is either natural or artificial. The natural day contains 24 hours; the artificial the time from fun- rife to fun-fet. The natural day is either aflronomical or civil. The aftronomical day begins at noon, becaufe the increafe and deereafe of days terminated by the hori¬ zon are very unequal among themfelves ; which inequa¬ lity is likewife augmented by the inconftancy of the ho¬ rizontal refractions, and therefore the aftronomer takes the meridian for the limit of diurnal revolutions, reckon¬ ing noon, that is, the inftant when the fun’s centre is on the meridian, for the beginning of the day.* The Bri- tifti, French, Dutch, Germans, Spaniards, Portuguefe, and Egyptians, begin the civil day at midnight; the an- cieilt Greeks, Jews, Bohemians, Silefians, with the mo¬ dern Italians, and Chinefe, begin it at fun-fetting; and the ancient Babylonians, Perfians, Syrians, with the mo¬ dern Greeks, at fun-rifing. An hour is a certain determinate part of the day, and is either equal or unequal. An equal hour is the 24th part of a mean natural day, as dhewn by well-regulated clocks and watches; but thefe hours are not quite equal as meafured by the returns of the fun to the meridian, becaufe of the obliquity of the ecliptic rind fun’s unequal motion in it. Unequal hours are thofe by which the ar¬ tificial day Is divided into twelve parts, and the night in¬ to as many. An hour is divided into 60 equal parts culledminutes, a minute into 60 equal parts called feconds, and thefe a* gain into 60 equal parts called thirds. The Jews; Chaldeans, and Arabians, divide the hour- into 1080 e- qual parts called fcruples ; which number contains 18 times 60; fo that one miniate contains 18 fcruples. A cycle is a perpetual round, or circulation of the fame parts of time of any fort; The cycle of the fun is a revolution of 28 years, in- which time the days of the months return again to the fame days of the week; the fun’s place to the fame figns and degrees of the e- cliptic on the fame months and days, fo as not to differ one degree in 100 years; and the leap-years begin the fame courfe over again with refpeCt to the days of the week on which the days of the months fall The cycle of the moon, commonly called the golden, number , is a revolution of 19 years; in which time, the conjunctions, oppofitions, and other afpeCts of the moon, are within an hour and half of being the fame as they were on the fame days of the months 19 years before. The indiflion is a revolution of iy years, ufed only by the Romans for in¬ dicating the times of certain payments made by the fub- je&s to the republic : It was eftablilhed by Conftantine, A. D. 312- The year of our Saviour’s birth, according to the vul¬ gar sera, was the 9th year of the folar cycle, the firft year of the lunar cycle, and the 312th year after his birth was the firll year of the Roman indiCtion. There¬ fore, to find the year, of the folar cycle, add 9 to any given year of Chrift^ and divide the fum by 28, the quotient is the number of cycles- elapfed fince his birth, and the remainder is the cycle for the given year; If nothing remains, the cycle is 28. To find the lunar cycle, add 1 to the given year of Chrift, and divide the fum by 19; the quotient is the. number of cycles elapfed in the interval, and the remainder is the cycle for the given year : If nothing remains, the cycle is 19. Laftly, fub- traCt 312 from the giyen year of Chrift, and divide the remainder by 15 ; and what remains after this divifion is the indiCtion for the given year : If nothing remains, the indiCtion is 15. Although the above deficiency-in the lunar: circle of an hour and an half every 19 years be but fmall, yet in time it becomes fo. fenfible as to make a whole natural day in 310 years. So-that, although this cycle be of ufe, when the golden numbers are rightly placed againft the days of the months in the kalendar, as in -our Com¬ mon Prayer Books, for finding the days of the mean conjunctions or oppofitions of the fun and moon, and confequently the time of Eafter; it will only ferve for 310 years, old ftyle. For as the new and full moons anticipate a day in that time, the golden numbers ought"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"^9‘2 A S T R O to be placed one day earlier in the kalendar for the next 510 years to come. Thefe numbers were rightly placed a gain A the days of new moon in the kalendar, by the council of Nice, A. D. 325 ; but the anticipation, which has been neglected ever fince, is now grown almoft into 5 days : And therefore, all the golden numbers ought now to be placed 5 days higher in the kalendar for the old ftyle than they were at the time of the faid council ; or 6 days lower for the new ftyle, becaufe at prefent it differs n days from the old. a £ g: 4 May * 2 * $ Cc oi fb b , 9 9 i 7 17 6 11 »9 2 17 6 »4 14 3 11 •9 3 17 6 17 6 3 11 19 8 8 4 6 6 *4 14 3 19 8 16. s 14 3 11 11 19 8 16 6 14 3 »4 3 19 16 5 5 7 3 11 u 19 8 16 13 8 r 9 S 8 16 5 5 13 9 11 ■ |*9 11 19 A 3 2 10 ! ! 19 8 8 16 16 5 13 2 10 11 19 8 5 13 2 2 10 12 8 16 8 16 16 5 10 18 •3 5 13 13 2 10 18 7 14 16 ! s 16 S 2 10 18 18 7 1 S *1 | 5 13 •3 2 7 IS 16 *3 2 10 10 18 7 is 17 13 2 13 2 18 7 1S 4 4 18 2 I 1 2 10 10 18 ij 12 19 io 1 18 7 7 15 4 4 12 20 10 18 16 18 15 12 1 1 21 18 18 ■ 7 7 ■ S 4 12 9 22 7 15 4 4 12 1 1 9 23 7 15 7 IS 12 9 *7 17 24 15 4 4 12 1 9 6 25 ; 5 4 12 1 9 17 i 7 6 26 ! 4 4 12 I 6 is 27 12 1 1 9 9 17 6 >4 28 12 1 12 9 *7 6 M M 3 3 29 1 1 9 *7 ! 3 11 30 17 6 6 14 3 11 3 1 9 9 £ M -3 11 ii. In the above table the golden numbers under the months ftan^l againft the days of new moon in the left- hand column, for the new ftyle ; adapted chiefly to the fecond year after leap-year, as being the neareft mean for all the four ; and will ferve till the year i960.- There¬ fore, to find the day of new moon in any month of a gi¬ ven year till that time, Jook for the golden number of N O M Y. that year under the defired month, and againft it you have the day of new moon in the left-hand column. Thus, fuppofe it were required to find the day of new moon in September 1769; the golden number for that year is 3, which I look for under September, and right againfl it in the left-hand column you will find 30, which is the day of new moon in that month. JV. B. If all the golden numbers, except 17 and 6, were fet one day lower in the table, it would ferve from the beginning of the year 1900 till the end of the year 2199. The table at the end of this chapter thews the golden number for 4000 years after the birth of Clirift, by looking for the even hundreds of any given year at the left hand v and for the reft to make up that year at the head of the table ; and where the Columns meet, ydu have the gold¬ en number (which is the fame both in old and new ftyle) for the given year. Thus, fuppofe the golden number was'wanted for the year 1769; look for 1700 at the left hand of the table, arid for 69 at the top of it ; then guiding your eye downward from 69 to over-againft 1700, you will find 3, which is the golden number for that year. But becaufe the lunar cycle: of 19 years fometimes in-; eludes five leap-years, and at other times only four, this table will fometimes vary a day from the truth in leap- years after February. And it is impoflible to have one more correct, unlefs we extend it to four times 19 or'76 years ; in which there are 19 leap-years without a re¬ mainder. But even then to have it of perpetual ufe, it muft be adapted to the old ftyle; becaufe, in every cen- turial year not divifible by 4, the regular courfe of leap- years is interrupted in the new ; as will be the cafe in the year 1800. The cycle of Eafter, alfo called the Dionyjian period, is a revolution of 532 years, found by multiplying the folar cycle 28 by the lunar cycle 19. If the new moons did not anticipate upon this cycle, Eafter-day would always be the Sunday next after the firft full moon, which fol¬ lows the 2 ift of March. But, on account of the above anticipation, to which no proper regard was had before the late alteration of the ftyle, the ecclefiaftic Eafter has feveral times been a week different from the true Eafter within this laft century: which inconvenience is now re¬ medied by making the table, which ufed to find Eafter for ever, in the Common Prayer Book, of no longer ufe than the lunar difference from the new ftyle will ad¬ mit of. The earlieft Eafter poffible is the 22d of March, the lateft the 23th of April. Within thefe limits are 33 days, and the number belonging to each of them is call¬ ed the number of direction ; becaufe thereby the time of Eafter is found for any given, year. The firft feven letters of, the, alphabet are commonly placed in the annual almanacks, to (hew on what days of the week the diys of the months fall throughout the year. And becaufe one of thofe feven letters muft ne- ceflarily ftand againft Sunday, it is printed in a capital form, and called the dominical letter: The other fix being inferred in fmall characters, to denote the other fix days of the Week. Now, fince a common Julian year contains 365 days, if this number be divided by 7"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"ASTRO (the number 6f days ia a week) there will remain one day. If there had been no remainder, it is plain the year would conftantly begin on the lame day of the week: but fince one remains, it is plain, that the year mull begin and end on the fame day of the week ; and therefore the next year will begin on the day follow¬ ing. Hence, when January begins on Sunday, A is the dominical or Sunday letter for that year: Then, becaufe the next year begins on Mond.ty, the Sunday will fall on the feventh day, to which is annexed the leventh let-* ter G, which therefore will be the dominical letter for all that year: and as the third year will begin on Tuef- day, the Sunday will fall on the fixth day; therefore F will be the Sunday letter for that year. Whence it is evident, that the Sunday letters will go annually in a retrograde or/ier thus, G, F, E, D, C, B, A< And,-ip the courfe of feven years, if they were all common ones, the fame days of the week and dominical letters would return to the fame days of the months. But becaufe there are 366 days in a leap-year, if this number be divided by 7, there will remain two days over and above the 52 weeks of which the year confifts. And therefore, if the leap-year begins on Sunday, it will end on Monday; and the next year will begin on Tuefday, the firft Sun¬ day whereof mult fall on the fixth of January* to which is annexed the letter F, and not G, as in common years. By this means, the leap-year returning every fourth year, the order of the dominical letters is interrupted; and the feries cannot return to its firft ftate till after four times feven, or 28 years ; and then the fame days of the months return in order to the fame days of the week as before. From the multiplication of the folar cycle of 28 years into the lunar cycle of 19 years, and the Roman indie* tion of-15 years, arifes the great Julian period, confift- ing of 7980 years, which had its beginning 764 years be¬ fore Strauchius’s fuppofed year of the creation -(for no later could all the three cycles begin together) and-it is not yet compleated : And therefore it includes all other cycles, periods, and aeras. There is but one year in the whole period that has the fame nnmbers for the three cycles of which it is made up: And therefore, if hifto- rians had remarked in their writings the cycles of each year, there had been no difpute about the time of any a&ion recorded by them. The Dionyfian or vulgar aera of Chrift’s birth was a- bout the end of the year of the Julian.period 4713 ; and coofequently the firft year of his age, according to that N O M Y. 493 account, was the 4714th year of the faid period. There¬ fore, if to the current year of Chrift we add 4713, the fum will be the year of the Julian period. So the year 1769 will be found to be the 6 ^ 3 2 d year Of that period. Or, to find the year of the Julian period anfwering to any given year before the firft year of Chrift, fubttadl the number of that given year from 4714, and the remainder will be the year of the Julian period Thus, the year 585 before the firft year of Chrift (which was the 584th before his birth) was the 4129th year of the faid period. Laftly, to find the cycles of the fun, moon, and indic¬ tion for any given year of this period, divide the given year by 28 t9, and 15; the three remainders will be the cycles fought, and the quotients the numbers of cycles run fince the beginning of the period. So in the above 4714th year of. the Julian period, the cycle of the fun was 10, the cycle of the moon 2, and the cycle of indic¬ tion 4; the folar cycle having run through 168 courfes, the lunar 248, and the indidtion 314. The vulgar aera of Chrill’s birth \\vas never fettled till the year 527, when Dionyfius Exiguus, a Roman abbot, fixed it to the end of the 4713th year of the Julian period, which was four years too late. For our Saviour was born before the death of Herod, who fought to kill him as foon as-he heard of his birth. And, according to •the teftimony of Jofephus (B. xvii. ch. 8.) there was an eclipfe of the moon in the time of Herod’s laft illnefs ; which eclipfe appears by our aftronomical tables to have been in the year of the Julian period 4710, March 13th, at 3 hours part midnight, at Jerufalem. Now, as our- Saviour muft have been born fome months before Herod’s death, fince in the-interval he was carried into Egypt, the lateft time ip which we can fix the true aera of his birth as about the end of the 4709th year of the Julian period. As there are certain fixed points in the heavens from which aftronomers begin their computations, fo there are certain points of time from which hiftorians begin to reckon; and thefe points or roots of time are called eeras or epochs. The moft remarkable aeras are, thofe of the Creation, the Greek Olympiads, the building of Rome, the aera of NabonafTar, the death of Alexander, the birth of Chrift, the Arabian Hegira, and the Perfian Jef- degird: All which, together with feveral others of lefs note, have their beginnings to the following table fixed to the years of the Julian period, to ’the age of the world at thofe times, and to the years before and after the year of Chritt’s birth.

Next, without the orbit of Venus, is the Earth, (No. 4.), which turns round its axis, to any fixed point at a great diftance, in 25 hours 56 minutes 4 feconds, of.mean folar time; but from the fun to the iun again, in 24 hours of the fame time. No. 6. is a fydereal dial plate under the earth, and No. 7. a folar dial-plate on the cover of the machine. The index of the former fhews fydereal, and of the latter, folar time ; and hence the former index gains one entire revolution on the latter every year, as 365 folar or natural days contain 366 fy¬ dereal days, or apparent revolutions of the liars. In the time that the earth makes 365^ diurnal rotations on its axis, it goes once round the fan in the plane of the eclipticand always keeps opposite to a moving index (No. 10.) which fhews the fun’s daily change of place, and alfo the days of the months. The earth is half covered with a black cap, for divi¬ ding the apparently enlightened half next the fun from the other half, which, when turned away from him, is in the dark. The edge of the cap reprefents the circle bounding light and darknefs, and fhews at what time the fun rifes and fets to all places throughout the year. The earth’s axis inclines 23^ degrees from the axis of the ec¬ liptic, the north pole inclines toward the beginning of Cancer, and keeps its parallelifm throughout its annual courfe; fo that in fummer the northern parts of the earth incline towards the fun, and in winter from him; by which means, the different lertgths of days and nights, and the caufe of the various feafons, are demonftrated to fight. There is a broad horizon, to the upper fide of which is fixed a meridian femicircle in the north and fouth points, graduated on both fides from the horizon to 90° in the zenith or vertical point. The edge of the horizon is graduated from the eaft and weft to the fouth and north points, and within: thefe divifions are the points of the compafs. From the lower fide of this thin horizon- plate ftand out four fmall wires, to which is fixed a twi¬ light-circle :3 degrees from the graduated fide of the horizon all round. This horizon may be put upon the earth, (when the cap is taken away), and redified to the latitude, of any place; and then, by a fmall wife called the ! ilar ray, which may be put on fo as to proceed di- re&ly from the fun’s centre towards the earth’s, but to come no Farther than almoft to touch the horizon. The beginning of twilight, time of fun-rifing, with his am¬ plitude, meridian altitude, time of fetting, amplitude then, and end of twilight, are fhewn for every day of the year, at that place to which the horizon is rectified. The Moon (No. 5.) goes round the earth, from be¬ tween it and any fixed point at a great diftance, in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes, or through all the figns and de¬ grees of her orbit, which-is called her periodical revolu¬ tion ; but (lie goes round from the fun to the fun. again, or from change to change, in 29 days 12 hours 45 mi¬ nutes, which is her fynodical revolution', and in that time file exhibits all the pbafes already defcribed. When the above mentioned horizon is rectified to the latitude of any given place, the times of the moon’s rl- fing and fetting, together with her amplitude, are fhewn to that place as well as the fun’s; P.nd all the various phenomena of the harveft-moon are made obvious to fight- The moon’s orbit (No. 9.) is inclined to the ecliptic, (No. 11.), one half being above, and the other below it. The nodes, or points at o and o, lie in the plane of the ecliptic, as before defcribed, and fhift back¬ ward through all its fines and degrees in 18 ^ years. The degrees of the moon’s latitude to the higheft at NL (north latitude) and loweft at SL, (fouth latitude), are engraven both ways from her nodes at o and o; and ay the moon rifes and falls iq her orbit according to its in¬ clination, her latitude and diftance from her nodes are Ihewn for every day, having firft rectified her orbit fo as to fet the nodes to their proper places in the ecliptic; and then, as they come about at different, and almoft oppofite times of the year, and then point towards the fun, all the eclipfes may be fhewn for hundreds of years, (without any new rectification), by turning the machinery backward for time paft, or forward for time to come. At 17 degrees diftance from each node, on both fides, is engraved a fmall fun; and at 12 degrees diftance, a fmall moon ; which fhew the limits of folar and lunar eclipfes: and when, at any change, the moon falls be¬ tween either of thefe funs and the node, the fun will be eclipfed on the day pointed to by the annual index, (No. 10.); and as the moon has then nortli or fouth la¬ titude, one may eafily judge whether that eclipfe will be vifible in the northern or fouthern hemifphere ;efpecially as the earth’s axis inclines toward the fun or from him at that time. And when, at any full, the moon falls between either of the little moons and node, fhe will he eclipfed, and the annual index fhews the day of that eclipfe. There is a circle of 294 equal parts (No. 8 . ) on the cover of the machine, on' which an index fhews the days of the moon’s age. There are two fertiicircLs (Plate XLVIII. fig. 1.) fix¬ ed t6 an elliptical ring, which being put like a cap upon the earth, and the forked part F upon the moon, fhews the tiu;s as the earth turns round within them, and they are led round it by the moon,. When the different places come to the femicircle AaEbB, they have tides of flood; and when they come to the femicircle CED, they have tides of ebb; the index on the hour-circle (No. 7. Plate XLVII.) fhewing the times of thefe phenomena. There is a jointed wire, of which one end being put into a hole in the upright Item that holds the earth’s cap, and the wire laid into a fmall forked piece which may be occafionally put upon Venus or Mercury, fhews the di¬ re# and retrograde motions of thefe two planets, with their ftaiionary times and places, as feen from the earth. The whole machinery is turned by a winch or handle, (No. 12.), and is fo eafily moved, that a clock might turn it without any danger of flopping. To give a plate of the whed-work of this machine, would anfwer no purpofe, becaufe many of the wheels lie fo behind others as to hide them from fight in any view whatever.

ABC is a wood¬ en bar, (in the box containing the wheel-wor^,' above which are the wheels D hnd E, and below it the elliptic plates FF and GG; each plate being fixed efti an axis in one of its focufes, at E and K ; and the w r heel E is fix¬ ed on the fame axis with the plate FF. Th^pffffatea have grooves round their edges precifely of equal djatneV' ters to one another, and in thefe grooves is thetcat-gut firing gg, gg croffing between the plates at h. On II, the axis of the handle or winch Win fig. 2. is an end- lefs ferew in fig. 3. working in the wheels D and E, whofe numbers of teeth being equal, and fhould be equal to the number of lines aS, bS, cS, See. in fig. 2. they turn round their axes in equal times to one another, and to the motion of the elliptic plates. For, the wheels D and E having equal numbers of teeth, the plate FF be¬ ing fixed on the fame axis with the wheel E, and the plate FF turning the equally big plate GG by a cat-gut firing round them both, they mull all go round their axes in as many turns of the handle N ai either of the wheels has teeth. It is cafy to fee, that the end b of the elliptical plate FF being farther from its axis E than the oppofite end I is, muft defcri.be a circle fo muclrthe larger in propor¬ tion, and therefore move through fo much more fpace in the fame time; and for that reafon the end h moves fo much falter than the end I, although it goe$ no fooner round the centre E. But then the quick-moving end h of the plate FF leads about the ihort end hK of the plate GG with the fame velocity-; and the flow-moving end / of the plate FF coming half round as to B, muft then lead the long end k of the plate GG as flowly about: fo that the elliptical plate FF and its axis E move uniformly and equally quick in every part of its revolution; but the. elliptical plate GG, together with its axis K, muft move very unequally in different parts of its revolution the-difference being always inverfely as the difiance of any point of the circumference of GG from its axis at K: or in other words, to iuftance in two points, if the diflance Kk be four, five, or fix times as great as the di- flance Kb, the point b will move in that pofition four, five, or fix times as faft as the point k does, when the plate GG has gone half round ; and fo on for any other excentricity or difference of the dirtances Kk and Kb. The tooth / on the plate FF falls in between the two teeth at k on the plate GG, by which means the revolu¬ tion of the latter is fo adjufted to that of the former, that they can never vary from one another.

The Improved Celestial Globe, (Plate XLIV. fig. 2 . ) . On the north pole of the axis, above the hour- circle, is fixed an arch MKH of 2^4 degrees; and at the end H is fixed an upright pin HG , which Hands di- redtly over the north pole of the ecliptic, and perpendi¬ cular to that part of the furface of the globe. On this pin are two moveable collets at D and H, to which are fixed the quadrantile wires N and 0, having two little balls on their ends for the fun and moon, as in the figure. The collet D is fixed to the circular plate F, whereon the 294 days of the moon’s age are engraven, beginning *juft under the fun’s wire N ; and as this wire is moved round the globe, the plate F turns round wish it. Thefe wires are eafily turned, if the fertw G be flackened; and when they are fet to their proper places, the ferew ferves to fix them there fo as in turning the ball of the globe, the wires with the fun and moon go round with it; and thefe two little balls rife and fet at the fame times, and on the fame points of the horizon, for the day to which they are rectified, as the fun and moon do in the heavens. Becaufe the moon keeps not her courfe in the ecliptic, (as the fun appears to do), but has a declination of 5-j- degrees on each fide from it in every lunation, her ball may be ferewed as many degrees to either fide of the ecliptic as her latitude or declination from the ecliptic amounts to at any given time; and for this purpofe S , Plate LT. fig. 2.

From this line, on the convex edge, are drawn the 54 degrees of -the moon’s latitude on both fides of the ecliptic; and when this piece is fet upright on the globe, its graduated edge reaches to the moon on the wire 0, by which means fhe is eafily adjufted to her latitude found by an ephemeris.

Having thus reflified the globe, turn it round, and oIj- ferve on what points of the horizon the fun and moon balls rife and fet, for thefe agree with the points of the compafs on which the fun and moon rife and fet in the heavens on the given day; and the hour-index fhews the times of their riling and fetting ; and likewife the time of the moon’s pafling over the meridian. This Ample apparatus fhews all the varieties that can happen in the rifing and fetting of the fun and moon.; and makes the fore-mentioned phenomena of the harveft- moon plain to the eye. It is alfo very ufeful in reading ledtures on the globes, becaufe a large company can fee this fun and moon go round, rifing above and fetting be¬ low the horizon at different times, according to the fea- fons of the year; and making their appulfes to different fi*ed flars. But in the ufual way, where there is only the places of the fun and moon in the ecliptic to keep the eye upon, they are eafily loH fight of, unlefs they be covered with patches. The Planetary Globe, (Plate XLIX. fig. 1.) In this machine, a terrcHrial globe is fixed on its axis Handing upright on the pedefial C D E, on which is an hour-circle, having its index fixed on the axis, which turns fomewhat tightly in the pedefial, fo that the globe may not be liable to fhake; to prevent which, the pede¬ fial is about two inches thick, and the axis gois quite through it, bearing on a fhonlder. The globe is hung in a graduated brazen meridian, much in the ufual way; and the thin plate N, NE, F. is a moveable horizon gra¬ duated round the outer edge, for fhewing the bearings and amplitudes of the fun, moon, and planets. The brafen meridian is grooved round the outer edge; and in this groove is a {lender femi-circle of brafs, the ends of which are fixed to the the horizon in its north and fouth points : this femi-circle Hides in the groove as the hori¬ zon is moved in reftifying it for different latitudes. To the middle of this femi-circle is fixed a pin, which always keeps in the zenith of the horizon, and on this pin the quadrant of altitude q turns; the lower end of which, in all pofitions, touches the horizon as it is moved round the fame. This quadrant is divided into 90 degrees from the horizon to the zenithal pin. on which it is turned, at 90. The great flat circle or plate AB is the„ecliptic,. on the outer edge of which the figns and degrees are laid down; and every fifth degree is drawn through the reftr of the furface of this plate towards its center. On this plate are feven grooves, to which feven little balls are adjufied by Aiding wires, fo that they are eafily moved in the grooves, without danger of ftarting them. The ball next the terreftrial globe is the moon, the next without it is Mercury, the next Venus, the next the fun, then Mars, then Jupiter, and lafily Saturn. This plate, or ecliptic, is fupported by four ftrong wires, ha¬ ving their lower ends fixed into the pedefial, at C D, E, the fourth being hid by the globe. The ecliptic is inclined 234 degrees to the pedefial, and. is therefore properly inclined to the axis of the globe which Hands upright on the pedefial. To rettify this t/iavhine.

Then lay a paper about four feet long under the pencils e and in, crofs-wife to the bar; which done, move the bar flowly round the axis g of the wheel T; and as the earth- E goes round the fun S, the moon M will go round the earth with a duly proportioned velocity; and the fridtion-wheel W running, on the floor, will keep the. bar from bearing too heavily on the pencils e and m, which will delineate the paths of the earth and moon..

The male mandrake has a very large, long, and thick root; it is largeft at the top or head, and from thence gradually grows fmaller. Sometimes it is fmgle and undivided to the bottom : but more frequent¬ ly it is divided into two, fometimes into three, or more parts. From this root there arife a number of very long leaves, broadeft in the middle, narrow to¬ wards the bafe, and obtulely pointed at the end ; they are of a foot or more in length, and five inches or thereabouts in breach ; they are of a dulky and difa- greeable green colour, and of a very foetid Imcll.

Authors have fpoken very largely and idly of the virtues of this plant. The molt common qua¬ lity attributed to it, is that of rendering barren wo¬ men fruitful: but we have no tolerable foundation for this : what we certainly know of it is,, that it has a fo- porific virtue like that of opium ; and the bark in fmall dofes, Herman allures us, has often been known to do great fervice in hyfteric complaints ; but it Ihould be. ufed fparingly, otherwife it will often bring, on con- vulfions, and many other mifehievous fymptoms.

None are admitted to aft without having ferved a clerkfhip for five years, taking the proper oath, being enrolled, and examined by the judges. The' attorney-general pleads within the bar.

If a flock of birds came about a man, it was a favour¬ able prefage; but the flight of vultures was unlucky.

For the fecond, fometimes called cheat-bread ba¬ king, it is thus: fome leaven (faved from a former batch) filled with fait, laid up to four, and at length diffolved in water, is ftrained through a cloth into a hole made in the middle of the heap of meal in the trough; then it is worked with fome of the flour into a moderate confiftence; this is covered up with meal, where it lies all night and in the morning the whole heap is ftirred up, and mixed with a little warm wa¬ ter, barm, and fait, by which it is feafoned, foftened, and brought to an even leaven: it is then kneaded, moulded, and baked, as before.

BATCHELOR, or Bachelor, a man who ftill con¬ tinues in the ftate of celibacy, or who was never mar¬ ried. Batchelor was anciently a denomination given to thofe ■ who had attained to knighthood, but had not a num¬ ber of vaflals fufficient to have their banner carried be¬ fore them in the field of battle ; or, if they were not of the order of bannerets, were not of age to difplay their own banner, but obliged to march to battle un¬ der another’s banner.

Be¬ fore a perfon can be admitted to this degree at Ox¬ ford, it is neceflary that he ftudy there four years ; three years more may intitle him to the degree of ma¬ tter of arts; and in feven years more he may commence batchelor of divinity. At Cambridge the degrees are ufually taken much the fame as at Oxford, excepting in law and phyfic, in either of which the batchelor’s de¬ gree may be taken in fix years.

BATH, a fuflicient quantity of water colleded in fome convenient receptacle, for people to walh in, either for health or pleafure. Baths are diftinguilhed into natural and artificial, and natural again into hot and cold. The chief hot baths in our country are thofe at Bath, near Wells, in Somenetfhire; and thofe at Buxton and Matlock in Derbyfliire. In the city of Bath are four hot baths: one trian¬ gular, called the crofs bath, the heat of which is more gentle than that of the reft, becaufe it has fewer fprings in it; the fecond is the hot bath, which was formerly much hotter than the reft, but it was then not fo large as at prefent: the other two are the King’s and Queen’s Bath, divided only by a wall; the laft having no fpring, but receives its water from the King’s Bath: each of Ttwiir; is fumifhed with a pump, to throw out the water upon the difeafed, where that is required. Thefe waters abound with a mineral fulphur; they are hot, of a bluilli colour, and ftrong fcentj they do not pafs through the body like moft other mineral wa¬ ters ; though if fait be added, they purge prefently. On fettlements, they afford a black mud, which is ufed by way of cataplafm in aches, and proves of more fer- vice to fome than the waters themfelves: The like theydepofite on diftillation, and no other: The cro r s- bath preys on filver, all of them on iron, but none on brafs. The ufe of thefe baths is found beneficial in disor¬ ders of the head, as palfies, tec. in cuticular difeafes, as leprofies, tec. obftrudions, and conftipations of the bowels, the fcurvy and ftone, and in moft difeafes of women and children •, they are ufed as a laft remedy in obftinate chronic difeafes, where they fucceed well, if they agree with the conftitution of the patient. Of the three hot European waters of note, viz. Aix- la-Chapelle, Bourbon, and Bath, the firft abounds more eminently in fulphur, which makes its heat, nau- feoufnefs, and purgative faculty fo great, that few fto- machs can bear it. The Bourbon are of a middle nature, between the Aix-la-Chapelle and the Bath waters ; being lefs hot, naufeous, and purgative than thofe of Aix-la-Chapellej but more fo than the Bath waters. Cold baths were by the ancients held in the greateft efteem; and though they were long banilhed out of medicine, the prefent age can boaft of abundance of noble cures performed by them, and fuch as were long attempted in vain by the moft powerful medicines. The cold bath\" 1 is, ferviceable in moft chronic difor- ders •, it always ads the part of a diuretic ; and will do more, efpecially plunging over head in fea-water, in the cure, of melancholy, madnefs, and particularly that occafined by the bite of a mad dog, than any other medicine. Van. I. No. 23, 3 529 ) BAT Artificial baths are various, according to the various occafions ; as aqueous baths, vaporous baths, dry baths, tec. Aqueous baths are made from common plants, and other emollient, refolvent, and nervine fubftances; confifting fometimes of milk and emollient herbs, with rofe-water, tec. when the defign is to humedate, or when it is only to cleanfe, it_confifts of bran and water alone ; and when it is for an exceflive pain or tumour, tec. in thefe cafes it confifts of a decodion of roots, plants, and fome fpirit of wine. In vapour-baths, the defign of which is to promote a perfpiration, the fteam or fume of fome decodion is received upon fome part of the body for that purpofe. In thefe baths there is no part of the patient’s body plunged into the decodion, only thofe parts which re¬ quire it are .properly difpofed to receive the fteams of fome proper fomentation. Of this kind are the bag¬ nios, where perfons are made to fweat by the heat of a room, and pouring on of hot water. Vapour-baths are of Angular fervice in cold diftem- pers, anafarca’s, oedematous tumours, paralytic cafes, fwellings of the tefticles, tec. Dry baths are made of allies, fait, fand, flireds of leather, tec. This bath is fuccefsful in provoking fweat in a plentiful manner, the patient being placed conveniently for the reception of the fumes : They are found ufeful in removing old obftinate pains, and are very effedual in venereal-complaints.

Bearing, in the fea language. When a ffiip fails to¬ wards the ffiore, before the wind, ffie is faid bear in with the land or harbour. To let the ffiip fail more before the wind, is to bear up. To put her right be¬ fore the wind, is to bear round. A ffiip that keeps off from the land, is faid to bear off. When a ffiip that was to windward comes under another (hip’s ftem, and fo gives her the wind, ffie is faid to bear under her lee, tec. There is another fenfe of this word, in re¬ ference to the burden of a ffiip; for they fay a ffiip bears, when having too (lender or lean a quarter, (he will fink too deep into the water with an over light freight, and thereby can carry but a fmall quantity of goods.

No perfon can be beatified till fifty years after death. All certificates or atteftations of virtues and miracles are examined before the congregation of rites: The exa¬ mination continues for feveral years, after which his ho- linefs decrees the beatification.

BEAUTY, in its native fignification, is appropriated to objects of fight. Objeds of the other lenfes may be agreeable, fuch as the founds of mufical inftruments, the finoothnefs and foftnefs of fome furfaces ; but the agreeablenefs called beauty belongs to objeds of fight. Objeds of fight are more complex than thofe of any other fenfe: In the Gmpleft, we perceive colour, fi¬ gure, length, breadth, thicknefs. A tree is compofed of a trunk branches, and leaves ; it has colour, figure, fize, and fometimes motion : By means of each of thefe. particulars, fegarately confidered, it appears beauti-"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"B E A ( 535 ) B E A ful; but a complex perception of the whole greatly augments the beauty of the objeft. The human body is a compofition of numberlels beauties arifing from the parts and qualities of the objeft, various colours, various motions, figures, lize, <bc. all united in one complex objeft, and finking the eye with combined foice. Hence it is, that beauty, a quality fo remark¬ able in vifible objefts, lends its name to every thing that is eminently agreeable. Thus, by a figure of fpeech, we fay, a beautiful found, a beautiful thought, a beautiful difeovrery, Confidering attentively the beauty of vifible objefts, two kinds are difeovered. The fird may be termed intrinfic beauty, becaufe it is difeovered in a fingle objeft, without relation to any other; the other may be termed relative, being founded- on the relation of objects. Intrinlic beauty is a perception of fenfe mere¬ ly ; for to. perceive the beauty of a fpreading oak, or of a flowing river, no more is required but fingly an a< 5 l of vifion. Relative beauty is accompanied with an aft of underftanding and refleftton ; for we perceive not the relative beauty of a fine inllrument or engine, until we learn its ufe and dellination. In a word, in¬ trinlic beauty is ultimate ; and relative beauty is that of means relating to fome good end or purpofe. Thefe different beauties agree in one capital circumdance, that both are equally perceived as belonging to the ob- jeft; which will be readily admitted with refpeft to intrinftc beauty, \"but is not fo obvious with refpeft to the other. The utility of the plough, for example, may make an objeft of admiration or of defire; but why Ihould utility make it beautiful ? A natural pro- penfity of the human mind will explain this difficulty : By an eafy tranfition of ideas, the beauty of the effeft is transferred to the caufe, and is perceived as one of the qualities of the caufe : Thus a fubjeft void of in- trinfic beauty, appears beautiful by its utility; a dwelling-houfe Void of all regularity, is however beau¬ tiful in the view of convenience . and the want of fym- metry in a tree, will not prevent its appearing beauti¬ ful, if it be known to produce good fruit.. When thefe two beauties concur in any objeft, it appears delightful. Every member of the human body poffeffes both in a high degree. The beauty of utility, being accurately proportioned to the degree of utility, requires no illudration: But intrinfic beauty being more complex, cannot be handled didinftly without being analyfed. If a tree be beaur tiful by means of its colour, figure, motion, fize, «$rc. it is in reality pofleffed of fo many different beauties. The beauty of colour is too familiar to need explana¬ tion. The beauty of figure is more; for example, t'iewing any body as a whole, the beauty of its figure arifes from regularity and fimplicity; viewing the parts with relation to each other, uniformity, proportion, and order, contribute to its beauty. The beauties- of grandeur and motion mull be confidered feparately. See Grandeur, and Motion. We fhall here make a few obfervations on fimplicity, which may be of ufe in examining the beauty of fingle objefts. A multitude o£ objefts crowding into the mind at once, didurb the attention, and pafs without making any lading impreffion : In the fame manner, even a fingle objeft, confiding of a multiplicity of parts, e- quals not, in drength of impreffion, a more fimple ob¬ jeft comprehended in one view. This judifies fimplicity in works of art, as oppofed to complicated circumdances and crowded ornaments. It would be endlefs to enumerate the effefts that are produced by the various combinations of the principles of beauty A few examples will be fufficient to give the reader fome idea of this fubjeft. A circle and a fquare are each perfectly regular; a fquare, however, is lefs beautiful than a circle; and the reafon is, that the attention is divided among the fides and angles of a fquare; whereas the circumference of a circle, being a jingle objeft, makes one entire impreffion: And thus fimplicity contributes to beauty. For the fame reafon, a fquare is more beautiful than a hexagon or oftagon. A Iquare is likewile more beautiful than a parallelogram, becaufe it is more regular and uniform. But this holds with refpeft to intrinfic beauty only; for in many in¬ dances, as in the doors and windows of a dwelling-houfe, utility turns the feales on the fide of the parallelogram. Again, a parallelogram depends, for its beauty, on the proportion of its fides: A great inequality of its fides annihilates its beauty: Approximation toward e- quality hath the fame effeft; for proportion there dege¬ nerates into imperfeft uniformity, and the figure appears an unfuccefsful attempt toward a fquare. And hence proportion contributes to beauty. An equilateral triangle yields not-to a fquare in regu¬ larity nor in uniformity, of parts, and it is more fimple. But an equilateral triangle is lefs beautiful than a fquare; which mult be owing to inferiority of order in the pofition of its parts; the order arifing from the_equal inclination of the fides of fuch an angle, is more obfeure than the parallelifm of the fides of a fquare. And hence order contributes to beauty not lefs than fimplicity, regularity, or proportion. Uniformity- is Angular in one circnmdance, that it is apt to difgud by excefsi A number of things dedined for the lame ufe, as windows, chairs, drrv cannot be too uniform. But a fcrupulous uniformity of parts in. a large garden or field, is far from being agreeable.. In all the works of nature, fimplicity makes a capital figure It alfo makes a figure in works of art: Profufe ornament in painting, gardening, or architefture, as well as in drefs or in language, (hows a mean or corrupted tade. Simplicity in behaviour and manners has an> inebanting effeft, and never fails to gain our affeftion. Very dif¬ ferent are the artificial manners of modern times. A gradual progrefs from fimplicity to complex forms and profufe ornament, feems to be the fate of all the fine arts; refembling behaviour, which from original candor and fimplicity, has degenerated into duplicity of heart and artificial refinements. At prefent literary produc¬ tions are crowded with words, epithets, figures: In mu- fic, fentiment is neglefted for the luxury of harmony, . and for difficult movement. With regard to the final caufe of beauty, one thing is- evident, that our relilh of regularity, uniformity, pro¬ portion."},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"B E C ( 536 ) BED portion, order, andfimplicity contributes greatly to en¬ hance the beauty of the objects that furround us, and of courfe tends to our happinefs. We may be con¬ firmed in this thought, upon reflecting, that our tafte for thefe particulars is not accidental, but uniform and univerfal, making a branch of our nature. At the fame time, regularity, uniformity, order, and fim- plicity, contribute, each of them, to readinefs of ap- prehenfion, and enable us to form more diftinCt ideas of objects than can be done where thefe particulars are wanting. In fome inftances, as in animals, propor¬ tion is evidently connected with utility, and is the more agreeable on that account. Beauty, in many inftances, promotes induftry, and as it is frequently connected with utility, it proves an additional incitement to enrich our fields and improve our manufactures. Thefe, however, are but flight efiFeCts, compared with the connections that are form¬ ed among individuals in fociety by means of beauty. The qualifications of the head and heart are undoubt¬ edly the moft folid and moft permanent foundations of fucli connections : But, as external beauty lies more in view, and is more obvious to the bulk of mankind than the qualities now mentioned, the fenfe of beauty has a more extenfive influence in forming thefe con¬ nections. At any rate, it concurs in an eminent degree with mental qualifications, in producing focial inter- courfe, mutual good-will, and confequently mutual aid and fupport, which are the life of fociety. It mud not however be overlooked, that the fenfe of beauty does not tend to advance the interefts of fociety, but when in a due mean with refpeCt to ftrength. Love, in par¬ ticular, arifing from a fenfe of beauty, lofes, when exceflive, its focial character ; the appetite for gratifi¬ cation, prevailing over affeCtion for the beloved ob¬ ject, is ungovernable, and tends violently to its end, regardlefs of the mifery that muft follow. Love, in this ftate, is no longer a fweet agreeable paflion ; it becomes painful, like hunger or third, and produceth no happinefs, but in the inftant of fruition. This fug- gefts an important leffon, that moderation in our de¬ fires and appetites, which fits us for doing our duty, contributes at the fame time the moft to happinefs; even focial paffions, when moderate, are more plea- fant than when they fwell beyond proper bounds. Beauty, in architecture, painting, and other arts, is the harmony and juftnefs of the whole compofition taken together.

The beryl, like moft other gems, is met with both in the pebble and columnar form, but in the latter moft frequently. In the pebble form it ufually ap¬ pears of a roundilh but flatted figure, and commonly full of fmall flat faces, irregularly difpofed. In the columnar or cryftalline form it always confifts of hex- angular columns, terminated by hexangular pyramids. It never receives any admixture of colour into it, nor lofes the blue and green, but has its genuine tinge in the degrees from a very deep and dufky to the paleft imaginable of the hue of fea- water. The beryl, in its perfect ftate, approaches to the hardnefs of the granet, but it is often fofter; and its fize is from that of a fmall tare to that of a pea, a a horfe-bean, or even a walnut.

It is compofed of concentrical coats fur round¬ ing each other, with a fmall cavity in the middle, con¬ taining a bit of wood, ttraw, hair, or the like fub- ftances. There are two kinds of bezoar. The firtt, which is brought from Perfia and the Eaft Indies, is found in the ftomach of the capra bezoardica, and efteemed by phyficians to be the beft. It is called oriental bezoar , and is of a lhining dark-green or olive-colour, arid has an even fmooth furface. On removing the outer coat, that which lies underneath is likewife fmooth and fhi- ning. It is generally lefs than a walnut. The fecond kind, called occidental bezoar, is brought from the Spanilh Weft Indies, has a rough furface, and lefs of a green colour than the oriental.. It is likewife much heavier, more brittle, and of a loofer texture; the coats are thicker, and, on break¬ ing, exhibits a n’tmber of ftriae curioufly interwoven. The occidental is generally larger than a walnut, and fometimes as big as a goofe-egg. The great value of this ftone in Perfia and the Eaft, and the little ufe it is found to be of in Europe, has made many fufpeit that the true kind is never brought to us. Many .of them are indeed evidently made by . art. The ufual mark to diftinguifh its being of a good quality, is its ftriking a deep green colour on white paper that has been rubbed with chalk. But it is of little importance to fay much on this fubjedt. The ftone is nothing more than a morbid concretion, much of the fame nature with the human calculus, of no fmell or tafte, indigeftible in the ftomach of the animal in which it is found, and fcarce capable of being ailed upon by any of the juices of the human body ; and, notwithftanding its many boafted virtues, it cannot be confidered in any other light than as an abforbent of the weakeft kind..

BIBLE, a name applied by Chriftians, by way of emi¬ nence or diftindtion, to the collection of facred wri¬ tings, or the holy fcriptures of the Old and New Te¬ ftament ; known alfo by various other appellations, as, the Sacred Books, Holy Writ, Infpired Writings, Scriptures, <bc. Tire Jews (tiled the Bible (that is, the Old Teftament) Mira, which fignifies Lejfon, or Ledurct . This collection of the facred writings, containing thofe of the Old and New-Teftament, is juftly looked upon as the foundation of the Jewifli as well as the Chviftian religion. The Jews, it is true, acknow¬ ledge only the fcriptures of the Old Teftament, the correcting and publiftiing of which is unanimoufly a- feribed, both by the Jews and Chriftians, to Ezra. Some of the ancient fathers, on no other founda¬ tion than that fabulous and apocryphal book, the fe- cond book of Efdras, pretend, that the fcriptures were entirely loft and deftroyed at the Babylonifh captivity, and that Ezra reftored them all again by divine revelation. What is certain is, that in the reign of Jofiah there was no other book of the law extant befides that found in the temple by Hilkiah; from which original, by order of that pious king, copies were immediately written out, and fearch made for all the other parts of the fcriptures, (2 Kings xxii.); by which means copies of the whole became multiplied among the people, who carried them with them into their captivity. After the return of the Jews from the Babylonifh captivity, Ezra got toge¬ ther as many copies as he could of the Sacred wai¬ tings, and out of them all prepared a correCt edition, difpofing the feveral books in their proper order, and fettling the canon of feripture for his time. Thefe books he divided into three parts. 1. The Law. 2. The Prophets. 3. ^he Cettibim, or Hagiogra- phia, i. e. The holy •writings. I. The Law contains, 1. Genefis. 2. Exodus. 3. Leviticus. 4. Numbers. 5. Deuteronomy. II The writings of the Prophets are, 1. Jolhua. 2. Judges, with Ruth. 3. Samuel. 4. Kings, j. I- faiah. 6. Jeremiah, with his Lamentations; 7. E- zekiel. 8. Daniel. 9. The twelve, minor Pro¬ phets. 10. Job. 11. Ezra. 12. Nehemiah. 13. Efther. III. And the Hagiographia confifts of, 1. The Pfalms. 2. The Proverbs. 3. Ecclefiaftes. 4. The Song of Solomon. This divifion was made for the fake of reducing- the number of the facred books to the number of the letters in their alphabet, which amount to twenty-two At prefent, the Jews reckon twenty-four books in their canon of feripture, in dif¬ pofing of which the law ftands as it did in the former, divifion, and the prophets are diftributed into the for¬ mer and latter prophets. The former prophets are, Jolhua, Judges, Samuel, Kings. Vol. I. Numb. 23. The latter prophets are, Ifaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. And the-hagiographia confift of, The Pfalms, the Proverbs, Job, the Song of Solomon, Ruth, the Lamentations, Ecclefiaftes, Efther, Daniel, Ezra, the Chronicles. Under the name of Ezra, they comprehend Nehe¬ miah. It is true this order hath not always been obfer- ved, but the variations from it are of little or no moment. The five books pf the law are divided into fifty-four feftio'ns. This divifion many of the Jews hold to have been appointed by Mofes himfelf; but others, with more probability, aferibe it to Ezra, The defign of this di¬ vifion was, that one of thefe fc&ions might be read in their fynagogues every fabbath-day. The number was 54, becaule in their intercalated years, a month being then added, there were 54 fabbaths. In other years, they reduced them to 52, by twice joining together two Ihort fe&ions. Till the perfecution of Antiochus Epi- phanes, they read only the law; but the reading of it be¬ ing then prohibited, they fubftituted in the room of it 54 fe&ions oufr of the Prophets; and when the reading of the law was reftored by the Maccabees, the fedtion which was read every fabbath out of the law, fervedfor their firft lelfon, and the fedlion out of the prophets for their fecond. Thefe fe&ions were divided into verfes, of which divifion, if Ezra was not the author, it was intro-< duced not long after him, and feems to have been defigned for the ufe of the Targumifts, or Chaldee interpreters; for after the return of the Jews from the Babylonilh cap¬ tivity, when the Hebrew language had ceafed to be their mother tongue, and the Chaldee grew into ufe inftead of it, the cuftom was, that the law fhould be firft read in the original Hebrew, and then interpreted to the peo¬ ple in the Chaldee language, for which purpofe thefe fhorter fedtions or periods were very convenient. The divifion of the fcriptures into chapters, as we at prefent have them, is of much later date. Some attri¬ bute it to Stephen Langton, archbilhop of Canterbury, in the reigns of John and Henry III. But the true au¬ thor of the invention was Hugo de Sandto Caro, com¬ monly called Hugo Cardinalis, becaufe he was the firft Dominican that ever was railed to the degree of cardi¬ nal. This Hugo flourilhed about the year 1240. He wrote a comment on the fcriptures, and projected the firft concordance, which is that of the vulgar Latin Bi¬ ble. The aim of this work being for the more eafy find¬ ing out any word or paflage in the fcriptures, he foiind it neceflary to divide the book into fictions, and the Ac¬ tions into fubdivifions ; for till that time the vulgar La¬ tin Bibles were without any divifion at all. Theie fec- tions are the chapters into which the Bible hath ever fince been divided. But the fubdivjfion of, the chaoters was not then into verfes. as it is now. Hugo’s method of fubdividing them was by the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, placed in the margin at an equal diftance from each other, according to the length - o f the chapters. The fubdivi- fion of the chapters into verfes, as they now ftand in our Bibles, had irs original from a famous Jewiih rabhi, na¬ med Mordecai Nathan, about the year 1445. This rab¬ bi, in imitation of Hugo Cardinalis, drew up a concord- 6 Y ance 3"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"BIB ( 54« ) ance to the Hebrew Bible, for the life of the Jews. But though he followed Hugo in his divifion of the books into chapters, he refined upon his invention as to the fub- divifion, and contrived that by verfes: this being found to be a much more convenient method, it has been ever fince followed. And thus, as the Jews borrowed the divifion of the books of the holy fcriptures into chapters from the Chriftians, in like manner the Chriftians bor¬ rowed that of the chapters into verfes from the Jews. The order and divifion of the books of the Bible, as well of the Old as the New Teftament, according to the difpofition made by the council of Trent, by decree I. feflion iv, are as follow; where we are to obferve, that thofe books to which the afterifms are prefixed, are re¬ jected by the Proteftants, as apocryphal.

The books which are now loft, and cited in the Old Teftament, are thefe, the book of the Righteous, or of Jaftier, as our verfion of the Bible has it, (Jolh. x. 13. and 2 Sam. i. 18.); the book of the wars of the Lord, (Numb. xxi. 14.) ; the annals of the kings of Ifrael, fo of¬ ten cited in the books of the Kings and Chronicles. The authors of thefe annals were the prophets, who lived in the kingdoms of Judah and Ifrael. We have likewife but a part of Solomon’s three thoufand proverbs, and his thoufand and five fongs, (1 Kings iv. 32.); and we have entirely loft what he wrote upon plants, animals, birds, fifties, and reptiles. Ezra; in the opinion of moft learned men, publifhed the fcriptures in the Chaldee character: For that lan¬ guage being grown wholly into ufe among the Jeifrs, he thought proper to change the old Hebrew characfter for it, which hath fince that time been retained only by the Samaritans, among whom it is preferved to this day. Prideaux"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"BIB ( 547 ) BIB Prideaux is of opinion that Ezra made additions in feveral parts of the Bible, where any thing appeared ne- ceflary for illuftrating, connedling, or compleating the work; in which he appears to have been aflifted by the fame fpirit in which they were firft written. Among fuch addi- tions'are to be reckoned the laft chapter of Deuteronomy, wherein Mofes feems to give an account of his own death and burial, and the fucceffion of Jofhua after him. To the fame caufe our learned author thinks are to be attri¬ buted many other interpolations in the Bible, which cre¬ ated difficulties and objections to the authenticity of the facred text, no ways to be folved without allowing them; Ezra changed the names of feveral places which were grown obfolete, and inftead of them put their new names, by which they were then called, in the text. Thus it is that Abraham is faid to have purfued the kings who car¬ ried Lot away captive, as far as Dan; whereas that place in Mofes’s time was called Laiffi; the name Dan, being unknown, till the Danites, long after the death of Mofes, poffelTed themfelves of it. The Jewiffi canon of feripture was then fettled by Ezra, yet not fo but that feveral variations have been made in it. Malachi, for inftance, could not be put in the Bible by him, fince that prophet is allowed to have lived after Ezra ; nor could Nehemiah be there, fince mention is made, in that book, of Jaddus. as high-prieft, and of Darius CodomannuS, as king ofPerfia, who were at lead an hundred years later than Ezra. It may be added, that jn the firft book of Chronieles, the genealogy of the fons of Zerubbabel is carried down for fo many ge¬ nerations as mull necelfarily bring it to the time of Alex¬ ander, and confequently this book could not be in the ca¬ non in Ezra’s days. It is probable, the two books of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Either, and Malachi, were adopted into the Bible in the time of Simon the Juft, the laft of the men of the great fynagogue. As the Jews were very backward in having any inter- courfe with ftrangers, it was a long time before their facred books came to be known and read in other nations. Jo fephus aferibes the little that is faid of the Jews by pa¬ gan writers to this, that the latter had no opportunity of being acquainted with their hiftorians, for want of a tranflation of their books into the Greek language. A- rifteas indeed pretends, that there was an intperfeCI ver- fion of the feriptures before the time of Demetrius Pha- Jereus; and that Theoponipus intending to infert a part of them in his verfes, was deprived of his underftanding.; but of this there is no proof. The Jews, upon their return from the Babylonifh cap¬ tivity, having brought with them their Chaldaic or Ally- rian language, which from that time became their mother- tongue, gave birth to the Chaldee tranftations, or rather, paraphrases of the Bible,.called Targttm. See Targum. Greek Bible. It is a matter of difpute among authors, whether there was a Greek verfion of the OldTeftament more ancient than the Septuagint. See Septuagint. Before our Saviour’s time, there Was no other Greek veriion of the Old Teftament, befidcs that which went under the name of the Septuagint: But after the efta- bliffiment of Chriftianity, fome authors undertook new tranftations, under pretence of making them more con¬ formable to the Hebrew text. The firft who performed this defign was the jewiffi profelyte Aquila, of the ci . of Synope inPontus, diieiple tollabbi Akiba, who put it in ex¬ ecution the twelfth year of the emperor Adrian, A . D. 128. St Epiphanius pretends, that being excommunieated af¬ ter his converlion, for addicting himfelf to judicial aftro- logy, he fet about this verfion out of hatred to the Chri- ftians, and with a wicked defign of corrupting the pafla- ges of the prophets relating to Jefus Chrift. St Jerom fays, his verfion is made word for word, and with too fcrupulous a nicety. The fecoud Greek verfion after the Septuagint is that of Symmachus, a Samaritan by birth, who firft turned Jew, then Chriftian, and at laft Ebionite, He compo- fed it, according to Epiphanius, in the reign of the em¬ peror Severus. His verfion was more free than the reft; for he applied himfelf chiefly to the fenfe, without t> anf- lating word for word; wherefore his verfion comes near¬ er the Septuagint than that of Aquila. The third Greek verfion is that of Theodotion of Ephefus. It is faid he was a difciple of Marcion, and that, having had fome difference with thofe of his fc&, he turned Jew. The verfion of this author was the beft of the three, becaufe he kept a juft medium between Aquila and Symmachus, not confining himfelf fo fervilely to the letter as the firft did, nor wandering fo far from it as the fecond did. There were, befides thefe, three other Greek verfions,. whofe authors are unknown. Syriac Bible.. The Syrians have in their language a verfion of the Old Teftament, which they pretend to be of great antiquity. A great part of it,. they fay, was made in Solomon’s time, and the reft in the time of Ab- garus king of Edefla. They relate, that Hiram king of Tyre defired Solomon to communicate the ufe of let¬ ters and writing to the Syrians, and to get tranflated for them the facred books of the Hebrews; whieh Solomon complied with, and fent them the Pentateuch, Jofhua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Pfalms, Proverbs, Ecclefiaftes,. Solomon’s Song, and Job, which were the only books then extant; the remaining books of feripture, they add,. were tranflated into Syriac after the death of Chrift, by the care of Abgarus king of Edefla. But this account is looked up'on as fabulous. It is true, the Syriae verfion which we have now mull: be very ancient, fince it is often cited by the fathers. Dr Prideaux is of opinion, it was made within the firft century; that the author of it was fome Chriftian of the Jewiffi nation ; and that it is the beft tranflation of the Old Teftament. This verfion is not always agreeable to the original; but in fome places is more conformable to the Samaritan Pentateuch, and in fome to the verfion of the Septuagint. In the Pfalms, . the tranflator has taken the liberty to leave out the an¬ cient titles aBd inferiptions of each pfalm,- inftead of which he gives an abftraiff: of the contents of .each pfalm, Latin Bible. It,is paft difpute, that the Latin churches had, evemin the firft ages, a tranflation of the Bible in their language, which being the vulgar Ln- guage, and confequently underftood by every one, occa- fioned a vaft number of Latin verfions. Among all thefe, there was one which was generally received, and called by St Jerom the vulgar, or common tranflation. St Au- ftin •"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"BIB ( 548 ) BIB 'ftin gives this verfion the name of the Italic, and prefers it to ali the reft: But we rcferve a diftinft article for this verfion. See Vulgate. St Jeroni undertook to revife and correCt the Latin verfion of the Bible ; but, having afterwards attained to a more perfect knowledge of the Hebrew language, he fet about a new tranflation of fome books of the Old Tefta- ment from the Hebrew; and continuing, at the folicita- tion of his friends, to tranflate the reft, he at laft per¬ fected an entire new verfion of all the books contained in the Hebrew canon. In his tranflation, he followed, as nearly as he could, the verfion of the Septuagint, and retained the very expreflions of the ancient vulgar Latin, as far as was confiftcnt with purity of ftyle and true Lati? nity. This tranflation was fo highly applauded by the Chriftian church, that fome authors have pretended it was brought to perfection by the infpiration of the Holy Ghoft. But St Auguftine looked upon the author to be fo well lkilled in the Hebrew language, as to be able to undertake, and bring to perfection fuch a work by the ftrength of his own abilities. St Jerom’s verfion was foon received in many churches ; and in the fixth centu¬ ry it became as general, and in as great elleem, as the ancient Vulgate. It was not till the fixteenth .century that any new La¬ tin tranflations were made of the Bible from the Hebrew text. SanCtes Pagninus, a Dominican monk, was the firft who undertook a new verfion of the books of ferip- ture from the modern Hebrew text. His defign Was encouraged by pope Leo X.; and his verfion made its firft appearance at Lyons in the year 1527. It adheres too fcrupuloufly to the words of the text, which makes it obfeure, and favour of barbarity in many places. He is likewile often milled as to the fenfe, having affeCted too much to follow the explications of the Jewiih Rab¬ bins. It is however a very ufeful work, and very pro¬ per to explain the literal fenfe of the Hebrew text. A- rias Montanus, when he compiled the edition of the Biblia Polyglotta , revifed this tranflation of Pagninus. Cardinal Cajetan, though not verfed in the Hebrew, undertook a tianflation of fome parts of the Bible by the afliftance of two perfons well (killed in that language, the one a Jew, the other a Chriftian. After him Ifidore Clarius, a monk of Mount Caflin, fet himfelf to reform the vulgJr verfion of the Bible after the Hebrew text; in the doing .of which he pretends to have corrected above eight thoufand paffages of the Bible. Befides thefe tranf¬ lations, made by catholic authors, there are fome likewife performed by proteftant tranflators •, the firft of whom was Sebaftian Munfter. His verfion is more intelligible, and in much better Latin, than that of Pagninus. Hue- tius bellows on him the character of a tranllator well verfed in the Hebrew, and whofe ftyle is very exaCt and comformable to the original. The tranflation of Leo Juda, a Zuinglian, printed at Zurich in 1543, and after¬ wards by Robert Stephens in I545 f is written in a more elegant ftyle than that of Munfter; but he often departs from the literal meaning of the Hebrew text for the fake of an elegant Latin expreflion. However, in this he has not taken fo great a liberty as Sebaftian Caftalio, who undertook to give the world an elegant Latin verfion of the Bible : But there are critics who cenfure him for de¬ parting from the noble fimplicity and natural grandeur of the original, and deviating into an affeCted effeminate ftyle, overcharged with falfe rhetoric, and not always true Latinity. The verfion of Junius and Tremellius, has much more of the true natural fimplicity: The chief Hebnfiftns are preferved in it, and the whole is ftriCtly conformable to the Hebrew text. We mull not forget the verfion of Theodore Beza, a proteftant divine of Ge¬ neva, in the fixteenth century. Sebaftian Caftalio found fault with this verfion, and Bcza wrote an apology for it about the year 1564. Arabic Bible. The Arabic verfions of the Bible are of two forts; the one done by Chriftians, the other by Jews. There is one of the Old Teftament, whofe author is fuppofed to be Saadias Gaon, a Jew of Baby¬ lon, who wrote the fame about the year of Chrill 900. Of this whole work the Pentateuch alone is printed. The Jews have another Arabic verfion in Hebrew charac¬ ters, which Erpenius publilhed in Arabic characters at Leyden in the year 1622. Among the Arabic tranfla¬ tions done by Chriftians, there is one printed in the po¬ lyglots of Paris and London ; but both the author, and the time when it was written, are unknown. It mull have been made fince the publication of the Koran, be- caufe the author, in many places, has evidently followed it. In this verfion the Pentateuch is tranflated from the Hebrew text; Job, from the Syriac; and the reft from the Septuagint, and two other verfions of the Pentateuch, the manuferipts of which are in the Bodleian library. There are alfo fome Arabic tranflations of - the Pfalms; one printed at Genoa in 1516, the other at Rome in 1619 : And there is a manufeript verfion of the prophets in this language preferved in the Bodleian library. The gofpel being preached in all nations, there is no doubt, but that the Bible, which Ts the foundation cf the Chriftian religion, was tranflated into the refpeCtive languages of each nation. St Chryfoftom and Theodo- ret both teftify, that the books of .the Old and New Te- ftainent had been tranflated into the Syrian, Egyptian, Indian, Perfian, Armenian, iEthiopic, Scythian, and Samaritan languages. Socrates and Sozomen tell us, that Ulphilas bilhop of the Goths, who lived about the middle of the fourth century, had tranflated the holy feriptures into the Gothic language ; and pope John VIII. gave his approbation to the verfion of the holy feriptures made into the Sclavonian. Mthiopic Bible. The iEthiopic verfion of the Old Teftament is made immediately from the Greek text of the Septuagint; and'there is a very plain agreement be¬ tween this tranflation and the Alexandrian' manufeript : The order of the chapters, the inferiptions of the Pfalms, and every thing elfe being exaCtly alike. The ^Ethio¬ pians attribute this verfion to Frumentius, the apollle of ./Ethiopia, fent thither by Athanafius bilhop of Alexan¬ dria. Coptic or Egyptian Bible. The Coptic or Egyptian tranflation is likewife made from the Greek of the Sep¬ tuagint, in which the Egyptian tranllator fo punctually followed the Greek text, that he refilled to m..ke ufe of the labours of Origen and others, who had been at the pains"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"• BIB ( 549 ) BIB pains to compare the Greek verfion with the Hebrew text. We are quite in the dark as to the author and the time of this verfion, but probably it is very ancient, fmce we cannot fuppofe the Egyptian church was long without a tranflation of the fcriptures in their mother tongue. Perftan and Turkifh Bible. There are feveral ver- fions of the Bible in the Pcrfian language, mod of which are in manufcript. There is a tranflation of the Pfalms by one father John, a Carmelite; and another of the fame book done from the Latin by the Jefuits. Wal¬ ton, in the London Polyglott, has publifhed the Gofpels, tranflated by one Simon the fon of Jofeph, a Chriftian of Perfia, who lived in the year 1341. We have likewife fome manufcript tranflations of the Bible in the Turkifh language, particularly a verfion of tlte New Teftament pr nted at London in the year 1666. Armenian and Georgian Bible. The Armenians have an old tranflation of the fcriptures in their language, taken from the Greek of the Septuagint. Three learned Armenians were employed about it, in the time of the emperor Arcadius, viz. Mofes firnamed the Grammarian, David the Philosopher, and Mampneus. The Arme¬ nians, in 1666, procured an edition of the Bible in their language to be made at Amfterdam, under the direction of an Armenian bilhop. Another was printed at Ant¬ werp in 1670, by the procurement ofTheodorusPatraeus, and the New Teftament feparately in 1668. The Georgians have likewife a tranflation of the Bible in the old Georgian language: But as this language is known only to a very few perfons, and the people of the country are extremely ignorant, there is fcarce any one who either reads or underftands this verfion. Whilft the Roman empire fubfifted in Europe, the read¬ ing of the fcriptures in the Latin tongne, which was the univerfal language of that empire, prevailed every where. But fince the face of affairs in Europe has been changed, and fo many different monarchies erected upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the Latin tongue has by degrees grown into difufe ; whence has arifen a neceflity of tranf- lating the Bible into the refpeftive languages of each people ; and this has produced as many different verfions of the fcriptures in the modern languages, as there are different nations profefiing the Chriftian religion. Hence we meet with French, Italian, Spanifh, German, Fle- rnifii, Danifn, Sclavonian, Polilh, Bohemian, and Ruf¬ fian or Mufcovite Bibles; befides the Anglo-Saxon and modern Englilh and Irith Bibles. French B'ble. The oldeft French Bible we hear of is the verfion of Peter de Vaux,~ chief of the Waldenfes, who lived about the year 1.160. Raoul de Prefle trarif- lated the Bible into French in the reign of Charles V. king of France, about the year 1380. Befides thefe, there are feveral old French tranflations of particular parts of the feripture. The doctors of Louvain pub¬ lifhed the Bible in French at Louvain, by order of the emperor Charles V. in 1550. There is a verfion by Ifaac le Maitre de Sacy, publifhed in 1672, with ex¬ planations of the literal and fpiritual meaning of the text, which was received with wonderful applaufe, and has been often reprinted. As to the New Teftaments in Vol. I. No. 23. ^ French, which have been printed feparately, one of the moft remarkable is that of F. Amelottc of the oratory, compofed by the diredUon of fome French prelates, and printed with annotations in the year 1666, 1667, and 1670. The author pretends he had been at the pains to fearch all the libraries in Europe, and collate the oldelfc manuferipts. ‘ But, in examining his work, it appears that he has produced no confiderable various readings, which- had not before been taken notice of either in the London Polyglott or elfewhere. The New Teftament of Mons printed in 1665, with the archbifhop of Capibray’s permiflion, and the king of Spain’s licence, made a great noife in the world. It was condemned by pope Clement IX. in 1668, and by pope innocent XI. in 1679, and in feveral bifhopiics of France at lcveral times. The New Teftament publifhed at Trevoux in 1702, by M. Simon, with literal and critical annotations Upon diffi¬ cult paffages, was condemned by the bifitops of Paris and Meaux in 1702. F, Bohours, a Jefuit, with the afiiftance of F. F. Michael Tellier, and Peter Bernier, Jefuits likew'ife, publifhed a tranflation of the New Te¬ ftament in 1697: But this tranflation is, for the moft part, harih and obfeure, which was owing to the au-. thor’s keeping too ftridlly to the Latin text from 'which he tranflated. There are likewife French tranflations publifhed by Proteftant authors ; one by Robert Peter Olivetan, printed at Geneva in 1535, and fince often reprinted with the cor¬ rections of John Calvin and others; another by Sebaftian Caftalio, remarkable for particular ways of expreffion never ufed .by good judges of the language. John Diodati likewife publifhed a French Bible at Geneva in 1644; but fome find fault with his method, in that he rather paraphrafes the text than tranflates it. Faber Stapalenfis tranflated die New Teftament into French, which was revifed and accommodated to the ufe of the reformed churches in Piedmont, and printed in 1534. Laftly, M. John LeClerc publifhed a New Teftament in French at Amfterdam in 1703, with annotations taken chiefly fromGrotius and Hammond; but the ufe of this verfion was prohibited in Holland by order of the States-Ge- neral, as tending to revive the errors of Sabellius and Socinus. Italian Bible. The firft Italian Bible publifhed by the Romanifts, is that of Nicolas Malerme, a Benedictine monk, printed at Venice in 1471. It was tranflated from the Vulgate. The verfion of Anthony Brucioli, publifhed at Venice in 1532, was prohibited by the coun¬ cil of Trent. The Calvinifts likewife have their Italian Bibles. There is one of John Diodati in 1607 and 1641, and another of Maximus Theophilus in 1551, dedicated to Francis de Medicis duke of Tufcany. The Jews of Italy have no entire verfion of the Bible in Ita¬ lian ; the inquifition conftantly refufing to allow them the liberty of printing one. Spanifh Bible. Thefirft Spanilh Bible that tve hear of, is that mentioned by Cyprian de Valera, which he fays was publifhed about the year 1 5 00. The Epiftles and Gofpels were publifhed in that language byAmbrofe de Montefin in 1512; the whole Bible by. Caffiodore de Reyna, a Calvinift, in 1569; and the New Teftament, 6 Z dedicated"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"BIB ( 550 ) BIB dedicated to tlie emperor Charles V. byFrancis Enzinas, otlierwife called Driander, in -1543. The firft Bible ■ which was printed in Spanifh for the ufe of the Jews, was that printed at Ferrara in 1553, in Gothic charac¬ ters, and dedicated to Hercules d’Eft duke of Ferrara. This verfion is very ancient, and was probably in ufe among the Jews of Spain before Ferdinand and Ifabella expelled them out of their dominions in 1492. German Bible. The firft and molt ancient trsnfla- tion of the Bible in the German language, is that of Ul- philas bifhop of the Goths, about the year 360. This bifhop left out the books of Kings, which treat chiefly of war, left it fhould too jmach encourage the martial hu¬ mour of the Goths. An imperfedt manufcript of this verfion was found in the abbey of Verden near Cologn, written in letters of filver, for which reafon it is called Codex Argenteus ; and it was publifhed by Francis Junius in 1665. The °ldeft German printed Bible extant, is that of Nuremberg, printed in 1447; but who the au¬ thor of it was, is uncertain. John Emzer, chaplain to George duke of Saxony, publifhed a verfion of the New Teftament in oppofition to Luther. There is a German Bible of John Eckius in 1537, with Emzer’s New Te¬ ftament added to it ; and one by Ulembergius of Weft- phalia, procured by Ferdinand duke of Bavaria, and printed in 1630. Martin Luther, having employed ele¬ ven years in tranflating the Old and New Teftament, publifhed the Pentateuch in 1522, the hiftorical books and the Pfalms in 1524, the books of Solomon in 1527, Ifaiah in 1529, the Prophets in 1531, and the other books in 1530: He publifhed the New Teftament in IJ22. The learned agree, that his language is pure, and the verfion clear, and free from intricacies: It was revifed by feveral perfons of quality, who were matters of all the delicacies of the German language. The German Bibles which have been printed in Saxony, Switzerland, and elfewhere, are for the mod part the fame as that of Luther, with very little variation. In 1604, John Pif- cator publifhed a verfion of the Bible in German, taken from that of Junius andTremellius: But his turn of ex- preflion is purely Latin, and not at all agreeable to the genius of the German language: The Anabaptifts have a German Bible printed at Worms in 1529. John Crel- lius publifhed his verfion of the New Teftament at Ra- covia in 1630; andFelbinger his^at Amfterdam, in 1660. Ftemijh Bible. The Flemifh Bibles of the Romanifts are very numerous, and for the moil part have no au¬ thor’s name prefixed to them, till that of Nicolas Vinck, printed at Lovain in 1548. The Flemifh verfions made ufe of by the Calvinifts till the year 1637, were copied principally from that of Luther. But the fynod of Dort having in 1618 appointed a new tranflation of the Bible into Flemifh, deputies were named for the work, which was not finifhed till the year 1637. Danijh Bible. The firft Danifh Bible was publifhed by Peter Palladius, Olaus Chryfoftom, John Synningius, and John Maccabaeus, in 1550, in which they followed Luther’s firft German verfion. There are two other ver¬ fions, the one by John Paul Refenius bifhop of Zealand, in 1605; the other, being the New Teftament only, by JohnMichel, in 1524. Snueitjl) Bible. In 1534 Olaus and Laurence pub¬ lifhed a Swedifh Bible from the German verfion of Mar¬ tin Luther. It was revifed in 1617, by order of king Guflavus Adolphus, and was afterwards almoft univer- fally followed. Bohemian , Polijh, Ruffian or Mufcovite , and Scla- vtnian Bibles. The Bohemians have a Bible tranf- lated by eight of their doftors, whom they had fent to the fchools of Wittemberg and Bafil, on purpofe to ftudy the original languages It was printed in Moravia in the year 1539. The firft Polifh verfion of the Bible, it is faid,.was that compofed by Hadewich wife of Jagellon, duke of Lithuania, who embraced Chriftianity in the year 1390. In 1599, there was a Polifh tranflation of the Bible publifhed at Cracow, which was the work of fe¬ veral Divines of that nation, and in which James VVieck, a Jefuit, had a principal fhare. The Proteftants, in 1596, publifhed a Polifh Bible from Luther’s German verfion, and dedicated it to Uladiflaus IV. king of Poland. The Ruffians or Mufcovites publifhed the Bible in their lan¬ guage in 1981. It was tranflated from the Greek by St Cyril, the apoftle of the Sclavonians; but this old verfion being too obfcure, Erneft Gliik, who had been carried prifoner to Mofcow after the taking of Narva, undertook a new tranflation of the Bible in the Sclavo- vonian ; who dying in 1705, the Czar Peter appointed fome particular divines to finifh the tranflation : But whe¬ ther it Was ever printed, we cannot fay. Englijh-Saxon, and modern Englijh Bibles. If we inquire into the verfions of the Bible of our own country, we fhall find that Adelm bifhop of Sherburn, who lived in 709, made an Englilh-Saxon verfion of the Pfalms; and that Eadfrid, or Ecbert, bifhop of Lindisferne, who lived about the year 7 30, tranflated feveral of the books of fcripture into the fame language. It is faid likewife, that venerable Bede, who died in 785, tranflated the whole Bible into Saxon. But Cuth- bert, Bede’s difciple, in the enumeration of his mailer’s works, fpeaks only of his tranflation of the Gofpel; and fays nothing of the reft of the Bible. Some pretend, that king Alfred, who lived in 890, tranflated a great part of the fcriptures. We find an old verfion in the Anglo-Saxon of feveral books of the Bible, made by El- fric abbot of Malmefbury: It was publifhed at Oxford, in 1699. There is an old Anglo-Saxon verfion of the four Gofpels, publifhed by Matthew Parker, archbifhop of Canterbury, in 1571, the author whereof is unknown. Dr Mill obferves, that this verfion was made from a La¬ tin copy of the old Vulgate. As to the Englifh verfions of the Bible, the moft an¬ cient is that of John de Trevifa, a fecular prieft, who tranflated the Old and New Teftament into Englifh, at the requeft of Thomas lord Berkley: He lived in the reign of Richard II. and finifhed his tranflation in the year 1357. The fecond author, who undertook this work, was the famous WicklifF, who lived in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II. The manufcript of his verfion is in feveral libraries in England. In the year 1534, an Englifh verfion of the Bible, done partly by William Tindal, and partly by Miles Coverdale, was brought"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"BIB (55 brought into England from Antwerp. The bifhops found great fault with this tranflation ; upon which amotion was made in convocation for an Englifh tranflation of the Bible to be fet up in all churches. This motion, though op- pofed by bifliop Gardiner and his party, fucceeded at laft. The king gave orders for letting about it with all poffible hafte, and within three years the impreffion of it was fi-. nifhed. Cromwell procured a general warrant from the king, allowing all his fubjeds to read it; for which Cranmer wrote his thanks to Cromwell, * rejoicing to ‘ fee the work of reformation now rifen in England, * fince the word of God did now fliine over it all without * a cloud.’ Cromwell likewife gave out injudions, re¬ quiring the clergy to fet up Bibles in all their churches, and to encourage the people to read them. In 1542, an ad palled for reftraining the ufe of the Bible. The pre¬ amble fets forth, that ‘ many feditious and ignorant * people had abuied the liberty granted them for reading ‘ the Bible ; and that great diverfity of opinions, animo- * fities, tumults, and fchifms had been occafioned by ‘ perverting the fenfe of the fcripture. To retrieve the ‘ mifchiefs arifing from hence, it is enaded, that a cer- ‘ tain form of orthodox dodrine be fet forth, as a ftan- * dard of belief; and that Tindal’s falfe iranjlalion of ‘ the Old and New Teftament be fupprefled, and for- * bidden to be read in any of the'king’s dominions.’ In the reign of Edward VI. Fuller mentions another tranf¬ lation of the Bible, printed in two editions; the firft in 1549, the other in 1551, but neither of them divided into verfes. In the reign of queen Elizabeth came out the Bifhops Bible, fo called, becaufe feveral of that order were con¬ cerned in that verlion. The work was divided into fe¬ veral parcels, and afligned to men of learning and cha¬ racter. Mod of the divilions are marked with great ini¬ tial letters, fignifying either the name or the titles of the perfons employed. Archbilhop Parker had the principal diredion of this affair; he revifed the performance, and perhaps put the finifhing hand to it. He likewife em¬ ployed feveral critics in the Hebrew and Greek lan¬ guages, to review the old tranflation, and compare it with the original. The laft Englifh Bible is that called King James’s Bible, which proceeded from the Hampton-court confe¬ rence in 1603, where many exceptions being made to the Bifhops Bible, king James gave orders for a new one, not, as the preface exprefles it, for a tranflation altoge¬ ther new, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, but to make a good one better; or of many good ones, one beft. Fifty-four learned perfons were appointed for this office by the king, as appears by his letter to the’arch- bifhop, dated in 1604, which being three years before the tranflation was entered upon, it is' probable feven of them were either dead, or had declined the talk, fince Fuller’s lift of the tranflators makes, but forty-feven, who, being ranged under fix diviflons, entered on their pro¬ vince in 1607. It was publifhed in 1610, with a dedi¬ cation to king James, and a learned preface, and is com¬ monly called king James’s Bible. After this all other verfipns dropped, and fell into difufe, except theEpiftles and Gofpels in the Common-prayer book, which were I) B I C ftill contiuued, according to the bifhops tranflation, till the alteration of the Liturgy in 1661, and the Pfalms and hymns, which are to this day continued as in the old verfion. The judicious Selden, in his Table-Talk, fpeaking of the Bible, fays, ‘ The Englifh tranflation of the , ‘ Bible is the beft tranflation in the world, and ren- * ders the fenfe of the original beft, taking in for the ‘ Englifh tranflation the bifhops Bible, as well as king ‘ James’s. The tranflators in king James’s time took ‘ an excellent way. That part of the Bible was given * to him who was raoft excellent infuch a tongue, (as * the Apocrypha to Andrew Downs) and then they * met together, and one read th<? tranflation, the reft * holding in their hands fome Bible either of the learn- * ed tongues, or French, Spanifh, Italian, <bc. If ‘ they found any fault, they fpoke; if not, he read on.’ King James’s Bible is that now read by authority in all the churches in England. Irijb Bible. Towards the middle of the fixteenth century. Bedell, bifliop of Kilmore, fet on foot a tranflation of the Old Teftament into the Irifh lan¬ guage; the New Teftament and the Liturgy having been before tranflated into that language. The bifliop appointed one King to execute this work, who, not underftanding the oriental languages, was obliged to tranflate it from the Englifh. This work was received by Bedell, who, after having compared the Irifli tranflation with the Englifh, compared the latter with the Hebrew, the LXX. and the Italian verfion of Diodati. When this work was finiflied, the bifliop would have been himfelf at the charge of the impref¬ fion, but his defign was flopped upon advice given to the lord-lieutenant and the archbifliop of Canterbury, that it would prove a fliameful thing for a nation to publifh a Bible tranflated by fuch a defpicable hand as King. However, the manufeript was not loft, for it went to prefs in. the year 1685. BIBLIOTHECA, in its original and proper fenfe, de¬ notes a library; or place for repofiting books. Bibliotheca, in matters of literature, denotes a trea- tife, giving an account of all the writers on a certain fubjed : Thus, we have bibliothecas of theology, law, philofopliy, <bc.

Blanching, in coinage, the operation performed on the planchets or pieces of filver, to give them th. re- quifite luflre and brightnefs. They alfo blanch pieces of plate, when they would have them continue white, or have only fome parts of them burniffied. Blanching, as it is now pra&ifed, is peformed by heating the pieces on a kind of peel with a wood fire, in the manner of a reverberatory ; fo that the flame pafles over the peel. The pieces being fufficiently heated and cooled again, are put fucceflively to boil in two pans, which are of copper : In thefe they put water, common fait, and tartar of Montpelier. When they have been well draided of this water in a copper fieve, they throw fand Und frefli water over them ; and when dry, they are well rubbed with towels. Blanching, among gardeners, an operation whereby certain fallets, roots, 6c. are rendered whiter than., they would otherwife be. It is this : After pruning off the tops and roots of the plants-to be blanched, they plant them in trenches about ten inches wide, and as many deep, more or lefs. as is judged neceffary; as they grow up, care is taken to cover them with earth, within fouT or five inches of their tops : This is repeated from time to time, for five or fix weeks, in which time they will be fit for ufe, and of a whitiffi colour where covered by the earth.

B LEACHING is the art of Whitening linen cloth, thread, <bc. ; which is conduced in the following manner by the bleachers of this country. After the cloth has been forted into parcels'of an e- qual finenefs, as near as can be judged, they are latched, linked, and then deeped. Steeping is the fird operation which the cloth undergoes, * and is performed in this manner. The linens are folded up, each piece diftimfl, and laid in a large wooden veffel; into which is thrown, blood-warm, a fufficient quantity of water, or equal parts of water and lye, which has been ufed to white cloth only, or water with rye-meal or bran mixed with it, till the whole is thoroughly wet, and the liquor rifes over all. Then a cover of wood is laid over the cloth, and that cover is fecu- red with a poll betwixt the boards and the joiding, to pre¬ vent the cloth from riling during the fermentation which enfues. About fix hours after the cloth has 1 been deeped in warm water, and about twelve in cold, bubbles of air arife, a pellicle is formed on the furface of the liquor, and the cloth fwells when it is not preffed down. This intedine motion continues from thirty-fix to forty-eight hours, according to the warmth of the weather; about which tiny the pellicle or feum begins to fall to the bot¬ tom. Ignore this precipitation happens, the cloth mull: be taken out; and the proper time for taking it out, is when no more air-bubbles arife. This is allowed to be the judett guide by the mod experienced bleachers. The cloth is then taken out, well rinfed, difpofed re¬ gularly by the felvage, and walhed in the put-mill to carry off the loofe dud. After’this it is fpread on the field to dry: When thoroughly dri6d, it is ready for bucking ; which is the fecond operation. Bucking, or the application of falts, is performed in this njanner. The fird. or mother lye, is made in a\" copper, which we fliall fuppofe, for example, when full, holds 170 Scots gallons of water. The copper is filled three fourths full of water^ which is brought to boil: jud when it begins, the following proportion of allies is put into it, viz. 30 lb. of blue, and as much white pearl- ■ afnes; 2oa.Ib. of Maicoft alhes, (or, if they have not ■ t hefe, about 300 tb. of Cafhub.) ; 300 lb. of Mufcovy, or blanch afhes ; the three lad ought to be well pounded. Vol.I. Numb. 24. 3 This liquor is allowed to boil for a quarter of an hour, dirring the alhes from the bottom very often; after which the lire is taken away. The liquor mud Hand till it has fettled, which takes at lead fix hours, and then it * is fit for life. Out of their fird, or mcither-lye, the fecond, or that ufed in.bucking, is made in this manner. Into another copper, holding, for example, 40 Scots gallons, -are put 38 gallons of water, 2 lb. foft foap, and 2 gallons of mother-lye ; or, for cheapnefs, in place of the loap, when they have lye which has been ufed to white linen, called 1white-linen lye, they take 14 gallons of it, leaving out an equal quantity of water. This is called bucking-lye. After the linens are taken up from the field dry, they are fet in the vat or cave, as their large veffel is called,' in rows, endwife, that they may be equally wet by the lye; which, made blood-warm, is now thrown on them, and the cloth is afterwards fqueezed down by a man-with wooden (hoes. Each row undergoes the fame operation, until the veffel is full, or all the cloth in it. At fird the lye is put on milk-warm, and, after danding a little time on the cloth, it is again let off by a cock into the brcking-copper, heated to a greater degree, and then put on the cloth again. This courfe is repeated for fix or feven hours, and the degree of heat gradually increa- fed, till it is, at the lad turn or two, thrown on boiling hot. The cloth remains after this for three or four hours in the lye; after which the lye is let off, thrown away, or ufed in the fird buckings, and the cloth goes on to an¬ other operation. It is then carried out, generally early in the morning, fpread on the grafs, pinned, corded down, expofed to the fun and air, and watered for the fird fix hours, fo often, that it never is allowed to dry. Afterwards it is allowed to lie till dry fpots appear before it is watered. After feven at night it gets no more water, unJefs it be a very dr-ing night. Next day, in the morning and fore¬ noon, it is watered twice or thrice if the day be very dry; but if the weather be not drying, it gets no wa¬ ter : After which it is taken up dry if the green be clean ; if not, it is rinfed, mill-wadied, and laid out to dry again, to become fit for bucking. This"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"562 B L E A This alternate courfe of bucking and watering, is per¬ formed for the moft part, from ten to fix teen time?, or more, before the linen is fit for fouring; gradually increafing the ftrength of the lye from the firft to the middle bucking, and from that gradually decreafing ir till the fouring begins. The lyes in the middle buckings are generally about a third ftronger than the firft and laft. Souring, or the application of acids to cloth, is the fourth operation. It is difficult to fay when this opera¬ tion ffiould commence, and depends moftly on the (kill and experience of the bleacher. When the cloth has an equal colour, and is moftly freed from the fprat, or outer bark of the lint, it is then thought fit for fouring ; which is performed in the following manner. Into a large vat or veflel is powered fuch a quantity of butter¬ milk, or four milk, as will fufficiently wet the firft row of cloth; which is tied up in Ioofe folds, and preffed down by two or three men bare-footed. If the milk is thick, about an eighth of water is added to it y if thin, no water. Sours made with bran, or rye-meal and wa¬ ter, are often ufed inftead of milk, and ufed milk-warm. Over the firft row of cloth a quantity of milk and water is thrown, to be imbibed by the fecond; and fo it is continued till the linen to be foured is fufficiently wet, and the liquor rifes over the whole. > The cloth is then kept down by covers filled with holes, and fecured with a poft fixed to the joift, that it may not rife. Some hours after the cloth has been in the four, air-bubbles arife, a white fcum is found on the furface, and an inte- ftine motion goes on in the liquor. In warm weather it appears fooner, is ftronger, and ends fooner, than in cold weather. Juft before this fermentation, which lafts five or fix days, is finiffied, at which time the fcum falls down, the cloth ffiould be taken out, rinfed, mill-waffied, and delivered to the women to be waffied with foap and water. Waffiing with foap and water, is the fifth operation; and is performed thus. Two women are placed oppofite at each tub, which is made of very thick ftaves, fo that the edges., which Hope inwards, are about four inches in thicknefs. A fmall veflel full of warm water is placed in each tub. The cloth is folded fo that the lelvage may be firft rubbed with foap and warm water length¬ ways, till it is fufficiently impregnated with it. In this manner all the parcel is rubbed with foap, and afterwards carried to be bucked. The lye now ufed has no foap in it, except what it gets from the cloth ; and is equal in ftrength to the fljongeft formerly ufed, or rather ftronger, becaufe the cloth is now put in wet. From the former operation thefe lyes are gradually made ftronger, till the cloth feems of an uniform white, nor any darknefs or brown colour appears in its ground. After this the lye is more fpeedily weakened than it was increafed; fo that the laft which the cloth gets, is weaker than any it got before. But the management of fours is different; for they are ufed ftrongeft at firft, and decreafed fo in ftrength, that the laft four, confidering the cloth is then always taken up wet, may be reckoned to contain three fourths of water. G H I N G. From the bucking it goes to the watering, as former¬ ly, obferving only to overlap the ffilvages, and tie it down with cords, that it may not tear; then it returns to the four, milling, waffiing, bucking, and watering a- gain. Thefe operations fucceed one another alternately till the cloth is whitened ; at which time it is blued, ftarched, and dried. This is the method ufed in the whitening fine cloths. The following is the method ufed in the whitening- of coarfe cloths. Having forted the cloths, according to their quality, they are fteeped in the fame manner as the fine, rinfed, waffied in the mill, and dried before boiling. In this procefs, boiling fupplies the place of bucking, as it takes lefs time, and consequently is thought cheap- eft. It is done in the following manner : 200 lb. cafliub allies, 100 lb. white Mufcovy, and 30 lb. pearl-allies, boiled in 105 Scots gallons of water for a quarter of an hour, as in the procefs for the fine cloth, makes the Mo¬ ther or firft lye. The cloth-boiler is then to be filled two thirds full with water and mother-lye, about nine parts of the former to one of the latter; io that the lye ufed for boiling the coarfe cloth, is about a third weaker than that ufed in bucking the fine. Such a quantity of cloth is put into the foregoing quantity of lye, when cold, as can be well covered by it. The lye is brought gradually to the boil, and kept boiling for two hours ; the cloth being fixed down all the time, that it does not rife above the liquor. The cloth is then taken out, fpread on the field, and watered, as mentioned before in the fine cloth. As the falts of the lye are not exhaufted by this boil¬ ing, the fame is continued to be ufed all that day, add¬ ing, at each boiling, fo much of the mother-lye as will bring it to the fame ftrength as at firft. The lye by boil¬ ing lofes in quantity fomewhat betwixt a third and a fourth; and they reckon that in ftrength it lofes about a half, becaufe they find in praftice, that adding to it half its former ftrength in freffi lye, has the fame effeft on cloth. Therefore fome freffi lye, containing a fourth part of the water, and the half of the ftrength of the firft lye, makes the fecond boiler equal in ftrength to the firft. To the third boiler they add fomewhat more than the former proportion, and go on ftiil increafing gradu¬ ally to the fourth and fifth, which is as much as can be done in a day. The boiler is then cleaned, and next day they begin with freffi lye. Thefe additions of freffi lye ought always to be made by the mafter-bleacher, as it requires judgment to bring fucceeding lyes to the fame ftrength as the firft. When the cloth comes to get the fecond boiling, the lye ffiould be a little ftronger, about a thirtieth part, and the deficiencies made up in the fame proportion. For fix or feven boilings, or fewer, if the cloth be thin, the lye Is increaled in this way, and then gradually diminiffied till the cloth is fit for fouring. The whiteft cloth ought always to be boiled firft, that it may not be hurt by what goes before. In this procefs, if the cloth cannot be got dry for boil¬ ing, bufinefs does not flop as in the fine ; for after the coarfe"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"B L E A C coarfe has dreeped pn racks made for the purpofe, it is boiled, making the lye ftrong in proportion to the water in the cloth. The common method of fouring coarfe linen is, to mix fome warm water and bran in the vat, then put a layer of cloth, then more bran, water, and cl .th; and fo on, till the cave is full. The whole is tramped with mens feet, and fixed as in the former procefs. A thou- fand yards of cloth, yard-broad, require betwixt four and fix pecks of bran. The cloth generally lies about three nights and two days in the four. Others prepare their four twenty-four hours before, by mixing the bran with warm water in a feparate veflel; and before pouring it on the cloth, they dilute it with a fuificient quantity of water. After the cloth is taken from the four, it ought to be well wafhed and rinfed again. It Is then given to men to be well foaped on a table, and after¬ wards rubbed betwixt the rubbing-boards. When it comes from them, it fhould be well milled, and warm water poured on it all the time, if conveniency will al¬ low of it. Two or three of thefe rubbings are fuificient, and the cloth very feldom requires more. The lye, after the fouring begins, is decreafed in ftrength by degrees ; and three boilings after that are commonly fufficient to finifh the cloth. Afterwards it is ftarched, blued, dried, and bittled in a machine made for that purpofe, which fupplies the place of a calendar, and is preferred by many to it. This method qfed in the bleaching of our coarfe cloths, is very like that pra&ifed in Ireland for both fine and coarfe. The only material difference is, that there the bleachers ufe no other afhes but the kelp or cafhub. A lye is drawn from the former by cold water, which dif- folves the falts, and not the fulphureous particles of the kelp afhes. This lye is ufed till the cloth is half whi¬ tened, and then they lay afide the kelp-lye for one made of cafhub allies. In the preceding hiflory of bleaching we may obferve, that it naturally divides itfelf into feveral different branches or parts, all tending to give linen the degree of whitenefs required. How they effe&uate that comes next to be confidered. The general procefs of bleaching divides itfelf in¬ to thefe different parts, i Steeping and milling. 2. Bucking and boiling. 3. .Alternate watering and drying. 4. Souring. 5. Rubbing with foap and warm water, liarching, and bluings We fhall treat of thefe different parts in their order. STEEPING;. Green linen, in the different changes which it has undergone before it arrives at that flate, contradls a great foulnefs. This is chiefly communicated to it by the dreffing compofed of tallow and fowen, which is a kind of flummery made of bran, flour, or oat-meal feeds. The firfl thing to be done in the bleachfield is to take off all that filth which is foreign to the flax, would blunt the future adtion of the falts, and might, in unfkil- ful hands, be fixed in the cloth. This is the defign of fteeping. H I N G; 56 $ To accomplifh this end, the cloth is laid to fteep in» blood-warm water. A fmaller degree of heat would not diffolve the dreffing fo foon ; and the greater might c6- agulate and fix, in the body of the linen, thofe particles which we defign to carry off. In a few hours the dref¬ fing made ufe in weaving is diffolved, mixed with the water; and, as it had acquired fome degree of acidity, before application, it becomes a fpecies of ferment. Each ferment promotes its own particular fpecies of ferment¬ ation, or intefline motion; the putrid ferment fets in motion the putrefadlive fermentation ; the vinous ferment gives rife to the vinous fermentation; and the acid fer¬ ment to the acetous fermentation. That there is a real fermentation going on in fteeping, one mull be foon con¬ vinced, who attends to the air-bubbles which immediate¬ ly begin to arife, to the feum which gathers on the fur- face,\" and to the intefline motion and fwelling of the- whole liquor. That it mull be the acetous fermentation,. appears from this, that the vegetable particles, already in part foured, mufl firfl undergo this procefs. The.effect of all fermentations is to fet the liquor in motion ; to raife in it a degree of heat; and to emit air- bubbles, which, by carrying up fome of the light oleagi¬ nous particles along with them, produce a feum. But as the dreffing is in fmall quantity in proportion to the water, thefe effects are gentle and flow, The acid falts are no fooner feparated, by the acetous fermentation, from the abforbent earth, which made them not percep¬ tible to the tongue in their former flate, than they are united to the oily particles of the tallow, which likewife adhere fuperficially, diffolve them, and render them, ir» fome degree, miflible with water. In this flate they are foon wafhed off by the intefline motion of the liquor. The confequence of this operation is, that the cloth comes out freed in a great meafure from its fuperficial dirt; and more pliant and foft than what it was. • Whenever this intefline motion is pretty much abated, . and before the feum fubfides, bleachers take out their cloth. The feum, when no more air-bubbles rife to fupport -it, feparates, and falls down ; and would again commu¬ nicate to the cloth great part of the filth. But a longer flay would be attended with a much greater difadvantage. The putrid follows clofe upon the acetous fermentation: When the latter ends, the former begins. Were this to take place, in any confiderable degree, it would render the cloth black and tender. Bleachers cannot be too care¬ ful in this article;.. The firfl queftion that arifes to be determined on thefe principles is, What is the properefl liquor for fteeping . cloth? Thofe ufed by bleachers are plain water ; white- linen lye and water, equal parts ; and rye-meal or bran mixed with water. They always make ufe of lye when they have it. . After fteeping, the cloth is carried to the putflock- mill, to be freed of all its loofe foulnefs. There can be nothing contrived- fo effectual to anfwer the purpofe as this mill.. Its motion is.eafy, regular, and fafe. While it preffes gently, it turns the cloth; which is continually walked with a flream of water. Care mufl be taken that no water be detained in the folds of the linen, otherwife that part may be damaged. BUCKING"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"B L E A 564 I 3 U C K I N G and BOILING. This is the moft important operation of the whole procefs, and deferves a thorough examination. Its de- fign is to loofen, and carry ofF, by the help of alkaline lixives or lyes, that particular fubftance in cloth, \"which is the caufe of its brown colour. All afhes ufed in lye, the pearl excepted, ought to be well pounded, before they are put into the copper; for the Marcoft and Cafhub are very hard, and with fome difficulty yield their falts. As thefe two laft contain a very confiderable proportion of a real fulphureous matter, which mull in fome degree tinge white cloth ; and as this is diffolved much more by boiling, than by the inferior degrees of heat, while the falts may be as well extrafted by the latter. The water fhould never be brought to boil, and ffiould be continued for fome time longer under that degree of heat. The pearl-afhes fhould never be put in till near the end, as they are eafily diffolved in water.

A decoftion from them when new, muft differ very much from one when thjey have been long kept; Hence a neceffity of fome exaft criterion to difeover when lyes are of an equal ftrength. The tafte cannot ferve, as that is fo variable, cannot be deferibed to another, and is blunted by repeated trials. The proof-ball will ferve the purpofe of the bleachfield fufficiently; and, by difeovering the fpecific gravity, will ftiow the quantity of alkaline falts diffolved. But it cannot ffiow the dangerous qualities of thefe falts; for the lefs cauftic and lefs heavy this liquor is, the more dangerous and corrofive it mity be for the cloth. The third lye, which they draw from thefe materials by an infufion of cold water, in which the tafte of lime is dilcoverable, appears plainly to be more dangerous than the firft. The fecond lye, which they extract from the fame allies, and which is reckoned about a third in ftrength, when compared to the firft, muft be of the fame nature ; nor fhould it be ufed without an addition of pearl-afhes, which will correft.it. It is taken for a general rule, That the folution of any body in its mcnftuium is equally diffufed through the whole liquor. The bleachers depending on this, ufe e- qual quantities of the top and bottom of their lye, when once clear and fettled; taking it for granted, that there is an equal quantity of falts in equal quantities of the lye. But if there is not, the miftake may be of fatal confe- quer.ee, as the lyc may be. in fome places ftronger than what the cloth cam with fafety bear. That general law of folution muft have taken its rife from particular expe¬ riments, and riot from reafoning. Whether a fufficient number of experiments have been tried 1 to afeertain this point, and to eftr.blifh an undoubted general rule, may be called in queftion. “ But, fays Dr Home, .when I had difeovered that C H I N G. lime makes part of the diffolved fubftance, and relieved how long its groffer parts will continue fufpended in wa¬ ter, there appeared ftronger reafons for fufpefting that this rule, though it maybe pretty general, does not ake place here ; at leaft it is worth the purfuit of experiment. “ I weighed at the bleachfield a piece of glafs in fome cold lye, after it had been boiled, flood for two days, and about the fourth part of it had beea ufed. The glafs weighed 3 drachms i 4 grains in the lye, and 3 rVachms 74 grains in river-water. The fame glafs weighed in the fame fye, when almoft all ufed, 2 grains lefs than it had done, before. This fhows, that the laft of the lye contained a third more of the diffolved body; and, con- fequently, was a third ftronger than the firft of the lye. “ As this might, perhaps^ be owing to a continuation of the folution of the falts, I repeated the experiment in a different way. “ I took from the furface fome of the lye, \"after the falts were diffolved, and the liquor was become clear. At the fame time I immerfed a bottle, fixed to a long ftick, fo near the bottom, as not to raife the afhes there, and, by pulling out the cork by a firing, filled the bottle full of the lye near the bottom. The glafs weighea in rivet-water 3 drachms 384 grains; in the lye taken irom the furface 3 drachms 344 grams; and in the lye taken from the bottom 3 drachms 314 grains. This experi¬ ment fhows, that the lye at tly: bottom was, in this cafe, 4 ftronger then the lye at the furface. “ At other times when I tried the fame experiment, I found no difference in .the fpecific gravity; and there¬ fore, I leave it as a queftion yet doubtful, though de- ferving to be afeertained by thofe who have an oppor¬ tunity of doing it. As the lye Hands continually on the afhes, there can be no doubt but what is ufed laft muft be ftronger than the firft. I would, therefore, recom¬ mend, to general pra&ice, the method ufed by Mr John Chriftie, who draws off the lye, afjer it 'has fettled, into a fecond receptacle, and leaves the afhes behind. By this means it never can turn ftronger; and he has it in his power to mixthe 'top and bottom, which cannot be done fo long as it Hands on the afhes.” Having confidered the lye, let us next inquire how it, ads. On this inquiry depends almoft the whole theory of bleaching, as its aftion on cloth is, at leaft in this country, abfolutely neceffary. It is found by experiment, that one effeft they have on cloth, is the diminifhing of its weight; and tl;at their whitening power is, generally, in proportion to their Weakening power. Hence arifes a probability, that thefe lyes aft by removing fomewhat from the cloth, and that the lofs of this fubflahce is the caufe of whitenefs. This appears yet plainer, when the bucking, which lafts from Saturday night to Monday morning is attended to. There are various and different opinions with regard to the operation of thefe falts: That they aft by alter¬ ing the external texture of the cloth, or by feparating the mucilaginous parts from the' reft, or l^y extracting the oil which is laid up in the cells of the plant The laft is the general opinion, or rather conjefture, for none of them deferves any better name; but may we venture to affirm, that it is fo without any better tifte to pre-emi¬ nence,"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"B LEACHING. nence, than what the others have. Alkaline falts diflolve oils, therefore thefe falts diflolve the cellular oil of the cloth, is all the foundation which this theory has to reft on ; too flight, when unfupported by experiment,- to be relied on. Dr Home endeavours to fettle this queftion by the fol¬ lowing experiments and obfervations. “ Wax, fays he, is whitened by being expofed to the influence of the fun, air, and moifture. A difcovery of the changes made on it by bleaching, may throw a light upon the queftion. “ Six drachms of wax were diced down, expofed on a fouth window. Sept. io. and watered. That day being clear and warm, bleached the wax more than all the fol¬ lowing. It feemed to me to whiten quicker when it had no water thrown on it, than when it had. Sept. 15. it was very white, and 1 drachm 3 grains lighter. 34. drachms of this bleached wax, and as much of unbleach¬ ed, taken from the fame piece, were made into two candles of the fame length and thicknefs, having cotton wicks of the fame kind. The bleached candle burned one hour thirty-three minutes; the unbleached three mi¬ nutes longer. The former run down four times, theJat- ter never. The former had an obfcure light and dull flame ; the latter had a clear pleafant one, of a blue co¬ lour at the bottom. The former when burping feemed to have its wick thicker,, and its flame nearer the wax, than the latter. The former was brittle, the latter not. It plainly appears from thefe fadls, that the unbleached wax was more inflammable than the bleached ; and that the latter ^rad loft fo much of an inflammable fubftance, as it had lbft in weight; and confequently the fubftance loft in bleaching of wax is the oily part. “ As I had not an opportunity of repeating the former experiment, I do not look on it as entirely conclufive ; for it is poflible that fome of the duft, flying about in the air, might have mixed with the bleached wax, and fo have rendered it lefs inflammable. Nor do I think the analogical reafo»ing from wax to linen without objec¬ tions. Let us try then if we cannot procure the fubftance extracted from the cloth, (how it to the eye, and exa¬ mine its different properties. The proper place to find it, is in a lye already ufed, and fully impregnated with thefe colouring particles. « “ I got in the bleach field fome lye, which had been ufed all that day for boiling coarfe linen, which was to¬ lerably white, and had been twice boiled before. There could be no drefling remaining in thefe webs. No foap had ever touched that parcel; nor do they mix foap with the Jye ufed for coarfe cloth. Some of this impregnated lye was evaporated, and left a dark-coloured matter be¬ hind. This fubftance felt oily 'betwixt the fingers, but would not lather in water as foap does. It deflagrated with nitre in fufion, and afforded a tindture to fpirit of wine. By this experiment the falts feemto have an oily inflammable fubftance joined with them. “ Could we feparate this colouring fubftance from thefe falts, and exhibit it by itfelf fo that it might be¬ come the object of experiment, the queftion would be foon decided. Here chymiftry lends us its afliftance. Whatever has a ftr'onger affinity or attradlion to the falts Vol. 1. No. 24. 3 565 with which it is joined, than this fubftance has, mult fetitat liberty, and make it vifible. Acids attradt alkaline fait from all other bodies; and therefore will ferve ourpurpofe. “ Into a quantity of the impregnated lye mentioned in the former experiment, I poured in oil of vitriol. Some bubbles of air arofe, an inteftine motion was to be per¬ ceived, and the liquor changed its colour from a dark to a turbid white. It curdled like a folution of foap, and a feum fbon gathered on the furface, about half an inch in thicknefs, the deepnefs of the liquor not being above fix inches. What was below was now pretty clear. A great deal of the fame matter lay in the bottom; and I obferved, that the fubftance on the furface was preci¬ pitated, and (howed itfelf heavier than water, when the particles of air, attached to it in great plenty, were dif- pelled by heat. This fubftance was in colour darker than the cloth which had been boiled in it. “ I procured a confiderable quantity of it by ikirn- ming it off. When I tried to mix it with water, it al¬ ways fell to the bottom. When dried by the air, it di- minilhed very much in its fize, and turned as black as a coal. In this ftate it deflagrated ftrongly with nitre in fufion; gave a ftrong tindture to fpirit of wine; and when put on a red-hot iron, burnt very flowly, as if it con¬ tained a heavy ponderous oil; and left fome earth behind. “ From the inflammability of this fubftance, its re- jedting of water, and diflolving in fpirit of wine, we dif- cover its oleaginous nature; but from its great Ipecific gravity we fee that it differs very much from the ex- prefled or cellular oil of vegetables; and yet more from their mucilage. That it diflolves in fpirit of wine, is not a certain argument of its differing from exprefled oils; becaufe thefe, when joined to alkaline falts, and reco¬ vered again by acids, become foluble in fpirit of wine. The quantity of earthy powder left behind after burning, (hows that it contains many of the folid particles of the flax. The fubftance extracted from cloth by alkaline lyes appears then to be a compofition of a heavy oil, and the folid earthy particles of the flax. “ In what manner thefe falts adt fo as to diflolve the oils, and detach the folid particles, is uncertain; but we fee evidently how much cloth mult be weakened by an . improper ufe of them, as we find the folid particles them- felves are feparated.” It is neceflary that cloth lhould be dry before bucking, that the falts may enter into the body of the cloth along with the water ; for they will not enter in fuch quantity, if it be wet; and by adting too powerfully on the ex¬ ternal threads, may endanger them. Tire degree of heat is a very material circumftance in this operation. As the adtion of the falts is always in proportion to the heat, it would appear more proper to begin with a boiling heat, by which a great deal of time and labour might be faved. The reafon why this method is not followed, appears to be this. If any vegetable or vegetable fubftance is to be foftened, and to have its juices extradled, it is found more proper to give it gentle de¬ grees of heat at firft, and to advance gradually, than to plunge it all at once in boiling water. This Lit degree of heat is fo ftrong, that when applied at once to a ve¬ getable, it hardens, inftead of foftening its texture. Dried 7 D vegetables"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"B L E A C H I N G $66 vegetables are immediately put into boiling water by cooks, that thefe fubftances maypreferve their green co¬ lour, which is only to be done by hindering them from turning too foft. Boiling water has the fame effeCl on animal fubftances ; for if fait beef is put into it, the wa¬ ter is kept from getting at the falts, from the outfide of the beef being hardened. But when we confider, how much of an oily fubftance there is in the cloth, especially at firft, which will for fome time keep off the water, and how the twilling of 'the threads, and clofenefs of the texture, hinders the water frcm penetrating, we fhall find, that if boiling wa¬ ter were put on it at once, the doth might be liable, in Several parts, to a dry heat, which would be much worfe than a wet one. That the lyes have not accefs to all parts of the cloth, at firft, appears plainly from this, that when it has lain, after the firll bucking, till all the lyes are waflied out, it is as black, in fome parts, as when it was lleeped. This mull be owing to the dif- charge of the, colouring particles from thofe places to which the lye has accefs, and to their remaining where it has not. It would feem advifeable, then, in the firll bucking or two, when the cloth is foul, to ufe the lye confiderably below the boiling point; that by this foak- ing or maceration, the foulnefs may be entirely difcharg- cd, and the cloth quite opened for the fpeedy reception of the boiling lye in the buckings which follow. The lyes Ihould likewife be weakell in the firft buck¬ ings, becaufe then they aft only on the more external parts; whereas, when the cloth is more opened, and the field of aCtion is increafed, the adtive powers ought to be fo too. For this reafon they are at the ftrongeft after fome Tourings. The only thing that now remains to be confidered, is, the management of the coarfe cloth, where boiling is fub- ftituted in place of bucking. This lpecies of linen cannot afford the time and labour neceffary for the latter ope¬ ration ; and therefore they mull undergo a fhorter, and more adtive method. As the heat continues longer at the degree of boiling, the lyes ufed to the coarfe cloth muft be weaker than thofe ufed to the fine. There is not fo much danger from heat in the coarfe as in the fine cloth, becaufe the former is of a more open texture, and will allow the lye to penetrate more fpeedily. In the clofer kinds, however, the firft application of the falts Ihould be made without a boiling heat. ALTERNATE WATERING and DRYING. After the cloth has been bucked, it is carried out to the field, and frequently watered for the firft fix hours. For if during that time, when it is ftrongly impregnated with falts, it is allowed to dry, the falts appioaching clofer together, and, abided by a greater degree of heat, Lncreafing always in proportion to the drinefs of the cloth, adt with greater force, and deftroy its Very texture. Af¬ ter this time, dry fpots are allowed to appear before it gets any water. In this ftate it profits mod, as the. latter part of the evaporation comes from the more in¬ ternal parts of the cloth, and will carry away mod from thofe parts. The bleaching of the wax, in a preceding experiment, helps to confirm this ; for it feemed to whiten moft when the laft panicles of water were going off. This continual evaporation from the furface of the cloth fhows, that the defign of the operation is to carry off fomewhat remaining after the former procef's of buck¬ ing. This appears likewife from a fact known to all bleachers, that the upper fide of cloth, where the eva¬ poration is ftrongeft, attains to a greater degree of white- nefs than the under fide. But it is placed beyond all doubt by experiment, which (hews, that cloth tyrns much lighter by being expofed to the influence of the fun, air, and winds, even though the falts have been wafhed out of it. What, then, is this fubftance ? As we have difcovered in the former fedtion, that the whitening, in the opera¬ tion of bucking, depends on the extracting or loofening the heavy oil, and folid particles of the flax ; it appears highly probable, that the effects of watering, and expo- fition to the fun, air, and winds, are produced by the evaporation of the fame fubftance, joined to the lalts, with which compofite body the cloth is impregnated when expofed on the field. That thefe falts ate in a great meafure carried off or deftrpyed, appears from the cloth’s being allowed to dry without any danger, after the eva¬ poration has gone on for fome time. “ If we can (Low, fays Dr Home, that oils and falts, when joined toge¬ ther, are capable of being exhaled, in this manner, by the heat of the atmofphere, we fhall reduce this queftion to a very great degree of certainty. “ Sept. io. I expofed, in a fouth-weft window, half an oz. of Caftile foap, fliced down, and watered. Sept* 14. when well dried, it weighed but 3 dr. 6 gr. Sept, 22. it weighed 2 dr. 2 gr. Sept. 24. it weighed 1 dr, 50 gr. It then feemed a very little whiter ; but was much more mucilaginous in its tafte, and had no degree of fait-, nefs, which it had before. “ It appears from this experiment, that foap is fo vo¬ latile, when watered, and expofed to air not very warm, that it lofes above the half its weight in fourteen days. The fame muft happen to the faponaceous fubftance, formed from the conjunction of the alkaline falts, heavy oil, and earthy particles of the flax. The whole defign, then, of this operation, which, by way of pre-eminence, gets the name of bleaching , is to carry off, by the eva¬ poration of water, whatever has been loofened by the former procefs of bucking. “ Againft this doCtrine there may be brought two ob¬ jections, feemingly of great weight. It is a general opi¬ nion amongft bleachers, that linen whitens quicker in March and April, than in any other months: But as the evaporation cannot be fo great at that time, as when the fun has a greater heat; hence the whitening of cloth is not in proportion to the degree of evaporation; and therefore the former cannot be owing to the latter. This objection vanifties, when we confider, that the cloth which comes firft into the bleachfield, in the fpring, is clofely attended, having no other to interfere with it for fome time ; and, as it is the whited, gets, in the after buck¬ ings, the firft of the lye ; while the fecond parcel is’often- bucked with what has been ufed to the firft. Were the faCt true, on which the objection is founded, this would"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"B L E A C be a fuihcient anfwer to the objection. But it appears not to be true, from an obfervation of Mr John Chriftie, That cloth laid down in the beginning of June, and fi¬ nilhed in September, takes generally lefs work, and un¬ dergoes fewer operations, than what is laid down in March, and finilhed in June. “ The other objection is, That cloth dries much fader in windy weather than in cafm funlhine; but it does not bleach fo fad. This would feem to (how, that the fun has fome particular influence independent on evaporation. In anfwer to this objection, let it be confidered, that it is not the evaporation from the furfaee, but from the more internal parts that is of benefit to the cloth. Now, this latter evaporation mud be much dronger in funfliine than in windy weather, on account of the heat of the fun, which will make the cloth more open; while the coldnels of windy weather mud Ihut it up, fo that the evaporation will all be from the furfaee. Clear funlhine, with a very little wind, is obferved to be the bed wea¬ ther for bleaching ; a convincing proof that this reafon- ing is juft. “ It would feem to follow as a corollary from this rea- foning, that the number of waterings ftvould in general be in proportion to the drength of the lye; for the dronger the lye is, the more, there is to be evaporated; and the greater the danger, in cafe the cloth fhould be allowed to dry. But there is an exception to this gene¬ ral rule, arifing from the confideration of another cir- cumftance. It is obferved, that cloth, when brown, dries fooner than when it becomes whiter, arifing from the clofenefs and oilinefs which it then has, not allowing the water a free pafiage. Perhaps that colour may retain % greater degree of heat, and in that way affift a very little. Cloth therefore, after the firfl buckings, mud be more carefully watered than after the lad. “ It follows likewife from this reafoning, that the foil of the bleachfield Ihould be gravelly or fandy, that the water may pafs quickly through it, and that the heat may be increafed by the reflexion of the foil: for the fuccefs of this operation depends on the mutual action of heat, and evaporation. It is likewife neceffary that the water fhould be light, foft,, and free from mud or dirt, which, not being able to rife along-with the water, mud remain behind. When there is much of this, it becomes necef- fary to rinfe the cloth in water, and then give it a mill¬ ing, to take out the dirt; elfe it would be fixed in the doth by the following bucking, as it is not foluble by the lye. “ This operation has more attributed to it by bleach¬ ers than it can juftly claim. The cloth appears, even to the eye, to whiten under thefe alternate waterings and dryings ; and thefe naturally get the honour of it, when, it more properly belongs to the former operation. Here lies the fallacy. Alkaline falts give a very high colour to the decodtions, or infufion of vegetables. This is probably owing to the folution of the oleaginous colour¬ ing particles of the plant; which particles,, being opened and feparated by the faks, occupy a greater fpace, and give a deep colour to the liquor. The cloth participates of the liquor and colour. Hence bleachers always judge ef the goodneis, of the bucking by the deepnei's o£ its II I N G. 5 <5 7 colour. The rule, in general, is good. I obferve, than in thofe buckings which continue from the Saturday night to the Monday morning, the cloth has always the deeped colour. When that cloth has been expofed fome hours to the influence of the air, thefe colouring particles, which arfe but loofely attached to it, are evaporated, and the linen appears of a brighter colour. This operation does no more than complete what the former had almod finilhed. If its own merit were thoroughly known, there would be no occafion to attribute that of another opera¬ tion to it. Thread, and open cloths, fuch as diaper, may be reduced to a great degree of whitenefs, after one bucking, by it alone. No cloth, as would appear, can attain,to a bright whitenefs without it. “ Since the only advantage of watering is the remo¬ val of the falts, and what they hive diflolved, might we not effedtuate this by fome cheaper, and more certain method ? For it occupies many hands ; and mud depend altogether on the uncertainty of the weather ; fo that, in the beginning of the feafon, the bleacher is often obliged to repeat his buckings without bleaching. We might take out the alkaline falts by acids ; but then the other fubdance would be left alone in the cloth, nor would any walhing be able to remove it. Mill-walhing appears a more probable method of taking out both falts and oils ; and it would feem that this might, in a great roeafure, fupply the place of watering; but upon trial it does not fucceed. Two parcels of linen were managed equally in every other refpedt, except in this, that one was water¬ ed, and expofed to the influence of the air, and the o- ther was only mill-walhed. This method was followed until they were fit for fouring. The cloth which had been mill-walhed, had a remarkable green colour, and did not recover the bright colour of the pieces managed in the common way, until it had been treated like them for a fortnight. The green colour was certainly owing to a precipitation of the falphureous particles, with which, the lye is impregnated, upon the furfaee of the cloth; owing to the falts being walhed off more fpeedily than the fulphur, to which they are united in the lye. The attachment betwixt thele two bodies we know is very loofe, and the feparation eafily made. Evaporation then alone is fufficient to carry off thefe fulphureous par¬ ticles.” SOURING. It is well known to all chymifts, that alkaline falts are convertible, by different methods, into abforbent earths. Frequent folution in water, and evaporation of it again, is one of thefe. This tranfnrutation then of thele falts, which are not volatilifed or walhed away, mud be continually going on in the cloth under thefe al¬ ternate waterings and dryings of the former procefs ; not much indeed after the firft two or three buckings; be-, caufe the falts, not having entered deep into the cloth, are eafily walhed off, or evaporated. But when they penetrate into the very compolition of the lad and mi¬ nuted fibres, of which the fird veffels are made, they find greater difficulty of efcaping again, and mud be more fubjedt to this tranfmutation. But if we confider the bleaching"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"5 5 8 BLEACHING. bleaching allies as a compofition of lime and alkaline falts, we muft difcover a frelh fund for the depofition of this abforbent earth. The common cauftic, a compofition of this very kind, foon converts itfelf, if expofed to the o- pen air, into' a harmlefs earthy powder. .Frequent buckings and bleachings load the cloth with th's fubftance. It becomes then neceffary to take it out. No walhing can do that, becaufe earth is not foluble in water. Nothing but acids can remove it. Thefe are attracted by the abforbent earth, join themfelves to it, and compofe a kind of neutral imperfedt fait, which is foluble in water ; and therefore eafily wafhed out of the clo'th. The acid liquors commonly ufed are butter-milk, which is reckoned the belt, four milk, infufions of bran, rye-meal, <bc. kept for fome days till they four. Sour whey is thought to give the cloth a yellow colour. The linen ought to be dried before it is put in the four, that the acid particles may penetrate, along with the watery, through the whole. A few hours after it has been there, air-bubles arife, the liquor fwells, and a thick feum is formed ; mariifefl figns of a fermentation. The following experiment, fays Dr Home, lhews the degree of heat which attends it. “ May 25. I put a thermometer of Fahrenheit’s in¬ to fome butter-milk, of which the bleachers were com- pofing their fours, and which flood in a vat adjoining to another, where the milk was the fame, and the fouring procefs had been going on for two days. After the thermometer had been twenty minutes in the butter¬ milk, the mercury flood at 64 degrees. In the fouring vat it rofe to 68 degrees. An increafe of 4 degrees fhows a pretty brifk intefline motion “ To what are all thefe effedts owing ? To the ace¬ tous fermentation going on in thofe vegetable liquors, whofe acids, extricating themfelves, produce heat, in- tefline motion, and air-bubbles. As the change is flow, the procefs takes five or fix days before it is finifhed. During this time the acid particles are continually uni¬ ting themfelves to the abforbent earth in the cloth. That this fermentation goes on in the liquor alone, appears from this confideration, that the fame effedts, viz. air- bubbles, and feum, are to be feen in the butter-milk a- lone. The only effedt then it has is, by the finall de¬ gree of heat, and intefline motion, which attend it, to aiTifl the junction of the acid and abforbent particles. We fhall prefently fee, that this procefs may be carried on, to as great advantage, without any fermentation; and therefore it appears not abfolutely neceffary. “ When thefe abforbent particles are fully faturated, the remaining acids may unite with, and have fome fmall effedt in extracting the colouring particles. This appears from the two following experiments. “ Sept. 20. A piece of cloth which had been fteep- ed, weighing 414 gr. was put into a half-pound of but¬ ter-milk, whigged, and well foured, by a mixture of water, and by boiling. Sept. 24. When taken out, and wafhed in water, it appeared a very little whiter. The mineral acids, as will appear afterwards, whiten'cloth, even though they are very much diluted. “ Juft before the acetous fermentation is finifhed, the cloth fhould be taken out ; otherwife the feum will fall down, and lodge in the cloth, and the putrefadlion which then begins will weaken it. This appears from the fol¬ lowing experiment. “ Sep. 16. A piece of cloth, weighing 42. gr. was laid in butter-milk unwhigged. Novem. 15. The milk had a putrified fmell. The cloth was a little whiter, but very tender ; and weighed, when well wafhed in warm water and dried, 40 gr.” All the fours made of bran, rye-meal, &c. ought to be prepared before ufe ; for by this means fo much time will be faved. Befides, when the water is poured upon the cloth, and bran, as is done in the management of coarfe cloth, the linen is not in a better fituation than if it had been taken up wet from the field; and by this means the acid particles cannot penetrate fo deep. A- gain, this method of mixing the bran with the cloth, may be attended with yet worfe confequences. All ve¬ getable fubflances, when much preffed, fall into the putref- cent, and not the acetous fermentation. This often hap¬ pens to the bran preffed betwixt the different layers on the linen, which mufl weaken the cloth. Hence, all fours fhould be prepared before the cloth is fleeped in them; and none of the bran or meal fhould be mixed with the cloth. The fours are ufed ftrongeft at firft, and gradually weakened till the cloth has attained to its whitenefs. In the firft fourings, there is more of the earthy matter in the cloth, from the many buckings it has undergone, than what there can be afterwards. As the quantity of this matter decreafes, fo fhould the ftrength of the four. There is not, however, the leaft danger, at any time, from too ftrong a four. What is mod wanted in this operation is a more ex¬ peditious and cheaper method of obtaining the fame end. As it takes five or fix days, it retards the whitening of the cloth confiderably; and as bleachers are obliged to fend for milk to a great diflance, it becomes very dear. This laft confideration makes them keep it fo long, that, when ufed, it can have no good effedt; perhaps it may have a bad one. There is one confideration that may lead us to fhorten the time. It is obferved, that the fouring procefs is fooner finifhed in_ warm than in cold weather. Heat quickens the fermentation, by aiding the intefline mo¬ tion. The vats therefore fhould not be buried in the ground, as they always are, which muft keep them cold ; there fhould rather be pipes along the walls of the room, to give it that degree of heat, which, on trial, may be found to anfwer beft. There are few days in fummer fo hot as is neceffary; and the beginning and end of the feafon is by much too cold. That this is no ideal fcheme, the following fadt is a fufficient proof? There are two vats in Salton bleachfield, adjoining to a partition- wall, at the back of which there is a kitchen fire. In thefe vats the fouring procefs is finifhed in three days, whereas it lafts five or fix days in the others placed round the fame room. This improvement, though it fhortens the time of fouring a very little, yet is no remedy againft the fcar- city and dearnefs of milk fours. Such a liquor as would ferve our purpofe, muft be found either among the vege¬ table"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"B L E A C table acids, which have no further fermentation to under¬ go, or among the mineral acids. The former are a large clafs, and contain within themfelves many different fpecies; fuch as the acid juice of feveral plants, vinegars made of fermented liquors, and acid falts, called tartars. But there is one objection againft thefe vegetable acids : They all contain, along with the acid, a great quantity of oily particles, which would not fail to difcolour the cloth. Belides, the demand of the bleachfields w'ould raife their price too high. The mineral acids have neither of thefe objections. They are exceedingly cheap, and contain no oil. “ I will freely own, fays Dr Home, that at firft I had no great opinion of fuccefs from the mineral, from two rea- fons ; their want of all fermentation, which I then look¬ ed on as neceflary ; and their extreme cotrofivenefs. But the experience of two different fummers, in two different bleachfields, has convinced me, that they will anfwer all the purpofes of the milk and bran fours; nay, in feveral refpeCts, be much preferable to them. I have feen many pieces of fine cloth, which had no other fours but thofe of vitriol, and weje as white and ftrong as thofe bleached in the common way. I have cut feveral webs through the middle, and bleached one half with milk, and the other with vitriol; gave both the fame number of operations, and the latter were as white an.d ftrong as the former.” The method in which it has been hitherto ufod is this. The proportion of the oil of vitriol to the water, with which it is diluted, is naif an ounce, or at moft three quarters, to a gallon of water. As the milk-fours are diminifhed in ftrength, fo ought the vjtrioI-fours. The whole quantity of the oil of vitriol to be ufed, may be firft mixed with a fmall quantity of water, then added to the whole quantity of wat'er, and well mixed together. The water fhould be milk-warm ; by which means the acid particles will penetrate further, and operate fooner. The cloth fhould then be put dry into the liquor. It is obferved, that this four performs its talk much fooner than thofe of milk and bran; fo that Mr John Chryftie, in making the trial, ufed to lay the milk-fours twenty-four hours before the vitriol. Five hours will do as much with this four, as five days with the common fort. But the cloth can receive no harm in allowing it to remain for fome days in the four ; but rather, on the contrary, an advant tge. The cloth is then taken out, well rinfed, and mill-wafhed in the ordinary way. The liquor, while the cloth lies in this four, is lefs acid the fecond day than the firft, lefs the third than the fecond, and fo diminifhes by degrees. At firft it is clear, but Dy degrees a mucilaginous fubftance is obferved to float in it; when put into a glafs. This foulnefs increa- fes every day. This fubftance, extracted by the acid, is the fame with what is extracted by the alkaline falts, and blunts the acidity of the former, as it does the alka- lefcency of the latter. Hence the liquor lofes by de¬ grees its acidity. But as the acid falts do not unite fo equally with oily fubftances as the alkaline do, the liquor is not fc- uniformly tinged in the former as in the latter cafe, and the mucous fubftance prefents itfelf floating in it. VpL. I. No. 24, 3 : H I N G. 569 It is obferved, that, in the firft fouring, which is the ftrongeft, the liquor, which was a pretty ftrong acid he- fore the cloth was put in, immediately afterwards be¬ comes quite vapid; a proof how very foon it performs its talk. But in the following operations, as the linen advances in whitenefs, the acidity continues much long¬ er; fo that in the laft operations the liquor lofes very little of its acidity. This happens although the firft buckings, after the firft fourings, are increafed in ftrength, while, the fours are diminifhed. There are two caufes to which this is owing. The texture of the cloth is now fo opened, that although the lyes are ftrong, the alka¬ line falts and abforbent earth are eafily walhed out; and the oily particles are, in a great meafure, removed which help to blunt the acidity of the liquor. Two objections are made againft the ufe of vitriol- fours. One is, that the procefs of fouring with milk is performed by a fermentation; and, as there is no fer¬ mentation in the vitriol-fours, they cannot ferve the ptir- pofe fo well: The other, that they may hurt the texture of the cloth. The anfwer to the former objection is very Ihort; that the vitriol-fours operate fuccefsfully without a fermentation, as experience Ihews ; and therefore in them a fermentation is not neceflary. As to the latter objection, that oil of vitriol, being a very corrofive body, may hurt the cloth ; that will va- nilh likewife, when it is confidered how much the vitriol is diluted with water, that the liquor is not ftronger than vinegar, and that it may be fafely taken into the human body. That it may be ufed with fafety, much ftronger than what is neceflary in the bleachfield, appears from the following experiment with regard to the ftamping of li¬ nen. After the linen is boiled in a lye of allies, it is bleached for fome time. After this, in order to make it receive the colour, it is fteeped in a four of water and oil of vitriol, about fifteen.times ftronger than that made ufe of in the bleachfield; for, to 100 gallons of water are added two and a half of oil of vitriol. Into this quantity of liquor, made fo warm as the hand can juft be held in it, is put feven pieces of 28 yards each. The linen remains in it about two hours, and comes out re¬ markably whiter. The fine cloth often undergoes this operation twice. Nor is there any danger if the oil of vitriol is well mixed with the water. But if the two are not well mixed together, and the oil of vitriol remains in fome parts undiluted, the cloth is corroded into holes. Let us now take a view of the advantages which the vitriol-fours muft have over the milk. The latter is full of oily particles, fome of which muft be left in the cloth: But the cafe is worfe when the feum is- allowed to pre¬ cipitate upon the cloth. The former is liable to neither of thefe objections. The common fours haften very faft to corruption ; and if, from want of proper care, they ever arrive at that ftate, muft damage the cloth very much. As the milk is kept very long, it is often corrupted before it is ufed ; and, without aiding as a four, has all the bad effeCts of putre¬ faction. The vitriol-fours are not fubjeCt to putrefac¬ tion. The milk takes five days to perform its talk, but the 7 E - vitriol-"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"570 B L E A < vitricl-fours do it in as many hours ; nay, perhaps as many minutes ' Their junction with.the abidrbcnt parti¬ cles in the cloth nraft be immediate, whenever thefe acid particles enter with the water. An unanfwerable proof that the fa£t is fo, arifes from the circumftances which happen when the cloth is firft fteeped in the vitriol-four; tlte cloth has no fooner imbibed the acid liquor than it lofes all acidity, and becomes immediately vapid This effed of vitriol fours muft be of great advantage in the bf ach f ield, as the bleachers are at prefent hindered from enjoying the feafon by the tedioufnefs of the fouiing procefs. The whole round of operations takes feven days; to anfwer which they muft have feven parcels, which are often mixing together, and caufing miftakes. three days, at moft, will be fufiicient for all the ope¬ rations when vitriol-fours are ufed, there will be no more than three parcels. The cloth will be kept a fhorter time in the bleachfield, and arrive fooner at market. > ’ The milk-fours are very dear, and often difficult to be got -, but the vitriol are cheap, may be eafily procured, and at any time. There is yet another advantage in the ufe of vitriol, and that is its power of whitening cloth. Even in this diluted ftate, its whitening power is very conltderable. •We have already feen, that it removes the fame cblour- ing particles, which the alkaline lyes do. What of it then remains, after the alkaline and abforbent particles are neutralized in the cloth, muft a< 5 t on thefe colouring particles, and help to whiten the cloth. That this is really the cafe, appears from the following faeft. Mr Chryftie being obliged to chufe twenty of the whiteft pieces out of a hundred, five of the twenty were taken out of feven pieces which were bleached with vitriol. From both experience and reafon, it appears, that it would be for the advantage of our linen-manufaffure to ufe vitriol in place of milk-fours. Hand-rubbincT ’with Soap and Warm Water, Rub¬ bing-boards', Starching, and Bluing. After the cloth comes from the fouring, it fhouldbe well waftied in the waihing-mill, to take off all the acid particles which adhere to its furface. All acids decom- pofe foap, by feparating the alkaline falts and oily parts from one another. Were this to happen on the furface of the cloth, the oil would remain ; nor would the wafli- ing-mill afterwards be able to carry it off. From the walhing-mill the fine cloth is carried to be rubbed by womens hands, with foap and water. As the liquors, whfch are generally employed for fouring, are impregnated with oily particles, many of thefe muft lodge in the cloth, and remain, notwithftanding the pre¬ ceding milling. It is probable, that all the heavy oils are not evaporated by bleaching. Hence it becomes ne- ceffary to apply foap and warm water, „which unite with, dilTolve, and carry them off. It is obferved, that if the cloth, when it is pretty white, gets too much foap, the fallowing bleaching is apt to make it yellow; on thatac- count they often wring out the foap. It is a matter worth inquiring into, whether hard or fo£t foag is heft. for cloth. Moll bleachers agree, that : H I N G. hard foap is apt to leave a yellownefs in the cloth. It is faid, that the u£e of hard foap is difeharged in Holland. As there muft be a confiderable quantity of fea-falt in this kind, which is not in the loft, and as this fait ap¬ pears prejudicial to cloth, the foft foap ought to be pre-j ferred. The management of the coarfe cloth is very different, in this operation, from fine, Inftead of being rubbed with hands, which would be too expenfive, it is laid on a table, run over with foap, and then put betwixt the rubbing-boards, which have ridges and grooves from one fide to another, like teeth. Thefe boards have fmall ledges to keep in the foap and water, which laves the cfoth. They are moved by bands, or a water v heel, which is more equal and cheaper. The cloth is drawn, by degrees, through the boards, by men who attend; or, which is more equal and cheaper, the lame water¬ wheel moves two rollers, with ridge and groove, fo that the former enters the latter, and, by a gentle motion roond their own axis, pull the cloth gradually through the boards. This mill was invented in Ireland about thirty years ago. The Irilli ble- chers ufe it for their fine, as well as coarfe cloath. Thefe rubbing-boards were difeharged, fome years ago, in Ireland, by the Truftees for the ma¬ nufactures of that country, convinced from long expe¬ rience of their bad effefls. But as proper care was no-t taken to inftruCt the bleach rs by degrees in a fafor me¬ thod, they continued in the old, made a party, and kept poffeffion of the rubbing-boards. There were confide¬ rable improvements made in them in this country; fuch as the addition of the ledges, to keep the cloth moift; and of the rollers, which pull the cloth more gradually than mens hands. Thefe improvements were firft made in Salton bleachfield. The objections againft thefe rubbing-boards, are un¬ anfwerable. By rubbing on fuch an unequal furface, the folid fibrous part of the cloth is wore; by which means it is much thinned, and in a great meafure weakened be¬ fore it comes to the market. As a proof of this, if the water which comes from the cloth in the rubbing-boards be examined, it will be found full of cottony fibrous matter. Thefe boards give the cloth a cottony furface, fo that it does not keep long clean . Again, they flatten the threads, and take away all that roundnefs and firm- nefs, which is the diftinguiffiing property of cloth bleached in the Dutch method. For thefe reafons they muft be very prejudicial to fine cloth, and ffiould never be ufed in bleaching it. As they feem to be, in fome meafure, neceffary to leffen the expence of bleaching coarfe linen, they ought never to be ufed above twice, or thrice at moft. They might be rendered much more fafe, by lining their infides with fome foft elaftic fubftance, that will not wear the cloth fo much as the wooden teeth do. Mr Chryftie at Perth has lined his boards, with fhort hair for fome years paft, &nd finds that it anfwers very well. After the coarfe linen has undergone a tubbing, it ffiould be immediately milled for an hour, and warm water poured now and then on it to m ’ it lather. This milling has very good effects; for it cleans the. doth af all"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"B L E A C all the dirt and filth which the rubbing-boards have loofened, and which, at the next boiling, would disco¬ lour the cloth. Belides, it is obferved, that it makes the cloth lefs cottony, and mere firm, than when whi¬ tened by rubbing alone. The laft operation is that of ftarching and bluing. It often happens, that the cloth, when expofed to the wea¬ ther to be dried after this operation, gets rain ; which undoes all again, and forces the bleacher to a new ex- pcnce. To remedy this inconvenience, Mr Chryflie, fome years ftgo, invented the uiy-houfe, where the cloth maybe dried, after this operation, in any weather. This invention meets with umverfal approbation. A METHOD of BLEACHING safely with LIME. Dr Home has found by repeated trials, that alkaline falts added to lime, dimirifh its power of weakening and corroding cloth; and that in proportion to the quantity of thefe falts added to the lime. This compofition, as it is not fo dangerous as lime alone, fo it is not fo expe¬ ditious in whitening. When equal parts of each are ufed, the whitening power is ftrong, and the weakening power not very confiderahle; fo that they might be uled with fafetv to bleach cloth, in the proportion of one-part of lime to four of pure alkaline falts. This fully accounts for an obfervation made by all bleachers, That the bleaching falts, when mixed together, operate fafer and better than when ufed feparatcly. For the corrofive power of the Mufcovy, Marcoft, and Cafhub afhes is corrected by the pearl afhes. and the whitening quality of the latter is in- creafed by that of the former. There is not a more corroding fubftance, with regard to animals, than alkaline falts and lime joined together, cfpecially when fufed in the fire. This is the compofition of the common cauftic. But lime, and lime-water alone, preferve animal fubftances in a found entire ftatc. It ap¬ pears then furprifing, that falts and lime fliould be found fo little deftnidtive of, cloth, when lime, or lime-water alone, deftroys it fo remarkably. But that this is afadt, • is made evident by many experiments, and has been pradtifed both with fuccefs and fafety, by a bleacher who give? the following account of his method of bleaching with lime. “ Firft, fays he, I fteep the cloth in warm water for twenty-four hours; then clean it in a wafhing mill, of all the drefling, or lowen, as the vulgar term it. After¬ wards I buck the cloth with cow-dung and water, and bleach it with this for three days ; then clean it again, and boil it with a lye made of Cafhub afhes. A pound to each piece of i8 or 20 yards long is fuflicient. This I do twice, as no lime oughyo be given to cloth before it is. a full third whitened; it by no means advances the whitening of the cloth, but, on the contrary, pro- tradts it: For, inftead of loofening the oil and dirt in the cloth, when brown, it rather fixes them; juft as when fine cloth is bucked with over-warm- ly s in the firft buckings. Lime is by no means fit for difeharging the oil in the cloth, but for cleaning it of tthe dead part, commonly called fprat. The cloth, being cleaned, is H I N G. 57 i laid upon a dreeper. It muft not be drier before buck¬ ing with lime, otherwife it will take in more than can be got out again before the next application: For as I have obferved already, that lime' is only fit for difclmr- ging the dead part, bucking thus wet make it reft on the outfide of the cloth. I take a lippy of the fineft and richeft powdered lime that caD be got, of the brighteft white colour, as poor lime does more hurt than good, to thirty pieces of the above length; and make a cold lye of it, by ftirring and pouring water off the lime, un¬ til all be diflolved, but the drofs, which is thrown away: Then I add a little foap, which makes the lye have the neareft refemblance to milk that breaks in boiling, of any thing I can think of: Fkir this foap blunts the hotnefs of the lime. Then I take the cloth, and dip it in the lime-lye,' and that moment out again, and lay it on a dreeper until it be bucked ; then put it on the field, watering it carefully; for if allowed to dry, it is much ■ damaged. This is done always in the morning; as it cannot be done at night, in regard of the hot quality of. the lime, which foon heats the cloth, and tenders it. If a hot funfhine follows, it has great effedf: for lime is juft like all other materials for- bleaching, that have more or lefs effedt according as the weather is good or bad. I take it up the fecund day after-bucking, and give it a little milling, or hand-bleaching, or bittling, commonly called blocking \\ and lay it on the field again, watering it carefully as before. The effedt is more vifible the fe- cond than the firft day. As all cloth when limed fliould have a great deal of work, otherwife more than half the effedt is loft; and not only that, but a great deal of la¬ bour and pains is requifite to take the lime out of the cloth again; it muft never be expofed on the Sabbarh day, but carefully kept wet always while ufed in this way., Thus bucking for three or four times at moft, is Suffi¬ cient for any cloth, except that made of flax pulled ei¬ ther over-green, or which grows in a droughty feafon, or perhaps not fo well heckled as it flionld be. This fort occaJions great trouble and expence to the bleacher. But the moft effectual and expeditious way I ever found for this kind, was, after boiling, to take a little of the warm lye, and mix a very f nail quantity of lime with it, and draw the cloth through that as hot as pofliblc, and put it on the field diredtly, watering it carefully, 1 his will clean it of the fprat furprifingly. Then I boil it with pearl afhes, and give it the laft boil with foap ; “ There are innumerable miftakes in the ufe of lime committed by the vulgar, - who are ignorant of its quality and effedts. They know only this in general, that it is a thing which whitens cloth cheap, and is eafy purchafed ; therefore they will ufe it. Some of them begin whiten¬ ing of their cloth with it, which-I have already obferved to be wrong, and given reafons for it, and continue it until the cloth is \"bleached; give it a boil or two at moft, and then wafli it up while the grofs body of the lime is in the fubftance of v the cloth. This makes limed cloth ea- fily diftibgui(liable from unlimed, ■ as the former has a ytl- lowifh colour, and is full of a powder. Befidts, as lime is of a very hot corroding nature, it muft by degrees weaken the cloth. The bad effedts of this fubftance do not end here..

The whole art and fafety in ufing the lime, according b a quick and fpeedy paflage ; yet whenever it is put to this method, depends on the jundlion of the alkaline in any warehoufe, it will meet with moifture there, efpe- falts, during the bucking, to the particle* of lime which daily if the winter-feafon fhould come on before it is were on the furface of the cloth, difpofed or made ufe of.

Blocks, whether fingle .or double, are dillinguilhed and called by the names of the ropes they carry, and the ufes they ferve for. Double blocks are ufed when there is occafion for much llrength, becaufe they will purchafe with more eafe than fingle blocks, though much flower. Block and block is a phrafe fignifying that two blocks meet, in haling any tackle, or halliard, having fuch blocks belonging to them. Filh-block is hung in at a notch at the end of the davit.

N. lat. BLOOD, a well known fluid, which circulates through the arteries, veins, &<?. of animal-bodies, and nou- rifhes all their parts. Blood is compofed of a thin watery liquor called ferutn, and a thick fed part called crajfamentum, which, when viewed by the microfcope, appears to confill of red globules of a certain determined magni¬ tude. Thefe globules are generally believed to be of the fame magnitude in all animals that have red blood. As blood is originally derived from our aliment, it mud confid of the fame principles, and confequently abound with falts and oils. The falts of the blood are partly of the fixed neutral kind, and partly fuch as are rendered femi-volatile by the heat and motion to which they are fubjeCted: Both irritate the fenfible nervous parts of animals; for it is well-known that any kind of fait applied to the eye gives great oneafinefs. From thefe qualities of blood the late learned and cele¬ brated Dr Whytt concluded that it mud be well fitted to communicate a gentle ftimulus to thofe fenfible nerves which terminate on the internal furface of the auricles and ventricles of the heart ; and confequently that the contraction of the heart is principally owing to this caufe. The diameter of a red globule is com¬ puted to be about part of an inch. See Circu¬ lation ; and for the analyfis of blood, fee Che- mlstry. Authors are not agreed in regard to the quantity of blood contained in the human body; fome making it only 10 pounds, whild others, make it to be 20, 60, or even 100 pounds : But then thefe lad comprehend the juices of the lymphatic veffels under the term blood. As to the quantity of current blood jn ahorfe, the ingenious Dr Hales found it be, at a low compu¬ tation, 1105 cubic inches, or 42.2 pounds. Spitting of Blood. See Haemoptoe and Medicine.

BOA, in zoology, a genus of ferpents, belonging to the order of amphibia. The characters of this genus are, that the belly and tail are both furniffied with feuta. The fpecies are ten, viz. i. The contortrix, has 150 feuta on the belly, and 40 on the tail; the head is broad, very convex, and has poifon-bags in the mouth, but not fang, for which reafon its bite is not reckoned poifonous : The body is affi-coloured, interfperfed with large dulky fpots; and the tail is about a third of the length of the body. This ferpent is found in Carolina. 2. The canina, has 203 feuta on the bel¬ ly, and 77 on the the tail; it is greenifli, and variega¬ ted with white belts. It is. a native of America, and lodges in the hollow-trunks of trees, and is about two feet long. The bite of the canina is not poifonoyis. 3. The bipnale, is of a dull yellow colour, and is found in Alia. It has 179 feuta on the belly, and 120 on the tail.—4. The conftridtor, has 24O feuta -on the belly, and 60 on the tail. This is an immenfe a- nimal; it often exceeds 36 feet in length ; the body is very thick, of a duflty white colour, and its back is interfperfed with 24 large pale irregular fpots ; the tail is of a darker colour ; and the fides are beautifully V variegated with pale {pots. Befides, the whole body is interfperfed with fmall brown fpots. The head is covered with fmall feales, and has no broad laminae betwixt the eyes, but has a black belt behind the eyes. It wants the large dog-fangs, and of courfe its bite is\" not poifonous. The tongue is fleffiy, and very little forked. Above the eyes, on each fide, the head rifes high. The feales of this ferpent are all very fmall, roundiffi, and fmooth. The tail does not exceed one eighth of the whole length of the animal.

The flefli of this ferpent is eat by the Indians, and the ne¬ groes of Africa. Pifo, Margraave, and Kempfer give the following account of its method of living and catching its prey. It frequents caves and thick fo- refts, where it conceals itfelf, and fuddenly darts out upon travellers, wild beafts, <bc. When it chufes a tree for its watching-place, it fupports itfelf by twill¬ ing its tail around the trunk or a branch, and darts down upon Iheep, goats, tigers, or any animal that comes within its reach. When it lays hold of ani¬ mals, efpecially any of the larger kinds, it twills it¬ felf feveral times round their body, and, by the vail force of its circular mufcles, bruifes and breaks all their bones. After the bones are broke, it licks the Ikin of the animal all over, befmearing it with a glu¬ tinous kind of faliva. This operation is intended to facilitate deglutition, and is a preparation for {wallow- yig th e whole animal. If it be a Hag, or any horned animal, it begins to fwallow the feet firlt, and gradu¬ ally fucks in .the body, and lafl of all the head. When the horns happen to be large, this ferpent has been ob- ferved to go about for a long time with the horns of a flag flicking out ffom its mouth. As the animal digells, the horns putrify and fall off. After this ferpent has fwallowed a (lag or a tyger, it is unable for fonie days to move ; the hunters, who are well acquainted with this circumltance, always take this opportunity of de- flroying it. When irritated, it makes a loud hilling noife. This ferpent is faid to cover itfelf over with leaves in fuch places as flags or other animals frequent, in order to conceal itfelf from their light, and that it may the more eafily lay hold of them. See Plate LII. fig. 1.—f. The murina, has 254 fcuta on the belly, and 6y on the tail. The colour of it is a light blue, with round fpots on the back. It is a native of America, and its bite is not poifonous. 6. The feytale, has 250 fcuta on the belly, and 70 on the tail. The body is alh-coloured and bluilh, with round black fpots on the back, and black lateral rings edged with white. This ferpent is a native of America ; and, like the conflridor, though not fo long, twills itfelf a- bout Iheep, goats, &c. and fwallows thpm whole. 7.

BOLES are vifcid earths, lefs coherent and more fri¬ able than clay, more readily uniting with water, and more freely fubfiding from it. They are foft and unc¬ tuous to the touch, adhere to the tongue, and by de¬ grees melt in the mouth, impreffing a light fenfe of aftringency. There are a great variety of thefe earths r the principal of which are the following. 1. Armenian bole, when pure, is of a bright red colour, with a tinge of yellow : It is one of the hard- eft and moft compaft of the bodies of this clafs, and not fmooth and gloffy like the others, but generally of a rough dufty furface. It does not effervefce.with acids. 2. French bole is of a pale red co'our, variegated with irregular fpecks of white and yellow. It is much fofter than the Armenian, and (lightly effervefccs with acids. 3. Bole of Blois is yellow, remarkably lighter than the moft of the other yellow earths, and effervefces ftrongly with acids. 4. Bohemian bole is of a yellow colour, with a eaft of red, and generally of a flaky texture. It is not afted on by acids. 5. Lemnian earth is of a pale red colour, and flight- ly effervefces with acids. 6. Silefian bole is of a brownilh yellow colour, and acids have nofenfible effedts upon it. Thefe and other earths, made into little rnaftes, and ftamped with certain impreflions, are called terra figtl* lata. Thefe earths have been recommended as aftrin- gent, fudorific, and alexipharmic. But thefe, and many other virtues that have been aferibed to them, appear to have no foundation. They are ftill ufed in fluxes and complaints of the firft paffages.

Hefiod’s works were originally written upon tables of lead, and depofited in the temple of the Mufes, in Bceotia: The ten commandments, delivered to Mofes, were written upon {lone; and Solon’s laws upon wooden planks. Tables of wood, box, and ivory, were common among the ancients: When of wood, they were frequently covered with wax, that people might w'rite on them i with more eafe, or blot out what they had written. The leaves of the palm-tree were afterwards ufed in¬ dead of wooden planks, and the fined and thinned part of the bark of fuch trees, as the lime, the afh, the mapple, and the elm ; from hence comes the word liber, v'hich fignilies the inner bark of the trees: and as thefe barks were rolled up, in order to be removed with greater eafe, thefe rolls were called volumeti , a volume ; a name afterwards given to the like rolls of paper or parchment. Thus we find bo ks were fird written on dones, witnefs the Decalogue given to Mofes : Theft on the parts of plants, as leaves chiefly of the palm-tree ; the rind and barks, efpecially of the tilia, or phillyrea, and. the Egyptian papyrus.

E E P T N G. The fird books were in the form of blocks and ta¬ bles.; but as flexible matter came to be wrote onj they found it more convenient to make their books in the form of rolls : Thefe were compofed of feveral fheets, fadened to. each other, and rolled- upon- a 'dickj or umbilicus ; the whole making a kind of column, or cylinder, which was to be managed by the umbilicus as a .handle, it being reputed a crime to take hold of the roll itfelf: The outfide of the volume was called frons ; the ends of the umbilicus, cornua, which were ufually carved, and adorned with filver, ivbry, or c- ven gold and precious dones: The title <ru\\>.tzfos, was ftruck on the outfide; the whole volume, when ex¬ tended, might make a yard and a half wide, and fifty long. The form Which obtains among us is the fquare, compofed of ftparate leaves ; which was alfo. known, though little ufed, by the ancients. ■ To the form of books belongs alfo the internal ceconomy, as the order and arrangements of points and letters into lines and pages, with margins and other appurtenants: This has undergone many varieties ; at fird the letters were only divided into lines, then into feparate words, which, by degrees, were noted with accents, and didributed, by points and dops, into pe¬ riods, paragraphs, chapters, and other divifions. In fome countries, as among the orientals, the lines be¬ gan - f rom the right and ran leftward ; in others, as the northern and wedern nations, from left to right; others, as the Greeks, followed both directions, alter¬ nately going in the one, and'returning in the other, called boujlrcphedon : In mod countries, the lines run from one fide to the other; in fome, parti¬ cularly the Chinefe, from top to bottom.

TjjOOKrKEEPING is .an art, teaching how to record J_3 and difpofe the accompts of bufinefs, fo as the true date of every part, and of the whole, may be eafily and didindly known. Though the number and kinds of books ufed in this art be in fome meafure arbitrary, there are three .which can never be difpenfed with by thofe whofe trade is complex ■ or extenfive, viz. the Wajle-book, Journal, and Ledger. I. Of the Waste-book. The Wajle-book is a regider, containing.an inventory of a merchant’s effects' and debts, with a record of all his tranfadlions, narrated in a plain, Ample dyle, and in the. exad order of time as they fucceed one another, - The Wade-book opens with the inventory * which confids of two parts: Fird, the effetts, that is, the mo¬ ney a merchant has by him, the goods he has on hand, his {hare‘ in (hips, houfes, farms, <bc. with the debts due to him; the fecond part of the inventory is the debts due by him to others: The difference betwixt which and the effects, is what merchants call neat Jlock. When a man begins trade, the inventory mud be gathered from a furvey of the particulars that make up his real e.date ; but mud afterwards be collededfrom the balance of his old booksj and carried to the new. This inventory is the fird thing narrated in the Wade-book, as being the fource and fpring whence all fubfequent tranfactions flow. After the inventory is fairly narrated in the Wade- book,., the tranfadions of trade come next to be jotted down ;"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"B O O IC - K down; which is a daily talk, to be performed as they occur ; and fhould be done diftin&ly, that is, every thing fhould be clearly and exa&ly expre/fed.

By fuch occurrences as thefe, a 'merchant as ef¬ fectually becomes fo mu<ih poorer or richer, as by the refult of any branch of his trade.

But an example of the Wafte-book turned into the Jodrnal form, will give a clearer idea than can be con¬ veyed by words. WASTE-BOOK. II. Of the Journal. The Journal is the book wherein the tranfaefions recorded in the Wafte-book are prepared - to be carried to the Ledger, by having their proper debtors and cre¬ ditors afeertained and pointed out.. One great defign of the Journal is, to prevent errors in the Ledger ; a thing of the worft confequence in book-keeping ; which yet, without the help of this book, would be almoft inevitable. For, fuppofe a perfon fhould attempt to form the Debtors and Creditors from the Wafte-book in his mind, and at the fame time poft them to the Ledger, he fhall find his thoughts fo much em- barrafTed and over-charged, by attending at once to fo many different things as occur here, that, were lie an accomptant of very- great experience, he could not well mifs of falling into frequent blunders. This makes it- neceffary to didvide the talk, and do at twice what can¬ not be performed at Once, without fuch hazard of mif- takes; that is, firft to write out the Debtors and Cre¬ ditors in a feparate book by themfclves, and afterward transfer them to the Ledger. The work by this means being divided into parts, becomes more fimple,: and con- fequently more eafy, and fo may be performed with great¬ er certainty of its being right. Again, after the Ledger is filled up, the Journal facilitates the work required in revifing and correcting it; for, firft the Wajle-book and Journal are compared, and then the Journal and Ledger. Whereas, to revife and correCt the Ledger immediately from the Wafte book, would be a matter of no lefs dif¬ ficulty than to form it without the help of a' Journal. Laftly, The Journal is defigned as a fair record of a merchant’s bufinefs : For neither of the other two books can ferve this purpofe; not the Ledger, by reafon both of the order that obtains in it, and alfo cn account of its brevi v, being little more than a large Index. Nor can the Wafte-book anfwer this defign ; for being written up in the time of bufinefs, and commonly too by different hands, it can neither be fair and uniform, nor very ac¬ curate. The Journal is a kind of middle book betwixt the o- ther two ; it looks back to the one, and forward to the ether. With the Wafte-book it agrees in form, being ruled after the fame manner. The order alfo and fuc- ceffion of things is the fame in. both. The thing then Bought 40 yards black cloth, at 14/ Bought of James Sloan, 100 yards lhalloon at 10 d. 1 . s. d.

Again, a poft is either fimple or complex, & fimple pojl is that which has-."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"584 B O O 1 C - K E has but one Debtor and one Creditor, as die firft of thefe abbve. A complex poji is either when one Debtor is balanced by two or more Creditors, as in the fecond port; or when two or more Debtors are balanced by one Creditor, as in the third poll ; or when feveral Debtors are balanced by feveral Creditors, and then the poll is faid to be complex in both its terms. This being premifed, the rules to be obferved are thefe following. I. In a fimple port, the debtor is to be exprefsly men¬ tioned, then the creditor, and, laftly, the fum, all in one line : After which follows the narrative, or reafon of the entry, in one or more lines, as in the firft of thefe three polls above. II. In a complex poft, the feveral Debtors or Creditors are expreffed in the\" firft line, by Sundries, or Sundry Accompts, and the reft of the line filled up as in the E P I N G. former rule. After which, the feveral Debtors or Creditors muft be particularly mentioned, each in a line by themfelves, with their refpe&ive fums fubjoin- ed to them; which are to be added up, and their to¬ tal carried to the money-columns, as in the fecond and third polls. The'Journal, as deferibed and exemplified above, is the form that was firft in ufe among merchants; and is ftill the moll common : but fome make their Journal juft a fair copy of the Wafte-book, with the Debtors and Creditors written out on the margin, which is ruled large for that purpofe. We lhall here fubjoin the three pre¬ ceding polls done after this way; which, to one who un- derftands the common method, will be fufficient inftruc- tion. Dr Black Cloth , Cr Cajh, - ■ l. s. d.

The nature and ufe of the terms Debtor and Credi¬ tor will be obvious, from the confiderations following. I. Accompts in the Ledger confift of two parts, which in their own nature are directly oppofed to, arid the reverfe of one another; which therefore are fet fronting one another, on oppofite fides of the fame folio. Thus, all the articles of money received go to the left fide of the Calh-accompt, and all the articles or fums laid out are carried to the right. In like manner, the purchafe of goods is polled to the left fide of the accohipt of the faid goods, and the fale, or dilpofal of them, to the right, he. II. Tranfadlions of trade, or cafes of the Wafte- book, are alfo made up of two parts, which belong to different accompts, and to oppofite fides of the Ledger: e. g. If goods are bought for ready money, the two parts are, the goods received, and the money delivered; the former of which goes to the left fide of the accompt of faid goods, and the latter to the right fide of the Calh-accompt. III. Thefe two different parts, in cafes of the Wafte- book, are not oppofed to one another, as the two fides of the Ledger-accompts are; but, on the contrary, have a mutual connexion and dependence, the one being the ground, condition, or caufe of the other. Thus, in the preceding example, when goods are bought for ready money, the receipt of the goods is the caufe of parting with the money; and, on the other hand, the delivering of the money is the condition on which the goods are received. From thefe three obfervations, it is plain, that, in or¬ der to poft a cafe of the Wafte-book to the Ledger, the firft thing the accomptant muft do, is, to divide the cafe into its. parts, and then to think with himfelf, to which accompt, and to what fide, each of thefe parts is to be carried; and when the entry is actually made, the con¬ nection of the parts with one another muft be expreffed in each of the accompts to which they are tranfported. Now, fince in fpeaking and writing things muft have names whereby they may be expreffed and written, it is neceffary that two words or terms be contrived, and ap¬ propriated to thefe two different parts, that have the fame relation to one another as the parts themfelves have, which may at once charade rife and diftinguilh the parts from one another, point out and afeertain to what fide of the Ledger each of them is to be carried, and withal exprefs their relation to, and dependence upon one another. The Italians at firft for this purpofe pitched upon the terms"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"(* 585 ) E E P I N G. i. IN PROPER TRADE. Proper trade is either domeftic or foreign. Proper dome flic trade, is that which a merchant carries on by himfelf, without the help of a faCtor. Proper foreign trade, is the bufinels that occurs to a merchant by tm- B O O K - K terms Debtor and Creditor, becaufe their common ac¬ ceptation comes nearer to the thing here meant than arty other they could think on. By means of thefe terms, the two parts, in any cafe of the Wafte-book, when poll¬ ed to thejournal, are denominated, the one the Debtor, and the other the Creditor, of that poft And when carried from thence to the Ledger, the Debtor, or Debtor part, is entered upon the left fide (hence called the Debtor fide) of its own account, where it is char¬ ged Debtor to the Creditor part. Again, the Creditor, or Creditor part, is ported to the right fide, or Credi tor-fide of its accompt, and made Creditor by the Debtor fart. Hence Italian book-keeping is faid to be a me¬ thod of keeping accompts by double entry, becaufe every fingle cafe of theWarte-book requires at leal! two entr jn the Ledger, viz. one for the Debtor, and another! the Creditor. We (hallilluftrate what has been faid by two exai Firft, Suppofe a merchant buys a pipe of wine for ready “o »ve ™ ,*? ulc money, the tw'o parts in this cafe are, the wine received, wfucati/y'obfcrvc chccate6 lnd 110tes ot the l’ ru ' affign a diftinCt pro¬ blem ; and, to prevent burdening the lea ner’s memoiy, we fhall deliver the feveral cafes as compendioufly as pd- fible, fubjoinmg to each problem fuch notes as leem ne- ceffary for clearing any thing that requires further lllu- and the money delivered for id by the terms Debtor and Creditor in the w thus: Wine Dr to cafh ; where the meaning is, (though to exprefs it fo is needlefs), that as Wine is Dr to Cafh, lo Cafh is Cr by Wine » And accordingly when carried to the Ledger, the Wine-aecompt is charged Dr to Cafh, and the Cajb-accompt is made Cr by Wine. Again, 2 d ip.

And ac cordingly, in the Ledger, the Cafh-accompt is charged Dr to Wine, and the Wine-accompt gets credit by Cajh. From all which it is evident, the terms Debtor and Cre¬ ditor are nothing elfe but marks or characterlilies (lamped upon the different parts of tranfadlions in the Journal, expreffing ihe relation of thefe parts to one another, and (hewing to which fide of their refpe&it Ledger they are to be carried.

Note 3. Having now (hewn how to keep fa ftory-ac¬ compts in your own books, along with your other bufi- nefs, it will not be improper to obferve, that thefe ac compts may alfo be kept, by help of the Sales book, without bringing any thing to your Ledger , or other books, except the accompt curtent, thus: Turn the Sales-book into a folio-form ; and when you receive the eonfigned goods, enter them on the Dr fide, mentioning their quantity, mark, and number, w ith the charges you pay; to which fide alfo carry all after charges, abate¬ ments made to buyers, and your own commifiion On the Cr fide, enter the fales, mentioning the names of the buyers on time; and, as they pay, mark the article as paid on the margin; or, which will do juft as well, never draw out the films to the money columns, till you receive payment. In your Ledger , give A. B. his sic compt current credit for all. the mon y you receive for his goods, and make the fame accompt Dr fot all the char- ges paid by you, abatements made to buyers, your own comrailfion, and returns made to your employer. But though this method may now and then be ufed with rsfpeft to fmall confignments; yet the conducing of large Concerns in fa&ory requires the ufe of all the fire books mentioned at the beginning of thisehapter. Note 4. When you cannot difpofe of your employer’s goods to advantage, and thereupon by his order (hip them off to a fadtor of your own, in expectation of a better market, the regular method in this cafe is, j. When you Ihip off the goods, entpr Voyage to -—forac- count of your Employer, Dr to Cash, tor charges paid at fhipping 2. When you have adyice from your fadtor, that he has received them, enter your Employer his ac- compt of goods in the hands of faflor, or rather your Employer his accompt of goods at fuch a place, Dr to Voy¬ age thither, for charges of the faid voyage. 3. When you have advice that he has fold them, e. g. for ready money, enter your Employer bis accompt current at - Dr to ditto his accompt of goods at -, for neat pro- ceeds. The entry in any other cafe will be obvious to oae who underftands proper trade and factorage, as ex¬ plained above But though this be the regular method, yet in real pradtice, the belt way, incur opinion, is, when you (hip the goods, to charge the employer’s accompt of goods (as they (land in your Ledger) Dr to Cash , for char¬ ges ar fhipping making no more entries, till you receive the Accompt of fates, and then charge A 3 . his accmpt of goods, for the neat proceeds ; and difcharge A. B. his accompt current at --, as returns are made to you by your faftor. 3. In PARTNERSHIP. Partnership is that branch of trade which is ma- E £ P I N G. (*C) naged and carried on by a truftee, in the name, and for the account of the partners ; that is, when a joint flock, made tap by two or more merchants, is depoiked in the hands of one ptifon, to be employed by him in a way of commerce, according to inftrudtions. M rchants, upon entering into partnership, generally chufe one of their own number, to w om they commit the management of their company-eoncerns ; who, oil account of his being partner, as well as manager or doer for the company, is called partner-trujlee ; and fhares of gains and Ioffes that happen, according to his (hare of the flock ; and muff allow his proportion of all charges, even of his own commifiion, fince, in quality of truftee, he ferves himfdf as paitner equally with the reft. The accompts of the company’s affairs may be kept by the truftee in his own books, along with the accompts of his own private bufinefs ; or they may be kept in fepa- rate books allotted for that purpofe. The former is common pradtice, in marterr of fmall concern, or fhort adventures ; the latter is ufed by fixed companies, whofe trade is confiderable, or who have the proipedt of deal¬ ing long that way. Hence it is obvious, that each partner will haveocca- fion to keep an accompt in his own books, of every thing he gives in and receives from the company, and alfo of what he owes to the company, or they to him: and, oft the other hand, it will be the bufinefs of the truftee, not only to keep rlear accompts with the perfons he deals with, in buying up and difpofing of goods fok the com¬ pany ; but he muft alfo keep diftindt accompts, with re- fpedt to the partners, fhewing what fh^re each of them gives in, and what part of neat proceeds is due to them, and likewife what every one of them owes to the com¬ pany, or the company to them. Thefe things premifed, 1. We fhall fhew how a partner keeps the accompts which he has occafion for. 2. The way how a truftee keeps the accompts of the company’s affairs in his own books. 3. The manner of keeping company-ac.compts in books, apart, that contain nothing elfe. I. Ho<ui a partner keeps the accompts he has occajion for. The Ledger.accompts deferibed. A merchant concerned as partner in a company, muff keep the two Ledger-accompts following ; in which ob¬ ferve, that A. B. reprefents the trultee’s name. 1. A. B. my accompt in company. This accompt is Dr for your inputs, and proportion of all charges, and Cr for your (hare of neat proceeds, 2. A. B. my accompt proper. This is a perfonal ac¬ compt, being charged and difeharged exadtly as fuch, for the mutual debts and payments betwixt you and the truftee Note 1. A. B. my accompt in company, is a general title, that may reprefent one or more kinds of goods ; and that whether in the truffee’s cuftody, or by him feat to fea. But different authors title this accompt diffe¬ rently. Some chufe to exprefs it thus: Goods in the hands of A. B.\\ or particularly, Broad cloth in the hands of A. B. If it be a fea-adventure, you may ufe the title, A. B, my account of Voyage to . If the company"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"(*C) B O O K - K he fixed, the title may'be taken from the commodity they deal in, as Accompt in Wine-company, accompt in Tobac¬ co- company , See . ; or from the place they trade to,, as A c nipt in Eajl-Inaia company. See. Nate 7. Inftead of A. B. my accompt proper, fome write A B. accompt-current ; Come too w-rite A B. his accompt current; and others title this accompt (im¬ ply by the truftee’s name. But though the titles of ac- compts are in fome fort arbitrary, or as he nie> chant pleales , yet it is fuitable or cong uous, that they carry in them fome badge of diftindhon, (hewing to whatclafs of accompts they belong.

Of the Ledger. The Ledger is the principal book, wherein all the fe- veral articles of each particular accompt, that lie fcat- tered in the other books according to their dates, are collected and placed together, in fpaces allotted for them, in fuch manner, that the oppofite parts of every accompt are fet diredly fronting one another, on oppofite fides of the fame folio. The Ledger is the chief or principal book of accompts, as being that which immediately anfwers the end of book¬ keeping For, as has been already obferved, the Jour¬ nal is only preparatory or introduflory to the Ledger ; and the Wa/le-boi k contains only the matter of accompts, without either the form or order ; whereas the Ledger has all the perfeflion of form and order aimed at in book¬ keeping* affording a ready anfwcr to all the demands of £ F. P I N G. (i*\\ the inquifitive merchant; and is therefore juflly e/leemcd the principal book of the three. It is called the Ledger, (an Italian word that fignifies art or dexterity), becaufe in it the artificial part of book-keeping chiefly appears. The Ledger, in oppofition to the fcattered order of things in the Wa/le-book, has all the particular articles of each accompt colledted and placed together ; and that in fnch a manner, as to have the oppofite articles fepa- rated, and fet fronting one another on oppofite fides of the fame folio. Thus, the oppofite articles of the Ca/h-accompt are, thefums of money received, and the fums laid out ; which accordingly /land, the former on the Dr fide, and the latter on the Cr fide of the fame folio. Again, in an accompt of goods, the prime coff and charges go to the Dr fide, and the fales to the Cr fide ; by comparing of which, appears the gain or lofs : and fo in other accompts. The Ledger folios are divided into fpaces, for con¬ taining the accompts ; on the head of which are written the titles of the accompts, marked Dr on the left-hand page, and Cr on the right : Below which /land the ar¬ ticles, with the word To prefixed to the Dr fide, and the word By on the Cr fide. Upon the margin are recorded the dates of the articles, in columns allotted for that pur. pofe. The money-columns are the fame as in the othe r books. Before them /lands the folio-column, which con¬ tains figures directing to the folio where the correfpon- dent Ledger-entry of each article is made; for every thing is twice entered in the Ledger, viz. on the Dr fide of one accompt, and again upon the Cr fide of fome other accompt; fo that thefe figures mutually refer from the one to the other, and are of ufe in examining the Ledger. For the ready finding any accompt in the Ledger, it has an alphabet, or index, wherein are written the titles- of all accompts, with the-number of the folios where they /land. Note. If the Ledger-accompts be numbered, 1, 2, 3, <bc. according to their order ; thefe numbers may bein- ferted in the Folio-column and Index, and ufed in/lead ' of the folio figures. We have numbered the accompts of the following Ledger, but have not made this ufe of them ; our de/ign being only to refer, by means of them, to the Ledger-accompts as occafion requires. How the Ledger is filled up from the Journal. To tranfport immediately from >he Wa/le-book to the Ledger, would, as has been formerly obferved, be a com¬ plex ta/k, and require too great a meafure of thought and attention ; but the former being firfl reduced to a Jonrnal, the transferring from it to the Ledger becomes eafy, and may be performed by the following RUL ES. 1. Turk to the Index, and fee wheiher the debtor of ' the Journal po/l to be tranfported be written there: If it be not, inferr it under its proper letter, with the number of the folio to which it is to be carried. 2. Upon the folio, and in the head of the fpace allot¬ ted for the accompt, write the title in a large text letta.- fair?"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"(*E) B O O K - K for ornament, making it Dr on the left fide of the folio, and Cr on the right. 3. Record the date in the columns on the margin of the Dr fide, and write the Cr with the word To pre¬ fixed to it, immediately below the title, or other articles formerly ported ; and complete the entry in one line, by giving a fhort hint of the nature and terms of the tranf- txflion, carrying the fum to the money-columns; and in- fert the quantity, if it be an accompt of goods, ire. in the inner columns, and the referring figure in the folio- column. 4. Turn next to the creditor of the Journal port, and proceed in the fame manner with it, both in the Index and Ledger; with this difference only, that the entry is to be made upon the Cr fide, and the word By prefixed to it. 5. The port being thus entered in the Ledger, return to the Journal, and, on the margin, mark the folios of the accompts, writing the folio of the Dr above, and the folio of the Cr below, a fmall line drawn between them, thus, 4. Thefe marginal numbers in the Journal are a kind of Index to the Ledger, and are of ufe in examining the books, and on other occafions. 6. In opening the accompts in the Ledger, follow the order of the Journal ; that is, beginning with the firrt Journal poft, allow the firrt fpace in the Ledger for the Dr of it, the next for the Cr, the third for the Dr ofthe following poft, if it be not the fame with fome of thofe already opened ; and fo on till the whole Jonrnal be tranfported. The above fix rules are formed for Ample ports, where there is but one Dr and one Cr; but may eafily be ap¬ plied to complex ones: e. g. In ports where only one of the terms is complex, the (imple term is entered Dr to, or Cr by Sundries or Sundry-accompts, referring to the journal for particulars. And the fingle Drs or Crs of the complex term, are each of them, in their refpedlive accompts, entered Dr to, or Cr by the Ample term. A- gain, in pofts where both terms are complex, each parti¬ cular Dr and Cr are entered Dr to, or Cr by. Sundry ac¬ compts, with a reference to the journal, as before. And here obfetve, that an article of Sundry-accompts has no referring figure in the folio-column, becaufe it refers to feveral accompts: But this defeft is fupplted by the mar¬ ginal numbers of the Journal, which mull ftill be con¬ futed before the particulars of the indefinite article can be be known. Hour to tranfpofe an account from - one folio to another. When the fpace allotted for an accompt proves too little • that is, when either the Dr or Cr fide, or both, are fo charged* and filled with articles, that they can hold no more ; the accompt muirt be tranfpofed to a new fpace: Which may be done by one or oilier of the methods fol¬ lowing. 1. In all accompts that have-inner columns for the quantities, fuch as Accompt of goods, ire. add up both F. E P I N G. the Dr and Cr fides, and charge the new accompt Dr to the old, for the total of the Dr fide ; and make the old ac¬ compt Dr to the new, for the total of the Cr fide. Thus the old accompt will be evened ; that is, the fums and quantities on both fides will be equal; and the new ac¬ compt will exhibit the fame fums and quantities on its Dr and Cr fides, that the old did, before it was tranf¬ pofed. 2. In accompts that have no inner columns, fuch as Perfonal accompts, Calh-accompt, Profit and Lofs, ire, where the difference betwixt the two fides is only confi- dered, it is fufficient, after adding up both fides, as be¬ fore, to carry the balance or difference only to the new accompt, by making it Dr to the old, for the faid ba¬ lance, if the Dr fide of the old be heavieft ; but if the Cr fide be heavieft, then charge the old accompt Dr to the new. See N° 1. and 61. As/e. The number of the folio on which the new ac¬ compt is opened, muft be inferted in the Index, and alfo in the folio-column of the old accompt; and again, the folio-number of the old murt be written in the folio-co¬ lumn of the new ; that the accomptant may readily turn from theoneto the other, as occafionrequires. How the Books are examined.. An accomptant ftiould be at all imaginable pains in filling up the books, to make lhem exaft and correct: But as errors muft happen, the examination of the books after they are written up becomes absolutely neceffary. I. The Wafte-book being the fiift and fundamental book, the only means left for difeovering errors in it, are, a careful reading of it, and comparing it with the ac- comptant’s memory, or the Book of letters, or Letters of correfpondents, Bills, Invoices, ire. ; or perhaps fome accident or circumftance may happen to bring things to remembrance. And this, with calling up the fums of money anew, is all that can be done. 2 In reviling the Journal, compare each poft with the Wafte-book, to fee if the fums of money be right, and whether the narrative or reafon of the entry be juftly ex¬ ported. Next, Confider whether the true Dr and Cr areafligned; and, after having thus narrowly examined the polls, and correfted what happens to be wrong, re¬ turn to the Wafte-book, and, on the margin oppofite to the revifed port,, make a dafh with the pen, thus, /, to fignify ihat the Journal has been compared with it, and found right. 3. The Ledger is revifed or examined, by comparing it with the Journal, in the manner following Tak the Journal, and, beginning with the'firrt poft, turn (as the marginal numbers dirett) to the folio of the Ledger where the Dr of the faid poft ftands, and fee whether v b - duly entered: And, upon finding it tight ret'rn to 'he Jour¬ nal, and affix to the marginal number of the faid D, a dot or point, thus [.j, to (hew that it has been examined. Next, Turn to the folio where the Cr is ported, and, upon finding it right, or after corre ing it if wrong, return to the Journal, and affix a dot to its referring"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"B OOK-KEEPING. figure in. the margin, for the fame purpofe as before. If there be more Drs or Crs in the poft, proheed the fame way with each of them. And thus go on with the next poll, and after it with the third, &c. till the whole Jour¬ nal and Ledger be eomparcd. As every thing is twiee entered in the Ledger, onee upon the Dr fide of one aeeompt, and again upon theCr fide of fome other aeeompt; it is plain, that the total fum of all the money on the Dr fides will be precifely equal to the total fum of all upon the Cr fides : And there¬ fore the aeeomptant, after revifing the books, is next, for further fatisfaftion, to add up the Dr fides of the whole Ledger into one fum, and the Cr fides into an¬ other. If they agree, it is highly probable that all is right; if they differ, fomething is unqueftionably wrong. This addition of the Dr and Cr fides is, by merchants, called the Trial-balance ; and ought to be made, not fimply by taking the fum of every page, but by fumming the Dr and Cr fides of every aeeount feparately, and then adding thefe on every page into one fum. By going to work in this manner, you lofe no labour; for. when you come afterwards to elofe the aecompts, inftead of adding their Dr and Cr fides anew, you take their funis fronv the trial-balanee. If, after the revife is made, the totals of the Dr and Cr fides agree, the aeeomptant may,, without further trial, conclude the books to be right. But if they differ, his next ftep is to examine the Ledger by itfelf. Whieh is done thus : Beginning with the firft aeeompt, compare the firft article pn the Dr fide with its counter-part (to which the referring figure dire As), and, upon finding them right, or making them fo, affix a dot to the end of the fum, or in the folio or month column of eaeh of them, thus [.], to fignifythat they have been compared^ Proceed in like manner with all the other articles on the Dr fide, and next with thofe upon the Cr fide; and then go on to a new aeeompt, and from it to the following; till the whole Ledger be finifhed. Here obferve, that, in pro- lecuting the examination, all the dotted articles you corqe: to are to be omitted, as having been compared already. The Ledger, being thus examined, if the corrections of the errors found bring the films of the Dr and Cr fides to a ba¬ lance, the books may now be prefumed right; but if not,, fomething is ftill wrong : And there is no way left to difeo- ver the miftake, but a moreeareful refearch of the books. This revifing or examination is what, merchants call Pricking of the books ; and fliould not be put off till the Ledger is filled up, but performed weekly, and in due order ; that is, the Wafte-book fhould be reviled, before it be polled to the Journal; and the Journal ought to be examined, before-it be tranfported to the Ledger; and the revifing of the Ledger finifhed, before the ba¬ lance is begun. How Errors are corsetted. In explaining the method of correcting errors, we fliall join the Wafte-book and Journal together, becaufe .the manner of eorrefting.is the fame in both; and then Ihcw the way of eorredting miftakes in the Ledger. I. Errors in the Wafte-book and Journal may be re¬ duced to fix clafita, and corrected as follows. 5&7 i ft, If the errors be the omiffion of a whole poft, the way to correct or fupply the defect is, to write it in a fe- parate place by itfelf, with a reference to it from the place where it Ihould have been, idly. If only a word or two be wanting, they may be interlined or written up¬ on the margin. $dly, If a whole poft be repeated, or twiee written, it is corrected by cancelling one of them ; but the eaneelling ought to be done in fueh a flight man¬ ner, that the original writing may ftill be legible and di- ftinct. 4 thly. In like manner, if only a word or fentence be repeated, let one of them be flightly cancelled. $tbly t If there be any wrong name, word, or figure, the bell w'ay is, to let the wrong name, word, or figure, Hand as they are, but correct the miftake by a note on the mar¬ gin or foot of the page. 6 thly. If you commit a mif¬ take, and prefently difeover it in the very time of wri¬ ting, the handfomelt way of eorredting it is, not to alter or eancel any thing, but to write the poft or fentence a- - new, beginning with fuch a phrafe as this, I fay ; as in the following example: Sold A. B. I fay, Bought of A. B, II. Errors in the Ledger are of four forts, i Jl, When an article is entered upon a wrong aeeompt : This is to be corrected, firft, by making the other fide of the faid ac- eompt Dr to, or Cr by Error, for the fum of the laid article ; which rectifies this aeeompt: After which, the article muft be entered in due form, in the aeeompt to which it belongs; or rather make the correction thus, viz. eharge the one aeeompt Dr to the other, for fo mueh per error. By either of thefe methods, the error is removed, and the purity of the books reftccred. 2dty, When an article is entered in the right aeeompt, but up¬ on the wrong fide; that is, upon the Dr fide, when ir ihould have been upon the Cr fide, or ' vice verfa ; to correct this, the firft thing to be done is, to remove the error, by making, the other fide of the faid aeeompt Dr to, or Cr by Error, for the fum of the artiele: After which,'...the article muft be entered anew upon the .righb fide, as if no fuch blunder had happened. 3 d ly, When there is an error in a fum of money : This, if it be too little, is corrected by a new eharge on the fame fide, for the defect; and if it be too much, the miftake is rectified by a difeharge on the oppofite fide for the excefs, viz. the aeeompt is debited or credited to, or by ditto perfon , or ditto goods, for fo mueh fliort-polled, or over¬ charged. 4 thly, When an artiele is quite forgot, or ne- gleted, errors of this nature are eafily adjufted, viz. by' making the entry omitted; only obferve, that it is not to be erouded in betwixt two former entries; in order to make it poflefs the place it would have done, had it eome regularly in; for though the order,- whatever it be, earn oeeafion no error in the iflue, yet this interlining would 1 look more confufid and irregular than the difotder of the. date, whieh any perfon ikilled in book-keeping will eafily perceive to have' happened through miftake. . Of balancing the Ledger ,. and raifing from it an- Inventory , to begin a new. Set of Books. Merchants eommonly once a-year balanee or elofe their Ledger, and raife from it the materials of an In-, veatory to a new fet of books, for the enfaing, year Now, ,"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"538 B O O K - K Now, to make the method of doing this plain and intel¬ ligible to a learner, it muft be obferved, that, by the word Balance , merchants underftand the difference be¬ twixt the fums on the Dr and Cr fides of any accompt. Which difference being entered on the defective fide, tlm accompt is faid to be balanced ; that is, to have the fums of the Dr and Cr fides evened, or made equal. And the fides of the feveral accompts throughout the Ledger being thus evened, and the total fums formally fet down on the foot of the accompts, the Ledger is faid to be ba¬ lanced, clofed, or finifhed. Again, in order to under¬ ftand how the new Inventory is formed from the old Ledger, it muft be obferved, that thefe balances or differ¬ ences of the fides of accompts, are of different kinds. In fome accounts, the balance is, the gain or lofs made upon the fale of goods; in fome, the balance is, the price of goods remaining unfold; and in others, it is a debt due to, or by the merchant, <bc. Now, balances of the firft kind, viz. of gain or lofs, muft be diftin- guifhed from the reft, and carried to the Profit and Lofs accompt; which being done, the balance or difference of its fides, will be the gain or lofs made upon one year’s trade, and goes to the Stock-accompt. All the other kinds of balances muft be brought together into one fpace or folio, under the title of Balance-accotfipt , and are the very articles of which the Inventory is made up. The moll natural method of balancing the Ledger is, firft to point out what is contained upon the Dr and Cr fides of each accompt, and confequently what the balances are ; and then, to ftiew the mercantile and approved way of going to work, in clofing the Ledger, collecting the ba¬ lances, and converting them into a new Inventory. This we fhall do in the form of problems. P R O B. I. What the Balances 'in the Accompts of proper Trade are, § 1 . What the Balances in proper domeflic Trade are. X. Cajh-accompt , N° i. and 6l. Contains, upon the Dr fide, the ready money which the merchant had at firft, or when the books were begun ; together with all he has received fince that time. The Cr lide contains all the payments he has made, or the money he has given out. So that the dif¬ ference of the two fides is, the ready money he has by him ; and therefore this accompt is clofed, by being cre¬ dited by Balance, for the faid difference. 2. A n Accompt of Goods, . N° 2. 3. 11. 12 . 14. 18. 20. 21. 27. isc. Contains upon the Dr fide, the prime coft and char¬ ges ; and, upon the Cr fide, the fale or difpofal of them. So that there are here three varieties. 1. When the goods are all difpoftd of, which is known by the inner columns being equal, the difference of its fides is, the gain or lols made upon the fale f and fo is clofed, by charging it Dr to Profit and Lofs, for the gain, if the Cr fide be heavieft; or giving it credit by Profit and E E P I N G. Lofs, for the lofs, if the Dr fide be heavieft. N° 2. 11. 14. 18. <bc. 2. When none of the goods are dif- pofed of, which will appear by the Cr fide being empty, then it is clofed by Balance, for the whole fum on the Dr fide. N° 21. 27. <bc. 3. When only part of the goods are difpofed of, which will appear by the inequa¬ lity of the quantity-columns; this cafe requires common¬ ly two clofing entries, viz, Firft, the accompt muft be credited by Balance, Jor the goods remaining, valued at the prime coft; which equals the inner columns : After this, if the money-columns be unequal, it muft be made Dr to, or Cr by Profit and Lofs, for the gain or lofs made upon what are fold; which evens the outer co¬ lumns, and clofes the accompts. N° 3. 12. Note 1. If the goods are of different kinds or prices, . as they fhould be diftinguifhed, when ported to the Ledger, by different numbers, or feparate inner columns; fo care muft be taken, in balancing the accompt, to mention the kind of goods remaining unfold, and to va¬ lue them at their own prices. Note 2. A merchant may, at any time, know what goods he has on hand, by comparing the inner columns of the Accompts of Goods, without being put to the trouble of infpe&ing his warehoufe, and weighing or meafuring the goods themfelves. Note 3. If there be inlack or outcome of goods, that is, defeCt or excefs in weight or meafure, it will happen, when the goods are all difpofed of, that the in¬ ner columns will not be equal. In this cafe, the ba¬ lance or equality muft be reftored, by inferting as much in the deficient column as will make it equal to the o- ther, writing the words Inlack, Broket Lojl in weight, Ullaged, Outcome , or the like, before it, as the reafon why it is added: but nothing goes to the money-columns. 3. P late and Jewels. This account contains, on the Dr fide, the things of that kind you are poffeffed of; and, like an accompt of goods remaining on hand, is clofed, by being credited by Balance. 4. P erfonal accompts, N° 5. 6. 7. 9. 10. 13. 15. <bc. Contain, upon the Dr fide, the debts due by the per- fon to the merchant, with the payments made upon any other fcore by the merchant to him. The-Cr fide con¬ tains the payments made by the perfon to the merchant, with the debts due by the merchant to the faid perfon, upon any other dealings. So that there are here two cafes. 1 ft, If the D.r fide be heavieft, the difference is a debt due by the perfon to the merchant. N° 13. 24. &c. idly, If the Cr fide be heavieft, the difference is a debt due by the merchant to the perfon. N° 15.57. And- in both cafes the accompt is clofed, by making it Dr to, or Cr by Balance, for the difference of its fides. 5. B ills receivable, N° 25. This is a general perfonal accompt, and contains upon the Dr fide, bills accepted, and payable to the merchant. The Cr fide contains the payments he has received. So that the difference of its fides (if there be any) is, what is yet unpaid: And the accompt is clofed, by giving it credit by Balance, for the faid difference. 6. Bills"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"BOOK-KEEPING. 6. Bills payable, N° 52. This is an accompt of the fame nature with the form¬ er ; and contains, upon the Cr fide, the bills accepted by the merchant, payable to others; and, upon the Dr fide, the payments he has made. So that the difference of the fides (if there be any) is the bills yet unpaid: And the accompt is clofed, by charging it Dr to Ba¬ lance. 7. Bills of Exchange. This accompt exhibits, on the Cr fide, all the bills you draw on your fadtors or correfpondents ; and the Dr fide fhows what of them are accepted, proteffed, or yet out- Handing ; and is clofed, if the fides happen to be unequal, by being debited to Balance, for the bills out-Handing, viz. the bills of whofe acceptance you have hitherto had no advice. 8. Bonds. This accompt exhibits, on the Dr fide, all the bonds you have received, and on the Cr fide, what of them are paid, or out-ltanding ; and is clofed, if the fides happen to be unequal, by being credited by Balance, for the bonds yet unpaid. 9.

Contains, upon the Dr fide, the goods fent off; and upon the Crfide, either the fame goods returned, or ad¬ vice from your correfpondent that he defigns to keep them, or the price fent up. So that either the fides of this accompt are equal, and then the accompt clofes of itfelf; or, if there be any difference, it is owing to your having hitherto had no advice concerning fome of the goods lent off; and in this cafe the accompt is clo¬ fed, by being credited by Balance, for the faid dif¬ ference. 10. Foreign Coin, , N° 26. Contains, upon the Dr fide, the value at which the fcveral pieces are received; and on the Cr fide, the va¬ lue at which they are put off. In doling this accompt, there are three cafes. \\Jl, If the pieces are all difpoled of, the accompt is clofed, by being d.ebited or credited to or by Profit or lofs, for the gain or lofs made by them, idly. If none of the pieces are yet difpofed of, it is clofed by be¬ ing credited by Balance, for the whole value on the Dr fide. 3 dly, If part of them are difpofed of, and part of them yet on hand ; in this cafe, the accompt mull firff be cre¬ dited by Balance, for value of the pieces on hand; and if aiter this the money-columns Hill remain unequal, it mult be debited or credited to or by Profit and Lofs, for the faid difference; which is the gain or lofs made upon the piece's difpofed of. M- Wagers Accompt. Contains, upon the Dr fide, the confignments made when the wagers were entered into. The Cr fide con¬ tains the decifions of the wagers. So that here occur two varieties, viz. \\fl, If all the wagers are determined, the difference of the fides will be the gain made upon thofe decided in favour of the merchant; and the ac¬ compt is clofed, by being charged Dr to Profit and Lofs, for the faid difference, idly. If any of the wagers are yet undecided, the accompt mult lirlt be credited by Ba¬ lance fpr them : After which, if the fides are Hill un- Vo l. I.

A ccompts of Ships , Houfes, and other Pof- fefions, N° 4. Contain, upon the Dr fide, what they coff at firff, or are valued at, with all charges, fuch as repairs, or other expences laid out upon them. The Cr fide contains, (if any thing be writ upon it), either what they are fold or exchanged for, or the profits arifing from them ; fuch as freight, rent, &c. Here there are three cafes, If nothing be written upon the Cr fide, it is clofed, by being credited by Balance. 2 dly, If the Cr fide be fill¬ ed up, with the price of the Ihip, houfe, &c. fold, or otherwife difpofed of, then the difference of the fides is the gain or lofs made upon the fale; and the accompt is clofed, by being debited or credited to or by Profit and Lofs. 3 d ly.

To this accotupt are carried, not only whatever comes in caurfe to it from the Journal, but alfo all the articles of gain and lofs that occfir in doling the Ledger-accompts. After which, the Dr and Cr fides being added up, their difference is the neat gain or lofs made fince the books were begun; and therefore this accompt is clofed, by being debited or cre¬ dited to or by Stock, for the difference of its fides. 16. S tock-accompt, N° 8. As gathered from the Journal, contains, upon the Dr fide, the debts due by the merchant when the books were begun. The Cr fide contains his ready money, ef¬ fects, and debts due to him at the fame time. But then, to this accompt, as it now Hands, there is brought, at doling of the Ledger, the difference of the fides of the Profit and Lofs accompt.

If you incline the goods remaining unfold, or at fea, Ihould appear upon the Balance-accompt, you mull clofe the Accompt of goods and Voyages with Ba¬ lance in company., for the value of the quantity not dif- pofed of, or at fea ; and you may clofe the partners Ac¬ compts in company (which in this cafe will not clofe of themfelVes), either with their Accompts proper, or with Balance in company, as you pleafe. How the Balances are colleded, the Ledger clofed. and a new Inventory formed. When you defign to balance your Ledger, in order to begin a new fet of books, proceed in the manner fol¬ lowing. Take two Iheets or folios of loofe paper, rule them like the Ledger, and write on the heads or tops of them, the titles of the two following Accompts, viz. on the head of the one, Profit and Lofs Dr, and Contra Cr; E E P I N G. on the other, Balance Dr, and Contra Cr. Then, be¬ ginning with the Accompt of calh, go over every accompt in the Ledger, (omitting only the Accompts of Profit and Lofs and Stock, which mull be left open to the lalt), and carry the articles of gain or lofs found on any of them, to the Profit and Lofs Iheet; and the articles of debt, or goods remaining, to the Balance Iheet, withbut touching the accompts themfelves: e.g. Taking from theTrial-ba- lance the fums of the Dr and Cr fides ofthe Calh-aecompt, fubtraft the one fum from the other, and, on the Balance Iheet, make Balance Dr to Calh, for their difference, be¬ ing the ready money in your hands. Again, in an Ac¬ compt of goods that are. all fold, taking the fums of the Dr and Cr fides, fubtrad the one from the other, and, on the other Iheet, make Profit and Lofs Cr or Cr to or by the faid Accompt of Goods, for the difference of its fides. And in this manner proceed with every other ac¬ compt in the Ledger, according to their nature, as ex¬ plained in the lall lection. Having advanced thus far, your next Hep is, to add up the Dr fides of the Profit and Lofs Iheet, and the Profit and Lofs accompt in the Ledger, into one fum, and their Cr fides into another ; and, on the fa*d Iheet, make Profit and Lofs Dr or Cr to or by Stock, for their difference : Which difference being carried to the Stock- accompt, add up its Dr and Cr fides, and carry their difference to the Balance Iheet. Which being done, the total fums of the Dr and Cr fides of the Balance Iheet will be equal to a farthing, if the hooks be right, and the balancing work truly performed: As may be thus demonll rated. It is obvious, that the Balance Iheet, before the ba¬ lance of the Stock-accompt is brought to it, contains, upon the Dr fide, the money and goods you have on hand, or at fea, or in the hands of factors, with the debts due to you ; the articles on the Cr fide are the debts due by you to others : So that the difference of its fides is yourprefent worth, or neat (lock. Now, if the balance of the Stock-accompt be alfo equal to your pre 1 - fent neat llock, it is plain, that it will even the fides of the Balance-accompt. But that it is fo, appears thus. Yonr prefent neat Hock is equal to your neat flock when the books were begun, with the addition of the gain, or diminution of the lofs, made fince that time: but the difference of the fides of Stock accompt, before the balance of Profit and Lofs accompt be brought to it, is your neat Hock when the hooks were begun; and the balance of Profit and Lofs accompt, is the gain or lofs made fince that time; which, confequently, being brought to Stock-accompt, makes the balance of Stock- accompt equal to your prefent neat Hock; and therefore the balance of Stack-accompt evens the fides of Balance- accompt. If, after'the balance of Stock-accompt is brought to Balance-accompt, the fides happen to be Hill unequal, there has unqueftionably fome error been committed; which you mull find out by a careful review of the ba¬ lancing work : for here the error mull lie, fince the books are fuppofed to have been examined, and found right, or made lb, before (he balancing was begun. On the other hand, if the fides of Balance-accompt he equal,"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"B O O K - K all may be prefumed right. There is not, indeed, an abfolute certainty in the cafe: for, if you imagine two millakes committed, either hoth in the articles of Profit and Lofs, or both in the articles of Balance, or one in the former, and the other in the latter, both excelfes, or both defefts, equal, and on oppofite fides, it is plain this would not impede the equality of the Dr and Cr fides of the Balance-accompt. But then this is fo great a chance, that it is more than probable fuch a thing can never happen, and pafs too, without being difeovered. Having brought the two fides of the Balance-aecompt to an equality, which is the tefb of every thing being right, proceed to clofe the Ledger-accompts, thus. Firlt, to the Profit and Lofs c^compt, transfer the articles on the Profit and Lofs meet. Next, at the end of the Ledger, ereft an Accompt of Balance, into which tran- fcribe the Balance fiieet. After which, return to the beginning of the Ledger, and giving the Cafh-aceompt credit by Balance, for your ready mefaey, draw a line crofs the money-columns on- each fide, at the foot of the accompt; below which fet down the total fums, which will be now equal. Prodeed in like manner with all the following accompts, transferring to each the refpe&ive articles that belong to them, from the two Iheets of loofe paper, inferting the referring figures in the folio.-column, and writing the total fums on the foot of the accompt; by which means all the accompts in the Ledger will come to be balanced and doled; that is. evened and finilhed. But here it will be proper to obferve, that merchants, E E P I N G. 593 in balancing their Ledger, do not all go the fame way to work. For fome, inftead of proceeding according to the above directions, clofe their Ledger-accompts, and poll the doling entries to the Accompts of Profit and Lofs, and Balance, all at the fame time. And it mull be owned, that this way, pradtifed with care, will well enough anfwer the purpofe; but to poll the clofing en¬ tries in the firlt place, and then to clofe the accompts, feems to be the furer and better method. The Ledger being now clofed, the next thing to be done is, to begin a new fet of books ; in order to which, a new inventory mull be fetched from your old books, as the foundation of your future trade in the new. Now, it is plain, at firlt view, that the feveral articles on the Dr fide of the Balance-accompt, being the particular items of your effe&s, and debts due to you, make tip the firlt part of the Inventory; and the feveral articles on the Cr fide, except the laft, being the debts due by you to others, make up the fecond part of it: and accordingly in your new Journal, the feveral particulars on the Dr fide mult all of them be made Drs to Stock, and Stock Dr to the feveral particulars on the Cr fide; and Stock - accompt in your New Ledger will Hand thus : Stock Dr, Contra Cr, To Jacob Ruffel.

The Cajh-book. This book is kept in a folio form, like.the Ledger, and ferves to abridge the Cafn-accompt there. On the left-hand page, or Dr fide, Cajh is charged Dr for all the fums received ; and on the right-hand page, Cafij is made Cr for all the linns paid. Once a week, or, which is more ordinary, once a month, this book is polled to the Ledger; or, if you pleafe, firft to the Journal, by two entries, viz. CaJhDt to Sundries, for all the receipts, and Sundries Drs to Cafh, for all the pay¬ ments.

When a merchant in Britain flxips: off imported goods, fuch as tobacco, to Holland, or other places, for fa!e, the invoice fent to the fadlor ufually contains only the marks, numbers, and quantity Ihipped, but nothing of the prime coft or charges ; which in this cafe could not be eafily afeertained; and the want thereof is pretty well fupplied by inftru&ing the fadlor not to fell under fuch a price. But invoices of all kipds of manufactures and goods configned from. Britain to North America or the IVefi Jndies, generally exhibit prime coft and all charges ; which is neceffary, not only as it Serves for a fort of dire&ory to the factor, but dill morefo, in re- g ird Briujh goods are frequently fold, in thofe places at fo. much advance on the invoice prices. 5 .

Upon the payment of any fum, merchants either cancel the line, or, which is better, they write the word Re¬ ceived or Paid upon the margin, or ufc fonie mark of their own,.to lignify that the fum to which it is affixed is paid. 7. The Receipt-book. In this book a merchant takes receipts of the payments he makes. The receipt ffiould contain the date; the iunt re¬ ceived, exprelfed in words at large, and alio in figures in the money-columns ; the reafon why ; . and whether in full or in part; and mitt! be figned by the perfou receiving. But there is no occafion to mention the merchant’s name ; for the book being his own, fufficiently implies that. This book is paged, and the form of it is as follows. 1 . 1360000 Received, July 1. 1769, in part for fugar ,7 the fum of one hundred thirty fix pounds, y per John Stewart.

It is very imprudent in any perfon to fend away a letter of bufinefs, without keeping a double of it to himfelf; and there- E E P I N G. fore, to prevent the bad confequences of fueh a carelefs prac¬ tice, merchants are provided with a large book, In folic, into which is copied verbatim every letter of bufinefs before it be lent off. So that this 'book, together with the letters recei¬ ved-(which mult alfo be carefully kept, in files or boxes,) makes a complete hillory of all the dealings that pafs betwixt a merchant and his correfpondents; which may be very ufcful and neceffary on many occafions. 9. The Pocket-book. This is a fmall book, of a portable fize, which a merchant carries in his pocket when bufinefs calls him abroad to a ta¬ vern, a fair, the country, or other places. In this he fets down the bargains he makes, the expences he is at, the debts he pays, or funis he receives, with every other part of bufi¬ nefs he trail fads while abroad; as alfo any occurrence or piece of news he thinks worth while to record. And when he comes home to his compting-houfe or ihop, he transfers the things contained in this book, each to their pioper places in the Wafte-book, or Books Subiidiary. Fadors of great bufinefs fometimes keep another fmall book, called the Memorandum book. Into this book is co¬ pied, from letters as they conic to hand, (hort notes of the ieveral conimiffions for buying goods contained in them ; and as the commiffions are effected, the notes are croffed, or have fome mark affixed to them. This is more convenient in doing bufinefs, than to be continually running to the letters them- felves. Suppofe a merchant of Lilbon, by his letter, give a commiffion for buying goods, a note of it in the Memoran¬ dum book will Hand thus. LiJlon, iyth June 1769. Out of Carlos Popbain'% letter an order for 4000 yards of ferges, at 8 d. or 8 id. per yard, 20 dozen (lockings, not above 36/. per dozen, <bc. All which to be packed and (hipped for Liffion, con- figned to liimfelf, and marked C. P. In like manner fadors may, and thofe much employed ge¬ nerally do, take a note, from the letters of advice, of all the goods configned to them, either in a feparate place of this book, or in another book of the fame naturel By this means a fador has daily under his eye, both the time when fuch a (hip may be expeded, and the goods (lie brings: And fo is in a readier way of minding to look out for a merchant for them before hand, than if he had only the letter as his remembran¬ cer. An example fallows. Naples, 18th June 1769. In the Profperity, Robert IVilfon matter, filks for ac¬ count of Anthony Carew, marked A. C. N° 122 to 140. The above are the fubfidiary books mod in ufe: But a merchant is not tied down or rettrided to them; he may keep fome. and negled others, or invent more, as the nature of his bufinefs requires, and he finds convenient. * Addendum"},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"BOO ( 6 21 Addendum to the article Book.

It is performed thus : The leaves are firft folded with a folding-ftick, and laid over each other in the order of the lignature; then beaten on a ftone with a ham¬ mer, to make them fmooth and open well, and after¬ wards prefled. They are fewed upon bands, which are pieces of cord or packthread; fix bands to a folio book, five to a quarto*, odtavo, isc. which is done by drawing a thread through the middle of .each fheet, and giving it a turn round each band, beginning with the firft, and proceeding to the laft. After this the books are glued, and the bands opened and jfcraped, for the better fixing the pafteboards; the back is turned with a hammer, and the book fixed in a prefs between two boards, in order to make a groove for fixing the pafteboards; thefe being applied, holes are made for fixing them to the book, which is prefled a third time.

BOOKSELLER,, one who trades in bocks, whether he prints them himfelf, or gives them to be printed by others. Vol. I. No. 26. 3 ) BOO Bookfellers are in many places ranked among the members of uriiverfities, and entitled td the privilege of ftudents, as at Tubingen, Salifburg, and Paris, where they have always been diftinguillied from the vulgar and mechanical traders, and exempted from di¬ vers taxes and impofitions laid upon other companies. The traffic of books was anciently very inconiider- able, in fo much, that the book-merchants of England, France, and Spain, and other countries, were diftin- guifhed by the appellation of Jiationtrs, as having no fhops, but only ftalls and ftands in the ftreets. Du¬ ring this flate, the civil magiftrates took little notice of the bookfellers, leaving the government of them to the univerfities, to whom they were fuppofed more im¬ mediate retainers ; who accordingly gave them laws and regulations, fixed prices on their books, examined their corredtnefs, and punifhed them at diferetion. But when, by the invention of printing, books and bookfellers began to multiply, it became a matter of more confequence, and the fovereigns took the direc¬ tion of them into their own hands ; giving them new ftatutes, appointing officers to fix prices, and granting licences, privileges, <bc.

Boring of 'water-pipes. The method of boring wa¬ ter-pipes is as follows. The poles of alder, which is a very ufeful wood in making pumps, water-pipes, he. being laid on horfes or treffels of a foot height, to reft the auger upon while they are boring, they fet up a lath to turn the leaft end of the poles, to lit them to the cavities of the great end of the others. They turn the fmall ends of the poles about five or fix inches in length, to the fize they intend to bore the bigger ends about the fame depth, viz. five or fix inches. This is defigned to make a joint to Ihut each pair of poles together, the concave part being the female part, and the other part the male of the joint. In turning the male part, they turn a channel in it, or a fmail groove at a certain diftance from the end; and in the female part, they bore a fmall hole to fit over this channel. This being done, they bore the poles through; and to prevent them from boring out at the fide, they flick great nails at each end to be a guide in boring. It is ufual, however, to bore them at both ends; fo that if a pole be crooked one way, they can bore it through, and not fpoil it. Boring, in farriery, an operation in ufe for the cure of wrenched fhoulders in horfes.

BOS, in zoology, a genus of quadrupeds belonging to the order of pecora. The chara&ers of this genus are taken from the horns and teeth. The horns are hol¬ low within, an 3 turned forward, in the form of cref- eents : There are eight fore-teeth in the under jaw, and none in the upper, their place being fupplied by a hard membrane; and there are nd dog-teeth in either jaw. Lmnseus enumerates fix fpecies, viz. 1. The taurus, including the bull and cow, has cylindrical horns, bent outwards, and loofe dewlaps. The bull or male is naturally a fierce and terrible animal. When the cows are in feafon, he is perfectly ungovernable, and often altogether furious. When chaffed, he has an air of fullen majefty, and oft t^ars up the ground with his feet and horns. The principal ufe of the bull is to propagate the fpecies; although he might be trained to labour, his obedience cannot be depended on. A bull, like aftallion, fhould be the mod hand- fome of his fpecies. He fhould be large, well made, and in good heart; he fhould have a black eye, a fierce afpeefl, but an open front; a fhort head; thick, fhort, and blackifh horns, and long fhaggy ears; a fhort and ftraight nofe, large and full breaft and fhoulders, thick and flefhy neck, firm reins, a ftreight back, thick flefhy legs, and a long tail well covered with hair. Caftration remarkably foftens the nature of this animal ; it deftroys all his fire and impetuofity, and fenders him mild and tradable, without diminifhing his ftrength; on the contrary, after this operation, his weight is increafed, and he becomes fitter for the purpofes of plow’.g, <bc. The beft time for caftrating bulls is at the age of puberty, or when they are eighteen months or two years old ; when performed fooner, they often die. However, it is not uncommon to caftrate'calves a few' days after birth. But fuch as furvive an ope¬ ration fo dangerous to their tender age, generally grow larger and fatter, and have more courage and adivity than thofe who are caftrated at the age of puberty. When the operation is delayed till the age of fix, feven, or eight years, they lofe but few of the qualities of bulls, are much more furious and untradable than other oxes, and when the cows are in feafon, they go in queft of them with their ufual ardor. See Plate LII. fig. 2. The females of all thofe fpecies of animals which we keep in flocks, and whofe increafe is the principal objed, are much more ufeful than the males. The cow pro¬ duces milk, butter, cheefe, <&c. which are principal ar¬ ticles in our food, and befides anfwer many ufeful pur¬ pofes in various arts. Cows are generally in feafon, and receive the bull, from the beginning of May to the middle of July. Their time of geltation is nine months, which naturally brings the veal or calves to our markets from the beginning of January to the end of April. However, luxury has falleD upon methods of interrupting this natural courfe, and veal may be had almoft every month in the year. Cows, when improperly managed, are very fubjed to abortion. In the time of geltation, therefore, they trught to be obferved with more than ordinary care, left: they fiiould leap ditches, Neither fhould they be fuffered to draw in the plough or other caniage, which is a pradice in fome countries. They fhould be put into the beft pafture, and Ihould not be milked for fix weeks or two months before they bring forth their young. The Calve ihould be allowed to ‘fuck and follow its mother during the firft fix or eight days. After this it begins to eat pretty well, and two or three fucks in a day will be fufficient. But if the objed be to have.it quickly fat¬ tened for the market, a few raw eggs every day, with hotted milk, and a little bread, will make it excellent veal in four or five weeks. This management of calves applies only to fuch as are defigned for the butcher. When they are intended to be nourifhed and brought up, they ought to have at leaft two months fuck; becaufe the longer they fuck, they grow the ftronger and larger. Thofe that are brought forth in April, May, or June, are the mod proper for this purpofc; when calved later in the feafon, they do not acquire fufficient ftrength to fupport them during the winter. The cow comes to the age of puberty in 18 months, but the bull requires two years: But although they are capable of propagating at thefe ages, it is better to reftrain them till they be full three years. From three to nine years thofe animals are in full vigour ; but when older, they are fit for nothing but to be fed for the butcher. A milk cow ought to be chofen young, flefhy, and with a brifk eye. The heavieft and moft bulky animals neither fleep fp profoundly, nor fo long as the fmkller ones. The fleep of the ox is fhort and flight; he wakes at the leaft noife. He lies generally on the left fide, and the kidtiey of that fide is always larger than the other. There is great va¬ riety in the colour of oxen. A reddifh or black colour is moft efteemed. The hair fhould be gloffy, thick, and foft; for, when otherwife, the animal is either not in health, or has a weakly conftitution. The beft time for inuring"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"BOS (62 s ) BOS inuring them to labour is at the age of two and a half or three years. The ox eats very quick, and foon fills his firft fto- mach ; after which he lies down to ruminate, or chew the cud. The firft and fecond ftomachs are continuations of the fame bag, and very capacious. After the grafs has been chewed over again, it is reduced to a kind of mafh, not unlike boiled fpinage, and under* this form it is fent down to the third ftomach, where it remains and digefts for fome time ; but the digeftion is not fully com- pleated till it comes to the fourth ftomach, from which it is thrown down to the guts. The contents of the firft and fecond ftomachs are a colledtion of grafs and other vegetables roughly macerated; a fermentation however foon commences, which makes the grafs fwell. The communication between the fecond and third fto mach is by an opening much fmaller than the gullet, and not fufficient for the paffage of the food in this ftate. Whenever then the two firft ftomachs are diftended with food, they begin to contract, or rather perform a kind of re-aftion. This re-adtion compreffes the food, and makes it endeavour to get out: Now the gullet being larger than the jwfiage between the fecond and third fto¬ machs, the prefture of the ftomach neceftarily forces it up the gullet. The adtion of ruminating, however, ap¬ pears to be in a great meafure voluntary; as animals of this kind have a power of increafing the re-adtion of their ftomachs. After the food undergoes a fecond maftica- tion, it is then reduced into a thin pulp, which eafily paffes from the fecond to the third ftomach, where it is ftill further macerated; from thence it paffes to the fourth, where it is reduced to a perfedt mucilage, every way prepared for being taken up by the ladteals, and converted into nourifhment. What confirms this ac¬ count of chewing the cud is, that as long as thefe ani¬ mals fuck or feed upon liquid aliment, they never rumi¬ nate ; and in the winter, when they are obliged to feed upon hay and other dry victuals, they ruminate more than when they feed-upon frefh grafs. Bulls, cows, and oxen, are fond of licking themfelves, efyecially when lying at reft. But this pradtice fhould be prevented as much as poflible; for as the hair is an undigeftible fubftance, it lies in the ftomach or guts, and is gradually coated by a glutinous fubftance, which in time hardens into round ftones of a confiderable bulk, which fometimes kills them, but always prevents their fattening, as the ftomach is rendered incapable of digeft- ing the food fo well as it ought. The agef of thefe animals may be diftinguilhed by the teeth and horns. The firft fore-teeth fall out at the age of fix months, and are fncceeded by others of a darker colour, and broader. At the end of fixteen months, the next milk-teeth likewife fall out; and at the beginning of the fourth year all the fore-teeth are renewed, and then they are long, pretty white, and equal : However, as the animal advances in years, they become unequal and blackifh. At the end of three years, the horns of oxen fall off, and new ones arife, which continue as long as they live. The hqrns of oxen four years of age are final! pointed, neat, and fmooth, but thickeft near the Vol. I. No. 27. ... 3 head: This thick part next feafon is pufiied further from the head by a horny cylinder, which js alfo termi¬ nated by another fwelling part, and fo on, (for as long as the ox lives, the horns continue to grow); and thefe Iwellings become fo many annular knots by which the age may eafily be reckoned: But, from the point to the firft knot mult be counted three years, and every fuc- ceeding knot only one year. Ox-beef is very nourilhing, and yields a ftrong aliment; the flelh of a cow, when well fatted and young, is not much inferior. Bull-beef is hard, tough, and dry; for which reafon it is not much ufed for food. Veal is well tailed, eafyof digeftion, and rather keeps the body open as otherwife. The northern countries of Europe produce the beft cattle of this kind. In general, they bear cold better than heat; for this reafon, they are not fo plenty in the fouthern countries. There are but few in Afia to the fouth of Armenia, or in Africa beyond Egypt and Bar¬ bary. America produced none till they were carried there by the Europeans. But the largeli are to be met with in Denmark, Podolia, the Ukrain, and among the Calmuck Tartars; likewife thofe of Ireland, England, Holland, and Hungary, are much larger than thofe of Perfia, Turkey, Greece, Italy, and Spain; but thofe of Barbary are leaft of all. In all mountainous countries, as Wales, the Highlands of Scotland, the black cattle are exceedingly fmall, but hardy, and when fattened make excellent beef. In Lapland, they are moftly white, and many of them want horns. The bull, cow, and ox, generally live about 14 or ij years. 2. The bonafus, has a long main ; its horns are bent round towards the cheek, and not above a fpan in length. It is about the fize of a large bull, and is a native of Africa and Afia. When enraged, he throws out his dung upon dogs or other animals that annoy him; the dung has a kind of cauftic quality which burns the hair off any animal it falls upon. 3. The bifon, has likewife a long thick mane, which' covers the whole neck and breaft on each fide. The horns are turned upwards, and exceedingly large ; there is a large protuberance or bunch on the back; his eyes are red and fiery, which gives him a furious afpedt. He is fierce, cruel, and fo bold that he fears nothing. It is unfafe to hunt him but where the trees are large enough to hide the hunters. He is a native of Mexico and Flo¬ rida. 4. The grunniens, or hog-cow, has cylindrical horns, bent backwards. The body is fo hairy, that the hair hangs down upon its knees like a goat. The tail has a kind of mane on each fide. The colour of the body is black; but the front is white. It has bridles on its back, tail, and hind-legs. It is an inhabitant of the North of Afia. 5. The bubalis, or buffalo, has large black herns bent backward and inward, and plain before. The hair on the back is very hard, but thinly fcattered over the body. It is a native of Afia. But they are tamed in. Italy, and ufed for the fame purpofes as black cattle in other countries. They draw carriages, and are guided 7 T by"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"BOS ( 626 ) BOS by a rope tied to a ring thruft through their nofes. The buffalo is larger than an ox, has a thicker body, and a very hard hide. His pace is flow; but he will carry a great burden. They feed in herds like cows, and yield plenty of milk, of which very good butter and cheefe is made. Their flefh is pretty good, but not to be compared to beef. The wild buffalo is a very fierce and dangerous animal; he often attacks tra¬ vellers, and tears them to pieces. However, they are not fo much to be feared in woods as in the plains; becaufe their horns, which are fometimes ten feet long, are apt to be entangled in the branches of trees, which gives thofe who are furprifed by them time to efcape. They are excellent fwimmers, and will crofs the largelt river without any difficulty. They run wild in great troops on the coaft of Malabar, for which reafon ftrangers are allowed to hunt and kill them at pleafure. 6. The indicus, or little Indian buffalo, has horns fliorter than its ears, a bunch on its back, and no mane. It is about the fize of a calf fix months old, and ufed in the Eaft Indies for drawing coaches, BOSA, orBossA, a town of Sardinia, fituated on its w.eflcrn coafl, at the mouth of a river of the fame name; in 8° 30' E. long, and 40° 1 j' N. lat.

BOSNIA, a frontier province of Chriftendom, divided between the Houfe of Auftria and the Turks; that part of it lying eaftward of the river Unna, belonging to the Turks; and the reft of it, lying weftwardof that river, to the Auftrians. BOSPHORUS, in geography, denotes, in general, a narrow fea, or, channel, fe’parating two continents, and ferving.as-a communication between two feas. Bosphorus is more particularly ufed for the ftraits of Conftantinople, .which divides.Europe from Afia. This was the original Bofphorus; fo called becaufe oxen could fwim over it : And from the refernblance between it-and the (freights of Kaffa, thefe 1 aft'were anciently called the Cimmerian, as the former were the Thracian Bofphorus. BOSQUETS, in gardening, groves fo called from lof- clato, an Italian word, which fignifies a little wood. They are compartments in gardens, formed by branches of trees, difpofed either regularly in rows; or wildly and irregularly, according to the fancy of the owner. A bofquet is either a plot of ground inclofed with pa- lifadoes of horn-beam, the middle of it being filled with tall trees, as elm or the like, the tops of which make a tuft or plume ; or it confifts of only high trees, as horfe-chefnut, elm, &c. The ground fliould be kept very fmooth and rolled, or clfe covered with grafs, after the manner of green-plots. In planting bofqucts, care fliould be taken to mix the trees which produce their leaves of different (hapes, and various (hades of green, and hoary or meally leaves, fo as to afford an agreeable profpeCt. Bofquets are only proper for fpa- cious gardens, and require a great expence to keep them up. BOSS, or Bosse, in fculpture. See Relievo. BOSSAGE, in architecture, a term ufed for any flone that has a projeCture, and is laid rough in a building, to be afterwards carved into mouldings, capitals, coats of arms, foe. Boffage is alfo that which is otherwife called ruftic work, and confifls of (tones which advance beyond the naked, or level, of the building, by reafon of inden¬ tures or channels left in the joinings. Thefe are chiefly ufed in the corners of edifices, and thence call¬ ed ruftic quoins. The cavities or indentures are fometimes round, fometimes chain-framed, or bevel¬ led, fometimes in a diamond form, and fometimes in¬ clofed with a cavetto, and fometimes with a liftel.

BOTALE foramen » in anatomy, a name given to the B O T B OTANY is that branch 0/ natural hiftory which treats of the ufes, characters, clalfes, orders, genera, and fpecies of plants. Before we explain the mod approvetj method of di- S E C T. J. U S E S A^THkn this fcience is carried no further than to di- ’ * ftinguiffi one plant from.another, its ufes are few and uninterefting. However, even this exercife is attended with fome advantages.. It is the firft, and a neceflary ftep towards difeovering tbofe of a more noble kind. It is the rudiments of the fcience ; and mult therefore be acquired before we can expeCt to arrive at any improve¬ ment that may be ufeful to mankind. This part of bo¬ tany is likewife more complete and fyftematic than many other branches of natural hiftory. By means of the claf- fical and generic marks, we are enabled in a few minutes, to difeover the name of any plant, from whatever quar¬ ter of the globe it may be brought. T&s is exceedingly curious, and altogether incredible to people unacquaint¬ ed with the nature of the fcience. When we have learnt the name, we are then in a capacity of confulting authors with regard to the peculiar properties of the plant, fo far as they are known. Befides, there is an elegance and fymmetry in plants,, which give rife to many agreeable emotions. Their parts, like thofe of animals, are poffeffed of all the beau¬ ties of utility, regularity, uniformity, order, and pro¬ portion. Neither is there any clafs of, natural bodies in which the beauty of variety makes fuch a. capital fi¬ gure. This variety is chiefly exhibited in the magnitude, figure, colour, odour, and tafte of vegetables. It is then fore natural to exped, that the ftudy of botany ffiould have fome influence in improving, our tafte. But as botany is confeffedly a branch of natural hifto¬ ry, the bot-anift ought not to confine, his refearches to the mere names and charaders of plants. He ought to inquire into their qualities. Thefe qualities,, indeed,, when we talk of vegetables in general, are exceedingly numerous, and the inveftigation of many of them attend¬ ed with fuch difficulty, that no perfon, however induftri- • foramen ovale, from Botall, phyfician to Charles IX, to whom the difeovery of it is aferibed.

ANY. ftinguilhing plants, it will not be improper to inquire in¬ to the nature of the fcience, and what ufeful or orna¬ mental purpofes may be expected from the cultivation of it. OF B O T A N Y. ous, can ever exped to unfold the whole. But this cir- cumftance does not afford any argument for lofing fight of utility altogether.. On the contrary, it is the only thing that can give dignity to the fcience', or entitle it to be ranked as a branch of natural hiftory. There is but little pleafure in ftudying a^Ycience which is already car¬ ried to its higheft pitch of improvement. The profped of difeovering any thing that may be ufeful to mankind ftimulates our induftry,. and makes us profecute our re- fearches with vigour and alacrity. A botanift, or an inquirer into the'nature and proper¬ ties of vegetables, ought to dired his views principally towards the inveftigation of ufeful' qualities. For this purpofe, in examining plants, he fliould confider whe¬ ther they, be poffeffed of any qualities which may render them of ufe in food, in medicine, or in, any of the arts. Thefe are objeds worthy the attention of philofophers. Let us examine the afliftance that may be expeded from the ftudy of botany with regard to thefe important articles. 1 . Food. —Many animals are endowed with an inftinc-. tive faculty of readily diftinguifhing whether the food that is prefer.ted to them be noxious or falutary. Mankind' have no fuch inftind. They muft have recourfe to expe¬ rience and obfervation, But thefe are not fufficient to guide us in every cafe.. The traveller is often allured by the agreeablenefs of fmell and tafte to eat poifonous fruits. Neither will a general caution not to eat any thing but what we know from experience to be falutary, anfwer in every emergency. A Blip’s company, in want of provifions, may be thrown upon an uninhabited coaft, or a defert ifland. Totally ignorant of the nature of the. plants which they meet with;—difeafes, or fcajcity of animals, may render it abfolutely neceffary to make ufe of vegetable food;—the confequcnce is dretdfu!: They muft"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"< 5 2 8 B O T mull: firft eat, before any certain conclufion can be formed. This is not the defcription of danger arifing from an imagi¬ nary fituation. Before the vegetables that grow in Ame¬ rica, the Eaft and Weft Indies, &c. became familiar to our failorg, m£qy lives were left by trials of this kind: Nei¬ ther has all the information received from experience been fufficient to prevent individuals from ftill falling a prey to ignorance or raihnefs. If the whole fcience of botany were as complete as feme of its branches, very little Ikill in it would be fuf¬ ficient to guard us infallibly from committing fuch fatal miftakes. There are certain orders and claffes which ' are called natural, becaufj every genus and fpecies com¬ prehended under them are not only diftinguifhed by the fame charatteriftic marks, but likewife poflefs the fame qualities, though not all in an equal degree. For ex¬ ample : Shew a botanift the flower of a plant whole calix is a double-valved glume, with three ftamina, two pi- ftils, and one naked feed, he can pronounce with abio- lute certainty, that the plant from which the flower was taken bears feeds of a farinaceous quality, and that they may be fafely ufed as food. In like manner, (hew him a flower with twelve or more ftamina, all inferted into the internal fide of the calix; though it belonged to a plant growing in Japan, he can pronounce, without hefi- tation, that the fruit of it may be eat with fafety. On the other hand, (how him a plant whofe flower has five ftamina, one piftil, one petal or flower-leaf, and whofe fruit is of the berry kind, he will tell you to abftainfrom eating it, becaufe it is poifonous. Many other examples might be given : but wc fha.Il referve them till we come to the medical qualities. Fafts of this kind make botany not only a refpedlable, but a rnoft interefting fcience. The French and fome other nations ufe a greater variety of vegetable food than the Britilh. This practice is attended with many advan¬ tages. The greater number of vegetables that are made ufe of in any country, the poor have the greater number of rcfources when there happens to be a fcarcity of any particular kind. It likewife affords an opportunity of a more univerfal cultivation. When agriculture or gar¬ dening is confined to J few plants, there is great hazard from bad feafons and other unavoidable accidents, befides the certain lofs arifing from allowing fuch foils as are im¬ proper for raifing the ufual plants to lie unemployed. Though we are principally influenced by example in in¬ troducing the culture of new plants; yet the advice and direction of the botanift may be ufeful. From his know¬ ledge of the qualities of plants that grow in other coun¬ tries, he is enabled to guefs, with tolerable exadnefs, whether they will agree with the foil or climate in which they are propofed to be cultivated. He can do more: he can point out what particular fpecies of the plant will be mod eafily naturalized. Befides, without having re- courfe to the example of foreign countries, the botanift can point out a number of plants that grow wild in his own country, which might be cultivated with advantage, as food either for men or cattle. For example, in the whole clafs called diadslpbia by Linnaeus, which includes the polygala, or milk-wort; the anthyllis, or kidney-vetch.; ANY. the orobus, or heath-peafe; the lathyrus and vlcia, which comprehend a number of plants of the Vetch-kind; the ornithopus, or bird’s-foot; the hedyfarum, or St-foin; the aftragalus, or wild liquorice; the medicago, or lu¬ cent; the lotus, or bird’s-foot trifoil, &c.; the leaves are excellent food for cattle, and the feeds may be ufed either by men or cattle. In like manner, all the feeds of the grafs kind, which belong to the triandria clafs of Linnaeus, and are very numerous, make excellent food for men, and the leaves afford the belt pafture for cattle. Many of the plants belonging to this clafs are not culti¬ vated in this country, though we have a great variety of them growing, wild. It has been frequently obferved, that poor people, du¬ ring a fcarcity of corn, have been induced to fill their bellies with fubftances that were both pernicious and loathfome, while they were trampling under their feet plants that would at once have afforded good nourifh- ment and been highly grateful. This condud could proceed from nothing but their ignorance of the nature and effeds of tlrefe plants, and from their not being able to diftinguifh the noxious ones from the falutary. It is the duty of every man to point out the remedy for calamities of this kind, efpecially when it is not impoflible that the caufes which produced them may exift in fome future pe¬ riod. For this purpofe, we fhall fubjoin a fliort lift of native plants that may be eat with fafety and advantage. Salicornia Europsea, or marfh-famphire, jointed glais- wort, or faltwort. This plant grows plentifully near the fea-coafts, and eats very well with fait and vinegar. Veronica becabunga, or common brook-lime. This plant, w'hich grows in marfhes, is commonly gathered in the fpring, and eat as a fallad. Valeriana locufta, lamb’s-lettuce, or corn-fallet, grows in corn-fields and pafture-grounds. The leaves are rec¬ koned more wholefome than the common lettuce culti¬ vated in our gardens. Scirpus maritimus, or round-rooted cyperus, grows near the fea-fhores. The root confifts of a number of knots, which, after being dried and grinded, have been frequently ufed as bread when provifions were fcarce. Bromus fecalinus, or field brome-grafs, grows in vaft quantities in rye-fields, efpecially after the rye is cut down. The feeds of this plant, mixed with grain of a better quality, make very good bread: But if the quan¬ tity of brome-grafs feeds be great; the people who ufe the bread are apt at firft to be affeded with a flight de¬ gree of intoxication; but this effed ceafes, after being a little accuftomed to the food. Feftucafluitans, or flote-fefeue-grafs, grows in ditches and marfhy places. In Sweden and Germany, the feeds are ufed in broths and gruels, on account both of their nutritive quality and agreeable flavour. When grinded, and made into bread, they are efteemed little inferior to wheat or oats. Triticum repens, common wheat-grafs, dog’s-grafs, quick-grafs, or couch-grafs, grows fo plentifully in our fields, that it is a great objed with farmers to root it out.. The roots of this plant, after being wafhed, dried, and grinded, have often been ufed as bread in a dearth of corn. With"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"B O T With regard to the other kinds of grafs, the feeds of them may be fafely ufed as food; but fome of them are fo fmall, that a fufhcient quantity cannot eafily be collefted. Campanula, or bell-flower. Nine or ten fpedes of bell-flower grow in Britain. Both the roots and leaves, when boiled, efpecially before the ltalk grows up, may be ufed. Chenopodiura bonus henricus, common Englifh mer¬ cury, or all-good, grows almoft every where. This plant is ufed.in broth by the country-people, in place of cabbage or other pot-herbs. When the young leaves and ftalks are drefled with butter, they are not inferior, in their flavour and nutritive power, to afparagus or fpinage. Eryngium maritimum, fea-holly, or eryngo, gene¬ rally grows near the fea-fhore. The young twigs, pre¬ pared as afparagus, are grateful to the tafte, very nou- rifhing, and give vigour to the body.- Daucus carota, wild carrot, or bird’s-neft, grows in every field; It is the fame fpecies with the.carrot culti¬ vated in gardens, and is equally nourifhing. Heracleum fphondylium, or cow-parfnip. The inha¬ bitants of Poland and Lithuania make a fermented liquor of the feeds and leaves, which the poorer fort ufe as ale. The inhabitants of Camfcatka eat the ftalks, after peel¬ ing off the bark. Carum carvi, or caraways, grows# in meadows and pafture-grounds. The young roots of this plant are more agreeable to the tafte than the parfnip, and there¬ fore might be of great fervice to the poor in a dearth of provifions. Convallaria polygonatum, or fweet-fmelling Solomon V feal, grows in the cliffs of rocks. The roots are made into bread, arid eat by the inhabitants of Lapland, when corn is fcarce. The Turks ufe the young ftalks as afpa¬ ragus. Bunium bulbocaftanum, earth-nut, kipper-nut, pig¬ nut, or hawk-nut, grows plentifully on lea-grounds, the banks of rivers, fides of hills, tic. The roots are very fweet, afford excellent nourifliment, and may be eat ei¬ ther raw, boiled, or roafted* Vaccinium uliginofum, the great bilberry-bulh, grows upon high grounds. The berries are much eat by chil¬ dren; but when taken in too great quantity, are. apt to occafion a giddinefs and headach. Vaccinium myrtyllis, black whorts, whortle-berries. or bilberries, grows in woods. The berries have a fine flavour, and may be eat with fafety. Vaccinium vitis idea, red whorts, or whortle-berries, grows s o n hills. The berries are eat in the autumn, and many people make an excellent jelly of them. Polygonum viviparum, fmall billort, or fnake-weed, grows upon high grounds. The roots may be prepared into bread. In Lapland and the northern parts of Eu¬ rope, it is principally eat along with the flefh of ftags and other wild animals. Spergula arvenfis, or corn-fpurrey, grows in corn¬ fields, efpecially in fandy foils. 'In Norway, they col- left the feeds of this plant, and make them into bread. Sedum rupeftre, orSt Vincent’s rock ftone-crop, grows on high grounds. The Swifs cultivate this plant, and ufe it as a pot-herb. Vol. I. Numb. 27. 3 A N Y. £29 Primus padus, wild clufter-cheiry, or bird’s-cherry, grows in wood* and hedges. Some people cat the ber¬ ries with fait. Prunus fpinofa, the black-thorn, or floe tree, grows ip hedges and woods. The berries are very auftere.; but the leaves are- tender, and, when gently toafted, may be ufed in place of tea. Prunus cerafus, or black-cherry, grows likewife in woods and hedges. The berries are eat both in a crude and dried ftate. When this plant is wounded, a gum exfudes from it nearly of the fame quality with gum- arabic. Dr Haffelquift informs us, that above loo.men, when befieged in an Egyptian town, were preferred alive for more than two months, without any other fuftenance than they derived from the ufe of this gum. Crataegus aria, or the white bean-tree, grows in woods. The berries are eat by the pealants ; and in Sweden they are prepared and ufed, as bread when there is a fcarcity of corn. Crataegus oxycantha, the white thorn, or hawthorn, grows every where in woods and hedges. The berries, when dried and grinded, are fometimes made into bread; but it is apt to bind the belly too much. Sorbus aucuparia, the quicken-tree, or mountain-afh, grows in woods. Very good cyder is made of the ber¬ ries*-, and, when dried, they make very wholefome bread. Rofa canina, red-flowered dog’s-rofe, or hip-tree, grows in hedges. The berries afford excellent nourifli¬ ment, and may ejther be eat .in a crud? ftate, or dried and made into bread. Spiraea filipendula, or drop-wort, grows in pafture- grounds and the fides of hills. The roots of this plant, which are compofed of fmall tubercles like peafe, whep dried and grinded, make tolerably good bread. Ranunculus ficaria, pile-wort, or lefler cejadine, grows in pafture-grounds, tic. The Norwegians colleft: the leaves in the fpring, and ufe,them in broth. Origanum vulgare, or wild marjoram, grows in hedges and among brufh-wood. The leaves of this plant, when toafted, and infufed in boiling water, have fuch a relem- blance to tea, that it is difficult to make 3 diftinftion. As tea is fo univerfally ufed in diet, it is much to be re¬ gretted that the ladies cannot be prevailed upon to prefer this or fome other of our own plants, and thereby faye fome millions fterling' annually to their country. Stachys paluftris, or clown’s alj-heal, grows in njarlhes arid the banks of rivers. The roots are fucculent, and may be ufed either boiled, or dried and made into bread. Melampyrum arvenfe, or purple cow-wheat, grows in corn-fields. Bread is fometimes made of the feeds; but it is a little bitter. Sinapis arvenfis, wild jrnuftard, or charlock,; grows plentifully in corn-fields, tic. The leaves of this plant are often ufed in broth. Crambe maritima, or fea-colewort, grow? in fandy ground near the fea-ftiore. The leaves, when young and tender, may be ufed in place of cabbage; but when top old, are apt to make the head giddy. Malva rotundifolia, or dwarf-mallow, and malva fyl- veftfis, or common mallow, are every where to be met with. The leaves of both thefe plants may.be ufed in -broth. 7 U Orobus"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"6^0 B O T Orobus tubcrofus, woodpeafe, or heath-peafe, grows in pafluie-ground, woods, hedges, tec. The roots, when boiled, or made into bread, afford excellent nou- rifhment. Pifum maritimum, or fea-peafe. In the year 1655, when a great famine prevailed in England, the poor peo¬ ple in Oxfordfliire lived principally upon the feeds of this plant. Trifolium repens, or white clover, grows in meadows and pafture-grounds. The flowers of this plant, when dried, make tolerably good bread. * Trifolium pratenfe, purple or honeyfuckle clover. The Scotch, when oppreffed with a famine, ufed bread made of the flowers of this plant. And indeed bread may be made of the flowers of every plant belong¬ ing to the clafs called diadeiphia , which comprehends near 600 fpecies. Hipochraslis maculata, or fpotted hawkweed, grows on high pafture-grounds. The peafants of Norway ufe the •leaves as cabbage. Sonchus oleraceus, or common fow-thiftle. The young leaves eat exceedingly well when boiled. Tragopodon pratenfe, or yellow goat’s-beard, grows in meadows ind pafture-grounds. The roots, when dug up before the plant flowers, have a fine flavour, and are very nourilhing. Aretium lappa, or burdock. The young ftalks, when the bark is taken off, eat, when boiled, like afparagus. Some people ufe them in a crude ftate, with oil and vi¬ negar. Carduus paluftris, or marfh-thiftle. Almoft all the fpecies of thiftle may be ufed in the fame manner as the burdock. Urtica dioica, or common nettle. The ufe of this plant as a pot-herb is well known. Quercds robur, or common oak. Acorns, during a famine, have often been made into bread. Fagus fylvatica, or beach tree. Bread has fornetimes been made of the nuts; but unlefs they be well dried, the bread made of them will produce a flight degree of intoxication. Corylus avellana, or the hafel-nut tree. Every body knows the agreeable flavour and nutritive quality of ha- iel nuts. Pinus fylveftris, or Scots fir. The Norwegians and others make bread of this tree in the following manner: They ftleCt fuch trunks as are moft fmooth and have teaft refin; they take off the bark, then dry it in the fhade, and afterwards to aft it over a fire, and grind it into meal. They generally mix with it a. little oat-meal, or barley. This bread, made of fir bark, is not only ufed in a fear- city of provifions, but is eat at all times by the poorer fort. Lichen iflandicus, or eryngo leaved liver wort, grows among heath and upon high grounds. The inhabitants of Iceland have long ufed this plant, both boiled, and in the form of bread. ANY. Lichen vellens, or fleecy liver- w ort, grows upon hills', In time of famine, the inhabitants ufed this plant for food. Fungus, or mufhroom. The fpecies of this plant are very numerous. Some of them aie ufed by the rich; rather as a feafoning, than as food. When taken in tod great quantity, they are abfolutely indigeftible ; and, un,- lefs thrown up from the ftomaeh, will prove as fatal as the moft deadly poifon. The poor, therefore, who would be very apt to fall into this error, had better re¬ frain from the ufe of mufnrooms altogether. From this fhoi t lift of efculent plants •'that grow wild in our own country, we fee how liberally we are provi¬ ded with refources in cafe of a fcarcity of the vegetables ufually cultivated for food, and at the fame time the ad¬ vantages that might be derived from a very flight.degree of knowledge in botany. Many of thefe plants grow beft in foils which cannot be employed for railing corn of any kind. Befides, they are exceedingly hardy, and fuffer but little from feafens, which in a gi eat meafure deftroy the more delicate plants which we cultivate with fa much labour and expence. It may be further remarked, that many improvements in agriculture and the ufeful part cf gardening might be expected from propagating a tafte for refearches into the nature and properties of vegetables. 2 . Medicine.— It is an unhappy cipcumftance, that the bulk of phyficians in all age&hsve been more remark¬ able for their attachment to. the abftrufe and ufelefs parts of the fcience, than to the nature and cure bf dif- eafes, the proper objects of their profcilion; Inftead of difputing in folio how fuch a plant cures fuch a difeafe, had they exerted their induftry and genius in afeertain- ing the faft, and then proceeded to make further inqui¬ ries into the qualities of other fimples, the practice of phyfic would not have been a thing of fuch a fluctuating nature as it ever has been, and ftill continues to be. Many practitioners, fome of them men of confiderabls abilities, affeft to defpife the fcience of botany, alledging that it affords no afliftance to their art; and that it is very ufelefs to load their memories with a long catalogue of hard names, without being a whit the wiier with regard to the medical properties. Befides, they imagine every Angle genus and fpecies of the whole vegetable tribes to be poffeffed of peculiar and diftinCt properties ; and that it would require the labour of a whole life time to afeertain the virtues of a few plants. It muft indeed be confeffed, that the writers and teach¬ ers of botany have not been fufficiently careful to prevent reflections of this kind. The technical part of the fci¬ ence ingroffes their chief attention: If the virtues are talked ©f, it is only in a curfory manner : The only thing that can render the fcience refpeftable, is either totally omitted in their fy.ftems, or difpatched in a line or two. But we are happy to find, that the fcience, begins now to get fonae footing in this country.

The Diadelphia clafs forms the jyth natural order. This clafs comprehends above 500 fpecies ; and, as was obferved above, the feeds of every one of them are efcu- lent, the leaves afford excellent pafture for cattle, and not one of them have any poifonous quality. The Syngenesia clafs, or 21ft natural order, Con¬ tains a very great number of fpecies. The virtues of l'ome plants belonging to this clafs are faid to differ con- fiderably. The bardana, carlina, tuffilago, arnica, ci- chorium, fcorzonera, taraxacum, <bc. are fuppofed to be deobftruent, and are kept as fuch in the fhops. But the greateft number of them are bitter and ftomachic ; e. g. the abfinthium abrotanum, artemifia, fantolina, biilfamita, tanacetum eupatorium, matricaria, chamo- milla, acttlella, verbefina, <bc.

The roots of thefe are ufed with this intention by practitioners. The Amentacete Acifolije, or 15th natural or¬ der, are refinous; e. g. the pinus, abies, juniperus, cu- preffas, &c. They are all warm ftimulants and diuretics. Th e v irt ue s 0 f the C r y p t o G a m 1 a cl afs, which compre- hends the 61 ft, 62d, 63d, and 64th natural orders, are moftly of a fufpicious nature. Hardly any of the Slices are efculent; their fmell is difagreeable, and they are faid to kill worms. All the mufei, except the lichen iflan* dicus, are improper for food. Some of the fungi are eat; but they are a very dangerous food. Plants which have their nedtaria Separate from the flowers, are commonly poifonous ; e. g. the epimedium, nigella, aquilegia, aconitum, monotropa helleborus, &c. Thofe plants which are called lattefcent, from their oozing out a whitifh juice upon being wounded, are ge¬ nerally poifonous •, e. g. the euphorbia, papaver, peri- ploca, cynanthum, drc. But thofe which are called femiflofculo/a: by Tournefort, are of a milder nature; e.g. ladtuca, hieracium, crepis, leontodon, <bc. Befides natural claffes and orders, which prefuppofe fome acquaintance with botany, we are provided with other means of discovering the general qualities of plants. The ferlfations of fmell and tafte give us fome intima¬ tion of the nature and qualities of plants. An agreeable tafte or fmell is feldom accompanied with noxious quali¬ ties ; on the other hand, when lhefe fenfes are difagree- ably affe&ed, the qualities are generally more or lefs noxious, being either purgative, emetic, or poifonous. Plants that have a fweet tafte are generally nutritive; thofe that have a fait tafte are warm and ftimulant. Plants of an acrid tafte are corrofive; but, when de¬ prived of their acrimony by drying, fome of them become fit for food. Bitter plants are alkaline, ftomachic, and Sometimes of a fufpicious nature. Acid plants are cool¬ ing, and allay thirft; but thofe of an auftere tafte are aftringent. Even the colour and afpedt of plants throw fome light upon their nature Flowers, or fruit of a red colour are generally acid. Yellow flowers indicate a bitter tafte. Plants that have green flowers are crude; thofe of a pale ANY. colour are commonly infipid; thofe of a white colour are generally fweet; and thofe whofe flowers have a gloomy and difmal afpedt, are moftly poifonous. Thefe examples naturally fuggeft the following obferva- tions.—The Creator of the univerfe hath endowed us with fufficient abilities for inveftigating the virtues of plants, and applying them to the cure of difeafes and other ufeful pur- pofes, even on the fuppofition that we were obliged to afeertain the virtues of every fingle plant by experiments. But this labour, though pradticable in a courfe of years, and under proper regulations, is greatly abridged. The information afforded by the fenfes is confiderable. Our inquiries are ftill further aflifted by the general diftribu- tion of vegetables into tribes and families. The mutual relation and connediion of thefe tribes depend not upon fancy or conjedlure: The relations are fo ftrongly mark¬ ed by the fimilarity of their flowers, fruit, and fenfible qualities, that they are confpicuous at firft fight, A perfon unacquainted with medicine, from this view/ of the virtues of plants, will be apt to imagine, that bo¬ tany is the only road to that fcience; and of courfe that every phyfician muft either be a good botanift, or a bad practitioner. The thought is natural, and, with fome limitation, not unjuft. The common pradlice of phyfic does not require an extenfive fltill in the virtues of plants. A certain number of vegetables and other fubftances are kept in the fhops, and recommended for particular purpofes in difpenfatories and books of pradlice; It is the bufinefs of the pradlitioner to have a general ac¬ quaintance with thefe, and to preferibe them according to the cuftom of the times. But inveftigations into the nature and properties of fimples or drugs, require more time than can be beftowed by men of bufinefs. When¬ ever any fcience is converted into a trade, and the ftudy of it confined to people who muft live by it, there is little profpedt of improvement. This has been the fate of phy¬ fic. Every body difpenfes medicines ; but few are none inquire into their virtues. Some valuable medicines have been difeovered. But by whom? Not by phyficiansj but by favages, old women, priefts, and chymifts. Un¬ til, therefore, the ftudy of phyfic be confidered as i. branch of natural hiftory, and cultivated by people who have time to make experiments, the fcience muft conti¬ nue to be vague, defultory, and limited in its utility. Botany has always been confidered as a branch of na¬ tural hiftory. But, as was formerly obfervdd, the ufe¬ ful part of it hath been too much negledted. The vir¬ tues of plants may be fuccefsfully inveftigated without an extenfive knowledge in all the branches of the medical art. To propagate a tafte for inquiries into the nature and properties of vegetables, would therefore lay the moft folid foundation for improvements in medicine. 3. Arts.— The application of the qualities of vege¬ tables to the various mechanical aats affords a moft ex¬ tenfive field for ufeful obfervation.

This fhort flcetch of the utility of botany with regard to Food, Medicine, and the Arts, will be fufficient to fug- geft the many advantages that may be expefled from the cultivation of it. The objects prefented by the fcience are curious, refpe&abLe, and ufeful. The natural hillory of plants is not even confined to the above important ar¬ ticles. It is ftridtly connefted with agriculture and gar¬ dening. The ftrudlure of vegetables, the foils that natu¬ rally produce particular kinds, things that promote or retard their growth, are effential parts of their natural hiftory. Hence a fchool of botany, efpecially when fufficient at¬ tention is paid to the ufeful part of the fcience, merits the higheft encouragement from the public, and ought to be attended by farmers, landed gentlemen, gardeners, be. as well as by phyficians and philofophers. s e c t:"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"BOTANY. ^35 SEC T. II. Of the Method of reducing Plants to Classes, Orders, Ge¬ nera, and Species; and of invefligating their gemeric and specific names by certain marks or characters. \"VX/T obferved in the former feftion, that in the pro- ’ * grefs of this part of botany many different me¬ thods had been followed by different authors. Caefalpi- nus, R .y, Bauhinus, Van Royan, Ricinus, Tournefort, Linnseus, Sauvages, have each adopted a peculiar me¬ thod of charafterizing and claffing plants. It would be foolifh to dill raft the attention of the reader by an ex¬ planation of all thele methods. We (hall therefore pro¬ ceed to explain that of Linnaeus, which is perhaps the only one now taught in Europe. This method of reducing plants to clafles, genera, and fpecies, is founded upon the fuppofition that vege¬ tables propagate their fpecies in a manner firoilar to that of animals. Linnaeus endeavours to fupport this hypothefis by the many analogies that fubfift between plants and a- nimals, which lhall be more particularly pointed out it. the third feftion. It is from this circumftance that Lin¬ naeus’s fyffem of botany has got the name of the Jexual ffftem. The names of his dalles, orders, <bc. are all derived from this theory. He calls, the flamina of flowers the males, or the male parts of generation ; and the pi- ftils females , or the female parts of generation. Plants whole flowers contain both male and female parts, are faid to be hermaphrodites , See. His clafles, orders, and genera, are all. derived from the number, fuuation, pro¬ portion, and other circumftances attending thele parts, as will appear from the following fcheme.

Hence they naturally admit of a divifion into the follow¬ ing orders, viz. gymnofpermia, comprehending fuch as have naked feeds ; and angiofpermia , which comprehends fuch as have their feeds covered, or inclofed in a capfule. The, 15th clafs is divided into two orders, viz. the Jiliculofa, or thofe which have a (hurt filiqua or pod; and xhtfeliquefa, or. thofe which have a longer filiqua. The orders of the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 20th clafles, are t^ken from the number of (lamina, e. g. monodel- phia pentandria, decandria, polyandria, fee. The Syngenesia, or 19th clafs, confrfts of plants whofe flowers are compounded of a great number of fmall flowers or flofcules inclofed in one common calix. The orders of this clafs are, Polygamia a-qaalis , or fuch whofe flofcules are all fur- nifhed with (lamina and pidils. Polygamia fpuria, comprehends thofe which have her- _maphrodite flofcules in the dilk, and female flofcules in the margin.' This circumdance is made the foundation of the three following orders. 1. Polygamia fuperflua, includes all thofe whofe hermaphrodite flowers in the ANY. dilk are furnilhed with digmata, and bear feed; and whofe female flowers in the radius likewife produce feeds. 2. Polygamia fruferanea , include fuch as have hermahprodite feed-bearing flofcules in the dilk ; but whofe flofcules-in the radius, having noiligmata, are bar¬ ren. 3. Polygamia necejjaria , is the reverfe of the former; The hermaphrodite flowers in the di(k want digmata, and are barren ; but the female flofcules in the radius are furniflied with digmata, and produce feeds. Polygamia ftgregala, many flofcules inclofed in one coipmon calix, and each of the flofcules likewife furnifli¬ ed with a perianthium proper to itfelf. Monogawia, this order confids only of feven genera, viz. the drumphia, feriphium, corymbium, jafione, lo¬ belia, viola, and impatiens ; none of which have proper¬ ly compound flowers, but are ranked under this clafs purely from the circumdance of having their damina uni¬ ted by the antherai. The orders of the jfft clafs are partly taken from the number of damina, and partly from the names and cha¬ racters peculiar to fome of the other clafles, e. g mo- ncecia triandria, moncecia fyngenefia, moncecia gynandria. The orders of the 23d are all taken from clailical characters, e.g. polygamia moncecia, polygamia ...tecia, and polygamia tricecia. The 24th, or Cryptogam'ia clafs, is divided into the four following orders: i.Ftikes, comprehending all plants that bear their feed in the back or edges of the leaf, and thofe that are called capillary plants. 3. Muf- ci , which comprehends all the mofs kind. 3. Alga, in¬ cluding the lichens, fuci, and many, others whofe parts of fructification are either altogether invisible or exceed- , ingly obfeure. 4. Fungi, comprehending all the mu(h- room tribe. Having thus explained the method of reducing plants to their clafles and orders, we (hall proceed to inform the young botanift how to invefligate the genus. This depends upon minuter diftinCtions, and requires more at¬ tention. But it is impoflible to invefligate the genera, without being previoufly acquainted with a confider- able number of terms. All the terms neceflary for this purpofe belong to .the parts of fructification. To attempt to give an idea*by words of the parts to which particular terms are applied, would not only.be difficult, but, in a great meafure, ufelefs, efpecially to fuch as are totally ignorant of botany. We (Hall therefore give a lift of the terms themfelves, with proper references to, the figures of the things fignified by them, which will both be (horter, and more intelligible than the moft ac¬ curate defeription that language is capable of.

Rheum Palmatum, or True Rhubarb. See Plate LVIII. The flower of this plant has no Calix. The Corolla dd, confifts of one petal, narrower at the bafe, not perforated, and divided in the margin into fix obtufe fegments, one lefs and one larger al¬ ternately; the petal is marcefcent, i. e. decays, but does not fall off till the feeds be ripe.

The Pistillum f, has a (hort three-fided germen. It can hardly be Paid to have any ftyli; but has three re¬ flected, plumofe (hgmata. The Pericarpium is wanting. Each flower contains but one large, three-fided, acute feed g, with a membranaceous edge. The number of ftamina determines this plant to belong to the Enneandria clafs; and the number of Stig¬ mata fixes its order to be Trigynia. The other parts of the above defcription clearly demonftrate the genus to be the Rheum or Rubarb, and fufficiently di- Itinguifh it from the Laurus, Tinus, Caffyta, and Bu- tomus, the only other genera belonging to this clafs. The Specific mark is taken from the leaves, which are palmated (58), and lharp and tapering at the points. There are but five fpecies of Rheum, none of whofe leaves are palmated, except the fpecies now de¬ ferred. But though the above, defcription be fufficient for af- certaining the genus and fpecies of this valuable plant, there are other reafons for giving a complete botanical defcription of the whole parts of it. The true rhubarb, though of the moil extenfive ufe in medicine, was never known in this country till the year 1762, when Dr Mounfey brought fome feeds from Ruflia, and gave them to Dr Hope profeffor of medicine and botany in Edin¬ burgh. Dr Hope fowed them in the botanical garden, and collected about 30 feeds from one of the plants, which rofe to eight feet in height. This plant is now propagating jn the botanic garden, in the garden of Sir Alexander Dick, and many other gardens in Scotland. The root is found, by repeated trials, to be equally powerful in its operation as the beft foreign rhubarb; and we have the greateft reafon to hope, that in a fliort time this plant will be fo univerfally cultivated as to pre¬ vent the future importation of it. The firfl: botanic de¬ fcription we have of the true rhubarb was publilhed by Dr Hope in the philofophical tranfaClions for the year 1765 * ; which w r e Ihall tranfiate into Englilh. * Vid. Phil.

III. Of the S A S many philofophers and botanifts deny that fuch a thing as the diftin&ion of fexes takes place in vege¬ tables, it will be neceffiary to give a narration of the ar¬ guments employed by both parties on this fubjeft. We (hall begin with the arguments in favour of the fexes. Linnaeus, like every perfon attached to-a parti¬ cular do&rine or theory, is at great pains in tracing the notion of fexes in plants to the remoteft periods of antiquity. He informs us, that Empedocles, Anaxago¬ ras, and other ancient philofophers, not only attributed the diftin&ion of fexes to plants, but maintained that they were capable of perceiving pleafure and pain. Hippocrates and Theophraftus are next introduced as difiinguifliing the conyza, the abies, the filix, &c‘ into male and female. The latter of thefe writers affirms, that the fruit of the female palm will not germinate un- lefs the pollen of the male be ffiaked over the fpatha of the female, previous to the ripening of the feed. Diofcorides takes notice of a male and female mandra- gora, inercurialis, ciftus, drc., Pliny does not confine his views of fex to animals, but exclaims, that every thing this earth produces is charac¬ terized by the diftindtion of fex. From the days of Pliny to thofe of Cadalpinus, who lived in the 16th century, the analogy between the vege¬ table and animal feems to have been entirely negledted. Cxfalpinus tells us, that the males of the oxyeedrus, taxus, mercurialis, urtica, and cannabis, are barren; and that the females of thefe plants only bear fruit. After Casfalpinus, we find Dr Grew and Sir Thomas Millington engaged in a converfation concerning the uti-' ANY. 64} foot-ftalks arife, to be diftribnted in the fame manner. c, is a flowering branch feparated from the (lem. The Taste, Odour, and Colour of the Root are precifely the fame w ith thofe of the foreign rhubarb. The Taste of the Flowers is aftringent, herbaceous and fubacid; they have no fenfible fmeli. The Taste of the Leaves is bitterifh, aftringent, and- herbaceous; the tafte of the Ribs or Nerves is acid, bitterifh, and very ungrateful —the tafte of the Stem is a little four. We have now pretty fully explained the method of reducing plants to daffies, orders, genera, and fpecies, according to the fexual fyftem of Linnaeus. The man¬ ner in which this explanation has been executed was fug- gefted by the difficulties which naturally occur to a per¬ fon unacquainted both with the fubjedt and the fyftem. Although this manner has not, fo far as we know, been hitherto attempted, we hope it will not be the lefs accep¬ table to the public, efpecially as it is likely to be more ufeful to the botanical ftudent. It only now remains to make the reader more fully ac¬ quainted with the origin and nature of the fexual fyftem. E X E S of PLANTS. lity of the ftamina and ftyli of plants. The refult of this converfation was the mutual agreement of thefe two eminent naturalifts, that the ftamina and ftyli of vege¬ tables were analogous to the organs of generation in ani¬ mals, and that they were adapted by nature to anfwer the fame purpofes. Dr Grew, in his anatomy of plants, after enumerating the analogies between plants and ani¬ mals, concludes, that the pollen probably emits certain vivific effluvia, which may ferve for the impregnation of the feeds. Mr Ray gave a further fandlion to the dodtrine of fexes, by concurring with Grew, and adding fome fur¬ ther illuftrations from analogy. In the-year 1695, Camerarius attempted to prove the fexes of plants But, as he truiled folely to ti*: palm- tree, and withal feemed to be doubtful as to the authen¬ ticity of the fadt, he cannot be c^nfidered as having done, any thing in confirmation of the fexual hypothefis. Mr Morland, in the year 1703, adopted the fame hy¬ pothefis; but gave it a new modification, by fuppofing that the pollen contained the feminal plant, in miniature; and confequently, that one pollen at leaft behoved to be conveyed into every feparate feed before it could be pro¬ perly impregnated. Analogy and the ftrudture of the parts are the only arguments he employs. • Some years after this, Mr GeofFroy wrote a treatife on the fexes of plants: But as he advanced nothing new, we (hall take no further notice of him. Vail Lint, in the 1717, j-udicioufly confidering that the canal in the (lyliis of moft plauts was too narrow to admit the pollen itfclf, republiffied Dr Grew’s theory of impregnation by means of a fubtile feminal aura. Thefe"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"6 44 B O T Thefe are the fentiments of the principal botanifts •with regard to the generation of plants, till the celebra¬ ted Linnaeus made his appearance as a botanical writer, who has extended the idea fo far as to compofe a com¬ plete fyftem upon it. Although Linnaeus can have no claim to the fuppofed difcovery of the fexual hypothefis, his being precifely the fame with that of Dr Grew, yet, as he is the chief fup- porter and improver of this doftrine, we fhall give a fuc- cinft narration of the arguments he makes ufe of in or¬ der to prove that vegetables propagate their fpecies by a regular commerce of fexes. In a treatife, intitled, Sponfalia Plant arum, publifhed as an inaugural difiertation by Wahlbom, in the firft vo¬ lume of the Amo? nit at es Academics, all the arguments made ufe of by Linnaeus in hi$ Fundamenta Botanica and other works, are collected artd arranged in one view. But as Wahlbom honeftly attributes all the merit ofi^his differtation to his great mailer, we fhall here drop his name altogether, and give the arguments as the proper¬ ty of Linnaeus, by whom they were originally employed. Linnaeus, then, firft attempts to Ihow, that vegetables are endowed with a certain degree of animal life; and, lecondly, that they propagate their fpecies in a. manner limilar to that of animals. “ That vegetables are really animated beings,” fays he, “ mull be obvious at firft fight ; becaufe they pof- fefs all the properties contained in that'accurate definition of life laid down by the great Dr Harvey, namely. Vita ejl fporitanea propulfto humor um. But univerfal experi¬ ence teaches, that vegetables propel humours or juices : Hence it is plain that vegetables muft be endowed with a certain degrees of animal life.” Not trufting*folely to a fyllogifin founded on a defini¬ tion, Linnaeus proceeds to fupport the life of vegetables by arguments drawn from the following particulars in their oeconomy • the firft of which he intitles “ Nutritio. — -The very idea of nutrition implies a propulfion of humours, and, of courfe, the idea of life. But vegetables derive their nourifhment from the earth, air, esc. and confequently muft be confidered as living creatures. 2. ALtai. —Every animal muft not only begin to exift, and have that exiftence diffolved by death, But muft likewife pafs through a number of intermediate changes in its appearance and affections. Infancy, youth, manhood, old aye, are ch,ir afterifed by imhecillity, beau¬ ty, fertility, dotage; are not all thefe vicifEtudes con- ipicuous in the vegetable world ? Weak and tender in infancy ; beautiful and falacious in youth; grave, ro- buft, and fruitful in manhood ; and when old age ap¬ proaches, the head droops, the fprings of life dry up, and, in fine, the poor tottering vegetable returns to that tlujl from whence it fprung. “ 3. Motus. —No inanimate body is capable of felf- motiou. Whatever moves fpontaneouily is endowed with a living principle ; for motion depends on the fpontaneous propulfion of humours, and where-ever there is a fpon¬ taneous propulfion of humours, there alfo is life. That vegetables are capable of motion is evident from the fol¬ lowing faffs 1 Plants,, when confined within doors, al- A N Y. ways bend towards the light, and fome of them even at*- tempt to make their efcape by the windows. The flowers of many plants, efpecially thofe of the fyngenefia clafs, purl’ue the fun from eait to weft, rejoicing in his beams. Who then can deny that vegetables are poflef- fed of living and felf-moving powers ? “ 4. Morbus. — The term difeafe means nothing more than a certain corruption of life: It is well known, that vegetables are fubjeft to difeafes as well as animals : When over-heated, they turn thirfty, languilli, and fall to the ground: When too cold, they are tormented with the chilblain, and not unfrequently expire : They are fometimes afflifled with cancers ; and every plant is infefted with lice peculiar to its fpecies. “ 5. Mors. —Death is oppofed to life, the former being only a privation of the latter. Experience ihows, that every living creature muft die. But, as vegetables are daily cut off by internal difeafes and external inju¬ ries ; as they are fubjeft to death from the attacks of hunger, thirft, heat, cold, &c. with what propriety could vegetables be thus faid to die, unlefs we allow that they previoufly lived I “ 6. Anatomia. —Under this article we are referred to Malpighius and Grew for the organic fibres, mem¬ branes, canals, veficles, &c. of plants, as additional proofs of their living powers. “ 7. Organization —Vegetables not only propel hu¬ mours, but alfo prepare and fecern a number of different juices for the fruit, the nedtar, isc. analagous to the va¬ rious fecretions in animal bodies.” From thefe fads and obfervations, Linnaeus concludes, that plants are unqueftionably endowed with life as well as animals; and then proceeds in the following manner to (hew how thefe animated vegetables propagate their fpecies. After difeufling the long exploded dodtrine of equivo¬ cal generation, he lays hold of another maxim of Dr Harvey, viz. Ornne v'tvum ex ovo. —“ It being fully e- vident,” fays he, “ from the foregoing chain of reafon- ing, that vegetables are endowed with life, it neceffarily follows, agreeable to this maxim of Harvey’s, that eve¬ ry vegetable muft in like manner derive its exiftence from an egg. But as vegetables proceed from eggs, and as it is the diftingui/hing property of an egg to give birth to a being fimilar to that which produced it, the feeds muft of courfe be the eggs of vegetables. “ Granting then that the feeds of vegetables are. in¬ tended by nature to anfwer the fame end as the eggs of animals, and confidering at the fame time that no egg can be fecundated without receiving an impregnation from- the male, it follows, that the feed or eggs of vegetables cannot be fecundated by any other means. Hence alfo the neceflity of vegetables being provided with organs of generation. But where are thefe organs fituated ? The. anfwer is eafy:—We have already found impregnated feeds within the flowers of plants ; and it is natural to expedt that the genitalia Ihould not be at a great diftance. Now, as copulation atways precedes birth, and every flower precedes the fruit, the generating faculty muft be aferibed to the flower, and the birth to the fruit.

Thefe affirmations he attempts to eftabliffi by the following, arguments; the firft of which he terms “ 1. P race dent ta. —The antherae, or vegetable teftes, always precede the fruit; and as foon as the antherae come to maturity, which conltantly happens before the maturity of the fruit, they continue to throw out their pollen as long as the flower lafts; but decay and fall off whenever the fruit comes to perfection. “ 2. Situs .—The antherae of all plants are uniformly fituate in fuch a manner that the pollen may with the greateft facility fall upon the Itigma or female organ. “ 3. Tempus. — The antherae and Itigmata always flourilh at the fame time, whether the flowers be of the hermaphrodite or dioicous kind. “ 4. Localumenta. —When the antherae are diffeCted, they difcover as great a variety of ftru&ure as the peri carpia or feed capfules : For fome of them have one cell, as the mercury; fome two, as the hellebore, (sc. “ 5. Cdftratio. —If all the antherae be cut off from an hermaphrodite plant, juft before the flowers begin to expand, takifig care at the fame time that no plant of the fame fpecies grows near it, the fruit will either prove en¬ tirely abortive, or produce barren feeds. “ 6 . Figurd. —When the pollen of different plants is examined by the microfcope, it exhibits as great a variety of figures as is difcoverable in the feeds them- f elves “ The accumulated force of thefe arguments”, con¬ cludes Linnaeus, “ amounts to a full demonllration that the antherae are the teftes, and that the pollen is the femen or genitura of vegetables. “ The male organ being thus inveftigated, we hope,” fays Linnaeus, “ that none will hefitate to pronounce . the ftigma to be the female organ, efpecially when the following obfervations are fufficitntly attended to. “ T he piftillum is compofed of the germen, ftylus, and ftigma The germen being only a kind of rudiment of the future foetus or feed, ceafes to exift as foon as the flower comes to maturity. Neither is the ftylus an effential part, as many flowers have no ftylus. But no fruit ever comes to maturity without the affiftance of the ftigma. It follows, that the ftigma muft be the female organ adapted by nature for the reception of the pollen or impregnating fubftance. This will appear ftill clear er from the following chain of reafoning. “ ' • Situs. —The ftigmata are always fituate fo that the pollen may with moft eafe fall upon them. Befides, it is remarkable, that in moft plants (though not in all) the number of the ftigmata exactly correi'ponds with the loculamenta or cells of the pericarpium. “ 2. Tempus. —Here the obfervation, that the ftigmata and antherae conftantly flourilh at the fame time, is re¬ peated. “ 3. Decidentia. —-The ftigmata of moft plants, like the antherae, decay and fall off as foon as they have dis¬ charged their proper function ; which evidently fhows, Vol. I. Numb. 27 3 A N V. 64 $ that their office is not to ripen the fruit, but folely to anfwer the important purpofe of impregnation. “ 4. Abfcijfo .—The argument here is precifely the fame with the caftration of the antherae ; and the refult is likewife the fame, namely, the deftruCtion of the fruit. “ Thefe arguments,” concludes Linnseus, “ are fufficient to demonftrate, that the ftigma is the female organ of generation, or that organ which is fuited for the reception and conveyance of the femen to the vegetable eggs. Hence, plants may be faid to be in aftu veneris , when the antherae, or tefticuli, fpread their pollen over the ftigma or female vulva \" To (how how the coitus of vegetables is effected, ib our author’s next objeCt of inveftigation. He affirms, that the pollen is conveyed, by means of the wind or in- feCts, to the moift ftigma, where it remains until it dif- charges a fubtile fluid, which, being abforbed by the veflels of the ftigma, is carried to the feeds or ova, and impregnates them. His proofs are taken from the fol¬ lowing particulars. “ 1. Ocnlus .—When the flowers are in full blow, and the pollen flying about, every one may then fee the pollen adhering to the ftigma. This, he illuftrates by mentioning as examples the viola tricolor, iris, campa¬ nula, (sc. “ 2. Proportio. — The ftamina and piftilla, in moft plants are of equal heights, that the pollen, by the inter¬ vention of the wind, .may, with the greater facility, fall upon the ftigma. “ 3. Locus. —The ftamina of moft plants furround the piftillum, to give the pollen an opportunity of falling on the ftigma at every breeze of wind. Even in the mo- noecia clafs, the male flowers ftand generally above the female ones, to afford an eafier conveyance of the pol¬ len to the ftigma. “ 4. Tempus It is remarkable that the ftamina and piftilla conftantly appear, at the fame time, even in plants belonging to the monoecia clafs. “ 5 Pluviee. —The flowers of moft plants expand by the heat of the fun and fhut themfelves up in the even¬ ing or in rainy weather. The final catife of this muft be. to keep the moifture from the pollen, left it fiiould ■ be thereby coagulated, and of courfe prevented from be¬ ing blown upon the ftigma. “ 6. Palmicolee .—That the cultivators of palm trees were in ufe to pull off ,the fpadices from the males, and fufpend them over the fpathae of the females, is at efted . by. Theophraftus, Pliny, Profper Alpinus, Kempfer, and many others. If this operation happened to be neglect¬ ed, the dates were four and deftitute of nuts. Kemp¬ fer adds this Angular circumltance, that the male fpa- dix, after being thoroughly dried and kept till next lea- fon,- ftill retained its impregnating virtue. “ 7 - Flores nutantes. —As the pollen is fpecifically heavier than air, fuch flowers as have their piftillum longer than the ftamina, hang down, or incline to one fide,, e. g. the fritillaria, campanula, (sc. An eafy ad- miinon of the pollen to the ftigma, is the final caufe of . this appearance. “ 8.

Omnium florum genuina confderatio. —Here .a number of particulars are recited. We (hall confine our- felves to thofe that are mod ftriking and applicable to the fubjedt. “ When the flowers of the male hemp are pulled off before thofe of the female are fully expanded, the fe¬ males do not produce fertile feeds. But as a male flower is fometimes found upon a female plant, this may be the reafon why fertile feeds are fometimes produced even af¬ ter this precaution has been obferved. “ The tulip affords another experiment to the fame purpofe.—Cut off all the anthcras of a red tulip before the pollen is emitted; then take the ripe antherae of a white tulip, and throw the pollen of the white one upon the (ligma of the red; the feeds of the red tulip being thus impregnated by one of a different complexion, will next feafon produce fome red, fome white, but mod va¬ riegated flowers.” In the year 1744, Linnaeus publifhed a defeription of a new genus, which he called peloria, on the fuppofition of its being a hybrid or mule plant, e. a plant produ¬ ced by an unnatural commixture of two different genera. The root, leaves, caulis, <bc. of this plant are exceed¬ ingly fimilar to thofe of the antirrhinum linaria; but the flower and other parts of fru&ification are totally differ¬ ent. On account of its fimilarity to the linaria in every part but the flower, Linnaeus imagined it to have been produced by a fortuitous commixture of the linaria with fome other plant, although he has never yet been able to condefccnd on the father. This doftrine of the produc¬ tion of mule plants has fince been greatly prized and carefully propagated by Linnaeus and the other fupport- ers of the fexual hypothefis. In the third volume of The Amoenitata Academica, there is a complete differta- tion, intitled, Plant* Hybrids, wherein the dodrine of vegetable mules is much improved and extended. This aiffertation contains a lift of 47 mules, with their fuppo- fed fathers and mothers. For example. The Veronica Spuria is faid to be a mule p lant begot by the verbena offcinalis upon the veronica maritima. The delphinium hybridum, a mule begot by the aconitum napellus upon t the delphinium elatum. The ardotis calendula, a mule begot by the calendula pluvialis upon the ardotis triftis. The afclepias nigra, a mule begot by the cynanchum acu- tum upon the afclepias vincetoxicum, <bc. From the examples given in this differtation, Linnteas draws this Angular conclufion, that only two fpecies of eath genus exifted ah origine; and that all the variety of fpecies which now appear have been produced by unna¬ tural embraces betwixt fpecies of different genera. Under this head, Linnaeus likewife quotes from Ray the ftory of Richard Baal gardener at Brentford. This Baal fold a large quantity of the feeds of the braflica florida to fevgral gardeners in the fuburbs of London. Thele gar¬ deners, after fowing their feeds in theufual manner, were furprifed to find them turn out to be plants of a different A N Y. fpecies from that which Baal made them believe they had purchafed; for, inftead of the brafica florida, the plants turned out to be the braflica longifolia. The gardeners, upon making the difeovery, commenced a profecution of fraud againft Baal in Weftminfter-hall. The cour t found Baal guilty of fraud, and decerned him not only to re- ftore the price of the feeds, but likewife To pay the gar¬ deners for their loft time, and the ufe of their ground. “ Had thefe judges (fays Linnaeus) been acquainted with the fexuail hypothefis, they would not have found Baal guilty of any crime, but would have aferibed the acci¬ dent to the fortuitous impregnation of the braflica florida by the pollen of the braflica longifolia.” Linnaeus next proceeds to celebrate the utility of in¬ fers, becaufe they convey the pollen of the male to the ftigma of the female. “ In this way,” fays he, “ it is reafonable to think that many dioicous plants are impreg¬ nated. Nay, even the hermaphrodites themfelves are greatly obliged to the different tribes of infedts, which, by fluttering and treading in the corolla, are conftantly fcattering the pollen about the ftigma. “ Upon the whole,” then, concludes Linnaeus, “the coitus of vegetables is evident to a demonftration. This coitus is nothing more than the conveyance of the pollen to the ftigma, to which it adheres till it burfts and dif- charges a fubtile elaftic fluid. This fluid or aura is ab- forbed by the veficJs of the ftylus, and carried diredtly to the ovarium or germen, where the myfterious work of impregnation is fully compleated.” These are the arguments employed by Linnaeus and other advocates for the fexual commerce of vegetables.— Let us next attend to thofe employed by the oppofers of this hypothefis. It is admitted by Pontedera, Dr Alftoo, <bc. that fome of the acients applied the terms male and female to feveral plants. But then they deny that thefe terms con¬ veyed the fame ideas to the ancients that they do to the moderns. Male and female, when applied to plants, W'ere to the ancients mere terms of diftindtion, ferving only as trivial names to diftinguilh one fpecies or variety from another. The ancients were ignorant of the very chara&ers which conftitute the difference between what is cal'.ed a male and female plant among the modems. Theophraftus, Diofcorides, Pliny, and, in a word, the whole ancient bontanical writers, confound the very no¬ tion of the modern fexes \\ they call the real female, or feed-bearing plant, the mate\\ and the male, or barren plant, the female. Nay, they have even applied the terms male and female to many plants which bear no¬ thing but hermaphrodite flowers. Such is the nature of this controverfy, that it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, but by ex¬ periments made upon dioicous plants. If a female plant- can produce fertile feeds without having any communica¬ tion with the pollen of the male, the ufe of this pollen, with refpedt to the impregnation of feeds, muft of necef- fity be entirely fuperfeded. Now, both Camerarius and Dr Alfton tried thefe ex¬ periments with the fame fuccefs. Thofe two eminent bounifts took female plants of the mercury, fpinage, and hemp,."},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"B O T hemp, tranfplanted them at a great diftance from any males of the fame genus, and befides had them inclofed by double rows of hedges. The refult was, that each of thefe plants produced great quantities of fertile feeds. Tournefort made the fame trial upon the Inpulus, Mil¬ ler upon the bryony, and Geoffroy upon the mays; and all of them declare that the feeds of thefe plants were as fertile as if they had been furrounded by athoufand males. Linnaeus, in his firft argument for the coitus of plants, refers every man to the evidences of his fer.fes. “ Do we not fee, (fays he) the ftigma of almoft every hermaphrodite flower covered over with the pollen or im¬ pregnating fubftance ? Do not we fee the parietaria, the urtica, fee. by violent explofions, difeharging their pol¬ len in the open air, that it may be carried in that ve¬ hicle to the ftigmata of their refpedive females ?”—All this is admitted by the oppofers of the fexes; but then they deny that thefe explofions, fee. are intended to create any intercourfe between the male and the female ; and further alledge, t.hat this ejedion of the pollen is in¬ tended by nature to throw off fomething excrementitious, or at leaft fomething, which, if retained, would prove noxius to the fructification. Linnaeus takes his fecond argument from the propor¬ tion which the ftamina bear to the ftylus, alledging that they are generally of the fame height.—This observa¬ tion is not only contrary to experience, bur, allowing it to be universal, no conclufion can be drawn from it either for or againft the fexual hypothefis. The third argument is taken from the locus or fituation of the ftamina with refped to the ftylus ; “ and as the male flowers in the monoecia clafs ftand always above the female flowers, it muft be concluded (fays Linnaeus) that the intention of nature, in this difpofition of the parts, is to allow a free and eafy accefs of the pollen to the ftigma.”—But the ftamina cannot be faid to furround the piftillum in the monandria and diandria clafles : And the pofition of the male flowers in the monoecia clafs is a mere chimera; for in the ricinus, one of the examples which Linnaeus mentions in confirmation of his dodrine, the female flowers ftand uniformly fome inches above the males. That the ftamina and piftilla generally come to per¬ fection at the fame time, and that this happens even in the dioicous plants, is Linnaeus's fourth argument. But, as it is acknowledged by Linnaeus himfelf, that there are many exceptions with refped to this fad, the oppofers of the fexual hypothefis alledge that it carries the btft an- fwer in its own bofom. The fifth argument is founded on the cireumftance of fome flowers fhutting up their petals in rainy or moift evenings.—But many flowers do not fhut themfelves up, either in the night or moift weather, as the paflion-flower, fee. The lychnis nodiflora, mirabilis peruvianar, fee. open their flowers in the night, and fliut them at the approach of the fun. Hence this is another final caufe evidently perverted to fupport a favourite hypothefis. We come now to the culture of the palm-tree, which is the fixth and raoft plaufible argument employed by the fexualifts. Herodotus, Theophraftus, Pliny, and fome others, have informed us, that the female palm-tree, unfefs ANY. 647 a male grows fufficiently near it, or unlefs the pollen be artificially conveyed to the female fpatha, will produce nothing but four dates and unfertile feeds. This fad is partly denied by Pere-Labat and Tournefort. The for¬ mer of thefe authors exprefsly affirms, that a female palm- tree, in the garden belonging to the monaftery at Mar- tinico, produced raoft excellent fruit, although there was not a male within fix miles of it : From which he con¬ cludes, that the prefence of the male is not necsiTary to render this tree fruitful, whatever may be pretended by ancient or modern naturalifls. Herodotus relates, that the people of Babylon, when the male was at too great a diftance from the female, made a rope pafs from the boughs of the one t© the boughs of the other, to afford an opportunity to the culices and other infects to pafs along the rope, and convey fome kind of impregnating influence from the male to the female. Tournefort, when he was in that country, inquired at the moft in¬ telligent people of the place, as to the truth of this re¬ lation ; but received for anfwer, That they had never heard of any fuch matter. Even the favourers of the fexual hypothefis give very different accounts of the me¬ thod of cultivating palm-trees in thole countries. Vef- lingius, who refided many years in Egypt, denies that any artificial method is employed for frudifying the palm-trees in that country. Thus Veflingius exprefsly contradids Herodotus and many others. In a word, al- moft every different author gives a different account of this ftory. Aniidft fo many contradidions concerning the culture of palm-trees, the oppofers of the fexes conclude., that the whole ftory is a vular error, taken for granted by fome learned men, fpurioufly fathered upon others, and fwallowed down without examination by their cre¬ dulous readers.—As we have not feen any anfwer to Mylefius’s letter on this fubjed, our obfervation3 upon it fliall be refcrved till this hiftorical view of the contro- verfy be finilhed. The feventh argument of Linnazus is taken from the flores nutantes .—The piftils of thefe flowers, according to Linnaeus, are always longer than the ftamina,. and na¬ ture has affigned them this penfile pofture, that the pol¬ len, which is fpecilically heavier, than air, may the more conveniently fall upon the ftigma.—But the piftils of the campanula, lilium, and many other flores nutantes,. are not longer than the ftamina. Befides, granting this were uniformly the cafe; yet, as- the polkn- is heavier than air, this pofture muft of neceflity either make the polkn mifs the piftillum altogether, or, at any rate, it can only fall- upon the back part of the piftil in place of the ftigma ; and, of courfe, fuch a diredion would ra¬ ther tend to fr-uftiate than promote: the impregnation of the feed. The eighth argument is taken from the plants fub- merfee, which are faid to emerge as foon.as their flowers begin to blow, left the pollen fhould be coagulated or wafhed off by the water.—But many fubmarine and aqua¬ tic plants frudify entirely below waterand, fuppoling they did not, the fame argument would equally prove it to be the intention of nature, that the pollen fhould be blown away by .the winds, as that it fhould be fubfer- vient to. the impregnation of the feed. The."},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"6 4 3 B O T The ninth and laft argument is infilled Omnium flornm genuina confideratio ; which is nothing more than a col¬ lection of vague obfervations upon the ftrudture and (eco¬ nomy of particular plants, lome of them true, others falfe, but all of them evidently thruft in as fupports to a favourite hypothefis. Having thus given a pretty full hiftorical view of the controverfy concerning the fexes of plants, we (hall now lay before our readers a few obfervations that have oc¬ curred from the perufal of it. It may be obferved in general, that the faCts and ar¬ guments adduced by the fexualilts are by far too few to admit of any general indudlion. Nay, molt of them are merely accidental, many of them not being uniform even in the fame fpecies •, and the final caufes of the whole are unnatural, and tortured fo as belt to anfwer the pur poles of a theory, which, for all that hath yet been laid, merits no higher appellation than that of a whimfical conjecture. Firft, then, Linnaeus’s reafoning is of a mixt nature, partly analogical, partly foundedv on obfervation. He iets out with an attempt to prove, that plants are en¬ dowed with a certain degree of animal life •, and his fun¬ damental reafon is, becaufe, agreeable to Dr Harvey’s definition of life, they fpontaneoujly propel humours . — Strange, that a man of Linnaeus’s capacity, or indeed of any capacity at all, (hould ferioufly employ an argument pregnant with every degree of abfurdity !—Stranger ftill that he lhould take up near twenty pages in illuftrating and drawing conclufions from fuch an argument!—If Harvey has given a vague and unintelligible definition of life, can that be a fufficient excufe for laying hold of fuch a definition in order to fortify an unitable hypothe¬ fis ? But, were'Harvey’s definition more accurate than it is, and were vegetables actually poifelFed of living powers, it is eafy to conceive how the life of vegetables might be a proper tell of, or contradiction to, the received de¬ finition : But, how a definition, which, from the com plex and intricate nature of the fubjeCt defined, mull neccflarily be vague and precarious, can be employed in confirmation of any general theory, exceeds the powers of common apprehenfion. But let us examine this notable definition a little fur¬ ther : What idea of.life does a fpontaneous propulfion of humours convey ? If Harvey means to fay, that men and other animals regulate the motion of their blood, and the fecretions of their different humours, by certain exertions of the fentient principle, fuch a meaning is contradicted by univerlal experience ; fo far is this from being the cafe, that the mod abftraCt attention cannot render us confcious of thefe motions. Again, if he means, that every body is endowed with life, whofe or¬ gans are fuited to propel humours, then the term fpon- taneous is abfurd, becaufe it aferibes intellectual powers to the organs themfelves, than which nothing can be more ridiculous. Befides, allowing the organs to enjoy an independent faculty of propulfion, what does this pro- pulfi. n mean when applied to vegetables ? Surely no¬ thing more than a power of conveying certain liquors from the root to the fuperior parts of the plant. A wet ANY. cloth, with one end in contaCt with the water in any vefiel, and the other hanging over its fide, will do the fame; fo will a fpunge, fo will a bed of loofe land, fo will a fugar loaf, &c ; but it is to be hoped, that man¬ kind have more fenfe than to believe that a bit of cloth; or a fugar loaf, are animated beings. As confcious of the lamenefs and futility of his rea¬ foning on this fubjeCt, Linnaeus endeavours further to corroborate the life of vegetables by analogies drawn from their nutrition, age, motions, difeafes, death, anar tomy, and organization In thefe nothing new or re- 1 markable occurs, excepting the uncommon method of reafoning, and the Hill more whimfical purpofes to which this realorting is applied. We lliall take notice oi his arguments under the articles of motion and death, which indeed are the chief of thofe which do not depend more or lefs upon the above definition. Under the former of thefe, Linnaeus informs us, that plants, when confined within doors, always bend to- waids the light; and that many flowers, particularly thofe of the fyngenefia clafs, purfue the courfe of the fun from eall to weft. This inclination of flowers towards- the light, Linnaeus would have us to believe are real initarv- ces of the living powers and fpontaneous motion of plants. — This phenomenon, however, may be eafily accounted for, independent of any idea of Ire. Every body knows, that a certain degree of heat relaxes the tone of the ve¬ getable organs, and at the fame time proportionally eva¬ porates the fluids which thefe organs contain. Now, to whatever fide of the plant that heat is principally applied, there of neceflity mull alfo be the greateft flaccidit of the fibres, and the greateft evaporation of the fluids •, of courfe, from the law of gravitation, the flower, indeed the whole plant, muft incline towards that fide from whence the light or heat proceeds. The flighted obfer¬ vation is fufficient to convince us of the proptiety of this method of accounting for the inclination of heavy flowers fupported by weak ftems, towards the rays of the fun. If a pot .of flowers be put loofely into a glafs, and al¬ lowed to remain a little time in an apartment where a fire is burning, as foon as the fibres begin to be enervated, they all, unlefs obftrudted by fome other caufe, bend to¬ wards the fire. Hence the abfurdity of aferibing this phenomenon to a fentient and living principle, which is more eafily and with more certainty explained by the common laws of mechanifm. Let us next attend to Linnaeus’s argument under the article of death. After telling us, with much folemnity, that death is only a privation of life, arid that vegetables die of many grievous diftempers, he thus concludes; “ With what propriety,” fays he, “ could vegetables be thus faid to die. unlefs it be allowed that they previ- oufly lived?\" However, if the life of vegetables hath no other fupport than this trifling quibble, (for it merits not the name of argument), we are afraid that every man of common fenfe will conclude, that they never were en¬ dowed with life, and confequently cannot, with any more propriety than an ordinary figure of fpeech can be¬ llow, be faid to die. Hiving in this manner attributed living powers to ve¬ getables, Linnaeus, in the next place, makes an effort to Ihow"},{"pageNumber":781,"pageContent":"B O T ftiovy,. that they enjoy the faculty of generation. But what piocefs of argumentation does he employ ? He lays hold of another maxim of. Dr Harvey : Omne vivuni ex vv'j, fays Harvey. : “ Now,” adds Linnaeus, “ we have already proved that vegetables live ; and therefore they mult in' like manner derive their origin from eggs. A- gain, no eggs, can be fertilized withont receiving an im¬ pregnation from the femen of the male: And hence the eggs or feeds of vegetables mud likewife be impregnated by the male vegetable femen, in order to their fertiliza¬ tion. Further, it is an effential property of an egg ta produce a creature of the fame fpecies with that front which itfelf was produced : Hence the feeds are the eggs pf vegetables. Befides, as the anther® and digmata are the only effential parts of a flower, it follows, that thefe parts are the organs of generation.” In this way Lin n®us goes on till he finds the anther® to be the teftes; the pollen, the femen; and the digma, the female or¬ gan of generation. But, as we have already {hewn that Linnaeus has re¬ markably. failed in the proof of his fird point, namely, that vegetables are endowed with life, his fubfequent rea- foning, which reds folely on the fuppofition of the living powers of vegetables, mud of courfe fall to the ground. However, allowing a fpontaneotis propul/ion of hu¬ mours to be a perfect definition of life, philologies are far from being agreed* with regard to the propriety of Harvey’s fecond maxim. Omne vivum ex ovo may be be applied to a great variety of animals. But to this day it remains a very doubtful point, whether man and moll quadrupedes derive their exidence from the fame fource. Hence the impropriety of drawing an analogy from a property not univerfal even among the animal cre¬ ation in order to fupport an imaginary one among the ve¬ getable tribes. When our author comes to explain the manner in which the ceitus of vegetables is performed, he tells us, that the pollen may be feen lying upon, the top of the digma in mod hermaphrodite flowers, where it is diffolved by the moidure which condantly adheres to that part; and after this diffolution, that the feminal aura contained in the pollen is abforbed by the digma, and fo conveyed direftly to the feeds. This account of the coitus lies open to two objedlions. id, Admitting that the pollen may be feen adhering to the digmata of moll hermaphrodite plants, and admitting likewife that moidure caufes the pollen to burl! and dif- charge a fuhtile fluid, dill a very natural quedion occurs with regard to the abforbing quality of the digma. It is true, that the top of the digma is generally covered with moidure. But does not this indicate that the proper office of the digma is to fecern and propel rather than to abforb moidure ? It will be the more readily admit¬ ted, that the veffels of the digma are not fuited to ab¬ forb, if it be confidered that the moilture of the digma is fubjefted to a condant evaporation, and of courfe mud al¬ ways dand in need of new fupplies of this liquor, which can flow from no other fource than the internal veffels of the digma itfelf. It may indeed be alledged, that the digma is fumifhed with two fets of veffels, one for abforbing the feminal fluid, another for fecerning the diffolving ,.VpL, I. No. 28. ' 3* ANY. d 49 moidure. No ,booty, however, lias ever pretended to, $iow that the digma is poffefled of any peculiar veffels for abforbing; whereas every man’s eyes will convince him that it is poffeffed of fecerning veffels : Hence, until the abforbing quality of the digma be fufficiently proved, the poflibility of an impregnation in this way mud at lead re¬ main problematical, 2dly, Linnseus makes the appearance of the pollen ad¬ hering to the Itigmata of hermaphrodite flowers an ocu¬ lar demonflration of an adtuaL coitus. Granting this to be an ocular demondration of the ceitus of vegetables, fhould not the pollen be likewife feen adhering to the digmata of dioicous plants ? But the appearance of pol¬ len upon the digmata of dioicous plants has never yet- been difcovered. We may, therefore, fairly conclude, that if the appearance of pollen upon the digmata of her-, maphrodite flowers be an ocular demondration of the coitus or copulation of plants, the want of that appear¬ ance, or. no pollen’s beiDg ever feen upon the digmata of dioicous flowers, mud likewife be an ocular demon¬ flration of the contrary ! In fupporting theoretical opinions, mankind are ex¬ tremely apt to render the fubjeft ridiculous tty pufhing them too far. No man ever blundered more remarkably in this refpeft than Linnaeus He is not fatisfied with attributing life and a generative faculty to plants: He mud likewife. attempt to prove, that this generative fa¬ culty is fo drong and vigorous, as to enable them to produce hybrids or mules , by means of unnatural com¬ mixtures. In fupport of this notion, he tells us, that, when the anther® of a red tulip are cut off, and the ripe anther® of a white one are fhaked over the digma of the red one, the feeds of the red tulip, by this artificial impregnation, will produce flowers dreaked with red and white. Of this fa<ft no body who knows any thing of the nature of tulips, and the changes to which the colour of their flowers are liable, will entertain any doubt. But this change of colour is evidently afcribed to a wrong caufe ; for the fame change would unquedionably happen whe-. ther the anther® of the white tulip had been fhaked o-r ver the digma of the red one or not. When tulips blow for the fird time, their petals are generally of one uniform colour. For feveral fucceeding feafons this original colour, continues to vary, in fo much that, by certain methods of culture, the colour of the flower may be varied with¬ out end. Linn®us, in his fyflematic works, wifely cau* tions his readers not to found any didin&ions upon the colour of plants, which, he dbferves, is fubjedt to fuch numberlefs alterations from culture, foil,, and other ca- fual incidents, that it can never fumilli the botanill with any permanent or uniform marks. With what propriety,, then, Linn®ns attributes the change in the colour of this tulip to his artificial impregnation, is fubmitted to die cdnfiueraiion of his warmed admirers. The lirft hint-of mules was taken from a' plant the fi¬ gure and difpofition of wh.ofe leaves, &c. refcmbled the antimnnum linaria, or common yellow toad-flax ; but attended with this peculiarity, that its parts of fructifica¬ tion were entirely difhrailar. Linrweus, when the plant was fird prcfented to hinij, imagined it to be foine kind SB\" of"},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":"650 BOX of deception. But, after a more accurate examination, the notion of a /furious iffue opportunely came to his aid. The thought pleafed him on a double account: It had a direct tendency to Corroborate his favourite hypo- thelis, and laid the foundation of another ftill more ex¬ travagant. Now, thinks he, by this ineftimable difco- very, we fhall be enabled to take a dry and rigid plant* from the mountain’s top, make it copulate with a moift and fpungy aquatic, and their offspring will participate of the rigidity and hardnefs of the former, together with the moifture and flaccidity of the latter; and hence mankind fhall foon be bleffed with an eafy purchafe of their united virtues when flourifliing in the intermediate vale ! More wonderful ftill, we fhall caufe the plants which dwell upon the frozen mountains of Greenland to intermarry with the more delicate and wayward inhabi¬ tants of the torrid zone, and the conftitutions of their children fhall be fo moulded and attempered, that they will live moft comfortably in every temperate clime!— Not contented with extracting two theories out of this jingle plantj Linnaeus forms a third ftill more wild and fantaftical: “ From this curious phaenomenon,” fays he, “ it is natural to think, that only two fpecies of each genus exifted ab origine, and that all the variety of fpe¬ cies which now appear are only the fpan of fortuitous' commixtures 1” If either the fortuitous or artificial copulation of two different fpecies were capable of producing a third per¬ fectly diftinCt from the other two, the number of fpecies would be infinite. According to our author, every blaft of wind, every butterfly, would daily produce hundreds of new fpecies. Neither the gardener nor hulbandman could pu'chafe feeds with fafety, unlefs they could difco- ver, from inlpeCtion, whether they had been impregnated by the femen of the fame,, or of a different fpecies. Lin naeus would have us to believe, not only that different fpecies of the fame genus copulate together, but even that genera belonging to different clafles engender, and beget mules. For example, he makes the poterium hy- bridum a mule, begot by the agrimonia eupatoria upon the poterium fangiiiforba. The agrimonia belongs to the do- decandria digynia clafs, and the poterium to the monoecia polyandria. Now, let any man ferioufly confider the un¬ avoidable confequences that would follow on the fuppofi- tion that this wanton proftitution of fexes really exifted a- mong vegetables In the firft place, it would be impof- fible to reduce botany to any regular fyftem; for every feafon would produce luch a troop of new and ftrange plants, as would confound every fcheme or method of claflification that ever was, or ever will be invented. A botanift, for inftance, carefully collects and preferves the f^eds of the poterium, in order to raife that plant next feafon; but, after fowing the feeds, to his utter afto- nifhment, not a Angle poterium appears, but every one of them is metamorphofed into a fpecies of agrimonia, a plant fo totally different that it cannot even be arranged under the fame clafs. ' 2dly, Linnasus is obliged to con- fefs, that bis vegetable mules , are not fubjeCted to that perverfe law of nature, which cruelly prevents animal mules from propagating their fpecies. On the contraty, his vegetable-mules enjoy all the. fweets of mutual em- A N Y. braces, and all the comforts that arife from' a numerou progeny 1 It is a happy circumftance that the oeconomy of nature is not influenced lay the whims and caprices of thofe very ingenious and learned gentlemen whofe heads are conftantly hunting after hypothetical phantoms. There is hardly a general theory of the oeconomy of a- nimals, or vegetables, which, on the fuppofition of its truth, would not in a very fhort time extirpate both a- nimals and vegetables from the face of die earth. In the theory under confideration, we have not only mules pro¬ duced by different genera and fpecies, but thefe very mules fuccefsfully propagating their kinds, and fubjeCt to be metamorphofed ad infinitum by fubfequent im¬ pregnations. This would be ftrange work indeed! How unlike the oeconomy of nature !—Let us take an exam¬ ple, and trace it through a few metamorphofes. A net¬ tle receives an impregnation from an oak, the feed falls to the ground, a plant of a very uncouth afpeft fprings up ; it is no longer a nettle, neither is it an oak; but then it makes an excellent mule / This mule next re¬ ceives an impregnation from a turnip ; the feed now brings forth neither a nettle, an oak, nor a common mule, but fomething fo monftruous that no language can* afford a name for it! Thefe are a few of the confequences that would inevitably happen, if this theory of fexual em¬ braces were really founded in nature. It is natural to think, that no author would venture to publifh a theory of this kind, without having previoufly- made a great variety of fuccefsful experiments. If plants were really capable of unnatural commixtures* any perfon might make many hundred mules in the fpace of twelve months. But we can affirm with confidence, that Lin¬ naeus never made a fingle vegetable mule in his life. He* has indeed collected forty-feven plants which he calls mules. Why ? not becaufe they were produced by an artificial or fortuitous impregnation ; but becaufe the leaves, ftem, or parts of fructification have a refemblance to fome other genus or fpecies; even of thefe forty-feven he ac¬ knowledges that thirteen cannot be depended upon. The only attempts he has made to produce mules, have been confined to a few hermaphrodite plants: When endea¬ vouring to impregnate a plant, Linnaeus proceeds in this manner: He lays hold of a hermaphrodite plant juft be¬ fore the flowers begin to blow; unfolds the petals, cuts off all the ftamina, and then with his own hands per¬ forms the office of a male plant, by ffiaking the pollen of a different fpecies over its piftillum. This operation being finifhed, he fows the feeds next feafon :—Now, if Linnaeus’s theory were juft, thefe feeds fhould produce mules, or plants whic’i cannot be referred to any of- the two fpecies upon which the experiment was made. But all the changes he has ever been able to produce by his manual impregnations are confined to the colour of the flower; a different ftreak or fhade in the petals paffes with him for a mule or mixture of the fpecies, although, in other parts of his works* he pofitively declares, that generic or fpecific differences can never be taken from the colour of flowers, as it is conftantly liable to a thoufand changes from caufes that are merely fortuitous., But no experiment can be made with any degree of can¬ dor upon hermaphrodite flowers. No man can determine : with"},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"B O T with certainty what changes the young feeds may undergo, what injury they may fuffer, by prematurely forcing open their petals and cutting off the (lamina. If a pregnant animal be wounded, and in a part too intimately con¬ nected with the foetus, what reafon have we to hope for a beautiful or well-proportioned offspring ? One thing however is certain, that if the office of the (lamina, as is alledged by the oppofers of the fexes, be to feparate and carry off noxious or excrementitious matter from the fruit, the retention of this matter would of itfelf intro¬ duce a change into the colour of the future plant; be¬ caufe in that cafe the feeds would not be properly purged, or rectified, being prematurely deprived of the veffels de- (tined for that purpofe.

A feedf- man or gardner, in packing up many parcels of different feeds, by the Ample error of putting, a wrong mark upon, any of the parcels, would produce a miftuke fimilar to this of Baal’s. But, whether the circumdance. took its rife from negligence or fraud, belongs not to our prefern inquiry. Even up< 5 n Linnaeus’s own principles, it is far from being clear of abfurdity, how, by a cafual impreg¬ nation,- the fpecies of a plant could be entirely changed. For, by the analogy of all animals, nay, taking our ana¬ logy from Linnaeus’s vegetable mules, this fortuitous impregnation (hould have only produced a mule, or mix¬ ture of the two fpecies, and not a perfeCt metamorphofis of either. Hence it may be fairly concluded, that this fa¬ mous dory, upon which the fexualids lay fo much flrefs, inftead of drengthening, tends to the final deftrudioo of that hypothefis in fdpport of which it was originally ad¬ duced.’ Of a fimilar nature is the dory contained in Mylius’s' letter to Dr Watfon. This gentleman writes to his cor- refpondent, “ that a female palm tree grew many years in the garden belonging to the Royal Academy at Berlin, without producing any ripe or fertile fruit; that a male, branch, with its flowers in full blow, was brought from Leipfic, which is about twenty German miles from Ber¬ lin, and. fufpended over the female; the refult of this operation was* that the female, that very year, produced foo ripe and fertile fruit. The fame experiment being repeated the following year, 2000 ripe fruit .were pro- A N Y. 651 duced.” — Not to call Mylius’s veracity in quedion, we (hall allow the fad to be as he has related it: Ne-. verthelefs it is far from being fatisfadory. Berlin is not the native climate of palm-trees. Mylius in¬ forms us, that this palm bore flowers and fruit for thirty years before the experiment was tried ; but the fruit never came to full maturity. Now it is well known, that many exotic plants, particularly thole of the larger kinds, feldom produce ripe' fruit in a climate which is not adapted by nature for their nourifhment, unlefs they are aflided by artificial culture, and have grown in that cli¬ mate for a great number of years. Mylius’s palm-tree had carried unripe fruit for the fpace of thirty years. Now, according to the ufual courfe of exotics, it is na¬ tural to think that, during all this time, the fruit was every feafon making gradual advances towards perfedion r It might fo fall out, then, that at the very feafon when the male branch was fufpended over the female, the plant had arrived at the highed degree of perfedion it could ever acquire in the climate of Berlin; and of courfe, the accidental circumdance of fufpending the male.branch over it, at this critical period, might give rife to the deception of attributing the perfedion and fertilization of the fruit to the prefence of the male branch. The cir-- cumdance of the tree’s bringing forth only ico ripe fruit the fird year, and 2000 the fecond, remarkably favours this account of the matter. However, be tins a$ it will, the experiment is fo very defedive, that no conclufion can be drawn from it either for or againlt the fexual hypothefis. To convince any thinking perfon, that the fertility of this tree was folely’ owing to fome impregnating virtue derived to it from the male branch, a branch (hould have been fufpended over the female one year, omitted the next, and fo on alter¬ nately for a courfe of years, or (as Linnsus would ex* prefs it), giving her a h'ufband one year, and depriving her of that gratification the next; After treating the- femaie in this manner for feveral years, if it had uni¬ formly happened, that the fruit was fertile every year the male branch was fufpended over it, and unfertile e- very year that the fufpenfion of the male branch was o- mitted, then indeed there would have been a foundation for'concluding, that there was fome connedion between the fertility of the fruit and the prefence of the male branch. But as this neceffary (lep has: been negleded, the experiment is incomplete, and the conclufion drawn from it uncandid and precipitate.. AVe cannot conclude our remarks on this theory, with¬ out hazarding a few obfervations on the truly miraculous effeds which Linnseus aferibes to the wind; In Recount¬ ing for the impregnation of all the dioicous aod mod of the hermaphrodite plants, recourfe is condantly had to the wind, which is faid to convey the pollen of the male to the digmata of the female. When the female again is at fuch a didance as to render the carriage of the pol¬ len fufpicious or impoflible, our author is not difeouraged by this.circumdance, but confidently affirms, that fome infed has been rummaging araongd the damina of the male, carries off a quantity of the pollen adhering to its legs, and, UDconfcious of its precious load, flies from* flower to flower till It arrives at the unmarried female, where."},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"■ 6 $i B O T where flopping to take another bait, it luckily depofites fome of this adhering pollen diredly ‘upon the ftgma of the female 1—- Here it is proper to obferve, that generation is one of the capital, and indeed one of the moil important laws of nature that we are acquainted with. The laws of nature are all fixed, fteady, and uniform in their operation. None 6f the effeds produced by them are fubjed to thofe un¬ certainties which always refult from chance or any for¬ tuitous train of circuinfiances. But is there any thing in nature more unfettled, defultory, and capricious, than the direction and motions of the wind ? Can we form a conception of any thing more cafual and fortuitous than the wild and wayward paths of infers? The very fup- pofition, therefore, that nature has left the generation of at leait a tenth part of the whole vegetable tribes to thefe accidental caufes, muft be unphilolophical, whimfical, and abfurd. We will be the more readily convinced of the abfurdity of this dodrine, when it is confidered that many of the monoecious and dioicous plants are of the u tin oft importance to the human race, and the confequent impropriety that the frudification of thefe fliould be fub¬ jed to the fport of the winds. After all, it requires the utmofl ftretch of fancy to conceive the pofiibility of a regular impregnation by means of the wind, even when the male and female are within yoo yards of each othef, which is a much more favourable fuppofi'tion than two, three, or according to fome authors, a dozen of miles. Conceive then a male and female hemp, or any other dioicous plant, growing 500 yards afunderi Let the male and female flowers, which, by the by, is not always the cafe, blow at the fame time. Well, the antheraj are fully ripe; the pollen is difchar- ged; and theftigma, as our author exprefles it, gaping ni'id.'f for its reception. Now, even this favourable fup- polition is fubjed to fo m ny accidents, and pregnant with fuch a troop of improbabilities, that it is abfolutely impoilible, upon any principles of belief hitherto invent¬ ed, to be fully perfuaded that the pollen, in fuch circunj fiances, can be thus conveyed on the wings of the wind, diredly to the ftigma, a point in moft plants juft not in- vifible,—To accQmplifh a regular impregnation in this way, whenever the nntherse are ripe, the wind muft blow in a dired line from the male to the female; if the blall be too ftrong, it will overfhoot the mark; if too weak, it will fall ftiort of it; if any vegetable or other body higher tijan the plants thcmfelves intervene, the progrefs of the pollen will be inte: cepted ;—if it rains, the pollen will be beat to the ground;—the lead tremor of the air, or fmalifer blaft refleded from any other quarter, will in¬ fallibly alter the diredion of this fludluating pollen.- Nay, fuppofing Linnaeus, or any other expert botanift, fhould take his ftation by the male plant, having his poc¬ kets loaded with pollen; fuppofe him further to take e- very advantage of wind and weather, and aiming a the female, let him, for hoars together, throw at her repeat¬ ed handfuls of this frudifying pollen, it is a thoufand to one, if, at the diftance of 500 yards, a Angle g ain of pollen would touch any part of the female, and many millions to one againft its falling diredly upon the ftig- mata of her refpedive flowers. In a word, this theory A N Y. df impregnation by the wind, is a palpable refuge of ig¬ norance, invented with a view to account for the frudifi¬ cation of dioicous plants, which, Linnaeus knew to be a. formidable barrier Handing in oppofition to the fexual hypothefis. How far that obftacle is removed by this vague fubterfuge, is fubmitted to the judgment of every candid inquirer. Upon the whole, we have endeavoured to fliow, that every fad or experiment Linnreus has employed to fup- port his theory of the procreation of vegetables by means of iexual embraces, is either falle, or accidental; and that the concisions drawn from them are unnatural, arid often drained to fuch a pitch of extravagance as renders them truly ridiculous. The only argument that now remains to be examined, is drawn from the analogy betwixt animals and vege¬ tables. That many beautiful analogies may be traced betwixt the animal and vegetable, is an undeniable truth. But, in reafoning upon a phyIleal fubjed, which admits of a clear determination by experiment, to truft folely or chiefly to analogical dedudions, is an evident mark ei¬ ther of a bad reafoner or an unftable hypothefis. The very nature of analogy prefuppofeth fome. radical differ¬ ence in the fubjeds between which the refemfilance fub- flfls. If the analogy be fupported by fads and experi¬ ments, they mutually ftrengthen the evidence But, if the analogy be not fupported by fads and experiments, or, if the experiments contradid the analogy, which is the cafe with the theory under confideration; in either of thefe iqftances the analogy is Carried beyond its proper li¬ mits, and affords no argument in favour of the hypothe¬ fis. Without the concurrence of fads, how can we be certain but that the very property we contend for confti- tutes the eflential difference betwixt the two fubjeds ? Without fads, how can we be certain but that generation by the intercourfe of fexes is the identical charaderiftic, by whi :h an animal and vegetable are diftinguilhed ? Thefe principles are applicable even in the cafe of a per- fed and uniform analogy, but acquire ah accumulated force when the analogy is partial and incomplete, which, is evidently the cafe with regard to the fexual commerce of vegetables. For example, to compleat the analogy in dioicous plants, a male fliould be uniformly found growing by the fide of the female ; and befides, at the age of puberty, or as foon as the antherse come to maturity, the male flower, fliould befituated in fuch a manner, that the pollen could not poflibly mifs the ftigmata of the female flowers, from whatever quarter the wind might blow: the fam . thing fhould take place with regard to the mohoicous flowers. But this is not the. analogy prefented to us by nature.* On the contrary, the males and females feldom grow in the neighbourhood of each other. Nothing is more common than to meet with large beds of males growing in one place, and large beds of females at the diilancc of fome miles from them, pointing out, as it were, that no necefl’ary connedion, no mutual affedion, no natural de¬ pendence fubfifted between thefe males and females; but rather that nature intended, for fome purpofe or other, that they fliould be kept at a diftance. Further, the fexualifts, ifi fupport of their theory, are"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"B O T are obliged to have recourfe to the unpardonable impro¬ priety of employing a double analogy, the one betwixt the animal and vegetable, the other betwixt two differ¬ ent tribes of vegetables. In order to account for the propagation of the mufei, fungi, and, in a word, the whole cryptogamia clafs, whofe parts of generation are either wanting altogether, or invifible to our eye-fight, Linnteus maintains, that, this circumftance notwithftand- ing^ they propagate their fpecies by a regular and uniform commerce of fexes. “ As it has been proven (fays he) that all thofe plants whofe organs of generations are vifible, propagate their fpecies by' male and female embraces ; therefore all thofe whofe organs are lefs fubjedl to our obfervation, mull likewife propagate in the fame way.” Before fuch reafoning as this can admit even of a decent apology, before the fexualifts attempt to fhew that fuch plants enjoy the faculty of generation, it is incumbent on them to prove that they are poflcffed of generating organs. According to the dodtrine of fexes in vegetables, an¬ other capital defedt, or rather redundance, occurs in the analogy between the animal and vegetable. It is one of the moft benevolent and ufeful laws in nature, that mules, or fuch animals as are produced by the unnatural commixtures of two different kinds, are deprived of the capacity of propagating their monjlrous fpecies. It is true, Linnaeus’s mules are not obliged to comply with this law; they are not animal but vegetable mules ; and confequently may freely tranfmit their monjlrous if tie to pofterity! As they are not objedts of rewards or pu- niffments, they cannot be anfwerable for the horrid con- fequences of turning the whole vegetable world into con- •fuiion, and covering the face of the earth with monfters horrible to behold! It is a trite obfervation, that no fault is more common among bad writers than to render their arguments ridi¬ culous by hunting down metaphors or analogies till every ffadow of refemblahce be loft. It is equally true, that this blunder occurs in almoft every page of Linnaeus’s works. But it is peculiarly unlucky when an analogy is of fuch a nature that it neceffarily runs into obfeenity when treated in this manner. In purfuing a fexual ana¬ logy, the utmoft delicacy of expreflion is tequired. This however is exceedingly difficult,- efpecially when the ana¬ logy is puffed beyond its natural limits. But, in per- ufing the Sponfalia Planlarum, one would be tempted to think, that the author had more reafons than one for re- liffing this analogy fo highly. In many parts of this treatife, there is fuch a degree of indelicacy in the ex- preffion as cannot be exceeded by the mull obfeene ro¬ mance-writer. For example, in p. 103. he fays, “ The calix is the bride-chamber in which the ftamina and “ piftilla folemnize their nuptials;” “ Vel, fi mavis “ CUNNUS, feu Labia ejufdem, inter ,qux organa I* 1 genitalia mafeulina & feminina, delicatiffima: iftse partes, “ foventur & ab externis injuriis muniuntur!— Corolla “ eft aulaum, vel potius nympho;! — Filanenta funt vafa “ fpermatica, quibus fuccus ex planta fccretus in an- “ theras transferor !— Anther# funt Testiculi,— “ Pollen, feu pulvis antherarum, genituf# & vermictilis “feminalibus refpondet.—Stigma eft vulva, in qua Vol. I.

It is impoflible to do juftice to thefe exprelfions in any tranflation. Befides the obfeenity of thefe paffages, It would be no difficult tafk to ffow that the analogies are entirely with; out foundation. The calix is made to reprefent no lefs than three things of very oppofite natures; firft, it is analogous to the chamber of the bride, -then fo. the fe¬ male organ, and laft of all to the Labia. What analogy is there betwixt the corolla of a plant and the nympho: of an animal ? Where is the analogy between the pollen and the animalcules in femine mafeulino ? &c. There is not any fcience which has fo little esnnedtion with theory as botany. Theorjip may perplex and con¬ found, but never can have the leaft tendency to aflift the botanic Undent. A man would not naturally expedt to meet with difgufting ftrokes of obfeenity In a fyftem of botany. But it is a certain fadt, that obfeenity is the very bafis of the Linnaeau fyftem. The names of his claffes, orders, fee. convey often the vileft and moft un¬ natural ideas. For example, diandria, the name of his fecond clafs, is thus explained by Linnaeus, “ mariti “ duo in eodem conjugio; feu ftamina duo in flore her- maphrodito;” i. e. one female married to two males ; or two Jlamina in a hermaphrodite flower. The number of males goes on increafing till the 13th clafs, the plants belonging to which are laid to have from 20 to tooo huffands to one wife!—-We might aik Linnaeus, where is the analogy in this fuppofition ? The fyngenefia clafs is thus defined by Linnaeus : “ Mariti genitalibus feedus “ conftituerunc j feu ftamina antheris in cylindrum coa- \" lita;” i. e. the males have made a covenant with their leftes ; or the ftamina are united by the anther# in the form of a cylinder. The characters of die orders are ftill worfe. Polygamia fruftranea, the name of an order of the fyngenefia clafs, is thus defined: “ Fruftranea di- “ citur, cum femipae maritatoe, fertiles funt, et fpeciem “ propagare queunt; callratse, impregnari nequeunt.” Men or philofophers can fmilc at the non fen fe and abfur- dityoffuch obfeene gibberilh ; but it is eafy to gliefs what effects it may have upon the young and thoughtlefs. But the bad tendency upon morals is not the only evil produced by the fexual theory. It has loaded the belt fyftem of botany that has hitherto been invented, with a profufion of fooliff and often unintelligible terms, which throw an obfeurity upon the fcience, obftrudl the progrefs of the learner, and deter many from ever enter¬ ing upon the ftudy. Upon the whole, we muft conclude, that the diftinc- tion of fexes among vegetables has no foundation in na¬ ture ; or, at leaft, that the facfls and arguments employ¬ ed in iupport of this dodfrine, when examined with any degree of philofophical accuracy, are totally infufficient to eftabliff it. 8 C BOTAR-"},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"B O T (65 4 ) B O U BOTARGO, a kind of faufage, made with the eggs and blood of the fea-mullet, a large fifh common in the Mediterranean.

The matter of which bows were made, as well as their fize, differed in different countries. The Perfians had very great bows made of reeds ; and the Indians had alfo, not only arrows, but bows made of the reeds or canes of that country ; the Lycian bows were made of the cornel tree; and thofe of the Ethiopians, which furpaffed all others in mag¬ nitude, were made of the palm-tree. Though it does not appear, that the Romans made ufe of bows in the infancy of their republic, yet they afterwards admitted them as hoftile weapons, and em¬ ployed auxiliary archers in all their wars. In drawing the bow, the primitive Grecians did not pull back their hand towards their right ear, according to the fafliion of modern ages, and of the ancient Perfians, but, placing their bow diredtly before them, returned their hand upon their right breaft. This was alfo the cyftom of the Amazons. The bow is a weapon of offence among!! the inha¬ bitants of Afia, Africa, and America, at this day; and in Europe, before the invention of fire-arms, a part of the . infantry were armed with bows. LewisXI. firft abolilh- ed the ufe of them in France, introducing, in their place, the halbard, pike, and broad fword.

BRAG, an ingenious and pleafant game at cards, where as many may partake as the cards will fupply; the eldeft hand dealing three to each perfon at one time, and turning up the laft card all round. This done, each g--meiler puts down three flakes, one for each card. The firft flake is won by the Left card turned up in the dealing round; beginning from the ace, king, queen, knave, and fo downwards. When cards of the fame value are turned up to two or more of the gamefters, the eldeft hand gains $ but it is to be ob- ferved, that the ace of diamonds wins, to whatever hand it be turned up. The fccond flake is won by what is called the brag,. which confifts in one of the gamefters challenging the reft to produce cards equal to his : Now it is to be obferved, that a pair of aces is the bell brag, a pair of kings the next, and fo op;, and a pair of any fort wins the flake from the moft valuable fingle card. In this part confifts the great diverfion, of the game ; for, by the artful management of the locks, geftures, and voice, it frequently happens, that a pair of fives, tr.eys, or even duces,, out-brags a much higher pair, and even fome pairs royal, to die no fmall merriment of the compay. The knave of clubs is here a principal favourite, making a pair with any other card in hand, and with any other two cards a pair royal.

ERANC'H, in botany, an arm of a tree, or a part, which, iprouting out from the trunk, helps to form the head or crown thereof. Branches of a bridle, in the manege, are two pieces of iron bended, which, in the interval, between the one and the other, bear the bit-mouth, the crofs-chains, and the curb; fo that oh one end they anfwer to the head-ftall, and on the other to the reins, in order to keep the horfe’s head in fubjeftion. With regard to their form and ftrudlure, branches are either ftrait, in form of a piftol, for young horfes to form their mouth; or, after the conftable of France’s falhion, proper for a horfe that carries his head well. Some are in form of a gigot or leg, which will prevent horfes from carrying too low: Some in form of a bent knee, contrived for horfes that arm themfelves againft the operation of the bit; and others after the French fa- fhion, which is hardly about \\ of an inch at the levile hole, and kneed i J inch at the jarret or ham. It is to be obferved, 1. That the farther the branch is from an horfe’s neck, the more effedt it will have. 2 • That (hort branches, cater is paribus, are ruder, and their effects more &dden, than thofe of logger. 3.

In general, the Greek breviary confifts of two parts; the one containing the office for the evening, the other that of the morning, divided into matins, lauds, ftrft, third, fixth, and ninth vefpers, and the compline; that is, of feven different hours, on account of thaf laying of David, Seplies' in die lauderH dixi tibi. The inftitution of the'breviary is not vCry ancient: there have been inferted in it the lives of the faints, full of ridiculous and ill-attefted llories, which gave occafion to feveral reformations of it, by feveral coun¬ cils, particularly thole of Trent and Cologh; by ft- veral pope?, particularly Pius V. Clement VIII. and Urban VIII.; and alfo by ftvera! cardinals 4 nd bi- Ihops, each lopping off fome extravagances, and bring¬ ing it nearer to the fimplicity of the primitive offices. Originally, every body was obliged to recite the breviary every day; but by degrees the obligation was reduced to the clergy only, who are enjoined, under penalty of mortal fin and ecclefiaftical cenfures, to re¬ cite it at home, when they cannot attend in public. In the XIVth century, there was a particular referve granted in favour of bilhops, who were allowed, on extraordinary occalions, to pafs three days without re- hearfing the breviary. This office was originally called curfus, and after- waids the bteviarium\\ which latter name imports. that the old office was abridged, or rather, that this collection is a kind of abridgment of all the prayers.

OF MALT. That fpecies of fermentation which is called the vi¬ nous fermentation , is only produceable by the juices of vegetable fubftances. The ft gar or faccharine matter is the caufe of this fermentation. If fugar be added to water in the proportion of 1 to 3, a proper vinous fer-. mentation is excited. When this faccharine matter is extracted from vegetables, they immediately, lofe rheir fermentative power. Moft plants either naturally con- ; tain this faccharine matter, or are capable of acquiring i.t by a certain method of treatment. This.procefs of converting vegetable fubftances into a fugar is known by the name of malting. . .Vol.T. Numb. 28. '3 Though moft vegetable fubftances be convertible into : malt, barley is found by experience to be the moft proper; for undergoing this operation. As the converting of grains into malt, is only a part of the progrefs towards their germination, it may be performed by committing them for fome time to the earth. But the ordinary method is to fteep the barley for fome time in water, and then to expofe it in heaps on the floor of a barn till it begins to heat: after which, it muft be fpread out in thin layers, to prevent putrefaction. It ought to continue in this fituation till the plume or bud is juft about to efcape from the feed, and then it is confi- dered as perfectly malted; that is, the feeds are con¬ verted into a fweet, moift ftbftance. This change of tafte, or malting, keeps exaCt pace with the progrefs of, the, plume ; hence one half of the feed is frequently malt ed, while the other undergoes no change. If the plume be allowed. to ffioot fully out, the feeds immediately, lofe their faccharine tafte, and are changed into infipid 8 F * hollow"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"666 B R E W N G. hollow bags. When feeds are thus fufficiently malted, they mult be dried in malt-kilns, the fuel of which Ihould fmoke as little as poflible.—The hujks mud now be broke open by malt-milns, and then infufed or nialhed in warm water, in order to extract the faccharine fub- ftance; the heat applied Ihould be very flow and gradual. Thus the malt is dilfolved, and lies till the liquor be fuf¬ ficiently tinftured. When the malt is too long diffufed, io that an acetous fermentation begins to take place, it is called blinking, or foxing, by brewers. This tindlure obtained from the infufion of grinded malt, is commonly known by the name of •wort. We (hall now give an account of this procefs in the language and manner of the a&ual brewer, Which will probably be more acceptable than treating it in a pbilofo- phical manner. Of making Malt. The barley murt be put into & leaden or tiled ciftern, that holds five, teh, or more quarters, and covered with tyater four or fix inches above the bailey, to allow for its fwell. Here it mud lie five or fix tides, as the' rjaltfter calls it, reckoning twelve hours to the tide, ac¬ cording as the barley is in body or in drinefs. The way ro know when it is enough, is to take a corn, end-ways, between the fingers, arid gently ci*uffi it; and if it be in all parts mellow, and the hulk opens, or Harts a little from the body of the corn, then it is enough . The nice ty of this is a material point; for if it be infufed too\" ibuch, the' fweetnefs of the malt will be greatly taken off, and yield the lefs fpirit, and will caufe deadnefs and fournefs in ale \"or beer in a fliort time, for the goodnefs of the malt contributes much to the prefervation ’of all ales and beers. Then the water mull be well drained from it, and it will come equal and better on the floor, ■ which may be done in twelve or fixteen hours in tempe¬ rate weather, but in cold near thirty. From the ciftern, it is pm into a fquare hutch or couch*, where ft mud lie thirty {fours; then it mull be worked night and day in one or two heaps, as the weather is cold or hot, and turned every four, fix, or eight hours, the outward part iftwards, and the bottom upwards, always keepings clear floor, that the corn that lies next to it be not chilled; and as foon as it begins to come or fpire, then turn it every three, four, or five hours, as was done before, according to the temper of the air, which greatly go¬ verns this management; and as it comes or works more, fo muft the heap be fpreaded and thinned larger to cool it. Thus it may lie and be worked on the floor in feve- ral parallels, two or three feet thick, ten or more feet broad, and fourteen or more: in length, to ehip or fpire, but not too much nor too fall; and when it is come enough, it is to be turned twelve or fixteen times in twenty four hours, if the feafon is warm, as in March, April, or May; and when it is fixed, and the root bdgins to bd dead then it muft be thickened again, and carefully kept often turned and worked, that the growing of the? root may not revive, and this is better done with the Sloes off than on : And here the Workman’s art and dili¬ gence in. particular is tried, in keeping the floor clear. and turning the malt often, that it neither moulds nor acre-fpires, that is, that the blade does not grow out at the oppofite end of the root; for, if it does, the flower and ftrength of the malt is gone, and nothing left be¬ hind but the acre-fpire, hulk, and tail : Now, when it is at this degree, and fit for the kiln, it is often put into a heap, and let lie twelve hours before it is turned, ^o heat and mellow, which will much improve the malt if it is done with moderation, and after that time it muft be turned every fix hours during twenty-four ; but if it is overheated, it will become’like ’ greafe and be fpoiled, or at leaft caufe the drink to be unwholefome. When this operation is over, it then muft be put on the kiln, to dry four, fix, or twelve hours, according to the nature of the malt; for the pale fort requires more lei- fure, and lefs fire, than the amber or brown forts: Three inches thick was Formerly thought a fufficient depth for the malt to lie on the hair-ploth ; but now fix is often allowed it; fourteen or fixteen feet fquare will dry about two quarters, if the malt lies four inches thick, and here it Ihould be turned every two, three, or four hours, keeping the hair cloth clear: The time of preparing it from the ciftern to the kiln is uncertain, according to th. feafon of the year ; in moderate weather, three weeks are often fufficient. When the malt is dried, it muft not cool on the kiln, but be direflly thrown off, not into a heap, but fpreaded wide in an aii*y place, till it is thoroughly cool; then put it into a heap, or otherwife difpofeofit. There are feveral methods ufed in drying of malts, as the iron-plate frame, the tile-frame, that are both full of little holes; the brafs-wired, and iron-wired frame, and the hair-cloth. The iron and tiled ones were chiefly invented for drying of brown malts, and faving of fuel; for thefe, when they come to be thorough hot, will make the corns crack and jump by the fiercenefs of their heat, fo that they will be roafted or fcQrched in a little time ; and after they are off the kiln, to plump the body of the corn, and make it take the eye, fome will fprinkle water over it, that it may meet with the better market: But if fuch malt is not ufed quickly, it will flacken and lofe its fpirits to a great degree, and perhaps, in half a year or lefs, maybe taken by the whools and fpoiled. Such batty dryings, or fcorchings, are alfo apt to bitter the malt, by burning its flein, and therefore thefe kilns' are not fo much ufed now as formerly. The wire-frameS indeed are fomething better, yet they are apt to fcorch the outward part of the dorn, (hat cannot be got off fo foon as the hair-cloth admits of, for thefe muft be fwept when the other is only turned at once; however, thefe laft three ways are now in much requeft for drying pale and amber malts, becaufe their fire may be kept with more leifure> and the malt more gradually and better dryed. But by many the hair cloth is reckoned the beft. Malts are dried with feveral forts of fuel; as the coak, Welch coal, ftraw, wood, and fern, &c. ~ But the coak is reckoned by moft to exceed all others for making drink of the fineft flavour and pale colour, be¬ caufe it fends no fmoke forth to hurt the malt with any offenfive tang, that wood, fern, and ftraw are apt to dot in"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"BREWING. 667 in a Idler or greater degree ; but there is a difference even in what is called coak, the right fort being large pit-coal charred or burnt in fome meafure to a cinder, till all the fulphur is confumed and evaporated, which is called cboak ; and this, when it is truly made, is the beft of all other fuels. But if there be but one cinder as big as an egg, not thoroughly cured, the fmoke of this one is capable of doing damage, which happens too often by the negligence or avarice of the choak-maker j There is another fort, by. fome wrongly called choak, and rightly named culm or Welch-coal, from Swanzey in Pembrokelhire, being of a hard ftony fubftance, in fmall bits, refembling a fhinning coal, and will burn without fmoke, and by its fulphureous effluvia call a moft excel¬ lent whitenefs on all the outward parts of the grainy bo¬ dy: In Devonfflire their marble or grey fire-ftone is burnt into lime with the ftrong fire .that this culm makes, and both this and the chalked pit-coal afford a moderate and certain fire to all malt that is dried by it. Straw is the next fweeteft fuel; but wood and fern are the worft. Some put a peck or more of peafe,. and malt them with five quarters of barley, to mellow the drink : Beans are ufed for the fame purpofe ; but they do not come fo foon, nor mix fo conveniently with the malt, as the pea. Barley is not fit to make malt of till it is folly meN lowed and fweated in the mow, and the feafon of the year is ready for it, without both which there can be no affurance of good malt. This untimely making of malt often occafions bad ales and beers; for fuch malt retain¬ ing fome of its barley nature* or that the feafon of the year is not cold enough to admit of its natural working on the floor, is not capable of producing a true malt, but will caufe its drink to (link in the calk inftead of growing fit for ufe, as not having its genuine malt nature to cure and preferve it, which all good malts contribute to as well as the hop. Mellilet, a moft (linking weed that grows among bar¬ ley, if not thoroughly cleaned from it before malting, makes the drink fo heady, that it is apt to intoxicate the unwary by drinking a fmall quantity : Befides, it gives a* naufeous flavour to the liquor. To Jinoiv good from bad Malts . First, break the mak-corn acrofs, between the teeth, in the middle, or at both ends, and if it tafteth mellow and fweet, has a round body, breaks foft, is full of flour all its length, fmells well, and has a thin lkin, then it is good Secondly, take a glafs near full of water, and put in fome malt ; if it fwims, it is right; but if any finks to the bottom, then it is not true malt, but fteely, and retains fomewhat of its barley nature; this, however, is not an infallible rule, becaufe, if a- corn of malt is cracked, fplit, or broke, it will then take the water and fink ; but an allowance may be'given for foih incidents,, and ftill room enough to make a judgment. Thirdly, malt that is truly made will, not be hard and fteely, but of fo mellow a nature, that, if forced agaioft a dry. board, it will mark, and call a white colour almoft like chalk. Fourthly, malt that is- not rightjy made will b.e part of it of a hard<barley nature, and Weigh heavier than that which is true malt. Of the Nature and Ufe of Pale, Amber, and Brown Malts. The .pale malt is the flowed and Hacked dried of any, and where it has had a leifure fire, a fufficient time al¬ lowed it on the kiln, and a due care taken of it, the flour of the grain will remain in its full quantity, and thereby produce a greater length of wort than the brown high- dried malt. It may be brewed either with fpring or common well water. The amber-coloured malt is that which is dried in a medium degree, between the pale and the brown, arid is very much in ufe, as being free of either extreme. Its colour is pleafant, its tafte agreeable, and its nature wholefome, which makes it be preferred by many as the beft of malts ; this by fome is brewed either with hard or foft waters, or a mixture of both. The brown malt is the fooneft and higheft dried of any, even till it is fo hard, that it is difficult to bite fome of its corns afynder. This malt, by fome, is though t tooc- cafion the gravel or done, and is by its fteely nature left nourilhing than the pale or amber malts, being very much impregnated with the fiery particles of the kiln, and therefore its drink fooner becomes lharp and acid than that made from the pale or amber forts, if they are all fairly brewed: For this reafon the London brewers moftly ufe the Thames or New River waters to brew this malt with, for the fake of its foft nature, whereby it agrees with the harfh qualities of it better than any of the well or other hard forts, aod makes a lufcious ale for a little while, and a but-beer, or porter, that will keep very well five or fix months ; but after that time it ge< nerally grows ftale, notwithftanding there be ten or twelve bulhels allowed to the hogfhead, and it be hopped ac* cordingly. Pale and amber malts dried with coak or culm, ob¬ tain a more clean, bright, pale colour, than if dried with any other fuel, becaufe there is- not fmoak to- darken and folly their Heins or hulks, and give them an ill refill), which thole malts have, more or lefs, that are -dried with draw., wood, or fern, &c. The coak or Welch coal alfo makes more true and compleat malt than any other fuel, becaufe its fire gives both a gentle arid cer¬ tain heat, whereby the corns are in all their parts gra-t dually, dried; and therefore of late thefe malts have gained fuch a reputation, that great quantities have been confumed in moft parts, of the nation for their whole-t fome nature and fweet fine tafte.

ThIs article-well deferVes the notice of all brewers, for on it the gaodnefs of our drink greatly depends *, be- caufe, if it is ground too fmall, the flour of the malt will •be the eafier and more freely mixed with the water, and Will caufe the wort to run thick* therefore the malt muft be only juft broke in the mill, to make it emit its fpirit gradually, and incorporate its flour with the water in •fuch a manner, that firft a ftout beer,; then an ale, and afterwards a fmall beer may be had at one and the fame brewing, and the wort run off fine -and clear to the lalh Many are likewife To fagacious as to grind their brown malt a fortnight before they ufe it, and keep it in a dry place, that it-may become mellower, by.lofing in a great meafure the.fury of its harfh fiery particle*, and itsfteely 'nature, which this fort of malt acquires on the kiln. However, this, as well as many other.hard bodies, may be reduced by time and air into a more foluble, mellow, and foft condition, and then it will imbibe the water, and give a natural kind tinCltre more freely, by which a greater-quantity and ftronger drink may be made than if it was ufed direCtly from the mill, and be much fmoother and better tafted. But pale malts will be fit for ufe at a week’s end, becaufe the leifurenefs of their drying endows them with a foftnefs from the time they are taken off the kiln to the time they are brewed, and fupplies in them what time and air muft do in the brown forts. This method of grinding malt fo long before¬ hand cannot be fo conveniently pra<£lifed by fome of the great brewers, becaufe feveral of them brew two or three times a week; but now moft of them grind their malts into the tun by the help of a long, defending, wooden fpout; and here they fave the charge of emptying orun- cafing it out of the bin, and alfo the wafte of a great deal of the mbit-flour, that is loft when carried in bafkets. A fteel hand-mill, will, by the help of only one man, grind fix or eight bbfhels in an hour; and will laft a fa¬ mily many years without hardening or cutting. There are fome old fafhioned ftone hand-mills in being, that fome prefer to the iron ones, becaufe they alledge that thefe break the corn’s body, when the iron , ones only cut it in two, which occafions the malt, fo broke by the ftones, to give the water a more eafy, free, and regular power to extra# its virtue, than the cut-malt can that is more confined within its hull. Notwithflanding, the iron ones are now moftly in ufe, for their great difpatch and long duration. In the country they frequently throw a fack of malt on a ftone or brick floor as foon as it is ground, and let it lie, giving it one turn, for a day or two, that the ftones or bricks may draw out the fiery quality it received from the kiln, and give the drink a foft mild tafte. . ?W - I N G. Of the Nature of feveral Waters, and their Ufe in Brewing. Water is a matter of great importance in brewing wholefome fine malt-liquors,; Now, the more finaple and freer every water is from foreign particles, it is the bet¬ ter. Spring-waters are in general liable to partake of thofe minerals through which they pafs. At Uppingham in Rutland, their watey is.faid to come off an ahum rock, and fo. tinges 1 theit beer with its faline quality, that it is eafily tafted at the firft draught. But that which will lather with foap, or foft water, that percolates through chalk,, or a grey fire-ftone, is generally accounted.beft for chalk in this refpe# excells all other earths, becaufe it communicates nothingun wholefome. to the waters, but abforbs .any' 1 minerals that, may accompany the water that runs through them : For which reafon they, throw in great quantities of chalk into their wells at Ailefbury to foften their water, which, coming off a black fand- ftone, is fo hard and lharp, that it will often turn their beer four in a week’s time ; fo that in its original ftate it is neither fit to walk nor brew with, but fo loog as the alcaline particles of the chalk hold good, they put jt tq both ufes. River-water is lefs liable to be loaded with metallic,' petrifying, or faline particles* than the well or Ipring forts, efpecially at fome diftance from the fpring head, becaufe the rain-water mixes with and. foftens it. But in running, it often collects groft particles, from ouzy muddy mixtures, particularly near town, which make the beer fubje# to.new fermentations, andg^ow foul jap- on any alteration of the weather, as the Thamefc-water: generally does ; yet this, for its foftnefs, is much betteq than the hard foit ; however, both thefe waters are uled- by fome brewers. But where river-water.Can be had clean in a dry time, when no great rain has lately fell out of rivulets, or rivers that have a gravelly, chalky, Tandy/ or ftony bottom, free from the difturbance of cattle, &c. and in good air, it ; may then juftly claim the name of a moft excellent water for brewing, and will make a ftrong-: er drink with the fame quantity of malt than any of the well-waters; infomuchthat that of the Thames has been proved to make as ftrong beer with feven bulhels of malt, as well-water, with eight,; and fo are all river-waters in a proportionable degree, and, where they can be obtain-- ed clean and pure, drink may be drawn fine in a few days after tunning. Rain-water is very foft, of a moft Ample and pure na¬ ture, and the beft diluter of any, efpecially if received free from dirt and mortar that often mix with it as it runs off tiled roofs; this is very agreeable for brew¬ ing ©f ales that are not to be kept long, but for beers that are to remain fome time in the calks, it is not fo good, being apt to putrify the fooneft of any. Pond waters. This includes all:Handing waters, chief-, ly from rain, and are good or bad according to circum- fiances; for where there is a clean bottom, and the wa¬ ter lies undifturbed from the tread of cattle, or too ma¬ ny fiflt, in an open found air, in a large quantity, and where"},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"BRE W where the fun has free accefs, it is then nearly as good as rain or river-waters.

(tiff mafh: While this is doing, there is more liquor heating in the copper, that mud not be let into the malh-tun till it is very (harp, almod ready to boil; with this they mafh again, then cover it with feveral balkets of malt, and let it (land an hour before it runs into the under back, whi.ch, when boiled an hour and a half with a good quantity of hops, makes this (lout.

His copper holds twenty-four gallons, and the mafh- tub has room enough for four or more buffiels of malt. The firlt full copper of boiiing water he. puts into the mafh-tub, there to lie a quarter of an hour, till the (team is fo far fpent that he can fee his face in it; or, as foon as the hot water is put in, throws a pail or two of cold water into it, which will bring it at once into a tem¬ per ; then he lets three buffiels of malt be run leifurely into it, and ftirred or maffied all the while, but as little as can be, or no more than juft to keep the malt from clotting or balling ; when that is done, he puts one buffiel of dry malt at the top, to keep in the vapour or fpirit, and fo lets if ftand covered two hours, or till the next copper-full of water is boiling hot, which he lades over the malt or goods three hand-bowls full at a time, that are to run off at the cock or tap by a very fmail ftream before more is put on, which again muft be returned into the mafti tub till it comes off exceeding line ; for, unlefs the wort is clear when it goes into the copper, there are little hopes it will be fo in the barrel ; which leifure way obliges him to be fixteen hours in brewing thefe four buihels of malt. Now between the Jadings-over he puts cold warer into the copper to be boiling hot, while the other is running off; by this means hi* copper is kept up near full, and the cock fpending to the end of brewing his ale or fmail beer, of which only twenty-one gallons muft be faved of the firft wort that is referved in a tub, wherein four ounces of hops are put, and then it is to be fet by. For the fecond wort we will luppofe there are twenty gallons of water in the copper boiling hot, that muft be all laded over in the fame manner as the former was, but no cold water need here be mixed when half of this is run out into a tub, it muft be dire&ly put into the Copper with half of the firft wort, drained through the brewing-fieve as it lies on a finall wooden 1'oofe frame over the copper, to keep back thofe hops that were f rft put in to preferve it, which is to make the firft copper twenty-one gallons; then, upon its beginning to boil, he puts in a pound of hops in one or two canvas qr other coarfe linen bags, fomewhat larger than contain the Hops, that an allowance may be gi ’wNsSEft their fwell; this he boife away very brifkly for fiallfatV hour, when he takes the hops out and continuts'hblfihg the wort by rtfelf till it breaks into par¬ ticles aMittl^.

The reft of the third or fmall-beer wort will be about fifteen or twentv gallons more or lefs, which he mixes diredHy with fome cold water to keep it free of excife, and puts it into the copper as the firft liquor to begin a fecond brewing of ale, with another four bufhels of malt as he did before, and fo on for feveral days together if necef- fary; and at laft there may be fome fmall-beer made. The Nature and Ufe of the Hop. This vegetable was formerly thought to be an un- W I N G. wholefome ingredient. Indeed, when the hop, in a dear time, is adulterated with water, in which aloes, &c. have been infufed, in order to make the old hops recover their bitternefs, and feem new, then they are to be look¬ ed on as unwholefome; but the pure new hop, when properly managed, has no hurtful qualities. But if the hops are boiled in ftrong or fmail worts beyond their fine and pure nature, the liquor fuffers, and will be tanged with a noxious tafte, both ungrateful and unwholefome to the ftomach ; and, if boiled to a very great excefs, they will be apt to caufe Teachings. . It is for thefe rea¬ sons that we advife the boiling two parcels of frefh hops in each copper of ale-wort; and, if there were three for keeping beer, it would be fo much the better for the tafte, health of body, and longer prefervation of the beer in a found fmooth condition. For this purpofe, fome make a bag, like a pillowber, and boil the hops in it half an hour; then take them out, and put in an¬ other bag of the like quantity of frefh hops, and boil them half an hour more; by which means there is an opporttfnity of boiling both wort and hops a due time, faving the trouble of (training them through a fieve, and fecuring the feeds of the hops at the fame time from mixing with the drink; afterwards they boil the fame bags in the fmail beer, till the fubftance of it is got out; but obferve that the \"bags be made larger than what would juft contain the hops, otherwife it will be difficult to boil out their fubftance. It is .true, that here is a charge increafed by the confumption of a great¬ er quantity of hops than ufual; but then how greatly will they anfwer the defired end of enjoying fine-pala- ted wholefome drink, that, in a cheap time, will not a- mount to much, if bought at the beft hand; and, if we confider their after-ufe and benefit in fmail beer, there is not any lofs at all in their quantity: But, where it can be afforded, the very fmail beer would be much impro¬ ved if frefh hops were al'fo fhifted in the boiling of this as well as the ftronger worts. Hence may appear the hardfhips that many are Under of being neceffitated to drink of thofe brewers malt-liquors, who, out of ava¬ rice, boil their hops \\o the laft, that they may not lole any of their quinteffence. After the wort is cooled and put into the working-vat or tub, fome throw frefh hops into it, and work them with the yeaft, at the fame time referving a few gallons of raw wort to wafh the yeaft through a fieve to keep back the hop. This is a good way where enough of hops have not been fufficiently boiled in the wort, or to pre¬ ferve it in the coolers where it is laid thick When hops are dear, many ufe the feeds of worm¬ wood inftead of them : Others ufe the daucus or wild* carrot feed that grows in our common fields, which many of the poor people gather* and dry in their houfes* for the purpofe of felling them to the brewers : Others ufe horer hound, which indeed is a fine bitter, and grows on fe¬ veral of our commons; Hops have a fine grateful bitter, which makes the drink eafy of digeftion; they alfo keep it from running into fuch cohefions as would make it ropy, vapid, and four; and therefore are not only of great ufe in boiled,. but in raw worts, to preferve them found till they can be put"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"BREW pur into the copper, and afterwards in the tun, while the drink is working. Here then it muft be obferved, that the earthy part of the hop is the caufe of that rough, harfh, unpleafant tafte which accompany both ales and beers that have the hops fo long boiled in them, as to tindlure their worts with their mifchievous effe&s; for, notwithftanding the malt be ever fo good, the hops, if boiled too long in them* will be fo predominant as to caufe a bad tafte. Of boiling Malt-liquors. Althotch it has been formerly faid, that an hour and a half is requifite for boiling of October beer, and an hour for ales and fmall beer; yet it is to be obferved, that an exa<3 time is not altogether a certain rule in this cafe , for, when loofe hops are boiled in the wort fo long till they all fmk, their feeds will arife and fall down again : the wort alfo will be curdled, and broken into fmall particles if examined in a hand-bowl, but after¬ wards into larger, as big as great pins heads, and will appear clean and line at the top. This is fo much a rule with fome, that they regard'not time, but this fign, to fhe w when the wort is boiled enough ; and this will hap¬ pen fooner or later, according to the nature of the,bar- ley, and its being well malted; for, if it comes off chalks or gravels, it generally has the good property of breaking or curdling foon; but, if off tough clays, then it is longer, which, by fome perfons, is not a little va hied, becaufe it faves time in boiling, and confequently the confumption of the wort. It is alfo to be obferved, that pale malt-wons will not break fo foon in the copper as the brown forts; but, when either of their worts boil, it lhould be to the pur- pofe, for then they will break fooner, and Wafte lefs, than if they are kept fimmering, and will Irkewife work more kindly in the tun, drink fmoother, and keep longer. Now all malt-worts may be fpoiled by too little or too much boiling: If too little, then the drink will.always tafte raw, mawkifh, and be un wholefome in the ftomach, where, inflead of helping to dilute and digeft onr food, it will caufe obftru&ions, cholics, head-achs, and other difeafes: Befides, all fuch under-boiled drinks are cer¬ tainly. expofed to ftalenefs and fournefs, much fooner than thofe that have had their full time in the copper. And if they are boiled too long, they will then thicken and nbt come out of the copper line and in a right condi¬ tion. which will caufe it never to be right clear in the barrel. But to be more particular, no ale-worts, boiled lefs than an hour, can be good ; becaufe, in an hour’s time, they cannot acquire a thicknefs of body any ways detri¬ mental to them; and, in lefs than an hour, the ramous vifeid parts of the ale cannot be fufficiently broke and di¬ vided, fo as to prevent its running into cohelions, ropi- nefs, and fournefs; becaufe in ales there are not hops enough allowed to do this, which good boiling muft in a great meafure fupply,- or elfe fuch drink can never be good; for then its cohefive parrs being not thoroughly broke and comminuted by time and boding, remain hard, I N G. 671 and in a good meafure indigeftible in the ftomach : How ignorant then are thofe people, who, in tippling of fuch li¬ quor, can praife it for excellent good ale, only becaufe its tafte is fweetilh, (which is the nature of fuch raw drinks)., believing it to be the pure effect of the genuine malt, and not perceiving the brewer’s avarice and cunning, to fave the confumption of his wort by (hortnefs of boiling, tho’ to the great prejudice of the drinker’s health ? In boiling, both time and the curdling or breaking of the wort lhould be confulted ; for if a perfon was to boil the wort an hour, and then take it out of the copper be¬ fore it was rightly broke, it would be wrong manage¬ ment, and the drink would not be fine and wholefome; and if it lhould boil an hour and a half, or two hours, without regarding when its particles are in a right order, then it may be too thick; fo that due care muft be had to the two extremes, to obtain it in its due order; therefore, in Odober and keeping beers, an hour and a quarter’s good boiling is commonly fufficient to have a thorough cured drink; for generally in that time it will break and boil enough; becaufe in this there is a double fecurity .by length of boiling, and a quantity of hops Ihiftcd; but-in the new way there is only a Angle one, and that is by a double or treble allowance of frelh hops boiled only half an hour in the wort; and for this prac¬ tice a reafon is afligned, that the hops, being endowed with difeutient apertive qualities, will, by them and their great quantity, fupply the defedl of underboil¬ ing the wort; and that a farther conveniency is here enjoyed by having only the fine, wholefome, ftrong, floury, fpirituous parts of' the hop in the drink, exclu- five of the phlcgmetic, earthy parts which would be extracted, if the hops were to be boiled above half gn hour; and therefore there are many now that are fo at¬ tached to this new method, that they will not brew ale or beer any other way, thinking, that if hops are boiled above thirty minutes, the wort will exhibit fome of their bad qualities; The allowance of hops for ale or beer cannot be ex¬ actly adjufted without coming to particulars, becaufe the proportion ftiould be according to the nature and quality of the malt, the feafon-of the year it is brewed in, and the length of time it is to be kept. - For ftrong brown ale brewed in-any of the winter- months, and boiled an hour, one pound‘is but barely fufficient for a hogfliead; if it be tapped in three weeks or a month. If for pale ale brewed at that time, and for that age; one pound and a quarter of hops; but if thefe ales are brewed in any of the .fummer months, there ftiould be more hops-allowed; For Oftober or March brown beer, a hogftread made from eleven buffiels of malt boiled an hour and a quarter, to be kept nine months, three pounds and a half ought to be boiled.in fuch drink at the leaft.

Foxing .is a misfortune, or rather a difeafe, in malt- drinks, occafioned by divers means, as the naftinefs of the utenfils, putting the worts too thick together in the backs or coolers, brewing too-often and foon one after another, and fometimes by bad malts and waters, and the liquors taken in wrong heats, being of fuch perni¬ cious confequence to the great brewer in particular, that he fometimes cannot recover and bring his matters into a right order again in lefs than a week or two, and is fo hateful to him in its very name, that it is a general law among them to make all fervants that name the word Fox or Foxing in the brew-houfe to pay fix-pence, which obliges them to call it Reynard ; for, when once the drink is tainted, it may be fmelt at lbrne diilance fome- what like a Fox: It chiefly happens in hot weather, and caufes the beer and ale fo tainted to acquire a fulfome fickilh tafte, that will, if it is received in a great degree, become ropy like treacle, and in fome lliort time turn four. And here we /hall mention the great value of the hop in preventing and curing the fox in malt-liquors. When the wort is run into the tub out of the malhing-vat, it is a very good way to throw fome hops diredUy into it be fore it is put into the copper, and they will fecure it a- gainft fournefs and ropinefs, that are the two effedts of foxed worts or drinks, and are of fuch power in this refpedt, that raw worts may be kept fome time, even in hot weather, before they are boiled, and which is ne- ceffary where there is a large quantity of malt ufed to a little copper; but it is certain that the ftronger worts will keep longer with hops than the fmaller forts: So Jikewife, if a perfon has fewer tubs than are wanted, and he is apprehenilve his worts will be foxed by too thick lying in the coolers or working tubs, then it will be a fafe way to put fome frelh hops into fuch tubs, and work them with the yeall, of, in cafe the drink is alrea¬ dy foxed in the vat or tun, new hops fhould be put in and worked with it, and they will greatly fetch it again into a right order; but then fuch drink Ihould be care¬ fully taken clear off from its grofs nafty lee, which be¬ ing moftly tainted, would otherwife lie in the barrel, cor¬ rupt, and make it worfe.

Of fermenting and 'working of Beers a?id Ales. Though a fin all quantity of yeaft be neceffary to ferment and fine the wort; yet it is in itfelf of a poifon- ous nature, and if beat into the wort too often or in too large a quantity, by its ftupifying and narcotic quality, it makes the liquor fo heady, that five buihels of malt maybe equal in ftrength to fix. But liquor made in this manner is extremely unwholfome. I N G. It is alledged indeed, that beating the yeaft into wort gives it a fine reli/h,- or it makes the ale bite of theyeaft ‘ but the true reafon is, to further its fale, on account of its intoxicating quality. But fome people are fo fond of white thick ale, that they often kill themfelves by drink¬ ing it; nor is their humour much different as to the com¬ mon brewers brown ale, who, when the cuftomer wants a kogfhead, they put in immediately a handful of fait, and another of flour, and fo bring it up ; this is no foon* er on the Hilling than it is tapped, that it may carry a froth on the top of the pot, otherwife they defpife it.

The ftrong beer brewed for keeping is fuffcred to be blood-warm in the winter, when the yeaft is put into it, that it may gradually work two nights and a day at leaft, for this will not admit of fuch a, IvJty operation as the common brown ale, becaufe, if it is worked too warm and halty, fuch b.eer will not keep near fo long as that fermented cooler. The brown ale has, indeed, its yeaft put into it in the evening very warm, becaufe it is often carried away the very next morning. The pale or amber ales are often kept near it, not quite a week under fermen¬ tation, for the better incorporating the yeaft with the wort. Of forwarding and retardhig the Fermentation of Malt- liquors. In cafe beer or ale is backward in working, it is cu- ftomary to caft fome flour out of the dufting-box, or with the hand, over the top of the drink, which will be¬ come a fort of cruft or cover to help to keep the cold out: Others put in one or two ounces of powdered gin¬ ger, which heats the wort and brings it forward: Others take a gallon ftone-bottle and fill it with boiling water, which, being well corked, is put into the working tub, where it communicates a gradual heat for fome time, and forwards the fermentation : Others referve fome raw wort, which they heat and mix with the reft; but then care muft be taken, that the pot in which it is heated has no manner of greafe about it, left it Ihould injpede, inftead of promoting the working; but, for retarding and keeping back any drink that is too much heated in work¬ ing, the cold raw wort is the moft proper of any thing to check it; though fome are known to put one or more pewter difties into it for that purpofe; or, it may be broke intofeveral other tubs, where, by its /hallow ly¬ ing, its fury will be abated. Others again, to make drink work that is backward, will take the whites ot two eggs, and beat them up with half a quartern of good brandy, and put it either into the working-vat, or into the ca/k, which will quickly bring it forward, if a warm cloth is put over the bung.

Some brewers take off all the top-yeaft firft, and then, by a peg near the bottom of the working-tub, draw off the beer or ale, fo that the dregs are by this means left behind. This is very right, in ales that are to be drank foon ; but in beers, that are to lie nine or twelve months in a butt or other calk, there certainly will be wanted fome faces or fediments for the beer to feed on, elfe it mull confequently grow hungry, {harp, and eager; and therefore, if its own top or bottom are not put into a calk with the beer, fome other artificial compolition, or lee, {hould fupply its place, that is wholefomer, and will better feed with fuch drink, than its own natural fettlement; and therefore, there are here inferted feveral receipts for anfwering this end. Of artificial Lees for Stout or Stale Beer to _ feed on. This article is of very great importance in the cu¬ ring of our malt-liquors. The general misfortune of the porter or keeping-beers drinking hard and harfti, is partly owing to the nafty foul feces that lie at the bot¬ tom of the calk, compounded of the fediments of malt, hops, and yeaft. Wheat is, by many, put into fuch beer to feed and preferve it, as being reckoned a fubftantial alcali; however, it has'been proved, that fuch wheat in about three years time has eat into the very wood of the caflc. Others hang a bag of wheat in the veffel, that it may not touch the bottom; but, in both cafes, the wheat is difcovered to abforb and collet the acid quali¬ ties of the beer, yeaft, and hop. Hence' it is, that fuch whole wheat is loaded w ith the qualities of the unwhole- fome fettlements or grounds of the beer, and becomes of fuch a corroding nature, as to do mifchief; and, for that reafon, fome hang a bag of the flour of malted oats, wheat, peafe, or beans, in the veffels of beer, as being of a lighter and mellower body than the whole wheat or its flour, and more natural to the liquor: But whether it be raw wheat or malted, it is fuppofed, after this re¬ ceptacle has emitted its alcalous properties to the beer, and taken in all it can of the acid qualities thereof, that fuch beer will in time prey upon that again, and fo com¬ municate its pernicious qualities to the liquor. Compofition for feeding Porter or Keeping-Beers. Take a quart of French brandy, or as much of En- glifh, that is free from any burnt tang, or other ill tafte, and is full proof; to this put as much wheat or bean- flour as will knead it into dough, put it in long pieces \"into the bung-hole, as foon as the beer has done work¬ ing, or afterwards, and let it gently fall piece by piece to the bottom of the butt ; this will maintain the diink in a mellow frelhnefs, keep ftalenefs off for fome time, and caufe it to be the ftronger as it grows aged. Another. Take one pound of treacle, or honey, one pound of the powder of dried oyller-lhells, .or fat chalk, mix them well, and put it into a butt, as foon as it has done work¬ ing, or fome time after, and bung it well ; this will both fine and preferve the beer in a foft, fmooth condition for a great while.

Of the Cellar or Repofitory for keeping Beers and Ales. Tr is' certain, that the weather has not only a power or influence in brewing, but alfo after die diink is in the barrel, hoglhead, or butt, in cellars, or other places, which is often the caufe of forwarding or retarding the ficenefs of malt-liquors; for if we brew iB cold weather, and the drink is to ftand in a cellar of clay, or where fprings rife, or waters lie or pafs through fuch a place, riiefe will check the due courfe of the drink, chill, flat, deaden, and hinder it from becoming fine. Sa likewife, if beer or ale. is brewed in hot weather, and put into chalky, gravelly, or fandy cellars, and efpecially if the windows open to the fouth, fo.uth-eaft, or foutli-weft, then it is very likely it will not keep long, but be muddy andftale : Therefore, to keep beer in fuch a cellar, it Ihould be brewed in October, that the drink may have time to oure itfelf before the hot weather comes on; but, in wettilh or damp cellais, it is beft to brew in March, that the drink may have time to fine and fettle before the winter weather is advanced. Now, cellars Ihould have double or treble doors, that the outer one may be fhut before the inner one is opened, to keep the air out. If a cellar be kept dry, and have double doors, it is reckoned warm in winter, and cool in fummer. But the beft of celiais are thought to be thofe in chalks,. gravels, or fands; and particularly in chalks, which are of a drying quality more.than any other, and ccufequently diffipate damps ; which contributes much to the gook keeping of the drink, for all damp cellars are prejudicial to the pre- fervation of beers and ales, and fooner bring on the rot¬ ting of the calks and hoops than the dry ones. Befides, in fuch inclofed cellars and temperate air, the beers and ales ripen more kindly, are better digefted and foftened, and drink fmoother : But, when the temperature of the air in the cellar is unequal, the drink foon grows ftale. Though malt-liquor be truly brewed, yet it is often fpoil- ed in a bad cellar, that occafions fuch alternate ferment¬ ations as to make it thick and four, though it fometimes happens that after fuch changes it fines itfelf again.’ To prevent thefe commotions of the beer, fome brew their pale malt in March, and their brown in October ; be¬ cause the pale malt, having not fo many fiery particles in it as the brown, Hands more in need of the fummeris weather to ripen it, while the brown fort, being more hard and dry, is better able to defend itfelf againft the winter-colds that will help to fmooth its harfh particles ; yet, when they happen to be too Violent, borfe-duttg Ihould be laid to the windows as a fortification againft them. Some are of ppinion, that Oftober is the beft of all o- ther months to brew any fort of malt in, by reafon there are fo many cold months direftly following, that will di- geft the drink and make it much excel that brewed in March, becaufe fuch beer will not want that care and watching, as that brewed in March abfolutely requires, by often taking out and putting in the vent-peg on change of weather; and, if it is always left out, then it dead¬ ens and palls the drink; yet, if due care is not taken in this refpeft, a thunder or ftormy night may marr all, by making the drink ferment and burft the ca/k; for which relfon, as iron hoops are molt in fafhion at this time, they are certainly the greateft fecurity to the fafe- ty of the drink thus expofed; and next to tliem is the chefnut-hoop; both which will endure a Ihorter or longer time, as the cellar is more or lefs dry, and according to the management attending them : The iron hoops generally begin to ruft firft at the edges, and therefore Ihould be rubbed off, and be kept from wet as much as poflible.

B R I BRICK, a. fat reddilh earth, formed into long, fquares, four inches broad, and eight or nine long, by means of a wooden mould, and thea baked or burnt in a kiln,, to lerve the purpofes of building. Bricks are of great antiquity, as appears by the fa- cred writings, the tower and walls of Babylon being with them. In the eaft, they baked their bricks in the fun ; the Romans uftd them unburnt, only leaving them to dry for four or five years in the air. Tiie Greeks chiefly uftd three kinds of bricks ; the firft whereof was called \\_didoron,~\\ i. e. of two palms ; the fecond, \\_tetradoron~\\, of four palms ; the third, L pentadoron ], of five palms. They had‘-alia other bricks, juft half each of thofe, to render their works more folid, and alfo more agreeable to the fight, by the diverfities of the figures and fizes of the bricks. Pliny fays, that to make good bricks they muft hot confift of any earth that is full of land or gravel, nor of fuch as is gritty or ftony; but of a greyilh marl, or whitiflr chalky clay, or at lead of a reddilh earth : He alfo adds, that the bell feafon for making bricks is the fpring; becaufe, ifmhde in fummer, they will ba."},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"% B R I ( 676 ) B R I b? fubje< 3 : to crack, and be full of chinks.

Bricks, among us, are various, according to their va¬ rious forms, dimenGons, tifes, method of making, &c. the principal of which are, Compafs-bricks, of a circu¬ lar form, ufed in fteyoiog of walls : Concave, or hol¬ low bricks, on one fide flat like a common brick, on the other hollowed, and ufed for conveyance of wa¬ ter : Feather-edged bricks, which are like common llatute bricks, only thinner on one edge than the o- ther, and ufed for penning up the brick pannels in timber buildings : Cogging bricks are ufed for making the indented works under the caping of walls built with great bricks: Caping bricks, formed on purpofe for caping of walls: Dutch or Flemilh bricks, ufed to pave yards, ftables, and for foap-boilers vaults and cifterns: Clinkers, fuch brides as are glazed by the heat of the fire in making : Sandel or famel-bricks, are fuch as lie outmoft in a kiln, or clamp, and con- fequently are foft and ufelefs, as not being thoroughly burnt: Great bricks are thofe twelve inches long, fix broad, and three thick, ufed to build fence-walls: Plailfer or'buttrefs bricks, have a notch at one end, half the breadth of the brick ; their ufe is to bind the work which is built of great bricks: Statute-bricks or frnall common bricks, ought, when burnt, to be nine inches long, four and a quarter broad, and two and a half thick ; they arc commonly ufed in paving cellars, finks, hearths, <kc. Bricks are burnt either in a kiln or clamp. Thofe that are burnt in a kiln, are Gift fet or placed in it, and then the kiln being covered with pieces of bricks, they put in fonie wood to dry them with a gentle fire ; and this they continue till the bricks are pretty dry, which is known by the fmoke’s turning from a darkilh colour to a tranfparent fmoke: They then leave off putting in wood, and proceed to make ready for burn¬ ing, which is performed by putting in brulh, furze, fpray, heath, brake, or fern-faggots; but before they put in any faggots, they dam up the mouth or mouths of the kiln with pieces of bricks (which they call Jhin- log ) piled up one upon another, and clofe it up with wet brick-earth, inilead of mortar. The Ihinlog they make fo high, that there is but juft room above it to thruft in a faggot; then they proceed to put in more faggots, till the kiln and its arches look white, and the fire appears at the top of the kiln ; upon which they flacken the fire for an hour, and let all cool by degrees. This they continue to do, alternately heating and flacking, till the ware be, thoroughly burnt, which is ufuaily effected in forty- eight hours. About London they chiefly burn in clamps, built of the bricks themfelves, after the manner of arches in kilns, with a vacancy between each brick, for the fire to play through ; but with this difference, that inftead Of arching, they fpan it over by making the bricks project one over another on both (ides of the place, for.the wood and coals to lie in till they meet, and are bounded by the bricks at the top, which clofe all up. The place for the fuel is carried up ftrait on both fides, till about three feet high ; then they almoft fill it with wood, and over that lay a covering of fea-coal, and then overfpan the arch; but they ftrew fea coal alfo over the clamp, betwixt all the rows of bricks; laftly, they kindle the wood, which gives fire to the coal; and when all is burnt, then they conclude the bricks are fufficiently burnt.

When they arrived at their journey’s end, the axle-tree of the coach they rode in was burnt, to figoify that the bride was never to re¬ turn to her father’s houfe. Among the Romans, when a bride was carried home to her hufband’s houfe, flie was not to touch the threlhold at her firft entrance, but was to leap over it.

Bridges are a fort of edifices very difficult to exe¬ cute, on account of the inconvenience of laying foun¬ dations, and walling under water. The parts of a bridge are the piers, the arches ; the pavement, or way ever for cattle and carriages; the foot-way on each fide*, for foot paffengars; the rail or parapet, which inclofes the whole; and the butments or ends of the bridge on the bank. The conditions required in a bridge are, that it be well-defigned, commodious, durable, and fuitably de¬ corated. The piers of ftone-bridges fliould be equal in number, that there may be one arch in the middle, where commonly the current is ftrongeft; their thick- nefs is not to be lefs than a fixth part of the fpan of the arch, nor more than a fourth ; they are common¬ ly guarded in the front with angular fterlings, to break the force of the current: the ftrongeft arches are thofe whofe fweep is a whole femicircle;. as the piers of brid¬ ges always diminifh the bed of a river, in cafe of inunda¬ tions, the bed muft be funk or hollowed in proportion to the fpace taken up by the piers (as the waters gain in depth what they lofe in breadth) which otherwife conduce to wafh away the foundation and endanger the piers: To prevent this, they fometimes diminifh the current, either by lengthening its courfe, or by ma¬ king it more winding; or by flopping the bottom with rows of planks, flakes, or piles, which break the current. It is alfo required that thq foundation of bridges be laid at that feafon of the year, when the waters are loweft; and if the ground be rocky, hard gravel, or ftony, the firft ftones of the foundation may be laid on the furface *, but if the foil be foft fand, it will be neceffary to dig till you come to a firm bot¬ tom. Among the bridges of antiquity, that built by Tfa- jan over the Danube is allowed to be the mod magni¬ ficent ; it was compofed of twenty arches, of an hun¬ dred and fifty feet in height, and their opening from one pier to another was an hundred and fixty feet: The piers of this fine bridge are ftill to be feen in the Danube, being eredted between Servia and Moldavia', a little above Nicopolis. Among modern bridges, that of Weftminfter, built over the river Thames, may be accounted pne of the fineft in the world: It is forty-four feet wide, a com¬ modious foot-way being allowed for pafTengers, on each fide, of about feven feet broad, raifed above the ro^d allowed for carriages, and paved with broad moor-ftones, while the fpace left between them is fuf- ficient to 'admit three carriages and two horfes to go a-breaft, without any danger. Its extent from wharf to wharf is 1220 or 1223 feet, being full three hun¬ dred feet longer than. London-bride. The free wa¬ ter-way under the arches of this bridge is eight hun¬ dred and feventy feet, being four times as much as the free water-way left between the fterlings of Lon don-bridge: This difpofition, together with the gen-' tlenefs of the ftream, are the chief reafons why no fenfible fall of water can ever flop, or in the leaft Vol. I.

All the arches of this bridge are femicircular; they all fpring from about two feet above low-water mark; the middle arch is feventy-fix feet wide, and the o- thers decreafe in breadth equally on each fide by four feet. This bridge is built of the beft materials ; and the fize and difpofition of thefe materials are fuch, that there is no falfe bearing, or fo much as a falfe joint in the whole ftru£ture ; befides that, it is built in a neat and elegant tafte, and with fuch fimplicity and gran¬ deur, that, whether viewed from the water, or by the paflengers who walk over it, it fills the mind with an agreeable furprize. The femioftangular towers, which form the recedes of the foot-way, the manner of placing the lamps, and the height of the baluftrade, are at once the moft beautiful, and, in every other refpeft, the beft contrived. But the moft Angular bridge in Europe is that built over the river Tave in Glamorganfhire. It confifts of one ftupenduous arch, the diameter of which is 175 feet, the chord 140, the altitude 39, and the abutments 32.

Bath waters are beneficial, when the fecietions from’ the blood are diminilhed ; Briftol, when too much in- creafed: Bath attenuates powerfully; Briftol incraf- fates : Bath is fpirituous, and helps defers; Briftol is more cooling, and fupprefles plentitude, with its’ confequences, inflammations and haemorrhages, * If we may judge of the contents of Briftol waters, from their effects, which are exceedingly deterfive and healing; they partake chiefly of chalk, lapis calcarius, and calaminaris, the virtues of which are too dry to cleanfe y they fill ulcers with fleflt, and cicatrize them. But whatever the fubftances are that impregnate them, it is plain they are very fubtile, and that there is but little of a terreftrial part in them, from their fpecific lightnefs above other waters: Yet when we confider how agreeable to the fight,, fmell and tafte ; how clear, pure and foft they are ; their gentle degree of heat, fo adapted to fundry difeafes; it muft be con¬ cluded, that thofe waters do imbibe fome falutary par¬ ticles in their paflage through the earth ; and, from; the many cures yearly wrought by them, that they have an undoubted tittle to a place in the firft clafs of medicinal waters. The difeafes in which Briftol waters are properly preferibed, are internal haemorrhages and inflamma¬ tions, blood-fpitting, dyfentery, and immoderate flux of the menfes, purulent ulcers of the vifeera : Hence, in confumptions, the dropfy, feurvy with heat, ftone, gravel, ftrangury; the habitual gput, fcorbutic rheu- raatifm, diabetes, flow- fevers, atrophy, pox, cancer, gleets in both fexes, king’s evil, fcc\\ ; in all thefe difor- ders, Bath waters are not only improper, but hurtful; they roufe the too languid, and quicken the too lazy circulation; they allay the heat, and reftrain the too rapid motion of the blood. Thofe impregnate the phlegmatic, thefe attemperate the choleric conftitution. Bath water feems to be adapted to the maladies of the ftomach, guts, and nerves; Briftol, to thofe of the: lungs, kidneys, and bladder : Again, Bath waters are at variance with a milk courfe ; and the Briftol can never be judicioufty diredled, but when they may be: joined with reafon and fuccefs.

This ornament was firft given by Tarquinius with the prsetexsa to his fon, who had, with his own hand, at fourteen years of age, killed an enemy. Thus we find the bulla was a fign of triumph. Macrobius relates, that the children of freed men were allowed to wear the prxtexta, and, inftead of the golden bulla, a leathern one, about their necks : Thofe bullae were made hollow within to inclofe amulets againft envy, &c. When the youth arrived at fifteen years of age, they hung up their bullae about the necks of their gods lares. We are farther informed, that the bullae were not only hung about the necks of young men, but of horfes alfo. I 3 ULLEN, a term ufed by country people for hemp- ftalks peeled.

The rites of burial are looked upon in all countries, and at all times, as a debt fo facred, that fuch as ne- gle&ed to jdifcharge it were thought accurfed: Hence the Romans called them jujla , and the Greeks \\notni* via*, dikvia , hofia,~\\ &c. words implying the inviolable obligations which nature has laid upon the living to take care of the obfequies of the dead. Nor are we to wonder, that the ancient Greeks and Romans were extremely folicitous about the interment of their de¬ ceafed friends, fince they were ftrongly perfuaded, that their fouls could not be admitted into the Elyfian fields till their bodies were committed to the earth ; and if it happened that they never obtained the rites of burial, they were excluded from the happy manlions -for the term of an hundred years. For this reafon it was con- fidered as a duty incumbent upon all travellers who fhould meet with a dead body in their way, to call duft or mould upon it three times, and of thele three hand¬ fuls, one at leaft was caft upon the head. The an¬ cients likewife confidered it as a great misfortune if they were not laid in the fepulchres of their fathers ; for which reafon, fuch as died in foreign countries had ufually their alhes brought home, and interred with thofe of their anceftors. But notwithftandiDg their great care in the burial of the dead, there were fome perfons whom they thought unworthy of that laft of¬ fice, and to whom therefore they refufed it: Such . were, 1. Public or private enemies. 2. Such as be¬ trayed, or confpiied againft their country. 3. Tyrants, who were always looked upon as enemies to their coun¬ try. 4. Villains guilty of facrilege. 5. Such as died in debt, whofe bodies belonged to their creditors. And, 6. Some particular offenders, who fuffered ca¬ pital punilhment. Of thofe who were allowed the rites of burial, fome were diftinguilhed by particular circumftances of dif- grace attending their interment: Thus perfons killed by lightening were buried apart by themfelves, being thought odious to the gods; thofe who wafted their patrimony, forfeited the right of being buried in the fepulchres of their fathers; ard thofe who were guilty"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"BUR ( <5o2 ) BUR of feif-murder were privately depofited in the ground, without the accuftomed folemnities. Among the Jews, the privilege of burial was denied only to fclf-murder- ers, who were thrown out to rot upon the ground. In the Cliriftian church, though good men always defired the privilege of interment, y t they were not, like the heathens, fo concerned for their bodies, as to think it any detriment to them, if either the barbarity of an e- oemy, or fome other accident, deprived them of this pri¬ vilege. The primitive Chriftian church denied the more foienin rites of burial only to unbaptized perfons, felf- murclerers, and excommunicated perfons who continued obilinate and impenitent, in a manifell contempt of the church’s cenfures. The place of burial among the Jews was never par¬ ticularly determined. We find they had graves in the town and country, upon the highways, in gardens, and upon mountains. Among the Greeks, the temples were made repofitories for the dead in the primitive ages ; yet the general cuftom in latter ages, with them, as well as with the Romans and other heathen nations, was to bury their dead without their cities, and chief¬ ly by the highways. Among the primitive Chrillians, burying in cities was not allowed for the firft three hundred years, nor in churches for many ages after, the dead bodies being firft depofited in the atrium or church yard, and porches and porticos of the church : hereditary burying-places were forbidden till the 12th century.

BURICK, a town of the duchy of Cleves, in the circle of Weftphalia in Germany, fituated on the river Rhine, about twenty miles fouth of Cleves : E. long. 6° 5', N. lat. jt° 35'. BURLESQUE, a fpecies of compolition, which, tho’ a great engine of ridicule, is not confined to that fub- jedt; for it is clearly diftinguilhable into burlefque that excites laughter merely, and burlefque that excites derifion or ridicule. A grave fubjedt, in which there is no impropriety, may be brought down by a certain colouring fo as to be rilible, as in Virgil Traveftie; the author firll laughs at every turn, in order to 'make his readers laugh. The Lutrin is a burlefque poem of the other fort, laying hold of a low and trifling in¬ cident to expofe the luxury, indolence, and contentious fpirit of a fet r.f monks. Boileau, the author, turns the fubjedt into ridicule by drefling it in the he¬ roic ftyle; and affedting to confider it as of the utmoft dignity and importance. Though ridicule is the poet’s aim, he always carries a grave face, and never once bewrays a fmile. The oppofition between the fubjedt and the manner of handling it, is what produces the ridicule ; and therefore, in a compolition of this kind, -no image profeffedly ludicrous ought to have quarter, becaufe fuch images dellroy the contrail. Though the burlefque that aims at ridicule, produ¬ ces its effedts by elevating the ftyle far above the fub¬ jedt, yet the poet ought to confine himfelf to fuch ima¬ ges as are lively, and readily apprehended. A ftrain- ed elevation, foaring above the ordinary reach of fan¬ cy, makes not a pleafant imprefiion. The mind is foon difgufted by being kept long on the ftretch. Ma¬ chinery may be employed in a burlefque poem, fuch as the Lutrin, the Difpenfary, or HuJibras, with more fuccefs and propriety than in any other fpe¬ cies of poetry. For burlefque poems, though they affume the air of hiftory, give entertainment chiefly by their pleafant and ludicrous pidtures: It is not the aim of fuch a poem to raife fympathy; and for that rea- fon, a ftridt imitation of nature is not neceffary. And hence, the more extravagant the machinery in a ludi¬ crous poem, the more entertainment it affords.

The method of burning, or rather drying, lamp¬ black, is as follows : Put it into a crucible over a clear fire, letting it Femain till it be red hot, or fo near it that there is no' manner of fmoke arifes from it. Secondly, Umber, which if it be intended for co¬ lour fgr a horfe, or to be a fhadow for gold, then burning fits it for both thefe purpofes. In order to burn umber, you muft put it into the naked fire, in large lumps, and not take it ojat till it is thoroughly red hot ; if you have a mind to be more curious, put it into a crucible, and keep it over the fire till it be red hot.

Bury St Edmunds, of* St Edmund’s Bury, the county-town of Suffolk, about twelve miles ead of Newmarket, and feventy north-ead of London : E. long. 45', N. lat. 52 0 2o'.

Burning- Bush, that bufh wherein the Lord appeared to Mofes at the foot of mount Horeb, as he was feeding his father-in-law’s flocks. As to the perfon that appeared in the bufh, the text fays, “ That the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the middle of the bufh but whether it was a created angel, fpeaking in the perfon of God, or God himfelf, or (as the mod re¬ ceived opinion is) Chrid - the Son of God, has been matter of fome controverfy among the learned. Thole who fuppofe it no. more than an angel, feem to imply that it would be a diminution of the majedy of God, to appear upon every occafion, efpecially when he has luch a number of celedial miniflers, who may do the bufinefs as well. But cOrifidering that God is prefent every where, the notification of his prefence by fome outward fign in one determinate place, (which is all we mean by his appearance), is in our conception lefs laborious (if any thing laborious could be conceived of God) than a delegation of angels upon every turn from heaven, and feems in the main to illudrate ra¬ ther than debafe the glory of his nature and exidence. But however this be, it is plain that the angel here fpoken of was no created being, from the whole con¬ text, and efpecially from his faying, “ I am the Lord God, the. Jehovah,.” <bc. fince this is not the lan¬ guage of angels, who are always known- to expfefs themfelves in fuch humble terms as thefe, “ I am fent from. God ; I am thy fellow-fervant,” <bc. It is a vain pretence to fay, that an angel, as God’s ambaf- fador, may fpeak in God’s name and perfon ; for what ambafiador of any. prince evSr yet faid, “ I am the king,?” Since therefore no aDgel, without the. guilt of blafphemy, could aflume thefe titles'; and fince nei¬ ther God the Father, nor the Holy Ghod, are ever called by the name of abgel, i. e. ameflenger, or per¬ fon fent, whereas God the Son is galled by the pro¬ phet Malachi, (chap. iii. 1.), “ The angel of the co¬ venant it hence feems'to follow, that this angel of the Lord was God the Son, who might very properly be called an angel, becaufe in the fulnefs of time he was fent into the world in our flelh, as a medenger from God, and might therefore make thefe his tem¬ porary apparitions, prefages and forerunners, as it were, of his more foleinn million. The Mahometans believe, that.one of Mofes’s (hoes, put off by him as he drew near the burning hulh, was placed in the ark of the covenant, in order to preferve the memory of this miracle. BUSHEL, a mealure of capacity for dry things, as grain, fruits, dry pulfe, <bc containing four pecks, or eight gallons, or one-eighth of a quarter. A bulhel, by 12 Henry VII. c. 3. is to contain eight gallons of wheat; the gallon eight pounds of troy-weight; the ounce twenty derlings, and the der- ling thirty-two grains, or corns of wheat growing in the midd of the ear. At Paris, the bufhel is divided into two half bulh- els ; the half bulhel into two quarts ; the quart into two half quarts ; the half quart into two litrons ; and the litron into two half litrons. By a fentence of the provod of the merchants of Paris, the bulhel is to be eight inches two lines and a half high, and ten inches in diameter ; the quart four inches nine lines high, and fix inches nine lines wide ; the half quart four inches three lines high, and five inches diameter; the litron three inches and a half high, and three inches ten lines in diameter. Three bulhels make a minot; fix, a mine ; twelve, a feptier ; and an hundred and forty-four, a muid. In other parts of France the bulhel varies. Oats are meafured in a double proportion to other grains, fo that twenty-four bulhels of oats make a feptier, and 288 a muid. The bulhel of oats is di¬ vided into four picotins, the picotin into two half quarts, or four litrons. For fait, four bulhels make one minot, and fix a feptier ; for coals, eight bulhels make one minot, fixteen a mine, and 320 a muid ; for lime,, three bulhels make a mmot, and forty-eight, minots a muid. BUSKIN, a kind of Ihoe, fomewhat in manner of a boot, and adapted to either foot, and worn by either fex. This part of drefs, covering both the foot and mid¬ leg, was tied underneath the knee ; it was very rich and fine, and principally ufed on the Page by aftors in tragedy. It was of a quadrangular form, and the foie was fo thick, as that, by means thereof, men of the ordinary ftature might be raifed to the pitch and ele¬ vation of the heroes they perfonated. The colour- was generally purple on the ftage : herein it was di- ftinguifhed from the fock, worn in comedy, that be¬ ing only a low common Ihoe.

M. Felibien obferves, that though, in painting, one may fay a figure appears in bufto, yet it is not proper¬ ly called a butt ; that word being confined to things in relievo. The butt is the fame with what the Latins called henna, from the Greek hermes , Mercury, the image of that god being frequently reprefented in that manner by the Athenians. BUSTARD, in ornithology. See Otis. BUSTUARII, in Roman antiquity, gladiators who fought about the buftum, or funeral pile of a deceafed perfon of diftinftion, in the ceremony of his obfequies. This cuftom was found to be lefs barbarous than the firft practice was of facrificing captives at the buftum, or on the tomb of warriors; inftances whereof we meet with both in Roman and Greek antiquities : the blood fpilt o» this occafion, was fuppofed to appeafe, by way of facrifice, the infernal gods, that they might be more propitious to the manes of the deceafed. BUSTUARlfE moech^e, according to feme, women that were hired to accompany the funeral, and lament the lofs of the deceafed: but others are of opinion, that they were rather the more common proftitutes, that flood among the tombs, graves, and other fuch lonely places. BUSTUM, in antiquity, a pyramid or pile of wood upon which were anciently placed the bodies of the deceafed, in order to be burnt. Some authors fay,, that it was properly called buftum after, the burning, quaji bene ujlum ; that before the burning it was cab¬ led pyra, and during the burning, rogus. The buftum in the Campus Marti us was encompaf- fed round with white ftone, and an iron rail. BUTCHER, a perfon who {laughters cattle for the ufe of the table, or who cuts up and retails the fame. Among the ancient Romans, there were three kinds of elfabliftied butchers, whofe office was to furniffi the city with the neceflary cattle, and to take care of pre¬ paring and vending their fleffi. The fuarii provided' hogs; the pecuarii or boarii, other cattle, efpecially oxen; and under thefe was a fubordinate clafs, whofe: office was to kill, called lanii, and carnifices. To exercife the office of butcher among the Jews with dexterity, was of more reputation than to underftand the liberal arts and fciences. They have a book con¬ cerning fhamble-conftitution ; and in cafe of any diffi¬ culty, they apply to fome learned rabbi for advice: nor was any allowed to praftife this art, without a licence in form; which gave the man, upon evidence: of his abilities, a power to kill meat, and others to eat what he killed ; provided he carefully read every week for one year, and every month the next year, and once a quarter during his life, the conftitutio'n a- bove mentioned. We have fome very good laws for the better regulation and preventing the abufes corn*• mitted by butchers. A butcher that fells fwine’s flefh meazled, or dead of the murrain, for the firft offence fliall be amerced; for the fecond, have the pillory ; for the third, be imprifoned and make fine; and for the fourth, abjure thu town. Butchers not felling .meat at reafonable prices, fiiall forfeit double the va¬ lue, leviable by warrant of two juftices of the peace. No butcher (hall kill any flefii in his fealding-houfe, or within the walls of London, qn pain to forfeit for every ox fo killed, I2d. and for every other beaft, 8 d. to be divided betwixt the king and th&profecutor. ^Butcher-bird, in ornithology.

BUT TER, a fat undhious fubftance, prepared from milk by heating or churning it. It was late ere the Greeks appear to have had any notion of butter; their poets make no mention of it, and yet are frequently fpeaking of milk and cheefe. The Romans ufed butter nootherwife than as a me¬ dicine, never as a food. The ancient Chriftians of Egypt burnt butter in their lamps inftead of oil; and in the Roman churches, it was anciently allowed, during Chriftmas time, to bum butter inftead of oil, on account of the great con- fumption of it otherways. For the making of butter, when it has been churn¬ ed, open the churn, and with both hands gather it well together, take it out of the butter-milk, and lay it in¬ to a very clean bowl, or earthen pan; and if the but¬ ter be defigned to be ufed fweet, fill the pan with clear water, and work the butter in it to and fro, till . it is brought to -a firm confiftence of itfelf, without any moifture. When this has been done, it muft be fcotched and fliced over with the point of a knife, every way as thick as poffible, in order to fetch out the fmalleft hair, mote, bit of rag, ftrainer, or any thing that may have happened to fall into it. Then fpread it thin in a bowl, and work it well together, with fuch quantity of fait as you think fit, and make it up into difhes, pounds, half pounds, fee. The newer the butter is, the more wholefome and pleafant it is; and that which is made in May, is efteemed the beft. There are as many forts of butter, as there are dif¬ ferent milks of animals whereof to make it: That of the cow is moll in ufe. It is ufed every where, and there is hardly any fauce^made without -it. The northern people, however, make more ufe of it than others.
