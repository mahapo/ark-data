[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Underst anding the Novelt y of Time by Terence McKenna I suggest that we have enti rel y mi sunderstood the character of time . We are not being pushed by the force of causal necessit y. We human beings, like the rest of nat ure, are react ing to the siren song of the transcendent al object at the end of time. We are on a collision course wit h an event for which there is barely language to describe. I would like to suggest that what is happening on this planet is that time is act ually speeding up . Our species is under the influence of a kind of strange attract or which is moving us through the temporal medium at an ever-accelerat ing rat e. This is a law of the universe, though not one recognized by science. The early universe immediat ely after the hypot hesized \" Big Bang \", was an incredibly simple place. There were no organisms , there were no molecules , there were not even atoms , there was only a pure plasma of elect rons . As the universe cooled, levels of complexit y cryst allized out successively, each one building on the previous level of complexit y. Event ually the temperat ure in the universe dropped low enough that elect rons could set tle into stable orbit s around atomic nuclei. Then you get atomic physics. Those atoms condensed into stars and event ually the temperat ure and pressure i n the cent er of stars was suf ficient to trigger fusion, and heavier element s, like iron , sulphur , and carbon , were cooked up in the cores of the stars. Once you have carbon, wit h its four-valent bonding, you have the possibilit y of molecular complexit y; an ent irely new domain of complexif icat ion. Not to belabor the point , but quickly out of molecules come highly complex polymers, out of highly complex polymers come early replicat ing molecules , from them come prokaryot s , the earliest living cells , non-nucleat ed , then the nucleat ed cells , the eukaryot s , then clust ers of colonies of cells , the earliest organisms , then more complex organisms , event ually higher animals . Out of them, binocular , bipedal primat es wit h an opposable thumb. Out of them, language-using , ushrooms-using , orgiast ic humans . Out of them, hist ory , cities , warf are , hierarchies , writ ing , mat hemat ics , music , and in the twent ieth cent ury this all knit s toget her into some kind of global organism. Now, the disgrace of science is that it denies the import ance of this phenomenon. For science, the most import ant phenomenon in the universe is the move toward heat , deat h, and ent ropy. Physicist s barely not ice that life represent s an amazing and persist ent except ion to the rule that all thermodynamic syst ems run down. Life has achieved the miracle of a stabilit y far from ent ropy through the miracle of met abolism. Not ice that when complexit y emerges out of simpler states, each ascent to the next order occurs more "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"thermodynamic syst ems run down.

The effect is that of being in a kind of tight ening spiral, one of William But ler Yeat s's gyres. We are wrapping ourselves around a cosmic end point of some sort , and this is what I call the transcendent al object at the end of time. It beckons across the dimensions, it throws an enormous shadow over the ent erprise of human hist ory. This is what drives the guru to make his statement , this is what kindles the messiah to his mission, this is what inspires the paint er and the dreamer and the musician. There is an enormous source of affect ion and concern for humanit y which is calling us toward it, across the plains of lower dimensional time and space, and the miracle is that through pert urbing our neurochemist ryin ways which Shamans have always done we can turn to the last page, as it were, and can see there that the ent ire process was act ually toward a good cause. We are moving toward the most prof ound event a planet ary ecology can encount er. We are about to wit ness the freeing of life from the chrysalis of mat ter. This is what our privilege and our dest iny is; to be the final generat ion of people wit h one foot in the mat erial realm of the bat tered primat e and one foot on the ladder to godhead."}]
