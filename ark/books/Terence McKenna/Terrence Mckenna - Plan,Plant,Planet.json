[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"0 UR PRESENT GLOBAL CRISIS is more profound than any previous historical crises, hence our solu- tions must be equally drastic I propose that we should adopt the plant as the organizational model for life in the 21st century, just as the computer seems to be the dominant mental/social model of the late 20th Century, and the steam engine was the guiding image of the 19th Century . This means reaching back in time to models that were successful 15,000 to 20,000 years ago . When this is done is becomes possible to see plants as food, shelter, clothing, and sources of education and religion . The process begins by declaring legitimate what we have denied for so long . Let us declare Nature to be Legitimate . All plants should be declared legal, and all animals for that matter . The notion of illegal plants and animals is obnoxious and ridiculous . Re-establishing channels of direct communica- tion with the planetary Ocher, the mind behind nature, through the use of hallucinogenic plants is the last best hope for dissolving the steep walls of cultural inflexibility that appear to be chan- neling us coward true ruin . We need a new set of lenses to see our way in the world . When the medieval world shifted its world view, secularized European society sought salvation in the revivify- ing of Classic Greek and Roman approaches co law, philosophy, esthetics, city planning and agri- culture . Our dilemma will cast us further back into time in a search for models and answers . The impact of hallucinogenic plants on the evo- lution and emergence of human beings has not been widely examined, yet it promises to provide tu .loce CAe\"N Rcmew PLAN PLANT PLANET BY TERENCE McKENNA fi+c4 `yf an understanding not only of primate evolution but also of the emergence of the cultural forms unique to Homo sapiens . The adaptive advantage conferred by using im- mune-stimulating or appetite-suppressing plants is not difficult to understand . Less easy to under- stand is the way in which plant hallucinogens might have provided similar yet different adap- tive advantages to our remote ancestors . These compounds do not catalyze the immune system into higher states of activity, although this may be a secondary effect . Rather, they catalyze con- sciousness, that peculiar, self-reflecting ability that has reached its greatest apparent expression in human beings . One can hardly doubt that consciousness, like the ability to resist disease, confers an immense adaptive advantage on any individual who possesses it . There is a hidden factor in the evolution of hu- man beings which is neither a \"missing link\" nor a telos imparted from on high . I suggest that this hidden factor in the evolution of human beings, the factor which called human consciousness forth from a bipedal ape with binocular vision, involved a feedback loop with plant hallucinogens . This is not an idea chat has been widely explored, though a very conservative form of this notion appears in R . Gordon Wasson's Soma : Divine Mushroom of Immortality (Wasson, 1971) . Wasson does not comment on the emergence of human- ness out of the primates, but does suggest hallu- cinogenic mushrooms as the causal agent in the appearance of spiritually aware human beings and the genesis of religion . Wasson feels that omnivorous foraging humans would sooner or later have encountered hallucinogenic mushrooms or other psychoactive plants in their environment . The strategy of these early human omnivores 17 GATE FNE IIOAO SAUSAUlQ a 7 \" 161"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"was to eat everything and to vomit whatever was unpalatable . Plants found to be edible by this method were then inculcated into the diet . The mushrooms would be especially noticeable be- cause of their unusual form and color . The state of consciousness induced by mushrooms or other hallucinogens would provide a reason for foraging humans to return repeatedly to those plants, in order to re-experience their bewitching novelty . This process would create what GH- Waddington (1961) called a \"creode~' a pathway of develop- mental activity (in other words, a habit) . Habituation to the experience was insured simply because it was ecstatic . \"Ecstatic\" is a word un- necessary to define except operationally : An ec- static experience is one that one wishes to have over and over again . If hallucinogens are operating as exo-pheromones, that is inter-species chemical messengers, then the dynamic symbiotic relationship between pri- mate and hallucinogenic plant is actually a trans- fer of information from one species to another . The primate gains increased visual acuity and access to the transcendent Other . The benefits to the mushroom arose out of the primate domesti- cation of previously wild cattle, hence the expan- sion of the niche occupied by the mushroom . Where plant hallucinogens do not occur, such WHOLE EARTI REVIEW FALL im processes take place with great slowness, but in the presence of hallucinogens a culture is intro- duced to ever more novel information, sensory input and behavior, and thus is bootstrapped to higher and higher states of self-reflection . Hallucinogenic plants may have been the cata- lysts for everything about us that distinguishes us from other primates except perhaps the loss of body hair . All of the mental functions which we associate with humanness, including recall, pro- jective imagination, language, naming, magical speech, dance, and a sense of mligio may have emerged out of interaction with hallucinogenic plants . Our society more than others will find this theory difficult to accept because we have made pharmacologically obtained eatasy a taboo . Sexuality is a taboo for the same reason : such things are consciously or unconsciously sensed to be entwined with the mysteries of where we came from and how we got to be the way we are . T HE SOLUTION to much of modern mal- aise, including chemical dependencies and repressed psychoses and neurosis, is direct expo- sure to the authentic dimensions of risk repre- sented by the experience of psychedelic plants . The pro-psychedelic plant position is dearly an anti- drug position . Drug dependencies are the result of habitual, unexamined and obsessive behavior ; these Use of drugs by human societies is as old as humanity inelL .What is it in the nature of human beings that allows them to form nearly symbiotic relationships with plants and chemir als in the natural, and now techno- logical, world around them?

Detailed discussion of the previously uneomined relationships of drags to cultural self-expression provides a new way of thinking about human history, as a series of arrangements, made and broken, between human beings and plants .

The plant hallu- cinogens dissolve habits and hold motivations up to inspection by a wider, less egocentric and more grounded point of view within the indivi- duaL It is foolish to suggest that there is no risk, but it is equally uninformed to suggest that the risk is not worth taking . What is needed is ex- periential validation of a new guiding image, an overarching metaphor able to serve as the basis for a new model of society and the individual . The plant/human relationship has always been the foundation of our individual and group exis- tence in the world . What I call the Archaic Revival is the process of reawakening awareness of tradi- tional attitudes toward nature, including plants and our relationship co them . The Archaic Re- vival spells the eventual breakup of the pattern of male dominance and hierarchy based on animal organization, something that cannot be changed overnight by a sudden shift in collective aware . ness . Rather is will follow naturally upon the gradual recognition that the overarching theme that directs the Archaic Revival is the idea/ideal of a vegetation Goddess, the Earth herself as the much ballyhooed Gaia - a concept well docu- mented by 19th-century anthropologists, most notably Fraser, but recently given a new re- spectability by Riane Eisler, Marija Gimbutas and others . The closer a human group is to the gnosis of the vegetable mind - the Gaian collectivity of or . ganic life - the closer their connection co the archetype of the Goddess, hence co the partner . ship style of social organization . The last time that the mainstream of Western thought was re- freshed by the gnosis of the vegetable mind was at the close of the Hellenistic era, before the Mystery religions were finally suppressed by enthusiastic Christian barbarians . My conclusion is that taking the next evoiu . rionary step, the Archaic Revival, the rebirth of the Goddess and the ending of profane history, are agendas that implicitly contain within them- selves the notion of our re-involvement with and the emergence of the vegetable mind . That same mind that coaxed us into self-reflecting language now offers us the boundless landscapes of the imagination . Without such a relationship to psychedelic exo-pheromones regulating our sym- biotic relationship with the plant kingdom we stand outside of an understanding of planetary purpose . And understanding of planetary pur- pose may be the major contribution that we can make to the evolutionary process . Returning to the bosom of the planetary partnership means trading the point of view of the history-creased ego for a more maternal and intuitional style . The widely felt intuition of the presence of the Other as a female companion to the human na- vigation of history can, I believe, be traced back to the immersion in the vegetable mind which provided the ritual context in which human con- sciousness emerged into the light of self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-articulation ; the light of the Great Goddess .

Two im . portant changes would follow from adopting this assumption : The ferninizing of culture on a level chat has yet to be fully explored ; Green Consciousness means recognizing that the real division between the masculine and the feminine is not a division be . tween men and women, but rather is a division between ourselves as conscious animals - omni- vorous, land-clearing war-makers, supreme ex- pression of the yang - and the circum-global mantle of vegetation - the ancient meta-stable yin element that constitutes by far the major portion of the biomass of the living earth . An inward search for values . Inwardness is the characteristic feature of the vegetable, rather than the animal, approach to existence . The animals move, migrate and swarm while plants hold fast . Plants live in a dimension characterized by the solid state, the fixed and the enduring . If there is movement in the consciousness of plants then is must be the movement of spirit and attention in the domain of the vegetal imagination . Perhaps this is what the reconnection to the vegetal God- dess through psychedelic plants, what the Archaic Revival actually points toward, that the life of the spirit is the life that gains access to the vi- sionary realms resident in magical plant teachers . This is the truth that shamans have always known and practiced Awareness of the green side of \t .: ; mind was called Vriditas by the 12th-century visionary Hildegard von Bingen . A NEW PARADIGM capable of offering hope of a path out of the cultural quicksand has to provide a teal-world agenda addressed to the escalating problems that the planet faces . There are several domains in which the rise of awareness of Veriditas might help stave off Armageddon : Demzification of the natural environment . This is a process that is naturally carried out by the combined action of the atmosphere, the biological matrix and the oceans . This planet-wide process was able to take care of even urban industrial waste, until modern industrial technology became a truly global phenomenon . Planting species of Datura, the plants once a part of the religious rites of the Indians of Southern California, and other plants that leach heavy metals from the earth and sequester them in their cellular tissue, is an example of a natural process that could help clean up our environment . Recognizing the many ways in which the biological matrix of the earth functions to avert toxification, recognizing that nature is working to sustain life, might go a 8 wHOU EM\" REVIEW FALL 19\" The shrub Datura stramonium can act litre a toxin sponge, leaching heavy-metal elements from polluted soils . The toxins are concentrated in its tissue, which can then be removed . long way toward building a political consensus to actively participate in saving that same life . Connectedness and symbiosis . Like plants, we need to maximize these qualities . Plant-based approaches to modeling the world include aware- ness of the fractal and branching nature of com- munity action . A tree-like network of symbiotic relationships can now replace the model of evo- lution that we inherited from the 19th Century . The earlier model, that of the tooth-and-claw struggle for existence, with the survivor taking all, is a model based on naive observation of animal behavior . Yet it was cheerfully extended into the realm of plants to explain the evolution- ary interactions thought to cause speciation in the botanical world . Later, more sophisticated observers (C . H . Waddington and Erich Jantsch) found not the War in Nature that Darwinists reported but rather a situation in which it was not competitive ability but ability to maximize cooperation with other species that most directly contributed to an organism's being able to func- tion and endure as a member of a biome . Plants interact with each other through the tangled mat of roots that connects them all to the source of their nutrition and to each other . The matted floor of a tropical rain forest is an environment of great chemical diversity ; the to- pology approaches that of brain tissue in its com- plexity . Within the network of interconnected roots complex chemical signals are constantly being transmitted and received .

For example, mycorrhizal fungi live in symbiosis on the outside of plant roots and gently balance and buffer the mineral-laden water that is moving through them to the roots of their host . Whole system fine-tuning is needed . If the phe- nomena associated with biological harmony and resonance could be understood, then such large- scale systems as global banking or global food production and distribution could be more prop- erly managed . The Gaian biologists, Lovelock, Margulis and others have argued persuasively that the entire planet has been self-organized by microbial and planktonic life into a meta-stable regime favorable to biology and maintained there for in excess of two billion years . Plant-based Gaia has kept a balance throughout time and space . And this in spice of the repeated bombard- ment of the earth by asteroidal material sufficient to severely disrupt the planetary equilibrium . We can only admire - and we should seek to imi- tate - such a Tao-like sense of the planet's multi- dimensional homeostatic balance . But how? I suggest we look at plants - look more deeply, more closely, and with a more open mind than we have done before . Recycling . Like plants we need to recycle . On a cosmic scale we are no more mobile than plants . Until this point in history we have modeled our more successful economic systems on animal predation . Animals can potentially move on to another resource when they exhaust the one at hand . Since they can move to new food sources, they potentially have unlimited resources . Plants are fixed . They cannot easily move to richer nu- trients, or leave an area if they foul or deplete it . They must recycle well . The fostering of a plant- based ethic that emulates the way in which the botanical world uses and replaces resources is a sine qua non for planetary survival . All capitalistic models presuppose unlimited exploitable resources and labor pools, yet neither should now be as- sumed . I do not know the methods but I suggest that we start turning to the plant world to discover the right questions to ask . Photovoltaic power is part of the shift toward an appreciation of the elegance of the solid state that plants possess . Plants practice photosynthetic solutions to the problems of power acquisition . Compared to the water- or animal-turned wheel, which are the Ur-metaphors for power production in the human world, the solid-state quantum- molecular miracle which involves dropping a photon of sunlight into a molecular device that will kick out an electron capable of energetically participating in the life of a cell seems like ex- travagant science fiction . Yet this is, in fact, the principle upon which photosynthesis operates . While the first solid-state devices arrived on the human cultural frontier in the late 1940s, solid- state engineering had been the preferred design approach of plants for some two thousand million years . High-efficiency photovoltaics could today meet the daily needs of most people for electri- city . It is the running of basic industries on solar energy that has proved difficult . Perhaps this is nature's way of telling us that we aspire to too much manufacturing . A global atmosphere-based energy economy . The ap- proach of vegetational life to energy production is called photosynthesis . This process could be modeled by the creation of a global economy based on using solar energy to obtain hydrogen from seawater . Solar electricity could supply most electricity needs, but the smelting of aluminum and steel and other energy-intensive industrial processes make demands that photovoltaic, elec- tricity is unlikely to be able to meet . However there is a solution : plants split atmospheric car- bon dioxide to release energy and oxygen as by- The factors that ordinarily limit growth in the temperate region - low temperatures, lack of water and a short growing season - are of little importance in the humid tropics . Ex- cept on alluvial land and in camas where the soil is frequently enriched by volcanic dust, howevo, the stock of available mineral nutrients is quite small . The rain forest is able to flourish under these conditions because a large fraction of the available nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and other minerals is held in the vegetation Matter and Energy in the Rainforest inelL The nutrients contained in dead wood and leaves and in the ex cretions and dead bodies of animals are quickly released by the activities of the decomposer organisms . Once the dead material has been broken down the minerals do not \t sin in the soil but are almost immediately taken up by the roots of the ecees and other plants . Thus, although the total stock of nutrients is not large, recycl- ing is rapid .

It is found among the Hukhol, who ingest peyote (Lopho . phon williamsit) and other psycho . tropic plants, among the Mazatec, soons ; local, non-toxic and without release of radioactivity . Like plant life itself, the hydrogen economy would be non-polluting and self-sus- taining ; burned hydrogen recombines with oxy- gen to again become water . An international effort of extraordinary scope would be necessary to begin to move toward a proof-of-concept demonstration of the feasibility of a hydrogen economy .

In the nanotech world, dwellings and machines can be \"grown\" and everything char is manufactured is closer to flesh than to stone .
