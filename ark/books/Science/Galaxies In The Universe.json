But the gas and stars are only the tip of an iceberg: a galaxy consists mostly of dark matter, which we know only by the pull of its gravity. The ages, chemical composition and motions of the stars we see today, and the shapes that they make up, tell us about each galaxy’s past life. This book presents the astrophysics of galaxies since their beginnings in the early Universe. This Second Edition is extensively illustrated with the most recent observational data. It includes new sections on galaxy clusters, gamma ray bursts and supermassive black holes. Chapters on the large-scale structure and early galaxies have been thoroughly revised to take into account recent discoveries such as dark energy. The authors begin with the basic properties of stars and explore the Milky Way before working out towards nearby galaxies and the distant Universe, where galaxies can be seen in their early stages. They then discuss the structures of galaxies and how galaxies have developed, and relate this to the evolution of the Universe. The book also examines ways of observing galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum, and explores dark matter through its gravitational pull on matter and light. This book is self-contained, including the necessary astronomical background, and homework problems with hints. It is ideal for advanced undergraduate students in astronomy and astrophysics.

We hope that graduate students and research workers in related areas will also find it useful as an introduction to the field. Some background knowledge of astronomy would be helpful, but we have tried to summarize the necessary facts and ideas in our introductory chapter, and we give references to books offering a fuller treatment. This book is intended to provide more than enough material for a one-semester course, since instructors will differ in their preferences for areas to emphasize and those to omit. After working through it, readers should find themselves prepared to tackle standard graduate texts such as Binney and Tremaine’s Galactic Dynamics , and review articles such as those in the Annual Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics . Astronomy is not an experimental science like physics; it is a natural science like geology or meteorology. We must take the Universe as we find it, and deduce how the basic properties of matter have constrained the galaxies that happened to form. Sometimes our understanding is general but not detailed. We can estimate how much water the Sun’s heat can evaporate from Earth’s oceans, and indeed this is roughly the amount that falls as rain each day; wind speeds are approximately what is required to dissipate the solar power absorbed by the ground and the air. But we cannot predict from physical principles when the wind will blow or the rain fall. Similarly, we know why stellar masses cannot be far larger or smaller than they are, but we cannot predict the relative numbers of stars that are born with each mass. Other obvious regularities, such as the rather tight relations between a galaxy’s luminosity and the stellar orbital speeds within it, are not yet properly understood. But we trust that they will yield their secrets, just as the color–magnitude relation among hydrogen-burning stars was revealed as a mass sequence. On first acquaintance galaxy astronomy can seem confusingly full of disconnected facts; but we hope to convince you that the correct analogy is meteorology or botany, rather than stamp-collecting. vii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"viii Preface to the second edition We have tried to place material which is relatively more difficult or more intri- cate at the end of each subsection. Students who find some portions heavy going at a first reading are advised to move to the following subsection and return later to the troublesome passage. Some problems have been included. These aim mainly at increasing a reader’s understanding of the calculations and appreciation of the magnitudes of quantities involved, rather than being mathematically demanding. Often, material presented in the text is amplified in the problems; more casual readers may find it useful to look through them along with the rest of the text. Boldface is used for vectors; italics indicate concepts from physics, or spe- cialist terms from astronomy which the reader will see again in this text, or will meet in the astronomical literature. Because they deal with large distances and long timescales, astronomers use an odd mixture of units, depending on the prob- lem at hand; Appendix A gives a list, with conversion factors. Increasing the confusion, many of us are still firmly attached to the centimeter–gram–second system of units. For electromagnetic formulae, we give a parallel-text transla- tion between these and units of the Syst`eme Internationale d’Unit ́es (SI), which are based on meters and kilograms. In other cases, we have assumed that read- ers will be able to convert fairly easily between the two systems with the aid of Appendix A. Astronomers still disagree significantly on the distance scale of the Universe, parametrized by the Hubble constant H 0 . We often indicate explic- itly the resulting uncertainties in luminosity, distance, etc., but we otherwise adopt H 0 = 75 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . Where ages are required or we venture across a substantial fraction of the cosmos, we use the benchmark cosmology with \u0002 \u0003 = 0 . 7 ,\u0002 m = 0 . 3, and H 0 = 70 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . We will use an equals sign ( = ) for mathematical equality, or for measured quantities known to greater accuracy than a few percent; approximate equality ( ≈ ) usually implies a precision of 10%–20%, while ∼ (pronounced ‘twiddles’) means that the relation holds to no better than about a factor of two. Logarithms are to base 10, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Here, and generally in the professional literature, ranges of error are indicated by ± symbols, or shown by horizontal or vertical bars in graphs. Following astronomical convention, these usually refer to 1 σ error estimates calculated by assuming a Gaussian distribution (which is often rather a bad approximation to the true random errors). For those more accustomed to 2 σ or 3 σ error bars, this practice makes discrepancies between the results of different workers appear more significant than is in fact the case.

Each contains anywhere from a million stars up to a million million (10 12 ); gravity binds the stars together, so they do not wander freely through space. This introductory chapter gives the astronomical information that we will need to understand how galaxies are put together. Almost all the light of galaxies comes from their stars. Our opening section attempts to summarize what we know about stars, how we think we know it, and where we might be wrong. We discuss basic observational data, and we describe the life histories of the stars according to the theory of stellar evolution. Even the nearest stars appear faint by terrestrial standards. Measuring their light accurately requires care, and often elaborate equipment and procedures. We devote the final pages of this section to the arcana of stellar photometry: the magnitude system, filter bandpasses, and colors. In Section 1.2 we introduce our own Galaxy, the Milky Way, with its charac- teristic ‘flying saucer’ shape: a flat disk with a central bulge. In addition to their stars, our Galaxy and others contain gas and dust; we review the ways in which these make their presence known. We close this section by presenting some of the coordinate systems that astronomers use to specify the positions of stars within the Milky Way. In Section 1.3 we describe the variety found among other galaxies and discuss how to measure the distribution of light within them. Only the brightest cores of galaxies can outshine the glow of the night sky, but most of their light comes from the faint outer parts; photometry of galaxies is even more difficult than for stars. One of the great discoveries of the twentieth century is that the Universe is not static, but expanding; the galaxies all recede from each other, and from us. Our Universe appears to have had a beginning, the Big Bang, that was not so far in the past: the cosmos is only about three times older than the Earth. Section 1.4 deals with the cosmic expansion, and how it affects the light we receive from galaxies. Finally, Section 1.5 summarizes what happened in the first million years after the Big Bang, and the ways in which its early history has determined what we see today. 1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 Introduction 1.1 The stars 1.1.1 Star light, star bright ... All the information we have about stars more distant than the Sun has been deduced by observing their electromagnetic radiation, mainly in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared parts of the spectrum. The light that a star emits is determined largely by its surface area, and by the temperature and chemical composition – the rel- ative numbers of each type of atom – of its outer layers. Less directly, we learn about the star’s mass, its age, and the composition of its interior, because these factors control the conditions at its surface. As we decode and interpret the mes- sages brought to us by starlight, knowledge gained in laboratories on Earth about the properties of matter and radiation forms the basis for our theory of stellar structure. The luminosity of a star is the amount of energy it emits per second, measured in watts, or ergs per second. Its apparent brightness or flux is the total energy received per second on each square meter (or square centimeter) of the observer’s telescope; the units are W m − 2 ,or ergs − 1 cm − 2 . If a star shines with equal bright- ness in all directions, we can use the inverse-square law to estimate its luminosity L from the distance d and measured flux F : F = L 4 π d 2 . (1.1) Often, we do not know the distance d very well, and must remember in subsequent calculations that our estimated luminosity L is proportional to d 2 . The Sun’s total or bolometric luminosity is L \u0005 = 3 . 86 × 10 26 W, or 3 . 86 × 10 33 erg s − 1 . Stars differ enormously in their luminosity: the brightest are over a million times more luminous than the Sun, while we observe stars as faint as 10 − 4 L \u0005 . Lengths in astronomy are usually measured using the small-angle formula. If, for example, two stars in a binary pair at distance d from us appear separated on the sky by an angle α , the distance D between the stars is given by α (in radians) = D / d . (1.2) Usually we measure the angle α in arcseconds : one arcsecond (1 \u0006\u0006 )is1 / 60 of an arcminute (1 \u0006 ) which is 1 / 60 of a degree. Length is often given in terms of the astronomical unit , Earth’s mean orbital radius (1 AU is about 150 million kilometers) or in parsecs , defined so that, when D = 1 AU and α = 1 \u0006\u0006 , d = 1pc = 3 . 09 × 10 13 km or 3.26 light-years. The orbit of two stars around each other can allow us to determine their masses. If the two stars are clearly separated on the sky, we use Equation 1.2 to measure the distance between them. We find the speed of the stars as they orbit each other from the Doppler shift of lines in their spectra; see Section 1.2. Newton’s equation for"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1.1 The stars 3 the gravitational force, in Section 3.1, then gives us the masses. The Sun’s mass, as determined from the orbit of the Earth and other planets, is M \u0005 = 2 × 10 30 kg, or 2 × 10 33 g. Stellar masses cover a much smaller range than their luminosities. The most massive stars are around 100 M \u0005 . A star is a nuclear-fusion reactor, and a ball of gas more massive than this would burn so violently as to blow itself apart in short order. The least massive stars are about 0.075 M \u0005 . A smaller object would never become hot enough at its center to start the main fusion reaction of a star’s life, turning hydrogen into helium. Problem 1.1 Show that the Sun produces 10 000 times less energy per unit mass than an average human giving out about 1 W kg − 1 . The radii of stars are hard to measure directly. The Sun’s radius R \u0005 = 6 . 96 × 10 5 km, but no other star appears as a disk when seen from Earth with a normal telescope. Even the largest stars subtend an angle of only about 0 . 05 \u0006\u0006 ,1 / 20 of an arcsecond. With difficulty we can measure the radii of nearby stars with an interferometer; in eclipsing binaries we can estimate the radii of the two stars by measuring the size of the orbit and the duration of the eclipses. The largest stars, the red supergiants, have radii about 1000 times larger than the Sun, while the smallest stars that are still actively burning nuclear fuel have radii around 0.1 R \u0005 . A star is a dense ball of hot gas, and its spectrum is approximately that of a blackbody with a temperature ranging from just below 3000 K up to 100 000 K, modified by the absorption and emission of atoms and molecules in the star’s outer layers or atmosphere . A blackbody is an ideal radiator or perfect absorber. At temperature T , the luminosity L of a blackbody of radius R is given by the Stefan–Boltzmann equation: L = 4 π R 2 σ SB T 4 , (1.3) where the constant σ SB = 5 . 67 × 10 − 8 Wm − 2 K − 4 . For a star of luminosity L and radius R , we define an effective temperature T eff as the temperature of a blackbody with the same radius, which emits the same total energy. This temperature is generally close to the average for gas at the star’s ‘surface’, the photosphere . This is the layer from which light can escape into space. The Sun’s effective temperature is T eff ≈ 5780 K. Problem 1.2 Use Equation 1.3 to estimate the solar radius R \u0005 from its luminosity and effective temperature. Show that the gravitational acceleration g at the surface is about 30 times larger than that on Earth."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 Introduction Problem 1.3 The red supergiant star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion has T eff ≈ 3500 K and a diameter of 0 . 045 \u0006\u0006 . Assuming that it is 140 pc from us, show that its radius R ≈ 700 R \u0005 , and that its luminosity L ≈ 10 5 L \u0005 . Generally we do not measure all the light emitted from a star, but only what arrives in a given interval of wavelength or frequency. We define the flux per unit wavelength F λ by setting F λ ( λ ) \bλ to be the energy of the light received between wavelengths λ and λ + \bλ . Because its size is well matched to the typical accuracy of their measurements, optical astronomers generally measure wavelength in units named after the nineteenth-century spectroscopist Anders ̊ Angstr ̈om: 1 ̊ A = 10 − 8 cm or 10 − 10 m. The flux F λ has units of W m − 2 ̊ A − 1 or erg s − 1 cm − 2 ̊ A − 1 . The flux per unit frequency F ν is defined similarly: the energy received between frequencies ν and ν + \bν is F ν ( ν ) \bν , so that F λ = ( ν 2 / c ) F ν . Radio astronomers normally measure F ν in janskys :1Jy = 10 − 26 Wm − 2 Hz − 1 . The apparent brightness F is the integral over all frequencies or wavelengths: F ≡ \u0002 ∞ 0 F ν ( ν )d ν = \u0002 ∞ 0 F λ ( λ )d λ. (1.4) The hotter a blackbody is, the bluer its light: at temperature T , the peak of F λ occurs at wavelength λ max = [ 2 . 9 / T (K) ] mm . (1.5) For the Sun, this corresponds to yellow light, at about 5000 ̊ A; human bodies, the Earth’s atmosphere, and the uncooled parts of a telescope radiate mainly in the infrared, at about 10 μ m. 1.1.2 Stellar spectra Figure 1.1 shows F λ for a number of commonly observed types of star, arranged in order from coolest to hottest. The hottest stars are the bluest, and their spectra show absorption lines of highly ionized atoms; cool stars emit most of their light at red or infrared wavelengths, and have absorption lines of neutral atoms or molecules. Astronomers in the nineteenth century classified the stars according to the strength of the Balmer lines of neutral hydrogen H I , with A stars having the strongest lines, B stars the next strongest, and so on; many of the classes subsequently fell into disuse. In the 1880s, Antonia Maury at Harvard realized that, when the classes were arranged in the order O B A F G K M, the strengths of all the spectral lines, not just those of hydrogen, changed continuously along the sequence. The first large-scale classification was made at Harvard College Observatory between 1911 and 1949: almost 400 000 stars were included in the Henry Draper Catalogue and its supplements. We now know that Maury’s spectral sequence lists the stars in order of decreasing surface temperature. Each of the classes has been subdivided"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1.1 The stars 5 Fig. 1.1. Optical spectra of main-sequence stars with roughly the solar chemical com- position.

Recently classes L and T have been added to the system, for the very cool stars discovered by infrared observers. Astronomers often call stars at the beginning of this sequence ‘early types’, while those toward the end are ‘late types’. The temperatures of O stars exceed 30 000 K. Figure 1.1 shows that the strongest lines are those of He II (once-ionized helium) and C III (twice-ionized carbon); the Balmer lines of hydrogen are relatively weak because hydrogen is almost totally ionized. The spectra of B stars, which are cooler, have stronger hydrogen lines, together with lines of neutral helium, He I . The A stars, with tem- peratures below 11 000 K, are cool enough that the hydrogen in their atmospheres is largely neutral; they have the strongest Balmer lines, and lines of singly ionized metals such as calcium. Note that the flux decreases sharply at wavelengths less than 3800 ̊ A, this is called the Balmer jump . A similar Paschen jump appears at wavelengths that are 3 2 / 2 2 times longer, at around 8550 ̊ A."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 Introduction In F stars, the hydrogen lines are weaker than in A stars, and lines of neutral metals begin to appear. G stars, like the Sun, are cooler than about 6000 K. The most prominent absorption features are the ‘H and K’ lines of singly ionized calcium (Ca II ), and the G band of CH at 4300 ̊ A. These were named in 1815 by Joseph Fraunhofer, who discovered the strong absorption lines in the Sun’s spectrum, and labelled them from A to K in order from red to blue. Lines of neutral metals, such as the pair of D lines of neutral sodium (Na I ) at 5890 ̊ A and 5896 ̊ A, are stronger than in hotter stars. In K stars, we see mainly lines of neutral metals and of molecules such as TiO, titanium oxide. At wavelengths below 4000 ̊ A metal lines absorb much of the light, creating the 4000 ̊ A break . The spectrum of the M star, cooler than about 4000 K, shows deep absorption bands of TiO and of VO, vanadium oxide, as well as lines of neutral metals. This is not because M stars are rich in titanium, but because these molecules absorb red light very efficiently, and the atmosphere is cool enough that they do not break apart. L stars have surface temperatures below about 2500 K, and most of the titanium and vanadium in their atmospheres is condensed onto dust grains. Hence bands of TiO and VO are much weaker than in M stars; lines of neutral metals such as cesium appear, while the sodium D lines become very strong and broad. T stars are those with surfaces cooler than 1400 K; their spectra show strong lines of water and methane, like the atmospheres of giant planets. We can measure masses for these dwarfs by observing them in binary sys- tems, and comparing with evolutionary models. Such work indicates a mass M ≈ 0 . 15 M \u0005 for a main-sequence M5 star, while M ≈ 0 . 08 M \u0005 for a sin- gle measured L0–L1 binary. Counting the numbers of M, L, and T dwarfs in the solar neighborhood shows that objects below 0.3 M \u0005 contribute little to the total mass in the Milky Way’s thin disk. ‘Stars’ cooler than about L5 have too little mass to sustain hydrogen burning in their cores. They are not true stars, but brown dwarfs , cooling as they contract slowly under their own weight. Over its first 100 Myr or so, a given brown dwarf can cool from spectral class M to L, or even T; the temperature drops only slowly during its later life. The spectrum of a galaxy is composite , including the light from a mixture of stars with different temperatures. The hotter stars give out most of the blue light, and the lines observed in the blue part of the spectrum of a galaxy such as the Milky Way are typically those of A, F, or G stars. O and B stars are rare and so do not contribute much of the visible light, unless a galaxy has had a recent burst of star formation. In the red part of the spectrum, we see lines from the cooler K stars, which produce most of the galaxy’s red light. Thus the blue part of the spectrum of a galaxy such as the Milky Way shows the Balmer lines of hydrogen in absorption, while TiO bands are present in the red region. It is much easier to measure the strength of spectral lines relative to the flux at nearby wavelengths than to determine F λ ( λ ) over a large range in wave- length.

In prac- tice, stellar temperatures are often estimated by comparing the observed depths of absorption lines in their spectra with the predictions of a model stellar atmosphere . This is a computer calculation of the way light propagates through a stellar atmo- sphere with a given temperature and composition; it is calibrated against stars for which F λ has been measured carefully. The lines in stellar spectra also give us information about the surface gravity. Figure 1.2 shows the spectra of three stars, all classified as A stars because the overall strength of their absorption lines is similar. But the Balmer lines of the A dwarf are broader than those in the giant and supergiant stars, because atoms in its photosphere are more closely crowded together: this is known as the Stark effect . If we use a model atmosphere to calculate the surface gravity of the star, and we also know its mass, we can then find its radius. For most stars, the surface gravity is within a factor of three of that in the Sun; these stars form the main sequence and are known as dwarfs , even though the hottest of them are very large and luminous. All main-sequence stars are burning hydrogen into helium in their cores. For any particular spectral type, these stars have nearly the same mass and luminosity, because they have nearly identical structures: the hottest stars are the most massive, the most luminous, and the largest.

Giant and supergiant stars have a lower surface gravity and are much more distended; the largest stars have radii exceeding 1000 R \u0005 . Equation 1.3 tells us that they are much brighter than main-sequence stars of the same spectral type. Below, we will see that they represent later stages of a star’s life. White dwarfs are not main-sequence stars, but have much higher surface gravity and smaller radii; a white dwarf is only about the size of the Earth, with R ≈ 0 . 01 R \u0005 . If we define a star by its property of generating energy by nuclear fusion, then a white dwarf is no longer a star at all, but only the ashes or embers of a star’s core; it has exhausted its nuclear fuel and is now slowly cooling into blackness. A neutron star is an even smaller stellar remnant, only about 20 km across, despite having a mass larger than the Sun’s. Further reading: for an undergraduate-level introduction to stars, see D. A.

Prialnik, 2000, An Introduction to the Theory of Stellar Structure and Evolution (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK). The strength of a given spectral line depends on the temperature of the star in the layers where the line is formed, and also on the abundance of the various elements. By comparing the strengths of various lines with those calculated for a hot gas, Cecelia Payne-Gaposhkin showed in 1925 that the Sun and other stars are composed mainly of hydrogen. The surface layers of the Sun are about 72% hydrogen, 26% helium, and about 2% of all other elements, by mass. Astronomers refer collectively to the elements heavier than helium as heavy elements or metals , even though substances such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen would not normally be called metals. There is a good reason to distinguish hydrogen and helium from the rest of the elements. These atoms were created in the aftermath of the Big Bang, less than half an hour after the Universe as we now know it came into existence; the neutrons and protons combined into a mix of about three-quarters hydrogen, one-quarter helium, and a trace of lithium. Since then, the stars have burned hydrogen to form helium, and then fused helium into heavier elements; see the next subsection. Figure 1.3 shows the abundances of the commonest elements in the Sun’s photosphere. Even oxygen, the most plentiful of the heavy elements, is over 1000 times rarer than hydrogen.

The fraction by mass of the heavy elements is denoted Z : the Sun has Z \u0005 ≈ 0 . 02, while the most metal-poor stars in our Galaxy have less than 1 / 10 000 of this amount. If we want to specify the fraction of a particular element, such as oxygen, in a star, we often give its abundance relative to that in the Sun. We use a logarithmic scale: [ A / B ] ≡ log 10 \u0005 ( number of A atoms / number of B atoms ) ( number of A atoms / number of B atoms ) \u0005 \u0006 , (1.7) where refers to the star and we again use \u0005 for the Sun. Thus, in a star with [Fe / H] =− 2, iron is 1% as abundant as in the Sun. A warning: [Fe / H] is often used for a star’s average heavy-element abundance relative to the Sun; it does not always refer to measured iron content. 1.1.3 The lives of the stars Understanding how stars proceed through the different stages of their lives is one of the triumphs of astrophysics in the second half of the twentieth century. The discovery of nuclear-fusion processes during the 1940s and 1950s, coupled with the fast digital computers that became available during the 1960s and 1970s,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 Introduction has given us a detailed picture of the evolution of a star from a protostellar gas cloud through to extinction as a white dwarf, or a fiery death in a supernova explosion. We are confident that we understand most aspects of main-sequence stars fairly well. A long-standing discrepancy between predicted nuclear reactions in the Sun’s core and the number of neutrinos detected on Earth was recently resolved in favor of the stellar modellers: neutrinos are produced in the expected numbers, but many had changed their type along the way to Earth. Our theories falter at the beginning of the process – we do not know how to predict when a gas cloud will form into stars, or what masses these will have – and toward its end, especially for massive stars with M ∼ > 8 M \u0005 , and for stars closely bound in binary systems. This remaining ignorance means that we do not yet know what determines the rate at which galaxies form their stars; the quantity of elements heavier than helium that is produced by each type of star; and how those elements are returned to the interstellar gas, to be incorporated into future generations of stars. The mass of a star almost entirely determines its structure and ultimate fate; chemical composition plays a smaller role. Stars begin their existence as clouds of gas that become dense enough to start contracting under the inward pull of their own gravity. Compression heats the gas, making its pressure rise to support the weight of the exterior layers. But the warm gas then radiates away energy, reducing the pressure, and allowing the cloud to shrink further. In this protostellar stage, the release of gravitational energy counterbalances that lost by radiation. As a protostar, the Sun would have been cooler than it now is, but several times more luminous. This phase is short: it lasted only 50 Myr for the Sun, which will burn for 10 Gyr on the main sequence. So protostars do not make a large contribution to a galaxy’s light. The temperature at the center rises throughout the protostellar stage; when it reaches about 10 7 K, the star is hot enough to ‘burn’ hydrogen into helium by thermonuclear fusion. When four atoms of hydrogen fuse into a single atom of helium, 0.7% of their mass is set free as energy, according to Einstein’s formula E = M c 2 . Nuclear reactions in the star’s core now supply enough energy to maintain the pressure at the center, and contraction stops. The star is now quite stable: it has begun its main-sequence life. Table 1.1 gives the luminosity and effective temperature for stars of differing mass on the zero-age main sequence ; these are calculated from models for the internal structure, assuming the same chemical composition as the Sun. Each solid track on Figure 1.4 shows how those quantities change over the star’s lifetime. A plot like this is often called a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, after Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell, who realized around 1910 that, if the luminosity of stars is plotted against their spectral class (or color or temperature), most of the stars fall close to a diagonal line which is the main sequence. The temperature increases to the left on the horizontal axis to correspond to the ordering OBAFGKMofthespectral classes.

Nuclear reactions go faster at the higher temperature, and the star becomes brighter. The Sun is now about 4.5 Gyr old, and its luminosity is almost 50% higher than when it first reached the main sequence. Problem 1.4 What mass of hydrogen must the Sun convert to helium each second in order to supply the luminosity that we observe? If it converted all of its initial hydrogen into helium, how long could it continue to burn at this rate? Since it can burn only the hydrogen in its core, and because it is gradually brightening, it will remain on the main sequence for only about 1 / 10 as long. Problem 1.5 Use Equation 1.3 and data from Table 1.1 to show that, when the Sun arrived on the main sequence, its radius was about 0 . 87 R \u0005 . A star can continue on the main sequence until thermonuclear burning has consumed the hydrogen in its core, about 10% of the total. Table 1.1 lists the time τ MS that stars of each mass spend there; it is most of the star’s life. So, at any given time, most of a galaxy’s stars will be on the main sequence. For an average value α ≈ 3 . 5 in Equation 1.6, we have τ MS = τ MS , \u0005 M / L M \u0005 / L \u0005 ∼ 10 Gyr \u0003 M M \u0005 \u0004 − 2 . 5 = 10 Gyr \u0003 L L \u0005 \u0004 − 5 / 7 .

The metal- poor star makes a ‘blue loop’ while burning helium in its core; it is always brighter and bluer than a star of the same mass with solar metallicity – Geneva Observatory tracks. in the past. Most of the stellar mass of galaxies is locked into these dim long-lived stars. Decreasing the fraction of heavy elements in a star makes it brighter and bluer; see Figure 1.5. The ‘metals’ are a source of opacity , blocking the escape of photons which carry energy outward from the core through the interior and the atmosphere. If the metal abundance is low, light moves to the surface more easily; as a result, a metal-poor star is more compact, meaning that it is denser. So its core must be hotter, and produce more energy. Consequently, the star uses up its nuclear fuel faster. In regions of a star where photons carry its energy out toward the surface, collisions between atoms cannot mix the ‘ash’ of nuclear burning with fresh material further out. The star, which began as a homogeneous ball of gas, develops strata of differing chemical composition. Convection currents can stir up the star’s interior, mixing the layers. Our figures and table are computed for stars that do not spin rapidly on their axes. Fast rotation encourages mixing, and the fresh hydrogen brought into the star’s core extends its life on the main sequence. At the end of its main-sequence life, the star leaves the hatched area in Figure 1.4. Its life beyond that point is complex and depends very much on the star’s mass. All stars below about 0.6 M \u0005 stay on the main sequence for so long that none has yet left it in the history of the Universe. In low-mass stars with 0 . 6 M \u0005 ∼ < M ∼ < 2 M \u0005 , the hydrogen-exhausted core gives out energy by shrink- ing; it becomes denser, while the star’s outer layers puff up to a hundred times their"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14 Introduction former size. The star now radiates its energy over a larger area, so Equation 1.3 tells us that its surface temperature must fall; it becomes cool and red. This is the subgiant phase. When the temperature just outside the core rises high enough, hydrogen starts to burn in a surrounding shell: the star becomes a red giant . Helium ‘ash’ is deposited onto the core, making it contract further and raising its temperature. The shell then burns hotter, so more energy is produced, and the star becomes gradually brighter. During this phase, the tracks of stars with M ∼ < 2 M \u0005 lie close together at the right of Figure 1.4, forming the red giant branch. Stars with M ∼ < 1 . 5 M \u0005 give out most of their energy as red giants and in later stages; see Table 1.1. By contrast with main-sequence stars, the luminosity and color of a red giant depend very little on its mass; so the giant branches in stellar systems of different ages can be very similar. Just as on the main sequence, stars with low metallicity are somewhat bluer and brighter. As it contracts, the core of a red giant becomes dense enough that the electrons of different atoms interact strongly with each other. The core becomes degenerate ; it starts to behave like a solid or a liquid, rather than a gas. When the temperature at its core has increased to about 10 8 K, helium ignites, burning to carbon; this releases energy that heats the core. In a gas, expansion would dampen the rate of nuclear reactions to produce a steady flow of energy. But the degenerate core cannot expand; instead, like a liquid or solid, its density hardly changes, so burning is explosive, as in an uncontrolled nuclear reactor on Earth. This is the helium flash , which occurs at the very tip of the red giant branch in Figure 1.4. In about 100 s, the core of the star heats up enough to turn back into a normal gas, which then expands. On the red giant branch, the star’s luminosity is set by the mass of its helium core. When the helium flash occurs, the core mass is almost the same for all stars below ∼ 2 M \u0005 ; so these stars should reach the same luminosity at the tip of the red giant branch. In any stellar population more than 2–3 Gyr old, stars above 2 M \u0005 have already completed their lives; if the metal abundance is below ∼ 0 . 5 Z \u0005 , the red giants have almost the same color. So the apparent brightness at the tip of the red giant branch can be used to find the distance of a nearby galaxy. Helium is now steadily burning in the core, and hydrogen in a surrounding shell. In Figure 1.4, we see that stars of M \u0005 to 2 M \u0005 stay cool and red during this phase; they are red clump stars. In Figure 2.2, showing the luminosity and color of stars close to the Sun, we see a concentration of stars in the red clump. Blue horizontal branch stars are in the same stage of burning. In these, little material remains in the star’s outer envelope, so the outer gas is relatively transparent to radiation escaping from the hot core. Stars that are less massive or poorer in heavy elements than the red clump will become horizontal branch stars. Helium burning provides less energy than hydrogen burning. We see from Table 1.1 that this phase lasts no more than 30% as long as the star’s main- sequence life. Once the core has used up its helium, it must again contract, and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"1.1 The stars 15 the outer envelope again swells. The star moves onto the asymptotic giant branch (AGB); it now burns both helium and hydrogen in shells, and it is more luminous and cooler than it was as a red giant. This is as far as we can follow its evolution in Figure 1.4. On the AGB, both of the shells undergo pulses of very rapid burning, during which the loosely held gas of the outer layers is lost as a stellar superwind . Eventually the hot naked core is exposed, as a white dwarf : its ultraviolet radiation ionizes the ejected gas, which is briefly seen as a planetary nebula. White dwarfs near the Sun have masses around 0.6 M \u0005 , meaning that at least half of the star’s original material has been lost. The white dwarf core can do no further burning, and it gradually cools. Stars of intermediate mass , from 2 M \u0005 up to 6 M \u0005 or 8 M \u0005 , follow much the same history, up to the point when helium ignites in the core. Because their central density is lower at a given temperature, the helium core does not become degenerate before it begins to burn. These stars also become red, but Figure 1.4 shows that they are brighter than red giants; their tracks lie above the place where those of the lower-mass stars come together. Once helium burning is under way, the stars become bluer; some of them become Cepheid variables , F- and G-type supergiant stars which pulsate with periods between one and fifty days. Cepheids are very useful to astronomers, because the pulsation cycle betrays the star’s luminosity: the most massive stars, which are also the most luminous, have the longest periods. So once we have measured the period and apparent brightness, we can use Equation 1.1 to find the star’s distance. Cepheids are bright enough to be seen far beyond the Milky Way. In the 1920s, astronomers used them to show that other galaxies existed outside our own. Once the core has used up its helium, these stars become red again; they are asymptotic giant branch stars, with both hydrogen and helium burning in shells. Rapid pulses of burning dredge gas up from the deep interior, bringing to the surface newly formed atoms of elements such as carbon, and heavier atoms which have been further ‘cooked’ in the star by the s-process : the slow capture of neutrons. For example, the atmospheres of some AGB stars show traces of the short-lived radioactive element technetium. The stellar superwind pushes polluted surface gas out into the interstellar environment; these AGB stars are a major source of the elements carbon and nitrogen in the Galaxy. An intermediate-mass star makes a spectacular planetary nebula, as its outer layers are shed and subsequently ionized by the hot central core. The core then cools to become a white dwarf. Stars at the lower end of this mass range leave a core which is mainly carbon and oxygen; remnants of slightly more massive stars are a mix of oxygen, neon, and magnesium. We know that white dwarfs cannot have masses above 1.4 M \u0005 ; so these stars put most of their material back into the interstellar gas. In massive stars , with M ∼ > 8 M \u0005 , the carbon, oxygen, and other elements left as the ashes of helium burning will ignite in their turn. The star Betelgeuse"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 Introduction is now a red supergiant burning helium in its core. It probably began its main- sequence life 10–20 Myr ago, with a mass between 12 M \u0005 and 17 M \u0005 . It will start to burn heavier elements, and finally explode as a supernova, within another 2 Myr. After their time on the main sequence, massive stars like Betelgeuse spend most of their time as blue or yellow supergiants; Deneb, the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus, is a yellow supergiant. Helium starts to burn in the core ofa25 M \u0005 star while it is a blue supergiant, only slightly cooler than it was on the main sequence. Once the core’s helium is exhausted, this star becomes a red supergiant; but mass loss can then turn it once again into a blue supergiant before the final conflagration. The later lives of stars with M ∼ > 40 M \u0005 are still uncertain, because they depend on how much mass has been lost through strong stellar winds , and on ill-understood details of the earlier convective mixing. A star of about 50 M \u0005 may lose mass so rapidly that it never becomes a red supergiant, but is stripped to its nuclear-burning core and is seen as a blue Wolf–Rayet star. These are very hot stars, with characteristic strong emission lines of helium, carbon, and nitrogen coming from a fast stellar wind; the wind is very poor in hydrogen, since the star’s outer layers were blown off long before. Wolf–Rayet stars live less than 10 Myr, so they are seen only in regions where stars have recently formed. Once helium burning has finished in the core, a massive star’s life is very nearly over. The carbon core quietly burns to neon, magnesium, and heavier elements. But this process is rapid, giving out little energy; most of that energy is carried off by neutrinos , weakly interacting particles which easily escape through the star’s outer layers. A star that started on its main-sequence life with 10 M \u0005 ∼ < M ∼ < 40 M \u0005 will burn its core all the way to iron. Such a core has no further source of energy. Iron is the most tightly bound of all nuclei, and it would require energy to combine its nuclei into yet heavier elements. The core collapses, and its neutrons are squeezed so tightly that they become degenerate. The outer layers of the star, falling in at a tenth of the speed of light, bounce off this suddenly rigid core, and are ejected in a blazing Type II supernova . Supernova 1987A which exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud was of this type, which is distinguished by strong lines of hydrogen in its spectrum. The core of the star, incorporating the heavier elements such as iron, is either left as a neutron star or implodes as a black hole . The gas that escapes is rich in oxygen, magnesium, and other elements of intermediate atomic mass. A star with an initial mass between 8 M \u0005 and 10 M \u0005 also ends its life as a Type II supernova, but by a slightly different process; the core probably collapses before it has burned to iron. After the explosion, a neutron star may remain, or the star may blow itself apart completely, like the Type Ia supernovae described below. A Wolf–Rayet star also becomes a supernova. Because its hydrogen has been lost, hydrogen lines are missing from the spectrum, and it is classified as Type Ic. These supernovae may be responsible for the energetic γ -ray bursts that"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"1.1 The stars 17 we discuss in Section 9.2. We shall see in Section 2.1 that massive stars are only a tiny fraction of the total; but they are a galaxy’s main producers of oxygen and heavier elements. Detailed study of their later lives can tell us how much of each element is returned to the interstellar gas by stellar winds or supernova explosions, and how much will be locked within a remnant neutron star or black hole. In Section 4.3 we will discuss what the abundances of the various elements may tell us about the history of our Galaxy and others. Further reading: see the books by Ostlie and Carroll, and by Prialnik. For stellar life beyond the main sequence, see the graduate-level treatment of D. Arnett, 1996, Supernovae and Nucleosynthesis (Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey). 1.1.4 Binary stars Most stars are not found in isolation; they are in binary or multiple star systems . Binary stars can easily appear to be single objects unless careful measurements are made, and astronomers often say that ‘three out of every two stars are in a binary’. Most binaries are widely separated, and the two stars evolve much like single stars. These systems cause us difficulty only because usually we cannot see the two stars as separate objects, even in nearby galaxies. When we observe them, we get a blend of two stars while thinking that we have only one. In a close binary system, one star may remove matter from the other. It is especially easy to ‘steal’ gas from a red giant or an AGB star, since the star’s gravity does not hold on strongly to the puffed-up outer layers. Then we can have some dramatic effects. For example, if one of the two stars becomes a white dwarf, hydrogen-rich gas from the companion can pour onto its surface, building up until it becomes dense enough to burn explosively to helium, in a sudden flash which we see as a classical nova . If the more compact star has become a neutron star or a black hole, gas falls onto its surface with such force that it is heated to X-ray-emitting temperatures. A white dwarf in a binary can also explode as a Type Ia supernova . Such supernovae lack hydrogen lines in their spectra; they result from the explosive burning of carbon and oxygen. If the white dwarf takes enough matter from its binary companion, it can be pushed above the Chandrasekhar limit at about 1.4 M \u0005 . No white dwarf can be heavier than this; if it gains more mass, it is forced to collapse, like the iron core in the most massive stars. But unlike that core, the white dwarf still has nuclear fuel: its carbon and oxygen burn to heavier elements, releasing energy which blows it apart. There is no remnant: the iron and other elements are scattered to interstellar space. Much of the iron we now find in the Earth and in the Sun has been produced in these supernovae. Even though close binary stars are relatively rare, they make a significant difference to the life of their host galaxy."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"18 Introduction A Type Ia supernova can be as bright as a whole galaxy, with a luminosity of 2 × 10 9 L \u0005 ∼ < L ∼ < 2 × 10 10 L \u0005 . The more luminous the supernova, the longer its light takes to fade. So, if we monitor its apparent brightness over the weeks following the explosion, we can estimate its intrinsic luminosity, and use Equa- tion 1.1 to find the distance. Recently, Type Ia supernovae have been observed in galaxies more than 10 10 light-years away; they are used to probe the structure of the distant Universe. 1.1.5 Stellar photometry : the magnitude system Optical astronomers, and those working in the nearby ultraviolet and infrared regions, often express the apparent brightness of a star as an apparent magnitude . Originally, this was a measure of how much dimmer a star appeared to the eye in comparison with the bright A0 star α Lyrae (Vega). The brightest stars in the sky were of first magnitude, the next brightest were second magnitude, and so on: brighter stars have numerically smaller magnitudes. The apparent magnitudes m 1 and m 2 of two stars with measured fluxes F 1 and F 2 are related by m 1 − m 2 =− 2 . 5 log 10 ( F 1 / F 2 ) . (1.10) So if m 2 = m 1 + 1, star 1 appears about 2.5 times brighter than star 2. The magnitude scale is close to that of natural logarithms: a change of 0.1 magnitudes corresponds to about a 10% difference in brightness. Problem 1.6 Show that, if two stars of the same luminosity form a close binary pair, the apparent magnitude of the pair measured together is about 0.75 magni- tudes brighter than either star individually. We have referred glibly to ‘measuring a star’s spectrum’. But in fact, this is almost impossible. At far-ultraviolet wavelengths below 912 ̊ A, even small amounts of hydrogen gas between us and the star absorb much of its light. The Earth’s atmosphere blocks out light at wavelengths below 3000 ̊ A, or longer than a few microns. In addition to the light pollution caused by humans, the night sky itself emits light. Figure 1.6 shows that the sky is relatively dim between 4000 ̊ A and 5500 ̊ A; at longer wavelengths, emission from atoms and molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere is increasingly intrusive. Taking high-resolution spectra of faint stars is also costly in telescope time. For all these reasons, we often settle instead for measuring the amount of light that we receive over various broad ranges of wavelength. Thus, our magnitudes and apparent brightness most often refer to a specific region of the spectrum. We define standard filter bandpasses , each specified by the fraction of light 0 ≤ T ( λ ) ≤ 1 that it transmits at wavelength λ .

The lower panel in Figure 1.7 shows one set of standard bandpasses for the optical and near-infrared part of the spectrum. The R and I bands are on the ‘Cousins’ system: the ‘Johnson’ system includes bands with the same names but at different wavelengths, so beware of confusion! In the visible region, these bands were originally defined by the transmission of specified glass filters and the sensitivity of photographic plates or photomultiplier tubes. The upper curve in Figure 1.7 gives the transmission of the Earth’s atmosphere. Astronomers refer to the wavelengths where it is fairly transparent, roughly from 3400 ̊ A to 8000 ̊ A, as visible light. At the red end of this range, we encounter absorption bands of water and of atmospheric molecules such as oxygen, O 2 . Between about 9000 ̊ A and 20 μ m, windows of transparency alternate with regions where light is almost completely blocked. For λ ∼ > 20 μ m up to a few millime- ters, the atmosphere is not only opaque; Figure 1.15 shows that it emits quite brightly. The standard infrared bandpasses have been placed in relatively trans- parent regions. The K \u0006 bandpass is very similar to K , but it has become popular because it blocks out light at the longer-wavelength end of the K band, where atmospheric molecules and warm parts of the telescope emit strongly.

The lower panel of Figure 1.7 also shows the spectrum from a model A0 star. The Balmer jump occurs just at the blue edge of the B band, so the difference between the U and the B magnitudes indicates its strength; we can use it to measure the star’s temperature. Because atmospheric transmission changes greatly between the short- and the long-wavelength ends of the U bandpass, the correction for it depends on how the star’s flux F λ ( λ ) varies across the bandpass. So U -band fluxes are tricky to measure, and alternative narrower filters are often used instead. The R band includes the Balmer H α line. Where many hot stars are present they ionize the gas around them, and H α emission can contribute much to the luminosity in the R band.

These ‘in-band’ magnitudes are generally labelled by subscripts: m B is an apparent magnitude in the B bandpass of Figure 1.7, and m R is the apparent magnitude in R . Originally, the star Vega was defined to have apparent magnitude zero in all optical bandpasses. Now, a set of A0 stars is used to define the zero point, and Vega has apparent magnitude 0.03 in the V band. Sirius, which appears as the brightest star in the sky, has m V ≈− 1 . 45; the faintest stars measured are near m V = 28, so they are roughly 10 12 times dimmer. Table 1.2 gives the effective wavelength – the mean wavelength of the transmitted light – for a standard A0 star viewed through those filters, and the fluxes F λ and F ν which correspond to apparent magnitude m = 0 in each filter. At ultraviolet wavelengths, there is no well-measured set of standard stars to define the magnitude system, so ‘flux-based’ magnitudes were developed instead.

Magnitudes on this scale do not coincide with those of the traditional system, except in the V band, and we no longer have m BP = 0 for a standard A0 star. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey used a specially-built 2.5 m telescope to measure the brightness of 100 million stars and galaxies over a quarter of the sky, taking spectra for a million of them. The survey used ‘flux-based’ magnitudes in the filters of Table 1.3. Non-astronomers often ask why the rather awkward magnitude system sur- vives in use: why not simply give the apparent brightness in W m − 2 ? The answer is that, in astronomy, our relative measurements are often much more accurate than absolute ones. The relative brightness of two stars that are observed through the same telescope, with the same detector equipment, can be established to within 1%. The total (bolometric) luminosity of the Sun is well determined, but the appar- ent brightness of other stars can be compared with a laboratory standard no more accurately than within about 3%. One major problem is absorption in the Earth’s atmosphere, through which starlight must travel to reach our telescopes. The fluxes in Table 1.2 were derived by using a model stellar atmosphere, which proves to be more precise than trying to correct for terrestrial absorption. At wavelengths longer than a few microns we do use physical units, because the response of the telescope is less stable. The power of a radio source is often known only to within 10%, so a comparison with terrestrial sources is as accurate as intercomparing two objects in the sky. The color of a star is defined as the difference between the amounts of light received in each of two bandpasses. If one star is bluer than another, it will give out relatively more of its light at shorter wavelengths: this means that the difference m B − m R will be smaller for a blue star than for a red one. Astronomers refer to this quantity as the ‘ B − R color’ of the star, and often denote it just by B − R . Other colors, such as V − K , are defined in the same way. We always subtract the apparent magnitude in the longer-wavelength bandpass from that in the shorter- wavelength bandpass, so that a low or negative number corresponds to a blue star and a high one to a red star. Table 1.4 gives colors for main-sequence stars of each spectral type in most of the bandpasses of Figure 1.7. Astronomers often try to estimate a star’s spectral type or temperature by comparing its color in suitably chosen bandpasses with that of stars of known type. We can see that the blue color B − V is a good indicator of spectral type for A, F, and G stars.

The colors of giant and supergiant stars are slightly different from those of dwarfs; see Tables 1.5 and 1.6. Optical and near-infrared colors are often more closely related to each other and to the star’s effective temperature than to its spectral type. For example, stars very similar to the Sun, with the same colors and effective temperatures, can have spectral classification G1 or G3. The colors listed in Tables 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 have been compiled from a variety of sources, and they are no more accurate than a few hundredths of a magnitude. But because the colors of different stars are measured in the same way, the difference in color between two stars can be found more accurately than either color individually. We define the absolute magnitude M of a source as the apparent magnitude it would have at a standard distance of 10 pc. A star’s absolute magnitude gives the same information as its luminosity. If there is no dust or other obscuring matter between us and the star, it is related by Equation 1.1 to the measured apparent magnitude m and distance d : M = m − 5 log 10 ( d / 10 pc) .

As for apparent magnitudes, the bandpass in which the absolute magnitude of a star has been measured is indicated by a subscript. The Sun has absolute magnitudes M B = 5 . 48 , M V = 4 . 83 , M K = 3 . 31; because it is redder than an A0 star, the absolute magnitude is numerically smaller in the longer-wavelength bandpasses. Supergiant stars have M V ∼− 6; they are over 10 000 times more luminous than the Sun in this band. The absolute V -magnitudes listed in the tables are averages for each spectral subclass. For main-sequence stars near the Sun, the dispersion in M V measured in magnitudes for each subclass ranges from about 0.4 for A and early F stars to 0.5 for late F and early G stars, decreasing to about 0.3 for late K and early M stars. This small variation arises because stars change their colors and lumi- nosities as they age, and also differ in their metal content. But supergiants with the same spectral classification can differ in luminosity by as much as 2 or 3 magnitudes.

Because we cannot measure all the light of a star, we use models of stellar atmospheres to find how much energy is emitted in the regions that we do not observe directly. Then, we can define a bolometric magnitude M bol . The zero point of the scale is set by fixing the Sun’s absolute bolometric magnitude as M bol , \u0005 = 4 . 75. The second column in each of Tables 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 gives the bolometric correction , the amount that must be subtracted from M V to obtain the bolometric magnitude: M bol = M V − BC . (1.16) For the Sun, BC ≈ 0 . 07. Bolometric corrections are small for stars that emit most of their light in the blue–green part of the spectrum. They are large for hot stars, which give out most of their light at bluer wavelengths, and for the cool red stars. A warning: some astronomers prefer to define the bolometric correction with a + sign in Equation 1.16. Finally, stellar and galaxy luminosities are often expressed as multiples of the Sun’s luminosity. From near-ultraviolet wavelengths to the near-infrared range at a few microns, we say that a star has L = 10 L \u0005 in a given bandpass if its luminosity in that bandpass is ten times that of the Sun in the same bandpass. But at frequencies at which the Sun does not emit much radiation, such as the X-ray and the radio, a source is generally said to have L = 10 L \u0005 in a given spectral region if its luminosity there is ten times the Sun’s bolometric luminosity. Occasionally, this latter definition is used for all wavebands. Problem 1.7 A star cluster contains 200 F5 stars at the main-sequence turnoff, and 20 K0III giant stars. Use Tables 1.2 and 1.4 to show that its absolute V - magnitude M V ≈− 3 . 25 and its color B − V ≈ 0 . 68. (These values are similar to those of the 4 Gyr-old cluster M67: see Table 2.2.)

A schematic side view of the Milky Way. 1.2 Our Milky Way We are resident in the Milky Way, which is also called the Galaxy (with a capital G). Here, we have a close-up view of the stellar and gaseous content of a typical large spiral galaxy. This section gives a brief sketch of our Galaxy, and how we observe the gas and dust that lie between the stars. We also define some of the coordinate systems by which astronomers locate objects on the sky and within the Milky Way. An external observer might see the Milky Way looking something like what is drawn in Figure 1.8. The Sun lies some way from the center, in the stellar disk that is the Milky Way’s most prominent feature. As its name implies, the disk is thin and roughly circular; when we look out on a dark night, the disk stars appear as a luminous band stretching across the heavens. Dark patches in this band mark concentrations of dust and dense gas. In the southern sky, the bright central regions are seen as a bulge extending above and below the disk. At the center of the bulge is a dense nucleus of stars; this harbors a radio source, and a black hole with mass M BH ≈ 4 × 10 6 M \u0005 ."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"1.2 Our Milky Way 27 We generally measure distances within the Galaxy in kiloparsecs : 1 kpc is 1000 pc, or about 3 × 10 16 km. The Milky Way’s central bulge is a few kiloparsecs in radius, while the stellar disk stretches out to at least 15 kpc, with the Sun about 8 kpc from the center. The density n of stars in the disk drops by about a factor of e as we move out in radius R by one scale length h R , so that n ( R ) ∝ e − R / h R . Estimates for h R lie in the range 2 . 5 − 4 . 5 kpc. The thin disk contains 95% of the disk stars, and all of the young massive stars. Its scale height , the distance we must move in the direction perpendicular to the disk to see the density fall by a factor of e , is 300–400 pc. The rest of the stars form the thick disk , which has a larger scale height of about 1 kpc. We will see in Chapter 2 that stars of the thick disk were made earlier in the Galaxy’s history than those of the thin disk, and they are poorer in heavy elements. The gas and dust of the disk lie in a very thin layer; near the Sun’s position, most of the neutral hydrogen gas is within 100 pc of the midplane. The thickness of the gas layer increases roughly in proportion to the distance from the Galactic center. Both the Milky Way’s disk and its bulge are rotating. Stars in the disk orbit the Galactic center at about 200 km s − 1 , so the Sun takes roughly 250 Myr to complete its orbit. Disk stars follow nearly circular orbits, with small additional random motions amounting to a few tens of kilometers per second. Bulge stars have larger random velocities. We will see in Chapter 3 that this means they must orbit the center with a lower average speed, closer to 100 km s − 1 . Stars and globular clusters of the metal-poor halo do not have any organized rotation around the center of the galaxy. Like comets in the solar system, their orbits follow random directions, and are often eccentric : the stars spend most of their time in the outer reaches of the Galaxy but plunge deeply inward at pericenter. In all, the luminosity of the disk is about (15–20) × 10 9 L \u0005 , and the mass in stars is around 60 × 10 9 M \u0005 . For the bulge L ≈ 5 × 10 9 L \u0005 , while the mass of stars is about 20 × 10 9 M \u0005 . The halo stars form only a small fraction of the Galaxy’s mass, accounting for no more than about 10 9 M \u0005 . When we measure the orbital speeds of gas, stars, and star clusters at large distances from the center of the Milky Way, and use Equation 3.20 to find the mass required to keep them in those orbits, we find that the total mass of the Galaxy must be more than just that present in the stars and gas. In particular, most of the Galaxy’s mass appears to lie more than 10 kpc from the center, where there are relatively few stars. We call this the dark matter and usually assume, without a compelling reason, that it lies in a roughly spherical dark halo . The nature of the unseen material making up the dark halo of our Galaxy and others is one of the main fields of research in astronomy today. 1.2.1 Gas in the Milky Way In the neighborhood of the Sun, we find about one star in every 10 pc 3 .

This dilute material makes itself apparent both by absorbing radiation from starlight that travels through it and by its own emission. We receive radiation from gas within the Milky Way that is ionized (the atoms have lost one or more of their electrons), from neutral atoms, and from molecules. The radiation can be in the form of emission lines, or as continuum emission, a continuous spectrum without lines. Atoms and ions radiate when one of their electrons makes a quantum jump to a lower energy level; the line photon carries off energy equal to the differ- ence between the states. If m -times-ionized element X (written X + m ) captures an electron it becomes X + ( m − 1) , which typically forms in an excited state. As this newly recombined ion relaxes to its ground state, a whole cascade of recombina- tion radiation is emitted. Transitions between barely bound high levels produce radio-frequency photons, whereas electrons falling to lower levels give visible light: the Balmer lines of hydrogen correspond to transitions down to level n = 2. We observe these transitions in H II regions around hot stars, where hydrogen is almost completely ionized. Transitions to the lowest energy levels give rise to more energetic photons. When H + captures an electron to become neutral, and its electron drops from n = 2 into the ground state n = 1, it gives out an ultraviolet photon of the Lyman- α line at 1216 ̊ A (10 . 2 eV). In heavier atoms, the lowest- level electrons are more tightly bound, and transitions to these states correspond to X-ray photons. From very hot gas we often see the 6.7 keV K line of Fe + 24 , 24-times-ionized iron. Gas can be photoionized : energetic photons liberate electrons from their atoms. O and B stars produce ultraviolet photons with wavelength below 912 ̊ A, or energy above 13.6 eV, which are required to ionize hydrogen from its ground state. These stars develop H II regions, but cooler stars do not. Atoms can also be excited up to higher levels by collisions with electrons. Collisional ionization is important when the gas temperature T is high enough that the average particle energy k B T is comparable to ν h P , the energy of the emitted photon that corre- sponds to the difference between the levels. When atom A collides with atom B to form the excited state A ∗ , we can have the reaction A + B −→ A ∗ + B , A ∗ −→ A + ν h P . However, we see an emission line only if state A ∗ decays before colliding yet again. Either the decay must be rapid, or the gas density quite low. Forbidden lines violate the quantum-mechanical rules that specify the most probable tran- sitions (electric dipole) by which an atom could return to its ground state. These ‘rule-breaking’ transitions occur via less-probable slower pathways. They are not observed in dense laboratory plasmas because A ∗ typically collides before it can decay. The electron of a hydrogen atom takes only 10 − 8 s to move from level n = 3to n = 2 by radiating an H α photon, but for forbidden lines this is typically 1 s or longer.

For lines at < 1 μ m, n crit is calculated for collision with electrons at T = 10 000 K; others refer to collisions with H I atoms. in denser gas, collisions are so frequent that A ∗ is most often knocked out of its excited state before it emits the photon. Because their intensity depends so strongly on these quantities, forbidden lines often give us detailed information on the density and temperature of the emitting gas. Astronomers indicate them with square brackets; they refer, for example, to the [O III ] line at 5007 ̊ A. Forbidden lines of ionized ‘metals’ such as O II ,O III (once- and twice-ionized oxygen, respectively), N II , and S II account for most of the energy radiated from H II regions. Table 1.7 lists some common forbidden lines. Fine structure transitions reflect the coupling between the electron’s orbital angular momentum and its spin. They correspond roughly to energy differences only 1 / 137 2 times as large as between the main levels, so for neutral atoms or low ions, wavelengths lie in the far-infrared. The fine-structure lines of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen are in the 10–300 μ m range, and must be observed from aircraft in the stratosphere or from space. Because the energies of the excited"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30 Introduction states are less, these lines are important at lower temperatures. The line of singly ionized carbon C II at 158 μ m, and lines of neutral oxygen at 63 μ m and 145 μ m, carry most of the energy radiated by the Milky Way’s atomic gas at T ∼ 100 K. The line brightness is set by the rate at which C + ions collide with energetic- enough electrons or H 2 molecules. The energy of a photon at 158 μ m corresponds to T = 91 . 2 K; in cooler gas, collisions are too slow to excite C II into the upper state. In a dilute gas with n e electrons and n (C + ) carbon ions per cm 3 , energy is radiated at the rate \u0003 (C + ) = n e n (C + ) T − 1 / 2 exp ( − 91 . 2K / T ) × 8 × 10 − 20 erg cm − 3 s − 1 . (1.17) The exponential term arises because the electrons follow the Maxwellian energy distribution of Equation 3.58. The line brightness falls rapidly as the temperature drops below 100 K. Hyperfine transitions are a consequence of coupling between the nuclear spin and the magnetic field generated by the orbiting electron. They have energy split- tings 2000 times smaller yet than the fine-structure lines. The most important of these is in the hydrogen atom, as the spin of the electron flips from being parallel to the proton spin, to antiparallel. A photon in the 21 cm line carries off the small amount of energy released. The average hydrogen atom takes about 11 Myr to make this transition; but, since hydrogen is by far the most abundant element, 21 cm radio emission is ubiquitous in the Galaxy. Problem 1.9 To find the strength of 21 cm emission, we first ask how often hydrogen atoms collide with each other. If the atoms have average speed v th , each has energy of motion m p v 2 th / 2 = 3 k B T / 2: show that v th ≈ 2kms − 1 at T = 100 K. We regard each as a small sphere of mass m p with the Bohr radius a 0 = h 2 P / (4 π 2 m e e 2 ) = 0 . 529 × 10 − 8 cm. With n H atoms per cm 3 , the average time t coll for one to run into another is 1 t coll = n H π a 2 0 v th , so t coll ≈ 3000 \u0003 1cm − 3 n H \u0004\u0003 100 K T \u0004 1 / 2 yr . (1.18) In nearby neutral clouds n H ≥ 0 . 1 (see Table 2.4), so t coll is much shorter than the time taken to emit a 21 cm photon. The energy difference between the excited and ground states is tiny, so after repeated collisions there will be equal numbers of atoms in each possible state. The excited atom with spins parallel (unit angular momentum) has three distinct states, the ground state (with opposed spins and zero angular momentum) only one. Thus each cubic centimeter emits 3 n H / 4 photons per 11 Myr. Molecules can radiate like atoms, as electrons move between energy levels. But the atoms within the molecule also have quantized levels of vibration, and of"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"1.2 Our Milky Way 31 rotation about the center of mass. We see radiation as the molecule jumps between these levels. The vibrational levels of common small molecules such as CO, CS, and HCN are separated by energies corresponding to emission at a few microns, whereas the rotational transitions lead to millimeter waves. The symmetric H 2 molecule has no dipole moment, so its rotational transitions are ≈ 137 2 times slower. The least energetic transition of H 2 corresponds to emission at 20 μ m, so cold H 2 hardly radiates at all; only shocked gas, with T ∼ 1000 K, gives strong emission. Ultraviolet photons below 2000 ̊ A can excite a hydrogen molecule into a higher electronic level, where its energy is larger than that of two isolated hydrogen atoms. About 10% of these molecules dissociate into two H atoms; the rest emit an ultraviolet photon to return to the ground state. The ultraviolet spectra of hot stars show many absorption lines from cool H 2 between us and the star. Table 1.8 lists some commonly observed molecular lines. H 2 is often excited by ultraviolet light; but other molecules are mainly excited by collisions, and we see their lines only when the typical thermal energy k B T exceeds the energy E upper of the upper level. The decay rate for a line at frequency ν is proportional to ν 3 , so the upper states are long-lived. The line strengths depend on the density, temperature and composition of the gas, and on the radiation shining on it. Unlike the atomic lines, the strong rotational transitions of molecules like CO, CS, and HCN are optically thick: a line photon trying to escape from a molecular cloud is likely to be absorbed by another molecule, putting it into an excited state. So we cannot simply define a critical density as we could for the atomic lines. For CO, the most abundant molecule after H 2 , the rotational transitions at 1.3 mm and 2.6 mm are normally strongest at densities n (H 2 ) ∼ 100 –1000 cm − 3 and require only T ∼ 10–20 K for excitation. Higher transitions at shorter wave- lengths require larger densities and higher temperatures, so we can investigate the state of the emitting gas by observing multiple lines. Emission from NH 3 , CS, and HCN is strongest at densities 10 to 100 times higher than for CO. We see SiO emission where silicate dust grains have been broken apart in shocks. Beyond the Milky Way, lines such as CO are usually weak in dwarf galaxies because their gas is poor in heavy elements. HCN is often strong in galaxies with active nuclei, where intense radiation shines on dense gas; but X-rays from the active nucleus easily destroy HCO + . Near luminous stars and protostars, and around active galactic nuclei (see Section 9.1), masing can occur in molecular transitions, such as those of OH at 1.7 GHz and of water, H 2 O, at 22 GHz. Collisions with fast-moving molecules of hot H 2 , and intense infrared radiation, can excite these molecules in a way that puts more of them into the higher of two energy states. Radiation corresponding to a transition down to the lower state is then amplified by stimulated emission. We see a masing spot when the emission happens to be beamed in our direction: the spot is very small, and the radiation intense. We often use emission or absorption lines to measure the velocities of gas clouds or stars.

Astronomers correct for the motion of the Earth, as it varies during"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"1.2 Our Milky Way 33 the year; quoted velocities are generally heliocentric , measured relative to the Sun. A diffuse ionized gas also produces continuum radiation. Free–free radiation (also called bremsstrahlung , or braking radiation) is produced when the electrical forces from ions deflect free electrons onto curved paths, so that they radiate. Hot gas in the center of the Milky Way, and in clusters and groups of galaxies, has T ∼ 10 7 –10 8 K; its free–free radiation is mainly X-rays. Ionized gas in H II regions around hot stars, with T ∼ 10 4 K, can be detected via free–free emission at radio wavelengths which penetrates the surrounding dusty gas. Strong magnetic fields also force electrons onto curved paths; if they are moving at nearly the speed of light, they give out strongly polarized synchrotron radiation. This process powers the radio emission of supernova remnants, and the radio source at the Milky Way’s nucleus. If the electrons have very high energy, synchrotron radiation can be produced at optical and even X-ray energies. About 1% of the mass of the interstellar material consists of dust particles, mainly silicates and forms of carbon, smaller than ∼ 1 μ m. These grains scatter and absorb radiation efficiently at wavelengths less than their own dimensions. Dust heated by diffuse stellar radiation has T ∼ 10–20 K and glows at ∼ 200 μ m; dust near bright stars is hotter. When dust is spread uniformly, light loses an equal fraction of its power for every parsec that it travels through the dusty gas. Then, if two observers at x and x + \b x look at a distant star in the negative- x direction, it will appear brighter to the closer observer. We can write the apparent brightness at wavelength λ as F λ ( x + \b x ) = F λ ( x )[1 − κ λ \b x ] , (1.20) where the opacity κ represents the rate at which light is absorbed. If the distant star is at position x 0 < x ,wehave d F λ d x =− κ λ F λ , so F λ ( x ) = F λ, 0 e − κ λ ( x − x 0 ) = F λ, 0 e − τ λ , (1.21) where F λ, 0 is the apparent brightness that we would have measured without the dust, and τ λ is the optical depth of the dust layer. Blue and ultraviolet radi- ation is more strongly scattered and absorbed by dust than red light, so dust between us and a star makes it appear both dimmer and redder. For interstellar dust, we often make the approximation κ λ ∝ 1 /λ at visible wavelengths in the range 3000 ̊ A <λ< 1 μ m. Problem 1.10 When a source is dimmed by an amount e − τ λ , show that, according to Equation 1.10, its apparent magnitude increases by an amount A λ = 1 . 086 τ λ . A λ is called the extinction at wavelength λ ."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 Introduction Problem 1.11 Near the Sun, the diffuse interstellar gas has a density of about one atom cm − 3 . Show that you would need to compress a cube of gas 30 km on a side into 1 cm 3 to bring it to Earth’s normal atmospheric density and pressure (6 × 10 23 atoms in 22.4 liters: a cube 10 cm on a side has a volume of one liter). Interstellar gas is about 10 10 times more rarefied than a good laboratory vacuum, which is itself ∼ 10 10 times less dense than Earth’s atmosphere. Assume that each dust grain is a sphere of radius 0.1 μ m, and the gas contains one grain for every 10 12 hydrogen atoms. Show that, as light travels through a 1 cm layer of the compressed gas in the previous problem, about 1% of it will be intercepted. Show that κ = 0 . 015 cm − 1 , so that a layer about 70 cm thick would block a fraction 1 / e of the rays ( τ λ = 1). If the air around you were as dusty as interstellar space you could see for less than a meter, as in the London fogs described by Charles Dickens. Problem 1.12 Assuming that the Milky Way’s luminosity L ≈ 2 × 10 10 L \u0005 , and making the very rough approximation that it is a sphere 5 kpc in radius, use Equation 1.3 to show that, if it radiated as a blackbody, T eff ≈ 5 K. Near the Sun, starlight heats interstellar dust to 15–20 K. On scales larger than ∼ 1 pc, dust is fairly evenly mixed with the Galactic gas. Looking ‘up’ toward the north Galactic pole, we see distant objects dimmed by an average of 0.15 magnitudes or 13% in the V band. If the dusty layer had constant thickness z 0 , objects beyond the Milky Way seen at an angle b from the Galactic pole are viewed through a length z 0 / cos b of dusty gas. So τ λ , and the increase in the star’s apparent magnitude, proportional to 1 / cos b . Since the dusty gas is quite clumpy, at high latitudes we can make a better estimate of this Galactic extinction by using 21 cm emission to measure the neutral hydrogen, and assuming the amount of dust to be proportional. Roughly, the extinction A V in the V band is related to the number N H of hydrogen atoms per square centimeter by N H ≈ 1 . 8 × 10 21 cm − 2 × A V (magnitudes) . (1.22) We will discuss our own Galaxy’s interstellar gas further in Section 2.4, and that of other galaxies in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. 1.2.2 What’s where in the Milky Way : coordinate systems Just as we use latitude and longitude to specify the position of a point on Earth, we need a way to give the positions of stars on the sky. Often we use equatorial coordinates, illustrated in Figure 1.9. We imagine that the stars lie on the celestial sphere , a very large sphere centred on the Earth, and define the celestial poles as the points that are directly overhead at the Earth’s north and south poles.

The celestial sphere, showing the ecliptic: right ascension α is measured eastward from the vernal equinox, and declination δ from the celestial equator. celestial equator is the great circle on the celestial sphere that runs directly above the Earth’s equator. A star’s declination , akin to latitude on Earth, is the angle between its position on the celestial sphere, and the nearest point on the celestial equator. An object at the north celestial pole has declination δ = 90 ◦ , whereas at the south celestial pole it has δ =− 90 ◦ . During the night, the Earth turns anticlockwise on its axis as seen from above the north pole, so the stars appear to rise in the east and move westward across the sky, circling the celestial poles. Each star rises where the circle of ‘latitude’ corresponding to its declination cuts the eastern horizon, and sets where that circle intersects the horizon in the west. Throughout the year, the Sun appears to move slowly from west to east against the background of the stars; it lies north of the celestial equator in June and south of it in January, following the great circle of the ecliptic. The ecliptic is inclined by 23 ◦ 27 \u0006 to the celestial equator, intersecting it at the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox . So the Sun crosses the equator twice a year: at the vernal equinox in the spring, usually on March 21st, and at the autumnal equinox around September 23rd. To define a longitude on the sky, we use the vernal equinox as a zero point, like the Greenwich meridian on Earth. The ‘longitude’ of a star is its right ascension , denoted by α . Right ascension is measured eastward from the vernal equinox in hours, with 24 hours making up the complete circle. The direction of the Earth’s rotation axis changes slowly because of preces- sion : the celestial poles and equator do not stay in fixed positions on the sky. The vernal equinox moves westward along the ecliptic at about 50 \u0006\u0006 per year, so the tropical year from one vernal equinox to the next is about 20 minutes shorter than the Earth’s orbital period, the sidereal year .

Astronomers generally use coordinates relative to the 1950 or 2000 equinox, or the equinox of the current year. Computer programs easily convert between these systems. But more than one astronomer has pointed a telescope in the wrong direction by forgetting to specify the equinox. The stars that have reached their highest point in the sky at any moment all lie on a great circle passing through the celestial poles and through the zenith , the point directly overhead. These stars all have the same right ascension. On the date of the autumnal equinox, in September, the position of the vernal equinox, and all stars with right ascension zero, are highest in the sky at midnight. Three hours later, when the Earth has made an eighth of a turn on its axis, the stars further east, with right ascension 3 h , will be at their highest; and so on through the night. So the positions of the stars can be used to tell the time. At any moment, the right ascension of the stars that are at their highest gives the local star time, or sidereal time: all observatories have clocks telling sidereal time, as well as the usual civil time. Problem 1.13 Draw a diagram to show that, as the Earth circles the Sun during the course of a year, relative to the stars it makes 366 1 4 rotations on its axis. The number of sidereal days in a year is one more than the number of solar days, which are measured from midnight to midnight. So a sidereal day lasts only 23 h 56 m . To give the positions of stars as we see them in relation to the Milky Way, we use the Sun-centred system of Galactic latitude and longitude shown in the left panel of Figure 1.10. The center of the Galaxy lies in the direction α = 17 h 42 m 24 s ,δ =− 28 ◦ 55 \u0006 (equinox 1950). Galactic longitude l is measured in the plane of the disk from the Sun–center line, defined as l = 0, toward the direction of the Sun’s rotation, l = 90 ◦ . The region 0 < l < 180 ◦ is sometimes called the ‘northern’ half of the Galaxy, because it is visible from the Earth’s northern hemisphere, while 180 ◦ < l < 360 ◦ is the ‘southern’ Galaxy. The latitude b"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"1.3 Other galaxies 37 gives the angle of a star away from the plane of the disk; b is measured positive toward the north Galactic pole at α = 12 h 49 m ,δ = 27 ◦ 24 \u0006 (1950). The north Galactic pole is just the pole of the disk that is visible from the Earth’s northern hemisphere. Inconveniently, the Earth’s rotation axis and that of the Milky Way are at present about 120 ◦ apart, so the Milky Way’s rotation is clockwise when seen from ‘above’ the north Galactic pole; its spin axis points closer to the direction of the south Galactic pole. To specify the positions of stars in three-dimensional space, we can use a system of Galactocentric cylindrical polar coordinates R ,φ, z (Figure 1.10). The radius R measures the distance from the Galactic center in the disk plane; the height ‘above’ the midplane is given by z , with z > 0 in the direction of the north Galactic pole. The azimuthal angle φ is measured from the direction toward the Sun, so that it is positive in the direction toward l = 90 ◦ . For motions near the Sun, we sometimes use Cartesian coordinates x , y , z with x pointing radially outwards and y in the direction of the Sun’s rotation. We take a more detailed look at the Milky Way in Chapters 2 and 3. 1.3 Other galaxies This section introduces the study of galaxies other than our own Milky Way. We discuss how to classify galaxies according to their appearance in optical light, and how to measure the amount of light that they give out. Although big galaxies emit most of the light, the most common type of galaxy is a tiny dim dwarf. The existence of other galaxies was established only in the 1920s. Before that, they were listed in catalogues of nebulae : objects that appeared fuzzy in a telescope and were therefore not stars. Better images revealed stars within some of these ‘celestial clouds’. Using the newly opened 100 \u0006\u0006 telescope on Mount Wilson, Edwin Hubble was able to find variable stars in the Andromeda ‘nebula’ M31. He showed that their light followed the same pattern of changing brightness as Cepheid variable stars within our Galaxy. Assuming that all these stars were of the same type, with the same luminosities, he could find the relative distances from Equation 1.1. He concluded that the stars of Andromeda were at least 300 kpc from the Milky Way, so the nebula must be a galaxy in its own right. We now know that the Andromeda galaxy is about 800 kpc away. Hubble set out his scheme for classifying the galaxies in a 1936 book, The Realm of the Nebulae . With later additions and modifications, this system is still used today; see Figure 1.11. Hubble recognized three main types of galaxy: ellip- ticals, lenticulars, and spirals, with a fourth class, the irregulars, for galaxies that would not fit into any of the other categories. Elliptical galaxies are usually smooth, round, and almost featureless, devoid of such photogenic structures as spiral arms and conspicuous dust lanes. Ellipticals are generally lacking in cool gas and consequently have few young blue stars."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"38 Introduction cD dE dIrr S0 E Sa SBa Sc dSph SBm Sm S d SBd Sb SBb SBc Fig. 1.11. Galaxy classification: a modified form of Hubble’s scheme. Though they all appear approximately elliptical on the sky, detailed study shows that large bright ellipticals have rather different structures from their smaller and fainter counterparts. Ellipticals predominate in rich clusters of galaxies, and the largest of them, the cD galaxies , are found in the densest parts of those clusters. Around an elliptical core, the enormous diffuse envelope of a cD galaxy may stretch for hundreds of kiloparsecs; these systems can be up to 100 times more luminous than the Milky Way. Normal or giant ellipticals have luminosities a few times that of the Milky Way, with characteristic sizes of tens of kiloparsecs. The stars of these bright ellipticals show little organized motion, such as rotation; their orbits about the galaxy center are oriented in random directions. The left panel of Figure 1.12 shows a giant elliptical, which has an active nucleus (see Section 9.1) that is a bright compact radio source. In less luminous elliptical galaxies, the stars have more rotation and less random motion. Often there are signs of a disk embedded within the elliptical body. The very faintest ellipticals, with less than ∼ 1 / 10 of the Milky Way’s luminosity, split into two groups. The first comprises the rare compact ellipticals, like the nearby system M32. The other group consists of the faint diffuse dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies, and their even less luminous cousins the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies, which are so diffuse as to be scarcely visible on sky photographs. The right panel of Figure 1.12 shows a dwarf elliptical satellite of M31. The dE and dSph galaxies show almost no ordered rotation. Lenticular galaxies show a rotating disk in addition to the central elliptical bulge, but the disk lacks any spiral arms or extensive dust lanes.

Spiral galaxies (Figure 1.14) are named for their bright spiral arms, which are especially conspicuous in the blue light that was most easily recorded by early photographic plates. The arms are outlined by clumps of bright hot O and B stars, and the compressed dusty gas out of which these stars form. About half of all spiral and lenticular galaxies show a central linear bar: the barred systems SB0, SBa, ... , SBd form a sequence parallel to that of the unbarred galaxies. Along the sequence from Sa spirals to Sc and Sd, the central bulge becomes less important relative to the rapidly rotating disk, while the spiral arms become more open and the fraction of gas and young stars in the disk increases. Our Milky Way is probably an Sc galaxy, or perhaps an intermediate Sbc type; M31 is an Sb. On average, Sc and Sd galaxies are less luminous than the Sa and Sb systems, but some Sc galaxies are still brighter than a typical Sa spiral. At the end of the spiral sequence, in the Sd galaxies, the spiral arms become more ragged and less well ordered. The Sm and SBm classes are Magellanic spirals , named after their prototype, which is our Large Magellanic Cloud; see Section 4.1. In these, the spiral is often reduced to a single stubby arm. As the galaxy luminosity decreases, so does the speed at which the disk rotates; dimmer galaxies are less massive. The Large Magellanic Cloud rotates at only 80 km s − 1 , a third as fast as the Milky Way. Random stellar motions are also diminished in"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"40 Introduction Fig. 1.13.

Mack; Hubble Space Telescope/NASA/ ESA. the smaller galaxies, but even so, ordered rotational motion forms a less important part of their total energy. We indicate this in Figure 1.11 by placing these galaxies to the left of the Sd systems. The terms ‘early type’ and ‘late type’ are often used to describe the position of galaxies along the sequence from elliptical galaxies through S0s to Sa, Sb, and Sc spirals. Some astronomers once believed that this progression might describe the life cycle of galaxies, with ellipticals turning into S0s and then spirals. Although this hypothesis has now been discarded, the terms live on. Confusingly, ‘early- type’ galaxies are full of ‘late-type’ stars, and vice versa. Hubble placed all galaxies that did not fit into his other categories in the irregular class. Today, we use that name only for small blue galaxies which lack any organized spiral or other structure (Figure 1.13). The smallest of the irregular galaxies are called dwarf irregulars ; they differ from the dwarf spheroidals by having gas and young blue stars. It is possible that dwarf spheroidal galaxies are just small dwarf irregulars which have lost or used up all of their gas. Locally, about 70% of moderately bright galaxies are spirals, 30% are elliptical or S0 galaxies, and 3% are irregulars. Other galaxies that Hubble would have called irregulars include the starburst galaxies . These systems have formed many stars in the recent past, and their disturbed appearance results in part from gas thrown out by supernova explosions."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"1.3 Other galaxies 41 Fig. 1.14.

Interacting galaxies, in which two or more systems have come close to each other, and galaxies that appear to result from the merger of two or more smaller systems, would also have fallen into this class. We have come to realize that galaxies are not ‘island universes’, but affect each other’s development throughout their lives. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 of this book discuss the structures of nearby galaxies, while Chapter 7 considers how galaxies interact in groups and clusters. We usually refer to galaxies by their numbering in a catalogue. Charles Messier’s 1784 catalogue lists 109 objects that look ‘fuzzy’ in a small telescope; it includes the Andromeda galaxy as M31. The New General Catalogue of more than 7000 nonstellar objects includes clusters of stars and gaseous nebulae as well as galaxies. This catalogue, published by J. L. E. Dreyer in 1888, with addi- tions in 1895 and 1908, was based largely on the work of William Herschel (who discovered the planet Uranus), his sister Caroline, and his son John Herschel.

A recent graduate text on galaxy classification is S. van den Bergh, 1998, Galaxy Morphology and Classification (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK). 1.3.1 Galaxy photometry Unlike stars, galaxies do not appear as points of light; they extend across the sky. Turbulence in the Earth’s atmosphere has the effect of blurring galaxy images; this is known as seeing . Because of it, a ground-based optical telescope rarely shows details smaller than about 1 / 3 \u0006\u0006 . For sharper images, we must use a telescope in space or resort to techniques such as interferometry or adaptive optics. Although the classification of galaxies is still based on their appearance in optical images, most work on galaxies is quantitative, measuring how much light, at what wavelengths, is emitted by the different regions. The surface brightness of a galaxy I ( x ) is the amount of light per square arcsecond on the sky at a particular point x in the image. Consider a small square patch of side D in a galaxy that we view from a distance d , so that it subtends an angle α = D / d on the sky. If the combined luminosity of all the stars in this region is L , its apparent brightness F is given by Equation 1.1; then the surface brightness is I ( x ) ≡ F α 2 = L / (4 π d 2 ) D 2 / d 2 = L 4 π D 2 . (1.23) I is usually given in mag arcsec − 2 (the apparent magnitude of a star that appears as bright as one square arcsecond of the galaxy’s image), or in L \u0005 pc − 2 . The surface brightness at any point does not depend on distance unless d is so large that the expansion of the Universe has the effect of reducing I ( x ); we discuss this further in Section 8.3. Contours of constant surface brightness on a galaxy image are called isophotes . Equation 1.23 shows that the position of an isophote within the galaxy is independent of the observer’s distance. We generally measure surface brightness in a fixed wavelength band, just as for stellar photometry. The centers of galaxies reach only I B ≈ 18 mag arcsec − 2 or I R ≈ 16 mag arcsec − 2 , and the stellar disks are much fainter. Galaxies do not"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"1.3 Other galaxies 43 have sharp edges, so we often measure their sizes within a fixed isophote. One popular choice is the 25th-magnitude isophote in the blue B band, denoted R 25 . This is about 1% of the sky level on an average night; before CCD photometry (see Section 5.1), it was close to the limit of what could be measured reliably. Another option is the Holmberg radius at I B ( x ) = 26 . 5 mag arcsec − 2 . To find the luminosity of the whole galaxy, we measure how the amount of light coming from within a given radius grows as that radius is moved outward, and we extrapolate to reach the total. Problem 1.14 In a galaxy at a distance of d Mpc, what would be the apparent B -magnitude of a star like our Sun? In this galaxy, show that 1 \u0006\u0006 on the sky corresponds to 5 d pc. If the surface brightness I B = 27 mag arcsec − 2 , how much B -band light does one square arcsecond of the galaxy emit, compared with a star like the Sun? Show that this is equivalent to L \u0005 pc − 2 in the B band, but that I I = 27 mag arcsec − 2 corresponds to only 0.3 L \u0005 pc − 2 in the I band. Table 1.9 gives the surface brightness of the night sky measured in the band- passes of Figure 1.7. These are approximate average values, since the sky bright- ness depends on solar activity (the sunspot cycle), the observatory’s location on Earth, and the direction in the sky. Typically, the sky is brighter than all but the inner core of a galaxy, and on a moonlit night even the center can disappear into the bright sky. From Earth’s surface, optical observations of galaxies must generally be made during the dark of the moon. If our eyes could perceive colors at such low light levels, we would see the sky glowing red with emission in the bands of atmospheric molecules. In the near- infrared at 2 μ m, from most observatory sites the sky is over a thousand times brighter than it would be in space. Figure 1.15 shows how steeply its emission rises at longer wavelengths, in the thermal infrared . The high cold South Pole is the best Earth-based site at these wavelengths, but the sky is still enormously brighter than from space. Standard infrared filters are chosen to lie where the atmosphere is most transparent. Between these regions, we see a blackbody spectrum corresponding to the temperature of the opaque layers. We can cut down the sky light by designing our filters to exclude some of the strongest lines; using the K \u0006 filter instead of K blocks out about two- thirds of the emission. But Table 1.9 makes clear that, when we observe from the ground, the infrared sky is always brighter than the galaxy. To find the surface brightness accurately, we must measure the brightness of a patch of blank sky as it changes throughout the night just as accurately as we measure the galaxy-plus-sky; the small difference between the two gives I ( x ). A tele- scope in space gives us a much darker sky at red and infrared wavelengths. We can also observe in the near-ultraviolet, where the sky brightness is yet lower."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44 Introduction Table 1.9 Average sky brightness in ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavebands Full moon Dark sky From space From space South Pole Band Wavelength ( mag arcsec − 2 ) ( mag arcsec − 2 ) ( mag arcsec − 2 )( μ Jy arcsec − 2 )( μ Jy arcsec − 2 ) 1500 ̊ A 25.0 2000 ̊ A 26.0 2500 ̊ A 25.6 U 3700 ̊ A 22.0 23.2 B 4400 ̊ A 19.4 22.7 23.4 1.8 V 5500 ̊ A 19.7 21.8 22.7 R 6400 ̊ A 19.9 20.9 22.2 I 8000 ̊ A 19.2 19.9 22.2 3.2 J 1 . 2 μ m 15.0 15.0 20.7 2.4 300–600 H 1 . 6 μ m 13.7 13.7 20.9 4.4 800–2 000 K 2 . 2 μ m 12.5 12.5 21.3 1.9 300–700 K \u0006 2 . 2 μ m 13.7 13.7 21.3 1.9 500 L 3 . 3 μ m 1.1 10 5 M 4 . 9 μ m 8.0 10 6 N 10 . 6 μ m 220 4 × 10 7 Q 19 μ m 400 3 × 10 8 The two columns headed ‘from space’ differ only in their units. 2 4 6 8 10 20 K L M N Q 1.5 1.55 1.6 Fig. 1.15.

According to this formula, the number of galaxies brighter than the luminosity L drops very rapidly. We often use the criterion L ∼ > 0 . 1 L to define a ‘bright’ or ‘giant’ galaxy, as opposed to a dwarf. The solid curve is for L ≈ 9 × 10 9 h − 2 L \u0005 , corresponding to M ( B J ) =− 19 . 7 + 5 log 10 h ; as explained in the next section, the parameter h measures the rate at which the Universe expands.

In the near- infrared K band ρ L ( K ) ≈ 6 × 10 8 hL \u0005 Mpc − 3 ; it is larger than ρ L ( B J ) because most light comes from stars redder than the Sun. 1.4 Galaxies in the expanding Universe The Universe is expanding; the galaxies are rushing away from us. The recession speed, as measured by the Doppler shift of a galaxy’s spectral lines, is larger for more distant galaxies. We can extrapolate this motion back into the past, to estimate when the Universe had its beginning in the Big Bang . Doing this, we link the recession speed or redshift that we measure for a galaxy with the time after the Big Bang at which its light was given out; the redshift becomes a measure of the galaxy’s age when it emitted that light. In 1929, on the basis of only 22 measurements of radial velocities for nearby galaxies, and some distance estimates which turned out to be wrong by about a factor of ten, Hubble claimed that the galaxies are moving away from us with speeds V r proportional to their distance d : V r ≈ H 0 d . (1.26) Subsequent work proved him right, and this relation is now known as Hubble’s law . Current estimates for the parameter H 0 , the Hubble constant , lie between 60 and 75 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . Figure 1.17 shows that galaxies that recede faster are indeed fainter, as expected if they all have roughly the same luminosity, but are progressively more distant. We often use Hubble’s law to estimate the distances of galaxies from their measured velocities. It is common to indicate the uncertainty in the Hubble con- stant explicitly, by writing h for the value of H 0 in units of 100 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . Then Equation 1.26 implies d = h − 1 \t V r (km s − 1 ) / 100 Mpc . (1.27) When the distance of a galaxy is found from its radial velocity V r , the derived luminosity L ∝ h − 2 . This is why the parameter L of Equation 1.24 has a value proportional to h − 2 ; similarly, the density n ∝ h 3 .

Oke 1975 ApJ 195 , 255. Newton’s equation for the gravitational force (see Section 3.1), then we have that M ∝ h − 1 . If the average speeds of the galaxies had always remained constant, they would have been on top of each other at a time t H before the present, where t H = 1 H 0 = 9 . 78 h − 1 Gyr = 15 Gyr × 67 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 H 0 . (1.28) This is called the Hubble time ; we can use it as a rough estimate of the age of the Universe, the time since the Big Bang. Problem 1.15 If a galaxy has absolute magnitude M , use Equations 1.1 and 1.27 to show that its apparent magnitude m is related to the redshift z = V r / c of Equation 1.19 by m = M + 5 log 10 z + C , where C is a constant, the same for all objects. Draw an approximate straight line through the points in Figure 1.17; check that its slope is roughly what you would expect if the brightest galaxy in a rich cluster always had the same luminosity. Using Hubble’s law to find approximate distances for galaxies, we can exam- ine their distribution in space: Figure 8.3 shows the region of the 2dF survey of Figure 1.16. We do not see galaxies spread uniformly through space, but concen- trated into groups and clusters. Within rich clusters, the galaxies’ orbits give them peculiar velocities up to 1500 km s − 1 . So, if we use Equation 1.27 to find their"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"48 Introduction positions, they will appear to be closer or more distant than they really are. A galaxy’s measured radial velocity V r has two components: the cosmic expansion, and a peculiar velocity V pec . Equation 1.26 should be modified to read V r = H 0 d + V pec . (1.29) Between the clusters, we will see in Chapter 8 that individual galaxies and small groups lie along filaments or in large sheets. The groups and associations of galaxies within these filaments and sheets are less rich than clusters, but more numerous. Our Milky Way and its neighbor Andromeda form part of the Local Group , which includes a few dozen smaller systems within a radius of 1–2 Mpc. Between the sheets and filaments are vast nearly empty regions; in these voids, we see only a few isolated galaxies. 1.4.1 Densities and ages In Section 8.2 we will examine the dynamics of the cosmic expansion, and how it is related to the density of matter and energy in the Universe. If the average density is now greater than the critical density , the expansion can in future reverse to a contraction; if it is less, the galaxies continue to recede forever. The critical density is ρ crit (now) = 3 H 2 0 8 π G = 1 . 9 × 10 − 29 h 2 gcm − 3 = 2 . 8 × 10 11 h 2 M \u0005 Mpc − 3 . (1.30) For H 0 = 67 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 , this is equivalent to a good-sized galaxy in each megaparsec cube, or about five hydrogen atoms per m 3 . If matter in the Universe has exactly this density, the time t 0 from the Big Bang to the present day is t 0 = 2 3 H 0 ≈ 10 Gyr × \u0003 67 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 H 0 \u0004 . (1.31) If the average density exceeds ρ crit , the Universe is younger than this, whereas if the density is less, it is older. We shall see that the density is unlikely to be greater than the critical value, so the time since the Big Bang is at least that given by Equation 1.31. The present age t 0 can be larger than t H only if the equations of General Relativity are modified by including dark energy , which pushes the galaxies away from each other. We will see in the following section that normal matter makes up only about 4% of the critical density. In the current benchmark model for the cosmic expansion, the total density has exactly the critical value, and H 0 = 70 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . Matter makes up 30% of ρ crit , but most of it is dark . The dark matter probably consists of particles that, like neutrinos, are weakly interacting – or we"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"1.4 Galaxies in the expanding Universe 49 should have seen them – and have some small but nonzero mass. Collectively, these are known as weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. Dark energy accounts for the remainder; we have little idea about its nature. The present age t 0 of the benchmark model is 0.964 t H or 13.5 Gyr. Problem 1.16 Use Equation 1.25 to show that, for the Universe to be at the critical density, the average ratio of mass to luminosity M / L would have to be approximately 1700 h M \u0005 / L \u0005 in blue light. 1.4.2 Galaxies in the Universe Why is the history of the Universe relevant to our study of galaxies? First, as we will see in Section 2.2, the Hubble time t H is very close to the ages that we estimate for the oldest stars in our own Galaxy and others. The galaxies, and the stars in them, can be no older than the Universe. To understand how galaxies came into existence, we must know how much time it took to form the earliest stars, and to build up the elements heavier than helium. The atmospheres of old low-mass stars in galaxies are fossils from the early Universe, preserving a record of the abundances of the various elements in the gas out of which they formed. Our knowledge of stellar evolution provides us with a clock measuring in gigayears how long ago these stars began their lives on the main sequence. The redshifts of distant galaxies tell the time by a different clock, giving information on how long after the Big Bang their light set off on its journey to us. To relate times measured by these two clocks, we must know how the scale of the Universe has changed with time. In Section 8.2 we will see how to calculate the scale length R ( t ), which grows proportionally to the distance between the galaxies; the Hubble constant H 0 is given by ̇ R ( t 0 ) / R ( t 0 ). For the simplest models, R ( t ) depends only on the value of H 0 and the present density ρ ( t 0 ). The expansion of the Universe also affects the light that we receive from galaxies. Consider two galaxies separated by a distance d , separating at speed V r = H 0 d according to Equation 1.26. If one of these emits light of wavelength λ e , an observer in the other galaxy will receive it at a time \b t = d / c later, with a longer wavelength λ obs = λ e + \bλ . If the galaxies are fairly close, so that V r \u0011 c , we can use the Doppler formula of Equation 1.19 to show that the ratio λ obs /λ e is 1 + \bλ λ e ≈ 1 + H 0 d c = 1 + H 0 \b t = 1 + \u000b 1 R ( t ) d R ( t ) d t \f t 0 \b t . (1.32) We can rewrite this as an equation for the wavelength λ as a function of time: 1 λ d λ d t = 1 R ( t ) d R ( t ) d t . (1.33)"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"50 Introduction Integrating gives the formula for the cosmological redshift z: 1 + z ≡ λ obs λ e = R ( t 0 ) R ( t e ) , (1.34) which holds for large redshifts as well as small. Since the wavelength of light expands proportionally to R ( t ), its frequency decreases by a factor of 1 + z . All processes in a distant galaxy appear stretched in time by this factor; when we observe the distant Universe, we see events taking place in slow motion. We will discuss galaxy groups and clusters in Chapter 7. The other topics of this section are treated in greater depth in Chapters 8 and 9. 1.5 The pregalactic era : a brief history of matter Here, we sketch what we know of the history of matter in the Universe before the galaxies formed. When a gas is compressed, as in filling a bicycle tire, it heats up; when it is allowed to expand, as in using a pressurized spray can, its temperature drops. The gas of the early Universe was extremely hot and dense, and it has been cooling off during its expansion. This is the Big Bang model for the origin of the Universe: the cosmos came into existence with matter at a very high temperature, and expanding rapidly. The physics that we have developed in laboratories on Earth then predicts how this fireball developed into the cosmos that we know today. Two aspects of the early hot phase are especially important for our study of galaxies. First, the abundance of the lightest elements, hydrogen, deuterium (heavy hydrogen), helium, and lithium, was largely determined by conditions in the first half-hour after the Big Bang. The observed abundance of helium is, amazingly, quite closely what is predicted by the Big Bang model. The measured fraction of deuterium, 3 He, and lithium can tell us how much matter the Universe contains. In later chapters, we will compare this figure with the masses that we measure in and around galaxies. Second, the cosmic microwave background radiation, a relic of the pregalactic Universe, allows us to find our motion relative to the rest of the cosmos. The Milky Way’s speed through the cosmic microwave background is our peculiar velocity , as defined in Equation 1.29. It turns out to be surprisingly large, indicating that huge concentrations of distant matter have exerted a strong pull on our Local Group.

During the expansion, Equation 1.34 tells us that wavelengths grow proportionally to the scale length R ( t ). By Equation 1.5, the radiation temperature T varies inversely as the wavelength λ max at which most light is emitted, and the temperature drops as T ∝ 1 / R ( t ); see the problem below. Problem 1.17 If photons now fill the cosmos uniformly with number density n ( t 0 ), show that, at time t , the density n ( t ) = n ( t 0 ) R 3 ( t 0 ) / R 3 ( t ). Use Equa- tion 1.34 to show that the energy density of radiation decreases as 1 / R 4 ( t ). For blackbody radiation at temperature T , the number density of photons with energy between ν and ν + \bν is n ( ν ) \bν = 2 ν 2 c 3 \bν exp[ h ν/ ( k B T )] − 1 . (1.35) Show that, if the present spectrum is that of blackbody radiation at temperature T 0 , then at time t the expansion transforms this exactly into blackbody radiation at temperature T ( t ) = T 0 R ( t 0 ) / R ( t ). During the first three minutes of its life, the Universe was full of energetic γ -rays, which would smash any atomic nuclei apart into their constituent particles. When the temperature of the radiation field is high enough, pairs of particles and their antiparticles can be created out of the vacuum. Because photons are never at rest, two of them are required to produce a particle pair. A typical photon of radiation at temperature T carries energy E = 4 k B T , where k B is Boltzmann’s constant; so proton–antiproton pairs could be produced when k B T ∼ > m p c 2 , where m p is the proton mass. We usually measure these energies in units of an electron volt , the energy that an electron gains by moving through a potential difference of 1 volt: 1 eV = 1 . 6 × 10 − 19 Jor1 . 6 × 10 − 12 erg. In these units, m p c 2 ≈ 10 9 eV or 1 GeV, so pairs of protons and antiprotons were created freely in the first 10 − 4 s, when k B T \u0012 m p c 2 , or T \u0012 10 13 K . (1.36) As the expansion continued, the temperature fell, and the photons had too little energy to make a proton–antiproton pair; almost all the antiprotons met with a proton and annihilated to leave a pair of γ -rays.

The small excess of matter over antimatter was"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"52 Introduction left over to form the galaxies. The photons produced in the annihilation are seen today as the cosmic microwave background. Electrons are about 2000 times less massive than protons: their rest energy m e c 2 is only 0.5 MeV. So the radiation still produced pairs of electrons and anti- electrons ( positrons ,e + ), until the temperature dropped a thousandfold, to T ∼ 10 10 K. Before this time, the reaction e − + e + ←→ ν e + ̄ ν e could produce electron neutrinos ν e and their antiparticles ̄ ν e . The great abundance of electrons, positrons, and neutrinos allowed neutrons to turn into protons, and vice versa, through reactions such as e − + p ←→ n + ν e , ̄ ν e + p ←→ n + e + , n ←→ p + e − + ̄ ν e . In equilibrium at temperature T , there would have been slightly fewer neutrons than protons, since the neutron mass m n is larger. The ratio of neutrons to protons was given by n / p = e − Q / ( k B T ) , where Q = ( m n − m p ) c 2 = 1 . 293 MeV . (1.37) Neutrinos are very weakly interacting particles; from the Sun, 10 15 of them fly harmlessly through each square meter of the Earth’s surface every second. Only in the extremely hot material of supernova cores, or in the early Universe, do they have an appreciable chance of reacting with other particles. While electron– positron pairs were still numerous, the density of neutrinos was high enough to keep the balance between neutrons and protons at this equilibrium level. But later, once k B T ∼ < 0 . 8 MeV or t ∼ > 1 s, expansion had cooled the matter and neutrinos so much that a neutron or proton was very unlikely to interact with a neutrino. The neutrons froze out , with n / p ≈ 1 / 5. 1.5.2 Making the elements Neutrons can survive if they are bound up in the nuclei of atoms, but free neutrons are not stable; they decay exponentially into a proton, an electron, and an anti- neutrino ̄ ν e . After a time τ n = 886 ± 1 s, which is also the mean lifetime, the number is reduced by a factor 1 / e . Very few neutrons would now be left, if they had not combined with protons to form deuterium , a nucleus of ‘heavy hydrogen’ containing a neutron and a proton, by the reaction n + p → D + γ ;"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"1.5 The pregalactic era : a brief history of matter 53 here γ represents a photon, a γ -ray carrying away the 2.2 MeV of energy set free in the reaction. This reaction also took place at earlier times, but any deuterium that managed to form was immediately torn apart by photons in the blackbody radiation. After the electron–positron pairs were gone, at T ∼ < 3 × 10 9 K, the energy density in the Universe was almost entirely due to blackbody radiation. General Relativity tells us that the temperature fell according to t = \u0003 3 c 2 32 π Ga B T 4 \u0004 1 / 2 ≈ 230 s \u0003 10 9 K T \u0004 2 ; (1.38) here a B = 7 . 56 × 10 − 16 Jm − 3 K − 4 is the blackbody constant. About a quarter of the neutrons had decayed before the temperature fell to about 10 9 K, when they could be locked into deuterium; this left one neutron for every seven protons. The excess protons, which became the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, accounted for roughly 75% of the total mass. Deuterium easily combines with other particles to form 4 He, a helium nucleus with two protons and two neutrons. Essentially all the neutrons, and so about 25% of the total mass of neutrons and protons, ended up in 4 He. Only a little deuterium and some 3 He (with two protons and one neutron) remained. Traces of boron and lithium were also formed, but the Universe expanded too rapidly to build up heavier nuclei. The amount of helium produced depends on the half-life of the neutron, but hardly at all on the density of matter at that time; almost every neutron could find a proton and form deuterium, and almost every deuterium nucleus reacted to make helium. The observed abundance of helium is between 22% and 24%, in rough accord with this calculation. If, for example, we had found the Sun to contain 10% of helium by weight, that observation would have been very hard to explain in the Big Bang cosmology. Problem 1.18 Deuterium can become abundant only when k B T ∼ < 70 keV. Use Equation 1.38 to show that this temperature is reached at t ≈ 365 s, by which time about 35% of the free neutrons have decayed. The mean lifetime τ n is hard to measure; until recently, laboratory values varied from 700 s to 1400 s. If the mean lifetime had been 750 s, show that the predicted fraction of helium would be about 2% lower, whereas if it had been 1100 s, we would expect to find close to 2% more helium. By contrast, the small fraction of deuterium left over is very much dependent on the density of neutrons and protons, collectively known as baryons . If there had been very little matter, many of the deuterium nuclei would have missed the chance to collide with other particles, before reactions ceased as the Universe became too dilute. If the present number of baryons had been as low as n B = 10 − 8 cm − 3 , then"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"54 Introduction as many as 1% of the deuterium nuclei would remain. If the density were now as high as n B = 2 × 10 − 6 cm − 3 , we would expect to find less than one deuterium nucleus for each 10 9 atoms of hydrogen. Deuterium also burns readily to helium inside stars. So to measure how much was made in the Big Bang, we must look for old metal-poor stars that have not burned the deuterium in their outer layers, or at intergalactic clouds of gas that have not yet formed many stars. Our best measurements show one deuterium nucleus for every 20 000 or 30 000 atoms of hydrogen. Along with measurements of 3 He and lithium, these show that the combined density of neutrons and protons today is n B = (2 . 5 ± 0 . 5) × 10 − 7 cm − 3 , or ρ B = (5 − 7) × 10 9 M \u0005 Mpc − 3 . (1.39) This is much less than the critical density of Equation 1.30: the ratio is 0 . 02 h − 2 ∼ < ρ B /ρ crit ∼ < 0 . 025 h − 2 , (1.40) where h is Hubble’s constant H 0 in units of 100 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . Observations seem to require h ∼ > 0 . 6, so neutrons and protons cannot make up more than about 7% of ρ crit . Since h ∼ < 0 . 75, baryons account for no less than 3% of the critical density. In the benchmark model, ρ B = 0 . 045 ρ crit . We will find in Section 5.3 that this is more mass than we can see as the gas and luminous stars of galaxies; at least part of their ‘dark stuff’ must consist of normal matter. Problem 1.19 The Universe must contain at least as much matter as that of the neutrons and protons: use Equations 1.39 and 1.25 to show that the average mass-to-light ratio must exceed 50 h − 1 M \u0005 / L \u0005 . 1.5.3 Recombination : light and matter uncoupled The next few hundred thousand years of the Universe’s history were rather bor- ing. Its density had dropped too low for nuclear reactions, and the background radiation was energetic enough to ionize hydrogen and disrupt other atoms. The cosmos was filled with glowing gas, like the inside of a fluorescent light. Pho- tons could not pass freely through this hot plasma, but they were scattered by free electrons. Matter would not collapse under its own gravity to form stars or other dense objects, because the pressure of the radiation trapped inside was too high. The density of radiation decreases with the scale length R ( t )as T 4 ∝ R − 4 ( t ). So after some time it must drop below that of matter, which falls only as R − 3 ( t ).

Later on, photons of the blackbody radiation lacked the energy to remove the electron from a hydrogen atom. During its subsequent expansion, hydrogen atoms recombined , the gas becoming neutral and transparent as it is today. By the time that R ( t ) / R ( t 0 ) ≈ 1 / 1100, photons of the background radiation were able to escape from the matter. Their outward pressure no longer prevented the collapse of matter, into the galaxies and clusters that we now observe. The most distant galaxies so far observed are at redshifts z ∼ > 6; when their light left them, the Universe was less than 1 Gyr old. Figure 1.18 presents a brief summary of cosmic history up to that time. The radiation coming to us from the period of recombination has been red- shifted according to Equation 1.34; it now has a much longer wavelength. Its temperature T = 2 . 728 ± 0 . 002 K, so it is known as the cosmic microwave background. There are about 420 of these photons in each cm 3 of space, so, according to Equation 1.40, we have (2–4) × 10 9 photons for every neutron or proton. The energy density of the background radiation is about equal to that of starlight in the outer reaches of the Milky Way. It is given by a B T 4 = 4 . 2 × 10 − 14 Jm − 3 ; so from each steradian of the sky we receive ca B T 4 / (4 π ) ≈ 10 − 6 Wm − 2 . Problem 1.20 Using Equation 1.25, show that, even if we ignore the energy loss that goes along with the redshift, it would take more than 100 Gyr for all the galaxies, at their present luminosity, to emit as much energy as is in the microwave background today. Figure 1.19 shows the extragalactic background radiation, estimated by observing from our position in the Milky Way and attempting to subtract local contributions. The energy of the cosmic background is far larger than that in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectral regions. It would be very difficult to explain such enormous energy as coming from any other source than the Big Bang.

Since photons lose energy in an expanding Universe, almost all this radia- tion, aside from that in the microwave background, must have been emitted over the past ∼ 10 Gyr, at times corresponding to redshifts z ∼ < 3. The microwave background is now very close to a blackbody spectrum; it is also extremely uniform.

We begin this chapter by looking at the Sun’s immediate vicinity. Examining the closest stars gives us a sample of the disk stuff, and we can ask how many stars of each luminosity, mass, com- position, and age are present. Combining this information with theories of stellar evolution, we investigate the star-forming past of the solar neighborhood. In Section 2.2 we venture further afield. Measuring stellar distances allows us to map out the Milky Way’s structure: the thin and thick disks, the metal- poor halo, and the central bulge. Star clusters, where all the members were born together, with the same initial composition, are especially useful; comparing their color–magnitude diagrams with the predictions of stellar models yields the age and composition jointly with the cluster’s distance. We find that the youngest stars belong to the disk, and are relatively rich in elements heavier than helium, whereas the stars of the metal-poor halo are extremely old. Most of the Milky Way’s stars and almost all of its gas lie in the disk, orbiting the center like the planets around the Sun. Section 2.3 deals with the Galaxy’s rotation: how we measure it, and how we use it to find the distribu- tion of gas within the disk. By contrast with motions in the solar system, the rotational speed of material in the furthest part of the disk is nearly the same as that for gas at the Sun’s position. To prevent this distant gas from flying off into intergalactic space, a large amount of mass must be concealed in the outer reaches of the Milky Way, in a form that emits very little light, or none at all: the dark matter . Measured by mass, the Milky Way has only a tenth as much gas as stars; but the gas has profound effects. The densest gas clouds collapse to make new stars; and at the end of its life a star pollutes the gas with dust and heavy elements produced by its nuclear burning. Section 2.4 discusses the complex processes that heat, ionize, and push around the Milky Way’s gas, and how these affect the pace at which stars are born. 58"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"2.1 The solar neighborhood 59 2.1 The solar neighborhood In this section, we consider the closest stars, the Sun’s immediate neighbors. We ask what kinds of stars are present, and in what numbers? How many are on the main sequence, and how many are in the later stages of their lives? How many were formed recently, and how many are very old? To answer these questions, we must first find out how far away the stars are. The distances of astronomical objects are in general extremely difficult to measure, but they are essential for our understanding of their nature. The lumi- nosities of stars and galaxies are always derived by using the inverse-square law (Equation 1.1). We usually find linear dimensions from a measured angular size on the sky and an estimated distance, and our calculations of masses usually depend on those size estimates. Many astronomical disputes come down to an argument over how far away something is; so astronomers have had good rea- son to develop a wide range of inventive and sometimes bizarre techniques for measuring distances. Triangulation, or trigonometric parallax , allows us to measure distances only for the nearest stars. We then compare more distant stars with similar stars close at hand, assuming that stars with similar spectra have the same luminosity and finding the relative distance from their relative apparent brightness. Those distant stars in turn are used to estimate distances to the nearest galaxies, those close enough that we can pick out individual stars. This cosmic distance ladder is then extended to more distant galaxies by comparing them with nearby systems. The relative distances at each stage of comparison are often quite well determined – in astronomy, this means to within a few percent – but the accumulation of errors at each stage can leave extragalactic distances uncertain by as much as a factor of two. Occasionally we are lucky enough to find a way of circumventing some of the lower rungs of the ladder, to measure directly the distance to an object beyond the reach of trigonometric parallax. These opportunities are much prized; we discuss some of them in Section 2.2 below. In general, the relative distances of two stars or galaxies can be found far more accurately than the absolute distance (in meters, or light-years) to either one. The parsec was adopted in 1922 by the International Astronomical Union to specify stellar distances in units of the Earth’s mean distance from the Sun, the astronomical unit . With interplanetary spacecraft, and measurements of the reflection times for light or radio waves bounced from the surfaces of planets, we now know the scale of the solar system to within one part in a million; we retain the parsec for historical reasons. Within the Galaxy, distances are sometimes given in units of R 0 , the Galactocentric radius of the Sun. 2.1.1 Trigonometric parallax Within a few hundred parsecs, we can use trigonometric parallax to find stellar distances.

Trigonometric parallax: in the course of a year, the star appears to move in an ellipse with a major axis of 2 p . stars appear to move relative to more distant objects. In the course of a year, a nearby star traces out an elliptical path against the background of distant stars (Figure 2.1). The angle p is the parallax ; it is always small, so, for a star at distance d ,wehave 1AU d = tan p ≈ p (in radians) . (2.1) One astronomical unit (1 AU) is the Earth’s mean distance from the Sun, about 150 million kilometers or 8.3 light-minutes. The parsec (pc) is defined as the distance d at which a star has a parallax of 1 \u0006\u0006 , one second of arc :1 \u0006\u0006 = 1 / 60 × 1 / 60 of 1 ◦ . One radian is roughly 206 265 \u0006\u0006 , so a parsec is 206 265 AU or about 3.26 light-years. The stars are so distant that none has a parallax even as large as 1 \u0006\u0006 . Proxima Centauri, the nearest star, has p = 0 . 8 \u0006\u0006 , so its distance is 1.3 pc or 4.3 light-years. The European Space Agency’s Hipparcos satellite (1989–93) repeatedly mea- sured the apparent motions across the sky of 120 000 bright stars, to an accuracy of a milli-arcsecond. The Hipparcos database gives us distances, and hence accurate luminosities, for the stars within a few hundred parsecs, as well as their motions through space, and orbits for the binary or multiple stars. For this fabulous sample of stars, the accurate distances allow us to determine many of the basic stellar parameters that we discussed in Section 1.1. Problem 2.1 To determine a star’s trigonometric parallax, we need at least three measurements of its position relative to much more distant objects: why?

If space were transparent, with no dust, it would be easy to find a star’s absolute magnitude by combining a measurement of its parallax with the observed apparent magnitude.

We can easily pick out the main sequence for stars fainter than M V ≈− 4; brighter stars are so rare that none falls within this sphere. The main sequence is quite broad. For stars more luminous than the Sun, this is mainly because the stars are of different ages. For dimmer stars, variations in the metal abundance are more important. The very bright stars at the right are the red giants, which have used up the hydrogen in their central cores. Many stars lie near M V ≈ 1 and B − V ≈ 1; these are red clump stars, burning helium in their cores, and hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Comparing the color of the red clump with the predictions of stellar models shows that the fraction of heavy elements in these stars lies between the solar value and about a third of that level: in the language of Section 1.1, this means − 0 . 5 ∼ < [Fe / H] ∼ < 0. Few of the stars brighter than M V ≈ 2 lie in the triangle between the main sequence and the red stars with B − V ∼ > 0 . 9, corresponding to temperatures T eff ∼ < 5500 K. This nearly empty region is called the Hertzsprung gap . Once their main-sequence life is over, stars more massive than about 2 M \u0005 swell very rapidly to become luminous red stars; they spend very little time at intermediate temperatures. A few stars fall about a magnitude below the main sequence; most of these are metal-poor subdwarfs , which are bluer than stars of the same mass with solar composition. Four dim white dwarfs are seen at the lower left. Very dim stars are hard to find; even within 100 pc, it is likely that more than half of the white dwarfs and the dimmest main-sequence stars have so far escaped our searches. 2.1.2 Luminosity functions and mass functions Most of the stars in Figure 2.2 are more luminous than absolute magnitude M V ≈ 8; but the less luminous stars are in fact more common. The luminosity function \u0010 ( M V ) describes how many stars of each luminosity are present in each pc 3 : \u0010 ( M V ) \b M V is the density of stars with absolute V -magnitude between M V and M V + \b M V . To compute \u0010 ( M V ), we must know the volume of space within which we have observed stars of each luminosity. It is common to select for observation those stars or galaxies that appear brighter than some fixed apparent magnitude. The Hipparcos observing list included almost all the stars with m V ∼ < 8, as well as some that were fainter. A star like the Sun with M V = 4 . 83 might not have been included if its distance modulus had been larger than 8 − 4 . 83 = 3 . 17, corresponding to d ≈ 43 pc. The solid dots in Figure 2.3 show an approximate luminosity function, in one-magnitude bins, calculated by using the formula \u0010 ( x ) = number of stars with M V − 1 / 2 < x < M V + 1 / 2 volume V max ( M V ) over which these could be seen .

The dashed curve gives M \u0010 MS ( M V ), the mass in main-sequence stars. Units are L \u0005 or M \u0005 per 10 pc cube; vertical bars show uncertainty, based on numbers of stars in each bin.

Using Table 1.4 for M V , find d max for an M4 dwarf. Why are you surprised to see such faint stars in Figure 2.2? It is quite difficult to determine the faint end of the luminosity function, since dim stars are hard to find. The bright end of \u0010 ( M V ) also presents problems; because luminous stars are rare, we will not find enough of them unless we survey a volume larger than our 100 pc sphere. But stars are not spread out uniformly in space. For example, their density falls as we go further out of the Milky Way’s disk in the direction of the Galactic poles. So, if we look far afield for luminous stars, the average density in our search region is lower than it is near the Sun’s position. Finally, many stars are in binary systems so close that they are mistaken for a brighter single star. Despite these uncertainties, it is clear that dim stars are overwhelmingly more numerous than bright ones. Figure 2.3 also shows how much of the V -band light is emitted by stars of each luminosity: stars in the range from M V to M V + \b M V contribute an amount L V \u0010 ( M V ) \b M V of the total.

If we had measured our luminosity function at ultraviolet wave- lengths rather than in the V band at 5500 ̊ A, almost all the light would be from O and B stars. The near-infrared light, at a few microns, comes mainly from the luminous red stars. We can use the tables of Section 1.1 to find the bolometric luminosity L bol from the V -band luminosity L V , and then use Table 1.1, or the mass–luminosity relation of Equation 1.6, to calculate the average mass of a main-sequence star at each luminosity. In Figure 2.3, the dashed curve shows the mass in main-sequence stars with absolute magnitude between M V and M V + \b M V . The red giants make a tiny contribution, since they are even less massive than main-sequence stars of the same luminosity. Almost all the mass is in K and M dwarfs, stars so faint that we cannot see them in galaxies beyond the Milky Way and its satellites. The stars that emit most of the light account for hardly any of the mass. The luminosity function of Figure 2.3 corresponds to about 65 stars in each 1000 pc 3 , with a luminosity equivalent to 40 L \u0005 in the V band. About 75% of the light comes from main-sequence stars, which have mass totalling about 30 M \u0005 . The averaged mass-to-light ratio M / L gives a measure of the proportion of mas- sive luminous stars to dim stars. We find M / L V ≈ 1 for the main-sequence stars alone, and M / L V ≈ 0 . 74 for all the stars, when we measure M in solar masses and L V as a fraction of the Sun’s V -band luminosity. Even including white dwarfs and the interstellar gas, the mass-to-light ratio M / L V ∼ < 2 locally. In Section 2.3, we will see that the ratio of mass to light for the Milky Way as a whole is much larger than that for this sample of stars near the Sun. The outer Galaxy contains unseen mass, in a form other than the stars and interstellar gas found near the Sun. Using models of stellar evolution, we can work backward from the present-day stellar population to find how many stars were born with each mass. We define the initial luminosity function , \u0014 ( M V ), such that \u0014 ( M V ) \b M V is the number of stars formed that had absolute magnitude between M V and M V + \b M V when they were on the main sequence. Stars less massive than the Sun have main-sequence lives of 10 Gyr or longer. Counting the numbers of faint white dwarfs indicates that stars have been forming in the local disk only for a time τ gal ≈ 8–10 Gyr, so the first- born K dwarfs have evolved very little. For these low-mass stars, \u0014 ( M V ) is almost the same as the present-day luminosity function \u0010 ( M V ). But O, B, and A stars burn out rapidly, and only those most recently born are still on the main sequence. We can calculate the initial luminosity function if we assume that the disk has been forming stars at a uniform rate throughout its history. If \u0010 MS ( M V )isthe present-day luminosity function for main-sequence stars alone, and a star remains on the main sequence with absolute magnitude M V for a time τ MS ( M V ), then \u0014 ( M V ) = \u0010 MS ( M V ) for τ MS ( M V ) ≥ τ gal , = \u0010 MS ( M V ) × τ gal τ MS ( M V ) when τ MS ( M V ) <τ gal .

Figure 2.4 shows a crude estimate for \u0014 ( M V ) calculated according to this formula, assuming τ gal = 10 Gyr.

What fraction of all the 3 M \u0005 stars are still there? What fraction of all the 0.5 M \u0005 stars? Now suppose that star formation slows with time t as e − t / t , with t = 3 Gyr. Show that now only 1.6% of all 2 M \u0005 stars survive, and merely 0.46% of stars of 3 M \u0005 . For these stars, explain why \u0014 ( M V ) is larger for a given observed \u0010 ( M V ) when starbirth declines with time (the and • points in Figure 2.4 must be further apart) than if it stays constant. How much larger must \u0014 ( M V ) /\u0010 ( M V ) become for stars of 2 M \u0005 ? How would a gradual slowdown change the inferred \u0014 ( M V ) for stars longer-lived than the Sun? For an accelerating rate of starbirth t < 0, in what sense would this affect our estimates of the initial luminosity function \u0014 ( M V )? ( \u0010 ( M V ) is a fairly smooth function, and we have no reason to expect that \u0014 ( M V ) will have a kink or change in slope near the Sun’s luminosity. Together, these imply that star formation locally has not slowed or speeded up by more than a factor of two over the past few gigayears.)"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"66 Mapping our Milky Way 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0.05 0.1 0.5 1 5 10 0 500 1000 1500 Fig. 2.5.

The smooth curve shows the Salpeter initial mass function, the dotted curve is a lognormal function. The dashed line shows mass: stars near 0.25 M \u0005 are most numerous, but those of (1–2) M \u0005 account for most of the cluster’s mass – E. Moreau. We can convert the initial luminosity function \u0014 ( M ) into an initial mass function : ξ ( M ) \b M is the number of stars that have been born with masses between M and M + \b M . Near the Sun, a good approximation for stars more massive than ∼ 0 . 5 M \u0005 is ξ ( M ) \b M = ξ 0 ( M / M \u0005 ) − 2 . 35 ( \b M / M \u0005 ) , (2.5) where the constant ξ 0 sets the local stellar density; this is called the Salpeter initial mass function. Figure 2.5 shows the observed numbers of stars at each mass in the Pleiades cluster, shown in Figure 2.11 below. This cluster is only 100 Myr old, so for masses below 5 M \u0005 the initial mass function is identical to what we observe at the present day. The Salpeter function overestimates the number of stars with masses below 0 . 5 M \u0005 , but otherwise it gives a good description. Observations in very different parts of our Galaxy and the nearby Magellanic Clouds show that ξ ( M ) is surprisingly uniform, from dense stellar clusters to diffuse associations of stars. If we understood better how stars form, we might be able to predict the initial mass function.

Taking M u = 10 M \u0005 (see Figure 2.5), show that the few stars with M > 5 M \u0005 should contribute over 80% of the light. Why do we see so few stars in Figure 2.11 compared with the number in Figure 2.13? 2.2 The stars in the Galaxy Most stars do not have measurable parallaxes, which tells us that the Galaxy is much larger than 500 pc across. To estimate distances of stars further away, we rely on the cosmic distance ladder; we measure their distances relative to stars that are close enough to show parallaxes. Occasionally we can use information from velocities to obtain distances without this intermediate step. In this section, we first explore some of these opportunities, then discuss the distribution of stars and star clusters in the Milky Way, which reveals its basic structure. Our position in the Galactic disk gives us a unique and detailed three-dimensional view of one spiral galaxy. 2.2.1 Distances from motions Radial velocities V r , toward or away from an observer, are measured using the Doppler shift of emission or absorption lines in the spectra of stars or gas (Equa- tion 1.19). Tangential velocities V t are found from the angular rate at which a star appears to move across the sky: this proper motion μ is so small that it is often measured in milli-arcseconds per year. The tangential velocity is the product of distance and proper motion: V t = μ (radians/time) × d , or μ (0 . 001 \u0006\u0006 /year) = V t (kms − 1 ) 4 . 74 × d (kpc) . (2.6) If we know how V r and V t are related for a particular object, then, by measuring V r and the proper motion, we can find its distance. Our current best estimate of the Milky Way’s size comes from the proper motions of stars around a very massive black hole that is believed to mark the exact center. The stellar orbits are shown in Figure 2.17. The problem below shows how observations of their position and velocity yield not only the mass M BH of the black hole, but also its distance: the Sun is 7 . 6 ± 0 . 3 kpc from the Galactic center. Problem 2.6 Using an 8-meter telescope to observe the Galactic center regularly over two decades, you notice that one star moves back and forth across the sky in a straight line: its orbit is edge-on.

V r , and find that this repeats exactly each time the star is at the same point in the sky. You are in luck: the furthest points of the star’s motion on the sky are also when it is closest to the black hole (pericenter) and furthest from it (apocenter), as in Figure 2.6. You measure the separation s of these two points on the sky, and the orbital period P . Assuming that the black hole provides almost all the gravitational force, follow these steps to find both the mass M BH of the black hole and its distance d from us. From the definition below Equation 2.1, show that the orbit’s semi-major axis a = 0 . 5AU × ( s / 1 \u0006\u0006 )( d / 1 pc). You observe s = 0 . 248 \u0006\u0006 : what would a be at a distance of 8 kpc? At the two extremes of its motion across the sky, the star’s radial velocity is V a = 473 km s − 1 and V p = 7 326 km s − 1 : at which point is it closest to the black hole? The orbit’s eccentricity is e ; explain why the conservation of angular momentum requires that V p (1 − e ) = V a (1 + e ), and show that, here, e = 0 . 876. At distance r from the black hole moving at speed V , the star has kinetic energy KE = m V 2 / 2 and potential energy PE =− Gm M BH / r .

The ‘light echo’ from a gas ring around supernova 1987a is seen by an observer to the right of the figure. In February 1987, a supernova was seen to explode in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Shortly afterward, narrow emission lines of highly ionized carbon, nitrogen and oxygen appeared in the spectrum; the lines were so narrow that they must have come from cool gas, surrounding the star. When the supernova faded, an ellipse of glowing gas was seen around it. This is probably a circular ring of material, thrown off in the plane of the star’s equator during the red-giant phase, which is tipped so as to appear elliptical (Figure 2.7). The narrow emission lines started to become bright only about 85 days after the supernova had exploded. So it must have taken 85 days longer for light to reach the nearer edge of the ring and to ionize the gas, and then for the gas emission to reach us, than for light to come to us directly from the explosion. From this, we can find the radius of the ring in light-days; see Problem 2.7 below. Together with its mea- sured size in arcseconds, this gives us a distance to the LMC between 50 kpc and 53 kpc. Information from two spacecraft observatories was used to make this mea- surement: the gas emission lines were at ultraviolet wavelengths that cannot pene- trate the Earth’s atmosphere, and the ring was so small that its image in a ground- based telescope would have been too badly blurred by atmospheric turbulence. Problem 2.7 The ring around supernova 1987a measures about 1 . 62 \u0006\u0006 × 1 . 10 \u0006\u0006 across on the sky; if its true shape is circular, show that the ring is inclined at i ≈ 43 ◦ to face-on. If the ring radius is R , use Figure 2.7 to explain why light travelling first to the point A and then to us is delayed by a time t − = R (1 − sin i ) / c relative to light coming straight to us from the supernova. Thus we see a light echo .If t + is the time delay for light reaching us by way of point B, show that R = c ( t − + t + ) / 2. The measured values are t − = 83 days, t + = 395 days: find the radius R in light-days, and hence the distance d to the supernova. At its brightest, the supernova had apparent magnitude m V ≈ 3; show that its luminosity was L V ≈ 1 . 4 × 10 8 L \u0005 . (Most Type II supernovae are even more luminous.) 2.2.2 Spectroscopic parallax: the vertical structure of the disk As we discussed in Section 1.1, the width and depth of lines in a star’s spectrum depend on its luminosity. We can use this fact as the basis of a technique for finding"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"70 Mapping our Milky Way stellar distances. For example, a star with the spectrum of an F2 main-sequence star is roughly as luminous as other F2 dwarfs with about the same chemical composition. If we can measure a parallax for one of these, then Equation 2.1 tells us its distance, and hence its luminosity and that of all similar F2 stars. So if we then measure our more distant star’s apparent brightness and can compensate for the dimming caused by interstellar dust, Equation 1.1 will tell us its distance. This method is called spectroscopic parallax because it should give the same information as that we gain by measuring the trigonometric parallax: namely, the star’s distance. Spectroscopic parallax works well for some types of star and poorly for others. The luminosities of main-sequence stars can often be found to within 10%, leading to 5% uncertainties in their distance. But in K giants, the temperature in the atmosphere is almost the same, no matter what the luminosity; the giant branch is almost vertical in Figure 1.4. The best we can hope for is to determine the luminosity to within 0.5 in the absolute magnitude, and hence the distance to 25%. Taking high-quality spectra for many faint stars demands long hours of obser- vation on large telescopes. A ‘poor man’s variant’ is to estimate the spectral type of a star from its color, and to rely on other indications to establish whether it is a dwarf or a giant. This method of photometric parallax can be reason- ably successful if the measured color changes substantially with the luminosity of the observed stars, and if we can correct for the effects of interstellar dust. Results are best when we observe a cluster of stars; with measurements of many stars, we can estimate both the cluster’s distance and the reddening caused by dust. When we look out perpendicular to the Galactic disk and select the sharp stellar images from among the fuzzy shapes of distant galaxies, almost all the red stars fainter than apparent magnitude m V ≈ 14 are K and M dwarfs. (At a distance of 1 kpc, what would be the apparent magnitude ofaKorMgiant with M V ≈ 0?) There is little dust in this direction to dim and redden the stars, so the V − I color should be a good indication of the spectral type. The stellar densities in Figure 2.8 were compiled using photometric distances determined by measuring the V − I colors of 12 500 stars with apparent magnitude m V < 19 in the direction of the south Galactic pole. The late G and early K dwarfs are bluer than red giants, and there are very few giant stars of the same color to mislead us. Using the Galaxy-centred spherical polar coordinates R ,φ, z of Figure 1.10, we often approximate the density n ( R , z , S ) of stars of a particular type S by a double-exponential form n ( R , z , S ) = n (0 , 0 , S )exp[ − R / h R ( S )]exp[ −| z | / h z ( S )] , (2.8) where h R is called the scale length of the disk and h z is the scale height .

Sloping dashed lines show n ( z ) ∝ exp( − z / 300 pc) (thin disk) and n ( z ) ∝ exp( − z / 1 kpc) (thick disk); the solid curve is their sum. At z ∼ > 2 kpc, most stars belong to the metal-poor halo. A dwarfs (star symbols) lie in a very thin layer – N. Reid and J. Knude. Gas in the disk, and the dust that is mixed with it, is confined to an even thinner layer. Near the Sun, h z < 150 pc for most of the neutral hydrogen gas, and no more than 60–70 pc for the cold clouds of molecular gas from which stars are born. Table 2.1 lists values of the scale height h z for various types of stars and for gas; these are only approximate, since the density does not exactly follow Equation 2.8. The scale length is probably in the range 2 . 5 kpc ∼ < h R ∼ < 4 . 5 kpc.

If stars are produced with the same initial mass function that we measure locally, roughly half of their material is returned to the interstellar gas as they age. So, to build the disk over 10 Gyr, the Milky Way must produce (3 − 5) M \u0005 of new stars each year. We will see in Section 2.4 that there is (5 − 10) × 10 9 M \u0005 of cool gas in the disk – so this rate of starbirth can be sustained for at least a few gigayears. Even if we cannot measure enough stars to find their distribution in space, we can still use the volume V max of Equation 2.3 to test whether they are uniformly spread: this is the V / V max test. Suppose that we choose a sample of stars by some well-determined rule (e.g., all brighter than a given apparent magnitude), and find their distance d and absolute magnitude M V (equivalently, the luminosity L V ). For each one, we find the largest distance d max and volume V max to which we could have included it in our sample, and compare that with V ( < d ), the volume closer to us than the star. If the stars are equally common everywhere, then on average V ( < d ) = V max / 2: the star is equally likely to be in the nearer or the further half of the volume V max .

Historically, this test was used to show that quasars were either more luminous or more common in the past. The older stars have larger scale heights because the Galactic disk is lumpy. As they orbit, the stars feel the gravitational force of giant clouds of molecular gas, which can have masses up to 10 7 M \u0005 , and clumps of stars and gas in the spiral arms. Over time, their orbits are disturbed by random pulls from these concentrations of matter, which increase both their in-and-out motion in radius and their vertical speed. Figure 2.9 shows velocities perpendicular to the Galactic disk for nearby F stars; clearly, older stars are more likely to be fast moving. In Table 2.1, we give the velocity dispersion σ z for different groups of stars. This quantity measures the spread of vertical velocities v z : σ 2 z ≡ \u000f v 2 z − v z \u000b 2 \u0010 , (2.9) where the angle-brackets denote an average over all the stars. For the F stars of Figure 2.9, we see that σ z increases steadily with the age of the stars. Groups"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"74 Mapping our Milky Way of stars that live for only a short time never attain a large velocity dispersion. Main-sequence A stars live no more than a gigayear; for them, σ z is only a few kilometers per second, whereas the average for G dwarfs like our 5 Gyr-old Sun is about 30 km s − 1 . Table 2.1 also gives velocity dispersions in the disk plane: as shown in Figure 1.10, σ x = σ R is measured radially outward from the Galactic center, and σ y = σ φ refers to motion in the direction of the disk’s rotation. Older stars of a given spectral type have both higher speeds in the vertical direction and larger random motions in the plane of the disk than younger stars. The more rapid the stars’ vertical motion, the more time they spend further from the midplane of the disk; accordingly, the scale height h z is larger. Generally, σ R ∼ > σ φ ∼ > σ z . The velocity v y \u000b gives the asymmetric drift , the speed relative to a circular orbit in the disk at the Sun’s position. It is systematically negative. Groups of stars with larger velocity dispersion lag most strongly: we will see why in Section 3.3. The stars within about 400 pc of the midplane belong mainly to the thin disk of the Galaxy. At greater heights, Figure 2.8 shows that the density of K dwarfs does not decrease as fast as predicted by Equation 2.8; these ‘extra’ stars belong to the thick disk . The density of the thick disk is often described by Equation 2.8, with h z ≈ 1 kpc, but the true vertical distribution is not very well known. (In fact, the problem of finding scale heights for both the thin and the thick disk simultaneously from a single measured run of n ( z )is ill posed : small errors or random variations in n ( z ) cause huge changes in the values of h z that we infer.) Stars of the thick disk make up 10% of the total near the Sun at z ≈ 0, and the number of thick-disk stars per square parsec is only 30% of that of stars in the thin disk. Unlike the thin disk, which is still forming stars, the thick disk includes no O, B, or A stars, so it must be older than about 3 Gyr. Because the luminous young stars are absent, the thick disk will have a higher mass-to-light ratio M / L than the thin disk. Thus its contribution to the luminosity will be somewhat below 30%. Problem 2.10 Thin-disk stars make up 90% of the total in the midplane while 10% belong to the thick disk, but h z for the thin disk is roughly three times smaller than for the thick disk. Starting from Equation 2.8, show that the sur- face density of stars per square parsec follows \u0017 ( R , thin disk) ≈ 3 \u0017 ( R , thick disk). Most stars in the thin disk have heavy-element abundances between the solar level and about half-solar, though some are more metal-poor. The spectra of thick- disk stars generally show a smaller fraction of heavy elements, with most having Z \u0005 / 10 ∼ < Z ∼ < Z \u0005 / 2. When we see stars with ages and compositions char- acteristic of the thick disk near the Sun, they have rapid vertical motions, with σ z ∼ > 40 km s − 1 , so they have enough energy to travel a kiloparsec or more above the midplane."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"2.2 The stars in the Galaxy 75 Fig. 2.10. Short-lived bright stars with M V < 3, at distances 100 pc < d < 500 pc from the Sun, taken from the Hipparcos catalogue. Most of these B and A stars lie in a plane tilted by about 20 ◦ to the midplane of the disk. Our present thick disk may be the remains of an early thin disk in the young Milky Way. If a small satellite galaxy had collided with our Milky Way and merged into it, the disk would have been shaken up, and the energy of the impact largely transferred into increased random motions of the stars. The gas would have fallen to the midplane of the disk; stars which later formed from it would make up the thin disk that we observe today. Disk stars are born in clusters and associations, where a gas cloud has come together that is large enough to collapse under its own gravity. The Sun lies inside a partial ring or disk of young stars known as Gould’s Belt. Within 500 pc, stars younger than about 30 Myr are not found in the plane of the disk, but rather in a layer tilted by 20 ◦ about a line roughly along the Sun’s orbit at l = 90 ◦ , with stars nearer to the Galactic center lying above the midplane (Figure 2.10). Clouds of hydrogen gas form a similarly tilted ring, which is expanding outward at 1–2 km s − 1 from a point about 150 pc away from us. By the time the Sun has made a few orbits of the Galaxy, the stars of Gould’s Belt will have dispersed into the disk. But measuring their velocities will show that they follow very similar orbits; such a collection of stars is called a ‘moving group’. Problem 2.11 Here you make a numerical model describing both the distribution of stars and the way we observe them, to explore the Malmquist bias. If we observe stars down to a fixed apparent brightness, we do not get a fair mixture of all the stars in the sky, but we include more of the most luminous stars.

(c) Metal-poor main-sequence stars are bluer for a given luminosity, so they must be fainter at a particular spectral type; if the star’s fraction by weight of heavy elements is Z , then \b M V ≈− 0 . 87 log 10 ( Z / Z \u0005 ). For each of your stars, roll the die again, note the number N 2 , set Z / Z \u0005 = ( N 2 + 0 . 5) / 6 and change its absolute magnitude from part (a) by \b M V . Observe them again with the same telescope. For your sample of stars, calculate the average Z of those that fall in regions B and C. Are these more or less metal-rich than all the stars that you placed in your sky? (Errors in measurement have the same kind of effect as a spread in the true luminosity of a class of stars or galaxies. You can make corrections if you know what your measurement errors are; but most people are too optimistic and underestimate their errors!) 2.2.3 Distances to star clusters If we can observe not just a single star, but an entire cluster of stars that are all at the same distance and that were formed together out of the same gaseous raw material, we can make a much more accurate estimate of the distance. The Pleiades cluster, shown in Figure 2.11, contains about 700 stars that appear brighter than m V = 17. The color–magnitude diagram of Figure 2.12 shows that most of the stars are still on the main sequence, but those brighter than m V ≈ 5, that can be seen without a telescope or binoculars, have left it to become blue giants. The main sequence is much narrower than it is in Figure 2.2, because all the stars are the same age and have the same abundance of heavy elements. Stars with the lowest masses have not yet reached the main sequence, and some of them are still"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"2.2 The stars in the Galaxy 77 Fig. 2.11.

Most of the stars lie very close to the isochrone, but almost a third of the stars in the cluster’s central region are in binary or multiple star systems that are so close that the stars appear as one brighter object; these points fall above the isochrone curve. Stars just now leaving the main sequence have spectral type B8 and a mass M ≈ 5 M \u0005 . The dashed line shows an isochrone for a much younger cluster, only 16 Myr old; at that time, even stars of 10 M \u0005 would still have been on the main sequence. To determine the distance and the age of a cluster by this method, we must take account of interstellar dust, which scatters light from the stars and makes them appear dimmer. Because blue light is more strongly scattered, the stars appear redder as well as dimmer. If we did not allow for the effects of dust, the isochrone would appear as the dotted line, which is clearly too blue at m V ≈ 5tofitthe observations. Similarly, if we had computed our isochrone for stars with much less than the solar metal abundance, it would not have been a good fit to the observed brightness and colors. Open clusters such as the Pleiades can contain up to several hundred stars, bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction. Table 2.2 shows that cluster luminosities generally fall in the range 100 L \u0005 to 30 000 L \u0005 . The central density can be as high as 100 L \u0005 pc − 3 but is frequently less; the core radius , where the surface brightness falls to half its central value, is typically a few parsecs. The stars have small random speeds, below 1 km s − 1 . The mass-to-light ratio is generally below unity; it increases with the cluster’s age as the luminous massive stars die. This ratio is hard to determine, because the diffuse outskirts of the cluster contain disproportionately many of the dim stars that contribute most of the cluster’s mass, but little of its light. We will see in Section 3.2 how this mass segregation can develop. Open clusters are quite often surrounded by gas and dust, and they always lie close to the plane of the disk.

Only ∼ 1% of its visible light can reach us, so we must study it in the infrared. In other galaxies, we see open clusters in the spiral arms. Unfortunately we cannot see most of the Milky Way’s open clusters, because visible light does not travel well through the dust in the disk. We can make a fairly complete map of the clusters only within about 5 kpc of the Sun. Only about 5% of the 1200 or so known open clusters are more than 1 Gyr old, and most have ages less than 300 Myr; the nearby Hyades cluster is about 600 Myr old. Because most of a cluster’s light comes from its brightest stars, the color of its total or integrated light gives us a rough estimate of its age. For example, the Pleiades cluster has B − V =− 0 . 05, close to the color of its most luminous stars that are still on the main sequence; see Table 1.4. As the massive stars die, and more of the cluster’s light comes from red giants, its color becomes redder. We can use observations of nearby clusters, and the theory of stellar evolution, to relate a cluster’s color to its age and metal abundance. When we observe star clusters in other galaxies, generally we measure only the integrated light. Comparing a cluster’s color with clusters in the Milky Way gives us an estimate of its age and the composition of its stars. Outside Gould’s Belt, most of the known open clusters younger than 300 Myr lie within 50 pc of the Galactic midplane. The older clusters, like the old stars of the thin disk, have a larger scale height, h z ≈ 375 pc. Clusters older than a gigayear are found mainly in the outer Galaxy, beyond the Sun’s orbit, where the gravitational forces are weaker. They are also relatively well populated and compact. Younger clusters are scattered more uniformly in Galactocentric radius; many have larger sizes or fewer members, and so are more fragile and prone to fall apart. Since the gravitational attraction of open clusters does not bind them together very strongly, they tend to be pulled apart as they pass through the spiral arms of the disk, and also to dissolve because of the gravitational pull of the cluster stars on each other. The old clusters that we see today are probably the robust survivors of a much larger population. NGC 3603 is a very young and massive cluster; in the central parsec are several O3 stars, each with L ∼ 30 000 L \u0005 . The stars are no more than 5 Myr old, and may be younger. Because its most massive stars are still shining, it is hugely more luminous than the other clusters in Table 2.2. It is a smaller version of the super-star-clusters formed in starburst galaxies. Here, starbirth is so vigorous that it will consume the galaxy’s supply of cool gas within ∼ 300 Myr. (Recall from Section 2.2 that the Milky Way will not run out of gas for at least 2–3 Gyr.) We will discuss starbursts further in Section 7.1. Since elements heavier than helium are produced in the interiors of stars, they become more abundant as the Universe ages. Figure 2.9 showed that F stars older than 10 Gyr are much more likely to be iron-poor than are the younger stars. So we might expect that old open clusters, which formed earlier in the life of the Milky Way, should have lower metal abundances than the younger clusters. Surprisingly, this is not so; the old cluster NGC 6791 is as metal-rich as the Sun."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"80 Mapping our Milky Way Table 2.3 Some globular clusters in the Milky Way, and one belonging to the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy dM V L V r c r t σ r Cluster (kpc) [Fe/H] ( mag )( 10 3 L \u0005 ) (pc) (pc) (km s − 1 ) NGC 5139 ω Cen 5.2 − 1 . 6 a − 10 . 2 1100 4 70 20 NGC 104 47 Tuc 4.5 − 0 . 71 − 9 . 5 500 0.5 50 11 NGC 7078 M15 10.8 − 2 . 15 − 9 . 3 440 < 0 . 01 b 85 12 NGC 6341 M92 8.5 − 2 . 15 − 8 . 3 180 0.5 35 5 NGC 7099 M30 9.1 − 2 . 13 − 7 . 695 < 0 . 1 b 45 5 NGC 6121 M4 1.73 − 1 . 2 − 7 . 2 60 0.5 25 4 Pal 13 24.3 − 1 . 9 − 3 . 8 3 0.5 > 50 0.6–0.9 NGC 1049 Fornax 3 140 − 2 . 0 − 7 . 8 100 1.6 > 50 9 Note : d is distance from the Sun; [Fe/H] = log 10 ( Z / Z \u0005 ); r c is the core radius, r t is the tidal or truncation radius; and σ r is the dispersion in the radial velocity V r of stars in the central region. a 20%–30% of the stars of ω Centauri’s core are more metal-rich. b A collapsed core : see Section 3.2. There is considerable scatter in the chemical composition of open clusters at all ages. The buildup of metals in the Galaxy must have proceeded quite unevenly: some regions even recently were relatively poor in these elements. Open clusters further from the Galactic center are more likely to be metal-poor; the outer Milky Way seems to be enriching itself more slowly than the inner parts. The globular clusters are very different from open clusters; they contain far more stars, much more tightly packed. The brightest of the Milky Way’s 150 or so known globulars is ω Centauri; with L ≈ 10 6 L \u0005 it contains about a million stars. In Figure 2.13 we see 47 Tucanae, another luminous cluster; Table 2.3 shows that dimmer clusters range down to 10 4 L \u0005 . The stellar density is roughly constant inside the core radius: r c ≈ 5 pc. The stars of globular clusters have higher random speeds σ r than those of stars in the open clusters of Table 2.2. Globular clusters around Fornax, a small nearby dwarf galaxy, are very similar to those in the Milky Way. At some outer radius r t , usually beyond 30 pc, the density of stars drops sharply toward zero. This is the tidal radius or truncation radius. Stars beyond this point are so loosely bound to the cluster that they can be swept away by the ‘tidal’ gravitational force of the Milky Way as the cluster orbits around it. We will study this process further in Section 4.1. None of the Milky Way’s globular clusters is younger than several gigayears, and most are much older. The two color–magnitude diagrams of Figure 2.14 show no young stars at all. The globular cluster 47 Tucanae is more than 10 Gyr old. Its stars have only 15% of the solar abundance of metals, so the main sequence ends with stars a little bluer and more luminous than the Sun. As in the Pleiades, the main sequence is very narrow because all the stars are the same age and have the same composition. Brighter stars fall on a narrow red giant branch, or on the hor- izontal branch with M V ≈ 0.

The luminous globular cluster 47 Tucanae – Southern African Large Telescope. in Figure 2.2, horizontal branch stars burn helium in their cores and hydrogen in a surrounding shell. The stars of the most metal-poor clusters appear to be 12–15 Gyr old. Even taking account of likely observational errors, and uncer- tainties in the theory of stellar evolution, their ages are unlikely to be less than 11–12 Gyr. This is close to the estimate t H for the age of the Universe given by Equation 1.31. Why has the Milky Way ceased production of globular clusters, when it con- tinues to make open clusters? We will see in Problem 3.14 that star formation must be more efficient in globular clusters than it normally is today, to allow them to remain dense. As the galaxies were assembled, extremely high gas density and pressure may have produced denser and more massive star clusters than can form today, scaled-up versions of the open cluster NGC 3603, that could survive as today’s globular clusters. Globular clusters are lacking in heavy elements. The stars of metal-rich glob- ulars have 1 / 3to1 / 10 of the solar metallicity, while metal-poor clusters contain as little as 1 / 300 of the Sun’s proportion of these elements. The color–magnitude diagram gives a clue about the cluster’s abundance. In a metal-poor globular clus- ter, the horizontal branch can lie well to the blue of the red giant branch. It shifts redward in younger clusters and those richer in metals. Horizontal branch stars of the metal-poor cluster M92 are as blue as spectral type A0 ( B − V = 0), while in 47 Tucanae they are about as red as the Sun, with B − V ≈ 0 . 6 (Figure 2.14).

RR Lyrae stars all have about the same luminosity, L ≈ 50 L \u0005 ; so, if we can measure their apparent brightness, Equation 1.1 gives the distance. Unlike open clusters, most globular clusters are high above the midplane, so they are not hidden from us in the dusty disk. We see many more globular clusters when we look toward the Galactic center than we do in the anticenter direction, showing that the Sun lies several kiloparsecs out in the disk. Figure 2.15 shows that metal-rich globulars are more numerous in the inner Galaxy and closer to the midplane; they may have been formed together with the bulge and thick disk. The metal-poor clusters form a rough sphere around the center of the Galaxy. Among them, red horizontal branches may be a sign of relative youth. Those are less concentrated toward the Galaxy center than are the clusters with blue horizontal branches. We can measure the radial velocities of stars in globular clusters from the Doppler shift of absorption lines in their spectra. These tell us that the most metal-poor globular clusters do not follow circular orbits. They plunge deep into the Galaxy, but spend most of their time at large distances. The orbits of halo clusters are oriented almost randomly, so the cluster system as a whole does not rotate about the Galactic center like the disk. The system of metal-rich globular clusters does rotate; the clusters follow orbits much like those of stars in the thick disk."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"84 Mapping our Milky Way Stars are made from dense gas clouds: so we might expect the Milky Way’s oldest stars to be in its dense center. Instead, they are in the halo globular clusters, its most extended component. How did this happen? Our Milky Way, like other sizable galaxies, is a cannibal: it has eaten its closest neighbors and satellites. We will see in Section 7.1 how gravity slows the motion of two galaxies that come close; if the effect is strong enough they spiral in toward each other and merge. The Sagittarius dwarf (see Section 4.1), our closest satellite galaxy, is partially digested and falling apart. A half-dozen metal-poor globular clusters follow orbits so similar to it that they almost certainly belonged to this dwarf, but are now part of the Milky Way’s halo. The globular cluster ω Centauri contains stars with differing metal abundances, unlike a true star cluster. Perhaps it is all that remains of a dense dwarf galaxy after its outer stars were torn away. The Magellanic Clouds will share the Sagittarius dwarf’s fate within 3–5 Gyr. Some astronomers believe that the ‘blue’ metal-poor clusters in Figure 2.15 joined the Milky Way when it swallowed their parent galaxies. The metal-poor halo of the Milky Way consists of the halo globular clusters, and roughly 100 times more individual metal-poor stars, some with less than 10 − 5 of the Sun’s abundance. Locally, only one star in a thousand belongs to the metal-poor halo. They follow orbits similar to those of metal-poor globulars, and so are moving very fast relative to the Sun. We can pick out a few nearby halo stars by their unusually high proper motions. The blue horizontal branch stars, distinctive variable stars such as the RR Lyrae, and red giants stand out clearly from among the more numerous foreground disk stars. Metal-poor globular clusters and stars of the metal-poor halo have been found as far as 100 kpc from the Galactic center. Most halo stars seem to be as old as the metal-poor globular clusters. As with open clusters, the globular clusters that we see today are the few survivors of a larger population. Some halo stars must be the remains of globular clusters that dissolved or were torn apart by the Milky Way’s gravity (see Sections 3.2 and 4.1). The globular cluster Palomar 5 has probably lost 90% of its stars; two spectacular stellar tails extend away from it more than 10 ◦ across the sky. Many globular clusters in the far reaches of the Milky Way, like Palomar 13 in Table 2.3, have relatively few members. If clusters like this had been formed closer to the Galactic center, they would have been torn apart long ago. The metal-poor halo also contains various ‘moving groups’ of stars that follow a common orbit, and are probably the remains of captured satellite systems. A stream of carbon stars and M giants apparently stripped from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stretches around the sky. The most useful approach to mapping the metal-poor halo has been to guess at the luminosity function and the density of stars in the disk, bulge, and halo, and then use Monte Carlo techniques to calculate how many stars of each spec- tral type one expects to see in a particular area of the sky with a given apparent brightness.

Figure 2.16 shows the number of stars per square degree at the north Galactic pole at apparent brightness 19 < m V < 20, compared with the predictions of a model in which 0.15% of the stars near the Sun belong to the metal-poor halo, and the density of halo stars drops with radius approxi- mately as r − 3 . Almost all the blue stars in this brightness range are halo stars, while nearly all the red ones are in the thin disk (see the following problem), so we can separate the various components.

Problem 2.12 The range in apparent magnitude for Figure 2.16 was chosen to separate stars of the thin disk cleanly from those in the halo.

We see in Table 2.1 that for the halo stars the tangential drift velocity v y \u000b is almost equal to the Sun’s rotation speed around the Galactic center; the halo has little or no rotation of its own. The outer halo seems to be rounder than the inner part. Table 2.1 shows that outer-halo stars move slower in the radial direction than they do tangentially: σ R <σ θ,φ . These stars do not plunge deep into the Galaxy; their radial speeds are low, just as we would expect if they had been torn from a satellite spiralling into the Milky Wa y. 2.2.4 An infrared view: the bulge and nucleus Studies of the Galactic disk have always been hampered by interstellar dust. By scattering and absorbing at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, the dust denies us a clear view of distant stars in the disk. By comparing the numbers of stars in different parts of the sky, William Herschel was able to show in 1800 that the Milky Way is a disk. But since he saw roughly the same number of stars in every direction within the disk, he erroneously concluded that the Sun must be near the center of the Galaxy. In fact, dust in the disk hid most of the stars. The best way to map the Milky Way’s central bulge is to use infrared light, which travels more freely than visible light through the dusty disk. These obser- vations indicate that, both for the thin and for the thick disk, the scale length h R of Equation 2.8 probably lies in the range 2 . 5 kpc < h R < 4 . 5 kpc. Beyond a radius R max ≈ 15 kpc, the density of disk stars appears to drop rapidly toward zero. We will find in Section 5.1 that an ‘edge’ of this kind is also seen in the stellar disks of some other galaxies. The near-infrared image on the front cover of this book shows the Milky Way as seen at wavelengths of 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , and 3 . 5 μ m. We clearly see a flattened central bulge, which accounts for roughly 20% of the Galaxy’s total light; most of that comes from within ∼ 1 kpc of the center. The bulge appears pear-shaped, larger on one side than the other. It is probably a central bar , extending 3–4 kpc from the center; the end at l > 0 appears larger because it is closer to us. In Hubble’s classification, the Milky Way is probably an Sbc or Sc galaxy. It is not so strongly barred as to be an SBbc or SBc, although some astronomers might place it in a category intermediate between barred and unbarred spirals, labelled SAB. The density of the stellar halo rises toward the Galactic center, and it is natural to wonder whether the galactic bulge is just the dense inner portion of the halo. It is not. Although the bulge stars are several gigayears old, they are not metal-poor like the halo. The average metal fraction is at least half of the solar value, and some stars have up to three times the solar abundance of heavy"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"2.2 The stars in the Galaxy 87 elements. The bulge is more flattened than the inner halo, and the bulge stars circle the Galactic center in the same direction as the disk does. The averaged rotation speed in the bulge is about 100 km s − 1 , somewhat slower than in the disk; the bulge stars have larger random motions. In Section 4.3 below, we will dis- cuss how the bulge, halo, and disk of the Milky Way might have been formed as they are. Very close to the Galactic center, we find dense gas and young stars. About 150 pc away, near-infrared observations reveal a huge dense star cluster, Sagittarius B2, which is making stars at a furious rate. Then, 30–50 pc from the center, the Quintuplet and Arches clusters are each more luminous than 10 6 L \u0005 , containing several very massive stars. At the heart of the Galaxy is a torus of hot dense molecular clouds, about 2 pc in radius with 10 6 M \u0005 of gas. It surrounds the Milky Way’s stellar nucleus , an extraordinary concentration of stars. At optical wavelengths the nucleus is invisible, because surrounding dust absorbs and scatters the light; in the V band, it is dimmed by 31 magnitudes! It is best seen in the near-infrared, at λ ∼ 5 − 7 μ m; at longer wavelengths the warmed dust radiates strongly, overwhelming the starlight. In mass and size, the stellar nucleus is not so different from a massive globular cluster, with 3 × 10 7 M \u0005 of stars within a central cusp of radius 10 \u0006\u0006 or 0.2 pc. The density of stars reaches 3 × 10 7 M \u0005 pc − 3 within 1 \u0006\u0006 from the center. But, unlike in globular clusters, at least 30 massive stars have formed here over the last 2–7 million years. Star-cluster nuclei are common in giant spiral galaxies; they are by far the densest regions of these systems. Unlike true star clusters, they contain stars with a range of ages and composition. The innermost young stars are less than 0.05 pc from the Milky Way’s central radio source. Figure 2.17 shows some of their orbits, calculated from the observed radial velocities and proper motions. These stars follow almost the same Keplerian motion as the planets in the solar system, and we saw in Problem 2.6 how to use them to measure the mass of the central compact object. This is almost certainly a black hole: we cannot otherwise understand how 4 × 10 6 M \u0005 can fit into such a small volume. Radio maps of the inner region show narrow filaments, tens of parsecs long but only a fraction of a parsec wide, reaching up out of the Galactic plane. They are highly polarized, which tells us that this is synchrotron emission; the radiating electrons are probably held inside the filaments by magnetic fields.

Sagittarius A may be a small version of the spectacular nuclear radio and X-ray sources found in active galactic nuclei, which we will discuss in Section 9.1. If so, it is a very weak example.

Galactic rotation: stars closer to the Galactic center (GC) pull ahead of us in their orbits, while those further out are left behind. A star at the same Galactocentric radius moves sideways relative to us. Further reading: F. Melia, 2003, The Black Hole at the Center of our Galaxy (Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey) is written for the general reader. 2.3 Galactic rotation To a good approximation, the stars and gas in the disk of our Milky Way move in near-circular paths about the Galactic center. We can take advantage of this orderly motion to map out the distribution of galactic gas, from its measured velocities in each direction. From the observed speeds, we can calculate how much inward force is needed to keep the gas of the outer Galaxy in its orbit; it turns out to be far more than expected. Additional mass, the dark matter , is required in addition to that of the luminous stars and gas. Stars closer to the Galactic center complete their orbits in less time than do those further out. This differential rotation was first discovered by considering the proper motions of nearby stars. Looking inward, we see stars passing us in their orbits; their motion relative to us is in the same direction as the Sun’s orbital velocity V 0 . Looking outward, we see stars falling behind us, so they have proper motions in the opposite direction (Figure 2.18). Stars at the same Galactocentric radius orbit at the same rate as the Sun, so they maintain a fixed distance and have a ‘sideways’ motion. So, for stars close to the Sun, the proper motion μ has a component that varies with Galactic longitude l as μ ∝ cos(2 l ). This pattern had been noticed already by 1900; Dutch astronomer Jan Oort explained it in 1927 as an effect of Galactic rotation. By the 1920s, photographic plates had become more sensitive, and could record stellar spectra well enough to determine radial velocities accurately; these are now more useful for measuring differential rotation in the Galaxy."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"90 Mapping our Milky Way Fig. 2.19. Galactic rotation: a star or gas cloud at P with longitude l and Galactocentric radius R , at distance d from the Sun, orbits with speed V ( R ). The line of sight to P is closest to the Galactic center at the tangent point T. The Sun does not lie exactly in the Galactic midplane, but about 15 pc above it, and its path around the Galactic center is not precisely circular. The local standard of rest is defined as the average motion of stars near the Sun, after correcting for the asymmetric drift v y \u000b of Table 2.1. Relative to this average, the Sun is moving ‘in’ toward the Galactic center at 10 km s − 1 , and travels faster in the direction of rotation by about 5 km s − 1 ; its ‘upward’ speed toward the north Galactic pole is 7–8 km s − 1 . Published velocities of stars and gas are frequently given with respect to this standard. Usually (but not always; see Problem 2.16 below), we assume that the local standard of rest follows a circular orbit around the Galactic center. In 1985 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) recommended the values R 0 = 8 . 5 kpc, for the Sun’s distance from the Galactic center, and V 0 = 220 km s − 1 , for its speed in that circular orbit. To allow workers to compare their measurements, astronomers often compute the distances and speeds of stars by using the IAU values, although current estimates are closer to R 0 ≈ 8 kpc and V 0 ≈ 200 km s − 1 . Problem 2.14 Using the IAU values for R 0 and V 0 , show that it takes the Sun about 240 Myr to complete one orbit about the Galactic center. This period is sometimes called a ‘Galactic year’. 2.3.1 Measuring the Galactic rotation curve We can calculate the radial velocity V r of a star or gas cloud, assuming that it follows an exactly circular orbit; see Figure 2.19.

The star moves away from us at speed V r = V cos α − V 0 sin l . (2.10) Using the sine rule, we have sin l / R = sin(90 ◦ + α ) / R 0 , and so V r = R 0 sin l \u0003 V R − V 0 R 0 \u0004 . (2.11) If the Milky Way rotated rigidly like a turntable, the distances between the stars would not change, and V r would always be zero. In fact, stars further from the center take longer to complete their orbits; the angular speed V / R drops with radius R . Then Equation 2.11 tells us that V r is positive for nearby objects in directions 0 < l < 90 ◦ , becoming negative for stars on the other side of the Galaxy that are so distant that R > R 0 . For 90 ◦ < l < 180 ◦ , V r is always negative, while for 180 ◦ < l < 270 ◦ it is always positive; in the sector 270 ◦ < l < 360 ◦ , the pattern of the first quadrant is repeated with the sign of V r reversed. Figure 2.20 shows the intensity of 21 cm line emission from neutral hydrogen gas in the disk of the Galaxy: as expected, there is no gas with positive velocities in the second quadrant (90 ◦ < l < 180 ◦ ), or with negative velocities in the third quadrant.

Do this by varying the Galactocentric azimuth φ around each ring; find d for each ( φ, R ), and hence the longitude l and V r . Make a plot similar to Figure 2.20 showing the gas on these rings. In Figure 2.20 itself, explain where the gas lies that corresponds to ( l ∼ 50 ◦ , V > 0); ( l ∼ 50 ◦ , V < 0); ( l ∼ 120 ◦ , V < 0); ( l ∼ 240 ◦ , V > 0); ( l ∼ 300 ◦ , V > 0); and ( l ∼ 300 ◦ , V < 0) . Where is the gas at ( l ∼ 120 ◦ , V > 0)?

For gas at a given radius R ,in which direction are the extrema (maxima or minima) of V R shifted away from l = 90 ◦ and l = 270 ◦ ? Use Figure 2.20 to show that the Sun and the local standard of rest are probably moving outward from the Galactic center.

Problem 2.17 Show that A + B =− V \u0006 , while A − B = V 0 / R 0 . Show that the IAU values for V 0 and R 0 imply A − B = 26 km s − 1 kpc − 1 . Do the measured values of A and B near the Sun correspond to a rising or a falling rotation curve? What effects might cause us to measure A + B \u0014= 0 near the Sun, even though the Milky Way’s rotation speed is roughly constant at that radius? If we could measure the speed V r for stars of known distance scattered through- out the disk, we could work backward to find V ( R ), the rotation curve of the Milky Way. Unfortunately, visible light from disk stars and clusters is blocked by dust. Radio waves can travel through dust, and we receive emission in the 21 cm hyperfine transition of atomic hydrogen from gas almost everywhere in the Galaxy. But, in general, we have no way of knowing the distance to the emitting gas. For the inner Galaxy ( R < R 0 ), the tangent-point method circumvents this difficulty and allows us to find the rotation curve. The angular speed V / R drops with radius. So Equation 2.11 tells us that, when we look out in the disk along a fixed direction with 0 < l < 90 ◦ , the radial speed V r ( l , R ) is greatest at the tangent point T in Figure 2.19, where the line of sight passes closest to the Galactic center. Here, we have R = R 0 sin l and V ( R ) = V r + V 0 sin l . (2.17) Thus, if there is emitting gas at virtually every point in the disk, we can find V ( R ) by measuring in Figure 2.20 the largest velocity at which emission is seen for each longitude l ; Figure 2.21 shows the results.

Measuring rotation speeds in the outer Galaxy is harder. We must first find the distances to associations of young stars by the methods of spectroscopic or photometric parallax. Their velocity V r is then measured from the emission lines of hot or cool gas around the stars. The stellar distances are often not very well determined, but they are good enough to tell us that the rotation speed V ( R ) does not decline much in the outer Galaxy, and may even rise further. 2.3.2 Dark matter in the Milky Way In Section 3.1 we will see that, for a spherical system, the speed V in a circular orbit at radius R is related to the mass M ( < R ) interior to that radius by the exact equation M ( < R ) = RV 2 / G . (2.18) When R is measured in parsecs, time in megayears, and M in M \u0005 , Newton’s gravitational constant G = 4 . 5 × 10 − 3 . For orbits in a flattened disk, this formula gives M ( < R ) to within 10% − 15%. Since V ( R ) does not decline, the mass of the Milky Way must increase almost linearly with radius, even far beyond the Sun where there are very few stars. Later, we will see that this discrepancy between the distributions of light and mass is generally present in spiral galaxies. Astronomers often refer to it as the ‘missing mass’or ‘dark matter’ problem."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"2.4 Milky Way meteorology: the interstellar gas 95 Galaxies presumably contain a large amount of matter that gives out virtually no light; this nonluminous mass is assumed to lie in a dark halo .

Show that this is about 10 5 times larger than the critical density of Equation 1.30. Taking h R = 4 kpc in Equation 2.8, show that 60% of the Milky Way’s disk lies within the Sun’s orbit. Taking L V = 5 × 10 9 L \u0005 for the bulge and 15 × 10 9 L \u0005 for the disk, show that the mass-to-light ratio M / L ( < R 0 ) ≈ 5.

Use Equation 2.18 to show that the speed V ( r ) of a circular orbit at radius r is given by V 2 ( r ) = V 2 H [1 − ( a H / r )arctan( r / a H )] , (2.20) and sketch V ( r ) as a function of radius. This density law is often used to represent the mass of a galaxy’s dark halo – why? 2.4 Milky Way meteorology: the interstellar gas Between the Milky Way’s stars lies the gas from which they were made, and to which they return the heavy elements produced by their nuclear burning. Almost all of the gas lies in the disk. Although its mass is less than 10% of that in stars, it gives the Galaxy many of its distinctive properties. Without gas, the Milky Way would be an S0 galaxy, not a spiral: our disk would have no hot young stars and no spiral pattern. Only about half of the Galaxy’s starlight escapes freely into intergalactic space; dusty interstellar gas absorbs the rest. The front cover shows the Milky Way’s gas, dust and stars observed at wavelengths from radio to γ -rays."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 Mapping our Milky Way Like the stellar disk, the Galaxy’s interstellar material is subject to gravity, which ultimately causes the densest gas to collapse into new stars. But we must also consider other forces, which can safely be ignored when discussing stellar motions: gas pressure, magnetic forces, and the pressure of cosmic rays. The gas is heated and ionized by stellar radiation; it is shocked and set into motion by fast stellar winds, violent supernova explosions, and passage through the spiral arms. Like the Earth’s atmosphere, the interstellar medium is in complex motion. 2.4.1 Mapping the gas layer Unlike stars, gas does not come in units of standard size. The mass of a clump of gas is not directly linked to its temperature, or any other quantity that we could measure independently of its distance. So the distances of gas clouds are very uncertain, except in special cases: for example, when we know that the gas surrounds a star. When we see absorption lines from interstellar gas in the spectrum of a star, we know that the gas is closer to us than the star. For gas in circular orbits in the Milky Way’s disk, we can calculate a kinematic distance . From its spectral line emission, we find how much gas is moving at each radial velocity V r in the direction at longitude l . Then, from the rotation curve V ( R ), we can use Equation 2.11 to estimate its distance. Thus we can build up a picture of how the Milky Way’s gas is distributed. When all of its radiation reaches us without being absorbed, the mass of gas moving with a particular velocity is proportional to the intensity of the radiation at the corresponding wavelength. Visible light is strongly absorbed by the interstellar dust, whereas radio waves can travel through the dusty gas. But, in the disk, we often look through enough material that radio waves from distant gas are partially absorbed by gas closer to us: the emission is optically thick . The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen, H I , is optically thick in the inner parts of the Galaxy. Dense cool clouds, where the gas is largely molecular, are often traced by the millimeter-wavelength lines of 12 CO, which are nearly always optically thick. Thus much of the molecular gas may be hidden from our direct view. Recall from Section 1.2 that we do not see emission lines from cool molecular hydrogen, because H 2 is a symmetric molecule. The next most abundant molecule in the dense gas is carbon monoxide, with roughly one CO molecule for every 10 4 of H 2 . On large scales, we can measure the total amount of atomic and molecular gas by comparing the numbers of energetic cosmic rays (see below), detected as they zip through the Earth’s atmosphere, with the brightness in γ -rays, which are produced as cosmic rays hit the gas atoms in the Galactic plane. By comparing in turn with observations in CO, we can find the average ratio X CO of the column density of molecular hydrogen to CO emission in the lowest rotational transition. In the Milky Way X CO is fairly uniform in the disk. It is higher in the central few hundred parsecs and in starbursts , where very vigorous star formation gives rise to a strong radiation field."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"2.4 Milky Way meteorology: the interstellar gas 97 051 0 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 Fig. 2.22.

Within the solar circle, the density is sensitive to corrections for optical thickness; outside, it depends on what is assumed for V ( R ). The shaded region shows the surface density of molecular hydrogen, as estimated from the intensity of CO emission – W. Burton and T. Dame. Table 1.8 of Section 1.2 lists spectral lines from some common interstellar molecules. Most of the gas in molecular clouds is cold, with T ≈ 10–20 K, and emits most strongly in CO. Even colder gas is detected when by chance it lies in front of a distant radio galaxy or quasar, and absorbs radiation in the appropriate spectral lines. We will see later that the densest gas is in the small warm cores of molecular clouds, where clusters and associations of young stars are born. Here we observe molecules such as NH 3 , CN, and H 2 CO. Figure 2.22 shows how atomic and molecular gases are distributed in the Galaxy. It is based on kinematic distances, using CO to trace the H 2 . The Milky Way probably contains (4–8) × 10 9 M \u0005 of H I , and about half that amount of molecular gas. Almost all of the H 2 , but less than half of the H I , lies within the solar circle , at radius R 0 . Molecular gas is piled up in a ring of radius 4 kpc. Inside this ring we find little molecular or atomic gas, except in the central few hundred parsecs. On the cover, we see that atomic hydrogen spreads to much larger radii than the molecular gas or the stars. It also forms a thicker layer than the molecular gas. Near the Sun, CO-emitting clouds lie mainly within 80 pc of the midplane, while the H I disk is about twice as thick. The H I layer puffs up even more strongly further out. As in other spiral galaxies, the dense molecular gas, dust, and young stars are concentrated into the spiral arms: see Section 5.5. The Sun lies just outside the Sagittarius–Carina arm, which can be traced for almost a full turn around the disk. Its pitch angle is about 10 ◦ , which is typical for an Sbc or Sc galaxy.

However, we do not have a picture of our whole spiral pattern. Dust blocks our view through the disk in visible light, and kinematic distances for the gas are unreliable, because the gravitational tug of the spiral arms pulls it out of circular rotation. Figure 2.23 shows atomic gas far above the Galactic plane. Looking away from the Galactic center toward l = 180 ◦ , from Equation 2.11 we expect that gas in circular orbit has V r ∼ 0, moving neither toward us nor away. Instead, the gas near b =+ 70 ◦ is approaching at > 70 km s − 1 . The high-velocity clouds of H I rain down on the disk even faster, at over 100 km s − 1 . Some of these may be disk material that has been thrown up above the midplane by supernovae or winds from hot massive stars, so that it is now falling back. Others, like the gas in the Magellanic Stream (Section 4.1), come from beyond the Milky Way. We do not generally know the distances to these clouds and so cannot estimate their masses. If they resemble those found around our neighbor M31 (see Section 4.2), most lie within 50 kpc of the disk, with masses 10 4 M \u0005 to 10 7 M \u0005 . Infalling high-velocity clouds may add metal-poor gas to the disk, potentially solving the G-dwarf problem which we discuss in Section 4.3. Beyond 1–2 kpc from the Galactic plane, almost all the gas is hot or warm. We can probe clouds of warm gas in the halo of our Galaxy and others by looking at the absorption lines they produce in the ultraviolet spectra of distant stars or quasars: see Section 9.3. In dense warm gas, light is absorbed by low ions such as Mg II . The more diffuse clouds are highly ionized; we see lines of C IV and N V . We also see absorption in lines of O VI , which arises in gas at ∼ 3 × 10 5 K, where Figure 2.25 shows that cooling is most rapid. This material must lie at the boundaries between the warm clouds and the hottest gas at ∼ 10 6 K. Within about 3 kpc of the Galactic center, inside the ring of dense gas, the average surface density of H 2 drops below 5 M \u0005 pc − 2 . At these radii, both atomic and molecular gas lie in a disk tilted 10 ◦ –20 ◦ from the plane b = 0, with gas at positive longitudes lying below that plane and that at l < 0 above it. We do not know what caused the tilt, nor why it persists. The tilted-disk gas is not in circular rotation. Instead, emission is observed at negative velocities for l > 0, and at positive velocities at negative longitudes, which by Equation 2.11 would not be allowed for circular motion. The emission at ‘forbidden’ velocities can be explained by the barlike Galactic bulge that we discussed in Section 2.2. Under the bar’s gravitational force, the gas must follow oval orbits that take it alternately toward and away from the Galactic center. The central 200 pc of the Galactic bulge is a gas-rich region which is actively forming stars; it harbors at least 10 8 M \u0005 of molecular gas, or about 10% of the total in the Milky Way. The material in the outer part of this region forms the inner edge of the tilted disk, its density now so high that the gas has become predominantly molecular. Further in, dense gas is again found close to the plane b = 0; here it is drawn out into long arcs and filaments as it orbits the central black hole."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"100 Mapping our Milky Way There is so much dust in the Milky Way’s disk that we cannot see optical and ultraviolet light from this central region. We observe X-rays from a hot plasma with T ≈ 10 7 K, filling the spaces around the denser and cooler clouds. The Galaxy’s gravity is too weak to hold onto such hot gas; it may be escaping as a wind into intergalactic space. 2.4.2 A physical picture The interstellar gas is a multiphase medium. On scales between 1 pc and about 1 kpc, the hot, warm, and cool phases are all mixed together. Most of the atoms are in the dense cool phases, but diffuse warm and hot gas occupy most of the volume. The cold molecular and atomic material is over 10 000 times denser than the hot plasma – a contrast larger than that between air and water. So we can often think of clouds of cool gas moving with little hindrance through the more diffuse medium. The densest gas is in a few thousand giant molecular clouds in the spiral arms. Any cloud with N H ∼ > 10 20 H atoms cm − 2 , or roughly M \u0005 pc − 2 , becomes largely molecular, since the ultraviolet photons that can break up H 2 molecules do not penetrate to greater depth. (Unshielded molecules are highly vulnerable: near the Sun, photons of ambient starlight destroy them in only a few hundred years.) The clouds can be larger than 20 pc, with masses above 10 5 M \u0005 , and densities > ∼ 200 H 2 molecules cm − 3 , rising above 10 4 cm − 3 in their cores. They are surrounded by cool H I , forming large complexes up to ∼ 100 pc across with 10 7 M \u0005 of gas. Between the arms, the clouds are smaller: typically M ∼ 40 M \u0005 , sizes are ∼ 2 pc, and densities hardly rise above n H ∼ 100 cm − 3 . In the central 200 pc, the clouds are denser ( n H ≈ 10 4 cm − 3 ) and hotter (typically around 70 K) than those near the Sun. The cool atomic hydrogen is less dense than molecular clouds, with n H ∼ 25 cm − 3 and T ≤ 80 K. Near the Sun, about half of the H I is much warmer, with T ∼ 8000 K and n H ∼ 0 . 3cm − 3 . This neutral gas is mixed with warm ionized gas, with the same temperature and pressure. Clouds of warm gas are themselves enveloped in hot diffuse plasma with n H ∼ 0 . 002 cm − 3 and T ∼ 10 6 K. At these temperatures hydrogen and helium are almost completely ionized by violent collisions with fast-moving electrons. Our Sun itself is moving through a warm cloud, a parsec in size and roughly 50% ionized, which lies within an irregularly shaped and expanding local bubble of hot gas, 100 pc across. At 1–2 kpc above the midplane, we still find clouds of H I , but the proportions of warm ionized gas and hot plasma are larger. Table 2.4 gives a summary of the various phases of the interstellar gas. Notice that the product n H T = p / k B is approximately the same for the cool H I clouds, for the warm gas, and for the hot plasma: they are in pressure balance. We will see why below, and discuss why the hot, warm, and cool phases have the temperatures that they do. Only O and B stars emit many photons above 13.6 eV, the energy required to ionize hydrogen from its ground state. When one of these begins to shine, its ultra- violet light first breaks up the surrounding H 2 molecules into atomic hydrogen,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"2.4 Milky Way meteorology: the interstellar gas 101 Table 2.4 A ‘zeroth-order’ summary of the Milky Way’s interstellar medium (after J.

The zone where this happens is called the photodissociation region . As the newly-ionized gas is heated to ∼ 10 000 K, its pressure suddenly shoots up to roughly 1000 times that of the surrounding cloud. The H II region expands, pushing the cold gas outward super- sonically. It often pierces the molecular cloud, escaping as a champagne flow . The Milky Way’s entire gas layer is also threaded by a tangled magnetic field. Its strength is about 0 . 5nTor5 μ G near the Sun; it is higher at smaller Galactocentric radii and falls to about half its local value at 2 R 0 . All but the coldest dense gas is sufficiently ionized to be a good electrical conductor, so the field is frozen into it, moving along with the gas. The expanding remnant of a supernova explosion sweeps up this magnetic field along with the gas, and the moving field accelerates protons and heavier atomic nuclei to near-light speeds, as cosmic rays . Cosmic rays with energy above 10 9 GeV or 10 9 m p c 2 can escape from the Galaxy’s magnetic field, while those of lower energy are trapped within it. Cosmic rays penetrate into even dense molecular clouds, keeping them partially ionized. Both cosmic rays and magnetic field resist attempts to squeeze the gas, effectively adding to the gas pressure. Expanding supernova remnants also accelerate electrons to relativistic speeds. We observe their synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths, as they spiral in the Galactic magnetic field. This emission is brightest near the Galactic plane, but the topmost image on the front cover shows that a diffuse radio halo extends many kiloparsecs above and below it. This shows that both field and fast particles can escape from the dense disk gas."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102 Mapping our Milky Way The interstellar gas is in motion on large and small scales. Like stars, inter- stellar gas clouds do not follow exactly circular orbits about the Galactic center. They also have random motions: typically about 5 km s − 1 for molecular clouds and 8 − 10 km s − 1 for clouds of atomic gas. Even within molecular clouds, gas in the denser cores must be in motion: the observed width of CO lines corresponds to velocities of 1 − 10 km s − 1 , while the thermal speeds for CO molecules are below 0.1 km s − 1 (see the problem below). Motions that are faster than the local speed of sound, which is roughly the thermal speed of atoms or molecules in the gas, give rise to shocks. Here the gas velocity changes sharply across a narrow region, and energy of motion is converted into heat. We do not know exactly how these motions arise, just as we cannot predict the Earth’s weather in detail even though we know that winds derive their energy from sunlight heating the air and the ground. The interstellar gas may be turbulent , with energy passed successively from motions on larger scales to smaller. Models of subsonic turbulence predict that random speeds σ measured inside a cloud of size L should increase as σ ∝ L 1 / 3 . This is approximately true for the atomic and molecular gas. Problem 2.21 For molecules of H 2 in a cloud with T = 20 K , n (H 2 ) = 200 cm − 3 , calculate the sound speed c s : k B T = μ m H c 2 s , where μ m H is the molecular mass. What is the sound speed for CO molecules in this same cloud? From Table 2.4, what is the sound speed for cool H I and for warm neutral gas? Show that cool H I clouds move through the warm interstellar medium at speeds close to the sound speed of that warm gas. An H II region cannot expand into the surrounding gas faster than this sound speed: how fast is that when T ≈ 10 4 K? If its temperature does not change, show that an H II region 1 pc across with n H = 10 3 cm − 3 would take 1 Myr to expand until its pressure balances that of the warm diffuse gas. The Milky Way’s dust absorbs nearly half of its ultraviolet and optical starlight. Most of this energy warms the grains, which radiate in the infrared, as we see in the fifth and sixth panels on the front cover. Cool interstellar gas contains about one grain of dust per 10 12 hydrogen atoms: on average, one grain per 100- meter cube. Most obviously, dust absorbs the visible light of stars, which would otherwise travel through the gas. Absorption by dust diminishes sharply toward the infrared. Since dust most efficiently absorbs light of wavelengths smaller than the grain size, this tells us that most grains have sizes ∼ < 0 . 3 μ m. Problem 2.22 Use the blackbody equations of Section 1.1 to find the approx- imate temperature of a dust grain that radiates mainly at 150 μ m . Show that a large dust grain 1 pc from an O star with L = 10 6 L \u0005 will be heated to roughly this temperature.

Lagache: ISO. burst of star formation: at what wavelength does it emit most of its energy? Show that its large dust grains have T ∼ 50 K. How far from the star would the dust have to be to reach an average temperature of 150 K, so that it radiates at 30 μ m? Figure 2.24 shows an infrared spectrum of the star-forming ring of NGC 7331, a galaxy much like the Milky Way or our neighbor M31. We see that its dust grains are a complex mixture. Large grains, with temperatures ∼ 30 K, are responsible for the emission peaking at 100 μ m. Radiation at around 30 μ m requires hotter grains at T ∼ > 100 K. Few grains are so close to stars that they reach such a high average temperature. Instead, we believe that this emission comes from grains smaller than 10 nm, with fewer than 10 6 carbon atoms. These are so tiny that absorbing a single ultraviolet photon raises their temperature above 100 K. Probably 10%–20% of the mass of interstellar dust is in the tiniest particles, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with 100 carbon atoms or fewer. Their carbon atoms are arranged in rings that make up a flat sheet or even a round ‘buckyball’. These behave like large molecules rather than amorphous solids. Stretching of their C—C and C—H bonds gives rise to the strong emission lines in the 3–20 μ m region. When a PAH molecule absorbs an ultraviolet photon, about 10% of the time it will throw out a fast-moving photoelectron , which loses its energy as it collides with electrons in the gas. This is probably the main way that the atomic gas is heated. Dust grains consist largely of magnesium and iron silicates, from the oxygen- rich atmospheres of red giant stars, and carbon in various forms: amorphous soot, graphite, and PAHs. In dense cold clouds, mantles of water ice, methane, and ammonia condense out onto the larger grains. Dust makes up about 1% of the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104 Mapping our Milky Way mass of interstellar material, and more in denser gas. In gas of approximately solar composition, elements heavier than helium hold only 2% of the mass. Thus, in dense clouds, almost all of the carbon, oxygen, magnesium, etc. must be in dust, leaving the gas depleted of those elements. Dust grains are continually knocked apart as they collide with fast-moving atoms and with each other, and built up by absorbing atoms of interstellar gas onto their surfaces. The material now present in a grain has probably been there for less than 500 Myr. The surface of grains is the main site where hydrogen molecules are made. These form only slowly in a gas, because the atoms rarely encounter each other and then find it difficult to lose energy to become bound in a molecule, since the process is strongly forbidden because of symmetry. At typical densities n H ∼ 100 cm − 3 , atomic hydrogen would take 10 13 yr to form H 2 . When the atoms can be absorbed onto grains to ‘find’ each other there, and then transfer excess energy to the grain to release a bound molecule, H 2 forms ∼ 10 8 times faster. Problem 2.23 In a very simple model, H atoms that collide with a grain stick to it for long enough to find a partner; the pair departs as a molecule of H 2 . In a cloud at T = 50 K, show that the thermal speed of Problem 1.9 is v th ≈ 1kms − 1 . From Problem 1.11, take the grain radius a = 0 . 1 μ m and number density n g = 10 − 12 n H . Show that an H atom collides with a grain after an average time ( n g π a 2 v th ) − 1 or 10 Myr × (1 cm − 3 / n H ). The Sun, and gas orbiting along with it, takes 5%–10% of a ‘Galactic year’ (see Problem 2.14) to pass through a spiral arm. Show that this is long enough for an H I cloud with n H = 100 cm − 3 to become largely molecular. The interstellar gas is an ‘open’ system: it needs a continuous energy supply. A star like our Sun will not change its orbit significantly within a Hubble time, unless the Milky Way has a near-collision with another galaxy: the stellar disk and bulge are close to equilibrium. By contrast, the gas layer is like a pan of boiling water; unless energy is supplied to it, the gas will cool rapidly, and the random motions of the clouds will dissipate. Energy is added to the interstellar gas by stellar radiation, by collisions with cosmic rays, and mechanically by supernovae, stellar winds, and Galactic rotation which stretches the magnetic field. As one example, we can ask how quickly ionized hydrogen reverts to a neutral state. In each cubic centimeter, neutral atoms are produced at a rate which increases as the number of electrons, n e , times the number of protons, n p ≈ n e , times the rate at which they encounter each other and recombine, which depends on the temperature T e of the (lighter and faster-moving) electrons. Thus electrons recombine at the rate − d n e d t = n 2 e α ( T e ) with α ( T e ) ≈ 2 × 10 − 13 \u0003 T e 10 4 K \u0004 − 3 / 4 cm 3 s − 1 . (2.21)"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"2.4 Milky Way meteorology: the interstellar gas 105 Here, the function α ( T e ) hides the physics of encounters with a range of relative speed; we have taken it from Equation 5.6 of the book by Dyson and Williams. The approximation is good for 5000 K ∼ < T ∼ < 20 000 K. The recombination time t rec is given by the number of electrons, divided by the rate at which they disappear: t rec = n e | d n e / d t | = 1 n e α ( T e ) ≈ 1500 yr × \u0003 T e 10 4 K \u0004 3 / 4 \u0003 100 cm − 3 n e \u0004 . (2.22) When the gas is hotter, electrons and protons collide more frequently but are less likely to stick together, so t rec is longer. Within H II regions, t rec is only a few thousand years. The ionized gas rapidly recombines once the star no longer provides ultraviolet photons. In the warm ionized interstellar gas the density is only ∼ 0 . 1cm − 3 , and recombination takes ∼ 2 Myr. But, because there is so much of this gas, it must absorb at least 25% of the ultraviolet radiation from all the O and B stars in the disk in order to maintain its ionized state. These energetic photons must find their way to ∼ 1 kpc above the midplane, between the clouds of neutral gas. Problem 2.24 We can estimate the size of an H II region around a massive star that radiates S photons with energy above 13.6 eV each second. Assume that the gas within radius r absorbs all these photons, becoming almost completely ionized, so that n e ≈ n H , the density of H nuclei. In a steady state atoms recombine as fast as they are ionized, so the star ionizes a mass of gas M g , where S = (4 r 3 / 3) n 2 H α ( T e ) = ( M g / m p ) n H α ( T e ) . Use Equation 2.21 to show that a mid-O star radiating S = 10 49 s − 1 into gas of density 10 3 cm − 3 creates an H II region of radius 0.67 pc, containing ∼ 30 M \u0005 of gas (assume that T e = 10 4 K). What is r if the density is ten times larger? Show that only a tenth as much gas is ionized. How large is the H II region around a B1 star with n H = 10 3 cm − 3 but only S = 3 × 10 47 s − 1 ? The cooling time t cool measures how fast the gas radiates away its thermal energy. When there are n atoms cm − 3 , the energy in each cubic centimeter is proportional to nT ; if it radiates with luminosity L , t cool ∝ nT / L . When the gas is optically thin, we have a formula like Equations 1.17 and 2.21: the number of photons from that volume is proportional to n 2 . We can write L = n 2 \u0003 ( T ) , so t cool ∝ T / [ n \u0003 ( T )] . (2.23) \u0003 ( T ) depends only on the temperature, so denser gas cools more rapidly."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"106 Mapping our Milky Way Table 2.5 Main processes that cool the interstellar gas Temperature Cooling process Spectral region > 10 7 K Free–free X-ray 10 7 K < T < 10 8 K Iron resonance lines X-ray 10 5 K < T < 10 7 K Metal resonance lines UV, soft X-ray 8000 K < T < 10 5 K C, N, O, Ne forbidden lines IR, optical Warm neutral gas: ∼ 8000 K Lyman- α ,[O I ] 1216 ̊ A, 6300 ̊ A 100 K < T < 1000 K [O I ], [C II ], H 2 Far IR: 63 μ m, 158 μ m T ∼ 10 − 50 K CO rotational transitions Millimeter-wave 0.3 1 10 100 100 1 0.01 Fig. 2.25.

Hensler. Figure 2.25 shows the cooling curve for gas of roughly solar composition, and Table 2.5 lists the main processes that carry away energy. Above about 10 7 K, almost all the atoms are fully ionized, and the gas cools by free–free radiation (see Section 1.2). Roughly \u0003 ( T ) ∝ √ T ,so t cool ∝ √ T / n ; we can see from Figure 2.25 that hotter gas needs longer to cool. At lower temperatures the resonance lines of iron and other metals become the main coolants. They are very efficient, so \u0003 ( T ) rises steeply between 10 6 and 10 4 K; gas cannot remain long at temperatures between that of the hot and warm phases of the interstellar medium. In neutral gas below about 8000 K, the energy loss drops sharply. It also depends on the column density N H , which determines how far ultraviolet pho- tons penetrate to ionize atoms and dissociate molecules. Almost all of the cooling below 10 7 K depends on elements heavier than hydrogen and helium; so, in the metal-poor gas of the first galaxies, it would have been much weaker than it is today."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"2.4 Milky Way meteorology: the interstellar gas 107 Various processes heat the Milky Way’s gas, replacing the lost energy. The diffuse hot gas was heated to ∼ 10 6 K, as it passed through the shock caused by the expanding remnant of a supernova. At the densities observed near the Sun, Figure 2.25 shows that it cools rapidly, within 10 4 − 10 5 yr, condensing into cooler clouds. Near the Sun’s position, a given region is crossed by a supernova shock about once per 1 − 5 Myr, reheating the gas. Far from the midplane the hot gas is less dense, and cooling times can reach 1 Gyr. Clouds of warm and cool H I gas are warmed by photoelectric heating, as ultraviolet light of stars falls onto the smallest dust grains. They are cooled by far-infrared lines of oxygen and carbon. When the gas temperature falls below ∼ 100 K, collisions among gas atoms are not energetic enough to excite the far- infrared atomic lines. In molecular clouds, energy is lost mainly in the millimeter- wavelength lines of CO. Table 1.8 shows that the lowest rotational level lies only 5.5 K above the ground state, so it is excited by collisions in gas near that temperature or above. The main source of heat is cosmic rays, which penetrate right through the clouds; they strip electrons from gas atoms, which then share their energy as they bump into electrons in the gas. Molecular clouds are dark; only far-infrared and longer wavelengths of light can reach the interior. The infrared light warms the dust grains, which in turn prevent even the densest and darkest clouds from cooling below ∼ 10 K (see Problem 1.12). Unlike stars, the warm and cool gas clouds are large enough that they occa- sionally collide with one another. So, like molecules in a gas, they exert pressure. The random speeds of H I clouds are typically σ r ∼ 10 km s − 1 , and the volume- averaged density n HI \u000b ∼ 0 . 5cm − 3 near the Sun; so the density of kinetic energy 3 ρ HI \u000b σ 2 r / 2 is equivalent to p / k B ∼ 8000. Table 2.4 shows that this is much larger than the thermal pressure of the gas, but about the same as the pressures contributed by magnetic fields and cosmic rays. This rough equality is no accident. The Milky Way’s magnetic field takes most of its energy from differential rotation, which tends to pull gas at small radii ahead of that further out. The magnetic field is frozen into the gas, so field lines connecting clouds at different radii are stretched out as the Galaxy rotates, strengthening the field. Random motions of the gas clouds, the pressure of cosmic rays, and disturbances from stellar winds and supernova explosions also stretch and tangle the field. The strength of the field depends on the vigor of these processes. As they collide, much of the clouds’ bulk motion is converted to heat, which is radiated away. The clouds’ random motion would cease within 10 − 30 Myr if they were not shaken about by supernova explosions, winds from H II regions, the pull of magnetic fields, and passage through spiral arms. Thus we see that energy is continually transferred among cloud motions, magnetic field, and cosmic rays. In very complex processes, often the energies of the various motions are driven to be equal on average, just as kinetic energy is on average distributed equally among the colliding molecules of gas in a room. Here, each component exerts roughly equal pressure."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"108 Mapping our Milky Way New stars are born in the Milky Way’s dense molecular clouds. These clouds are at much higher pressure than the surrounding atomic gas, because they must resist the inward pull of their own gravity. We will see in Section 8.5 that gravity will cause a gas cloud of density ρ and temperature T to collapse on itself, if its diameter exceeds the Jeans length λ J = c s \u0011 π G ρ ; here c s is the sound speed c 2 s = k B T / ( μ m H ), and μ m H is the mean molecular mass.

(2.24) If gas pressure is not enough to prevent it, the cloud collapses after approximately a free-fall time (see Equation 3.23 in Section 3.1): t ff = \u0012 1 G ρ ≈ 10 8 √ n H yr . (2.25) When do we expect collapse to be so rapid? A gas heats up as it is compressed, so the Jeans mass increases according to Equation 2.24. Unless it can radiate away this heat, gas pressure will slow the collapse. Thus the cooling time must be short: t cool \u0011 t ff .If T does not grow, the Jeans mass decreases as the density rises, and the original cloud can break into smaller fragments which themselves collapse independently. This continues until the densest fragments become optically thick; they heat up and begin to shine as protostars . Table 2.4 shows that the Galaxy has (1–2) × 10 9 M \u0005 in molecular clouds, at densities above 100 cm − 3 , and T ∼ 10–20 K. According to Equations 2.24 and 2.25, any of these clouds larger than 60 M \u0005 should collapse within about 10 Myr. Converting all of the Galaxy’s molecular material to stars in this way yields ∼ 100 M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars – far more than the (3–5) M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars that we observe. Either a collapsing molecular cloud turns very little of its mass into stars, or something – perhaps ‘frozen’ magnetic fields or turbulent motions – must slow the collapse. Just as water passes between solid, liquid, and vapor phases in Earth’s atmo- sphere, so interstellar material passes continually between different phases. As H I gas cools or is compressed in a spiral arm, more of it converts to the dense cold phase. When atomic clouds become dense enough that ultraviolet light cannot penetrate their interiors, H 2 forms on dust grains. The molecular"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"2.4 Milky Way meteorology: the interstellar gas 109 clouds lose heat and gradually contract, forming new stars if they are not first disrupted. As new massive stars shine on the remains of the dense cloud in which they were born, their ultraviolet photons split H 2 molecules apart, then ionize the atoms to form an H II region. This expands, breaking out of the molecular cloud to mix with the warm ionized medium. Near the end of their lives, we saw in Section 1.1 that low-mass stars become red giants and supergiants, shedding dusty gas enriched in heavy elements pro- duced by their nuclear burning. Supernova explosions also release dust and heavy elements. Even though the energy in these explosions is only ∼ 1% of that in starlight, supernovae are the main source of the Galaxy’s hot gas and cosmic rays. Their shock waves heat surrounding gas to over a million degrees, sweep up and so strengthen the magnetic field, and accelerate cosmic rays. Once massive stars have destroyed their natal molecular cloud with ultraviolet radiation, stellar winds, and supernova explosions, no further stars can be born there until the gas has had time to cool and become dense again. If a galaxy undergoes a starburst (see Section 7.1), turning most of its cool gas into stars within ∼ < 300 Myr, repeated supernova explosions in a small volume can heat up so much gas that it forces its way out of the galaxy as a superwind . The average stellar birthrate in the Milky Way is set by this feedback loop : too-vigorous star formation in a particular region inhibits further starbirth. In a large galaxy like ours, an expanding supernova compresses cool gas in nearby regions of the disk, and can trigger collapse of the densest parts to make new stars. Thus star formation can ‘spread like a disease’ across the face of the galaxy. We will see in Section 4.4 that a dwarf galaxy is more likely to have episodes of rapid starbirth across the entire system, interspersed with quiet periods.

Stars are so much denser than the interstellar gas through which they move that neither gas pressure nor the forces from embedded magnetic fields can deflect them from their paths. If we know how mass is distributed, we can find the resulting gravitational force, and from this we can calculate how the positions and velocities of stars and galaxies will change over time. But we can also use the stellar motions to tell us where the mass is. As we discovered in Chapter 2, much of the matter in the Milky Way cannot be seen directly. Its radiation may be absorbed, as happens for the visible light of stars in the dusty disk. Some material simply emits too weakly: dense clouds of cold gas do not show up easily in radio-telescope maps. The infamous dark matter still remains invisibly mysterious. But, since the orbits of stars take them through different regions of the galaxies they inhabit, their motions at the time we observe them have been affected by the gravitational fields through which they have travelled earlier. So we can use the equations for motion under gravity to infer from observed motions how mass is distributed in those parts of galaxies that we cannot see directly. Newton’s law of gravity, and methods for computing the gravitational forces, are introduced in Section 3.1. Usually we can consider the stars as point masses, because their sizes are small compared with the distances between them. Since galaxies contain anywhere between a million stars and 10 12 of them, we usu- ally want to look at the average motion of many stars, rather than following the individual orbit of each one. We prove the virial theorem , relating average stellar speeds to the depth of the gravitational potential well in which they move. Orbital dynamics and the virial theorem are our tools to find masses of star clusters and galaxies. The gravitational potential of a galaxy or star cluster can be regarded as the sum of a smooth component, the average over a region containing many stars, and the very deep potential well around each individual star.

Two-body encounters , transferring energy between individual stars, can be important within dense star clusters. We discuss how these encounters change the cluster’s structure, eventually causing it to disperse or ‘evaporate’. Section 3.3 covers the epicycle theory, which is a way to simplify the calculation of motions for stars like the Sun, that follow very nearly circular orbits within a galaxy’s disk. Using epicycles, we can explain the observed motions of disk stars near the Sun. Section 3.4 is the most technical of the book: it introduces the collisionless Boltzmann equation , linking the number of stars moving with given velocity at each point in space to the gravitational force acting on them. We survey a few of its many uses, such as finding the mass density in the Galactic disk near the Sun. We remind readers of Plato’s warning ( Timaeus , 91d): the innocent and lightminded, who believe that astronomy can be studied by looking at the heavens without knowledge of mathematics, will return in the next life as birds. Symbols. We use boldface to indicate a vector quantity. The energy and angular momentum of a star are given by E and L ; E is energy per unit mass, while L and its components denote angular momentum per unit mass. F is used both for a force and for force per unit mass, depending on the context. 3.1 Motion under gravity: weighing the Galaxy Newton’s law of gravity tells us that a point mass M attracts a second mass m separated from it by distance r , causing the velocity v of m to change according to d d t ( m v ) =− Gm M r 3 r , (3.1) where G is Newton’s gravitational constant. In a cluster of N stars with masses m α ( α = 1 , 2 ,..., N ), at positions x α , we can add the forces on star α from all the other stars: d d t ( m α v α ) =− \u0013 β α \u0014= β Gm α m β | x α − x β | 3 ( x α − x β ) . (3.2) The mass m α cancels out of this equation, so the acceleration d v α / d t is independent of the star’s mass: light and heavy objects fall equally fast. This is the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial mass, which is the basis for the general theory of relativity.

If we think of a continuous distribution of matter in a galaxy or star cluster, the potential at point x is given by an integral over the density ρ ( x \u0006 )atall other points: \u0010 ( x ) =− \u0002 G ρ ( x \u0006 ) | x − x \u0006 | d 3 x \u0006 , (3.4) and the force F per unit mass is F ( x ) =−∇ \u0010 ( x ) =− \u0002 G ρ ( x \u0006 )( x − x \u0006 ) | x − x \u0006 | 3 d 3 x \u0006 . (3.5) The integral relation of Equation 3.4 can be turned into a differential equation. Applying ∇ 2 to both sides, we have ∇ 2 \u0010 ( x ) =− \u0002 G ρ ( x \u0006 ) ∇ 2 \u0003 1 | x − x \u0006 | \u0004 d 3 x \u0006 . (3.6) In three dimensions, differentiating with respect to the variable x gives, for x \u0014= x \u0006 (check by trying it in Cartesian coordinates), ∇ \u0003 1 | x − x \u0006 | \u0004 =− x − x \u0006 | x − x \u0006 | 3 , and ∇ 2 \u0003 1 | x − x \u0006 | \u0004 = 0 . (3.7) So the integrand on the right-hand side of Equation 3.6 is zero outside a small sphere S \u001a ( x ) of radius \u001a centred on x .

Setting f = 1 / | x − x \u0006 | , Equation 3.7 tells us that, on the surface of the sphere S \u001a ( x ), the gradient ∇ x \u0006 f is a vector of length \u001a − 2 pointing in toward the point x . The surface area is 4 π\u001a 2 , so the integral of ∇ x \u0006 f · d S \u0006 in Equation 3.8 is − 4 π .Wehave Poisson’s equation : ∇ 2 \u0010 ( x ) = 4 π G ρ ( x ) . (3.9) This can be a more convenient relationship between the potential \u0010 ( x ) and the cor- responding density than the integral in Equation 3.4. To choose an approximation for the density ρ ( x ) of a star cluster or galaxy, we can select a mathematically con- venient form for the potential \u0010 ( x ), and then calculate the corresponding density. We must take care that ρ ( x ) ≥ 0 everywhere for our chosen potential; various apparently friendly potentials turn out to imply ρ ( x ) < 0 in some places. The problems below deal with some commonly used potentials. Problem 3.1 Use Equation 3.1 to show that, at distance r from a point mass M , the gravitational potential is \u0010 ( r ) =− G M r . (3.10) Problem 3.2 The Plummer sphere is a simple if crude model for star clusters and round galaxies.

Show that both \u0010 SIS and the mass within radius r have no finite limit as r →∞ , and that the speed in a circular orbit is V H at all radii. The singular isothermal sphere describes a system in which the number of stars at each energy E is proportional to exp[ − E / (2 V 2 H )].

(3.16) For a spherical galaxy or star cluster, Newton proved two useful theorems about the gravitational field. The first states that the gravitational force inside a spherical shell of uniform density is zero. In Figure 3.1, the star at S experiences a gravitational pull from the material at A within a narrow cone of solid angle \b\u0002 , and a force in the opposite direction from mass within the same cone at B. By symmetry, the line AB makes the same angle with the normal OA to the surface at A as it does with OB at B. Thus the ratio of the mass enclosed is just (SA/SB) 2 ; by the inverse-square law, the forces are exactly equal, and cancel each other out. Thus there is no force on the star, and the potential \u0010 ( x ) must be constant within the shell. The second theorem says that, outside any spherically symmetric object, the gravitational force is the same as if all its mass had been concentrated at the center . If we can show that this is so for a uniform spherical shell, it must be true for any spherically symmetric object built from those shells.

The acceleration V 2 / r of a star moving with speed V ( r ) in an orbit of radius r about the center must be provided by the inward gravitational force − F r ( r ). So, if M ( < r ) is the mass within radius r ,wehave V 2 ( r ) r =− F r ( r ) = G M ( < r ) r 2 . (3.20) We already used this equation in Section 2.3 to find the mass of the Milky Way. Whenever we can find gas or stars in near-circular orbit within a galaxy, this is by far the simplest and most reliable way to estimate the mass. For a point mass, we have V ( r ) ∝ r − 1 / 2 ; in a spherical galaxy the rotation speed can never fall more rapidly than this. The potential \u0010 ( r )is \u0010 ( r ) =− \u000b G M ( < r ) r + 4 π G \u0002 ∞ r ρ ( r \u0006 ) r \u0006 d r \u0006 \f (3.21) (check that differentiating this with respect to r gives you back Equation 3.20). We see that \u0010 ( r )is not equal to − G M ( < r ) / r , unless all the mass lies within radius r . But Equation 3.4 implies that, at a great distance from any system with finite mass M tot , \u0010 ( x ) −→ − G M tot | x | . (3.22) Problem 3.5 Use Equation 3.20 to show that, if the density ρ in a spherical galaxy is constant, then a star following a circular orbit moves so that its angular speed \u0002 ( r ) = V ( r ) / r is constant. Show that a star moving on a radial orbit, i.e., in a straight line through the center, would oscillate harmonically in radius with period P = \u0012 3 π G ρ ∼ 3 t ff , where t ff ≡ \u0017 1 / G ρ. (3.23) The free-fall time t ff is roughly the time that a gas cloud of density ρ would take to collapse under its own gravity, if it is not held up by pressure. Show that, if you bored a hole through the center of the Earth to the other side, and dropped an egg down it, then (ignoring air resistance, outflows of molten lava, etc.) you could return about an hour and a half later to retrieve the egg as it returned to its starting point.

This is a typical density for the inner parts of a galaxy. Processes such as bursts of star formation that involve large parts of the galaxy happen on roughly this timescale, because gravitational forces cannot move material any faster through the galaxy. Problem 3.7 The Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) model describes the halos of cold dark matter that form in simulations like that of Figure 7.16. Show that the potential corresponding to the density ρ NFW ( r ) = ρ N ( r / a N )(1 + r / a N ) 2 is \u0010 NFW ( r ) =− σ 2 N ln(1 + r / a N ) ( r / a N ) , (3.24) where σ 2 N = 4 π G ρ N a 2 N . The density rises steeply at the center, but less so than in the singular isothermal sphere; at large radii ρ ( r ) ∝ r − 3 .

(3.25) When finding the orbit of a single star moving through a galaxy, we will see in Section 3.2 that we can usually ignore the effect which that star has in attracting all the other stars, and thus changing the gravitational potential. If the mass distribution is static (the galaxy is not, for example, collapsing, or colliding with something), the potential at position x does not depend on time. Then as the star moves with velocity v , the potential \u0010 ( x ) at its location changes according to d \u0010/ d t = v ·∇ \u0010 ( x ). Taking the scalar product of Equation 3.3 with v ,we have v · d d t ( m v ) + m v ·∇ \u0010 ( x ) = 0 = d d t \u000b 1 2 m v 2 + m \u0010 ( x ) \f . (3.26) Thus E ≡ 1 2 m v 2 + m \u0010 ( x ) = constant along the orbit . (3.27) The star’s energy E is the sum of its kinetic energy KE = m v 2 / 2 and the potential energy PE = m \u0010 ( x ). The kinetic energy cannot be negative, and Equation 3.22 tells us that, far from an isolated galaxy or star cluster, \u0010 ( x ) → 0. So a star at position x can escape only if it has E > 0; it must be moving faster than the local escape speed v e , given by v 2 e =− 2 \u0010 ( x ) .

In fact, we see local stars with speeds as large as 500 km s − 1 ; explain why this tells us that the Galaxy contains appreciable mass outside the Sun’s orbit. The star’s angular momentum L = x × m v changes according to d L d t = x × d d t ( m v ) =− m x ×∇ \u0010 (3.29) (why can we leave out the term d x / d t × m v ?). If a galaxy is spherically symmetric about x = 0, the force ∇ \u0010 points toward the center, and L does not change. For a star moving in an axisymmetric galaxy, we will see in Section 3.3 below that only the component of angular momentum parallel to the symmetry axis remains constant. Problem 3.9 Calculate the energy E and angular momentum L of a star of mass m moving in a circular orbit of radius r in the Plummer potential of Equation 3.11. Show that the circular speed V ( r ) increases with radius near the center and falls further out, and that d L / d r > 0 everywhere, while the angular speed \u0002 ( r ) = V / r is always decreasing.

Two gas clouds, of masses m 1 and m 2 , follow circular orbits at radii r 1 and r 2 , with r 1 < r 2 . What is the total energy E and the angular momentum L ? The gas clouds are now displaced to different circular orbits at radii r 1 + \b r 1 and r 2 + \b r 2 . How must \b r 1 and \b r 2 be related so that L remains unchanged? Assuming that \b r 1 and \b r 2 are small, what is the energy change \b E ? Show that, if α< 2, the angular momentum rV ( r ) of a circular orbit increases with r .We will see in Section 3.3 that this condition is met whenever the circular orbit is stable. Show that the second state then has lower energy than the initial energy if \b r 1 < 0. Processes that couple different regions of a rotating disk, such as viscosity or spiral structure, can extract energy from the rotation by moving mass inward and angular momentum outward. In a cluster of stars, the gravitational potential will change as the stars move: \u0010 = \u0010 ( x , t ). The energy of each star is no longer conserved, only the total for the cluster as a whole.

According to Equation 3.34, the stars in an isolated cluster can change their kinetic and potential energies, as long as the sum of these remains constant. As they move further apart, their potential energy increases, and their speeds must drop so that the kinetic energy can decrease. If the stars moved so far apart that their speeds dropped to zero, and then just stayed there, the system could still satisfy this equation. But star clusters cannot remain in this state: Equation 3.2 makes clear that the stars are accelerated into motion. The virial theorem tells us how, on average, the kinetic and potential energies are in balance. To prove this theorem, we return to Equation 3.2, but we now add an external force F ext ; this might represent, for example, the gravitational pull of a galaxy on a star cluster within it.

As long as all the stars are bound to the cluster, the products | x α · v α | , and hence | d I / d t | , never exceed some finite limits.

(3.44) This is the virial theorem, one of the fundamental results of dynamics. The virial theorem is our tool for finding the masses of star clusters and galax- ies where the orbits are far from circular. The process is straightforward if the star cluster or galaxy is nearly spherical and has no strong rotation; otherwise, we must use the tensor virial theorem of Section 6.2. Unless the system is actively colliding with another, or is still forming by collapse, we assume that it is close to a steady state so that the virial theorem applies. Generally we start by assuming that the ratio of mass to luminosity M / L is the same everywhere in the system, so that the measured surface brightness I ( x ) indicates the density of mass. We measure the stellar radial velocities V r relative to the cluster’s mean motion, and find the veloc- ity dispersion σ r . This is defined by σ 2 r = V r 2 \u000b , where the angle brackets represent an average over the stars of the cluster. For example, in globular clusters V r can be measured with a precision of 0.5 km s − 1 , and σ r is typically 5–15 km s − 1 ; see Table 3.1. Many star clusters are so distant that tangential motions are very hard to measure (what proper motion μ corresponds to 10 km s − 1 at d = 30 kpc?). We often assume that the average motions are isotropic , equal in all directions. Then, v α · v α \u000b ≈ 3 σ 2 r , and the cluster’s kinetic energy is KE ≈ (3 σ 2 r / 2)( M / L ) L tot .

Clusters with upper limits to r c probably have collapsed cores. spherically symmetric. Then, from its surface brightness, we can find the volume density of stars and hence the potential energy: see the problem below. Problem 3.13 For a random sample of stars in a globular cluster, σ r ≈ 10 km s − 1 ; the surface brightness can be fit approximately by the Plummer model of Equa- tion 3.13 with a P = 10 pc. Assuming that the cluster is spherical and contains no unseen dark matter, use the virial theorem to show that its mass M ≈ 2 × 10 6 M \u0005 . What did you assume about the stars’ random motions? Another tactic is to measure the cluster’s core radius r c , where the measured surface brightness I ( x ) has fallen to half its central value. The core radii of globular clusters are generally about 10 pc, but can be larger (Table 2.3). We can write the potential energy as PE =− G M 2 / (2 η r c ) for some constant η ∼ 1. For example, the homogeneous sphere of Problem 3.1 has r c = √ 3 a / 2, and using Equation 3.36 yields η = 5 / (3 √ 3) ≈ 0 . 96. For the Plummer model of Problem 3.12, η ≈ 2 . 6. Ignoring external forces from the rest of the Galaxy, Equation 3.44 gives the cluster’s mass as M ≈ 6 ησ 2 r r c / G . (3.45) Sometimes it is easier to measure the cluster’s central surface brightness I ( x = 0) than its total luminosity.

It is a fairly good approximation for a wide range of cluster-like and galaxy-like potentials (see Richstone and Tremaine 1986 AJ 92 , 72). Most globular clusters have masses in the range 10 4 M \u0005 to 10 6 M \u0005 . Table 3.1 shows that typically the mass-to-light ratio 1 ∼ < M / L ∼ < 4. It is larger than that measured in Section 2.1 for the immediate solar neighborhood, which is not surprising since all the bright massive stars in these old clusters have now died. But it is much less than what we found in Problem 2.18 for the Milky Way as a whole: globular clusters do not seem to contain much, if any, ‘dark matter’. Open clusters are less dense than globular clusters, and their stars have smaller random speeds. The mass-to-light ratios in Table 2.2 are even lower than those in globular clusters because luminous stars are still on the main sequence. Problem 3.14 Suppose that an isolated cluster of stars is initially in equilibrium. If a fraction f of its mass is suddenly removed so that the mass m α of each becomes (1 − f ) m α , by what factor do the kinetic and potential energies change? If the initial potential energy is PE 0 , show that the total energy E 0 = PE 0 / 2, and afterward it is E 1 = (1 − f )(1 − 2 f ) E 0 . So, if f > 0 . 5, the stars are no longer bound together. Use the virial theorem to show that, when the stars come to a new equilibrium, the average distance between them is larger by a factor (1 − f ) / (1 − 2 f ). The fast winds from massive stars, and their final explosion as supernovae, blow away any cluster gas that was not initially converted into stars. In the Milky Way’s disk, we see many clumps of young stars that were born together but are now dissolving; they became unbound as leftover gas was expelled. Globular clusters must have formed in a different way, using up almost all their gas, or else the clusters would not have remained as dense as they now are. To find the average motion of one star within an unchanging cluster potential, we can regard the gravity of all the other stars as giving rise to an external force. For each star, the virial theorem now tells us that v 2 \u000b= ∇ \u0010 ( x ) · x \u000b . (3.47) (For a star following a circular orbit in a spherically symmetric potential \u0010 ( r ), check that this gives the same orbital speed V ( r ) as Equation 3.20.) In the outer parts of any cluster, the magnitude of ∇ \u0010 · x begins to decrease with radius.

Looking back at Figure 2.19, explain why you must add V 0 sin l cos b to find the motion relative to the Galactic center. Simplify the problem by taking the Galaxy to be spherically symmetric, with its mass entirely within the satellite orbits, so you can treat it as a central point mass M G . The mutual potential energy of the satellites is small compared with the external force term − G M G / r 2 , and the satellite’s Galactocentric radius r is almost equal to d , its distance from the Sun. Assume that on average the satellites have equal speeds in all directions; for each in turn, use Equation 3.47 to estimate M G .

This happens because particles can exchange energy and momentum during ‘collisions’: two of them come so close that the forces between them are much stronger than the force that each feels from all the other molecules together. At an average room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure, each molecule of oxygen or nitrogen has about 10 11 such encounters every second. Similarly, Figure 3.3 shows how we can think of the gravitational potential of the Galaxy as the sum of two parts: a smooth component, averaged over a region containing many stars, and the remainder, which includes the very deep potential well around each star. The successive tugs of individual stars on each other, described by the sharply varying part of the potential, cause them to deviate from the courses they would have taken if just the smooth part of the force had been present: we can think of these sharp pulls as ‘collisions’ between stars. We will see in this section that stars in a galaxy behave quite differently from air molecules. The cumulative effect of the small pulls of distant stars is more important in changing the course of a star’s motion than the huge forces generated as stars pass very near to each other. But, except in dense star clusters, even these distant collisions have little effect over the lifetime of the Galaxy in randomizing or ‘relaxing’ the stellar motions. For example, the smooth averaged part of the Galactic potential almost entirely determines the motion of stars like the Sun."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"3.2 Why the Galaxy isn’t bumpy : two-body relaxation 125 = + Fig. 3.3. The potential \u0010 ( x ) of a stellar system, represented here by vertical height, can be split into a smoothly varying averaged component and a steep potential well near each star. Fig. 3.4. During time t , this star will have a strong encounter with any other star lying within the cylinder of radius r s . 3.2.1 Strong close encounters We can calculate the average time between strong encounters , in which one star comes so near to another that the collision completely changes its speed and direction of motion, as follows. Suppose that the stars all have mass m and move in random directions with average speed V . For the moment, we neglect the gravitational force from the rest of the galaxy or cluster. Then, if two stars approach within a distance r , the sum of their kinetic energies must increase to balance the change in potential energy. When they are a long way apart, their mutual potential energy is zero. We say that they have a strong encounter if, at their closest approach, the change in potential energy is at least as great as their starting kinetic energy. This requires Gm 2 r ∼ > mV 2 2 , which means r ∼ < r s ≡ 2 Gm V 2 ; (3.48) we call r s the strong-encounter radius. Near the Sun, stars have random speeds of V ≈ 30 km s − 1 , and taking m = 0 . 5 M \u0005 gives r s ≈ 1AU. How often does this happen? We know that the Sun has not had a strong encounter in the past 4.5 Gyr; if another star had come so near, it would have disrupted the orbits of the planets. As the Sun moves relative to nearby stars at speed V for a time t , it has a strong encounter with any other stars within a cylinder of radius r s , and volume π r 2 s Vt centred on its path; see Figure 3.4.

(3.49) In Section 2.1 we found that n ≈ 0 . 1pc − 3 for stars near the Sun; so t s ∼ 10 15 years. This is about ten million ‘Galactic years’, and it far exceeds the age of the Universe. Gravity is a much weaker force than the electromagnetic forces between atoms, and, even though stars are by terrestrial standards very massive, they still do not often come close enough for the gravitational attraction of one to cause a large change in another’s orbit. Strong encounters are important only in the dense cores of globular clusters, and in galactic nuclei. 3.2.2 Distant weak encounters For molecules in the air, the electric and magnetic forces of distant particles will tend to cancel each other out, averaging to zero. Thus strong close encounters are overwhelmingly more important in changing their speeds and direction of motion. But gravity is always an attractive force; a star is pulled toward all other stars, however far away. In this section we will see that the cumulative pull of distant stars is more effective over time in changing a star’s direction of motion than are single close encounters. In a distant encounter, the force of one star on another is so weak that the stars hardly deviate from their original paths while the encounter takes place. So we can use the impulse approximation , calculating the forces that the stars would feel as they move along the paths they would follow if they had not been disturbed. We start with a star of mass M in Figure 3.5, moving at speed V along a path that will take it within distance b of a stationary star of mass m . The motion of M is approximately along a straight line; the pull of m gives it a small motion V ⊥ perpendicular to that path. If we measure time from the point of closest approach, the perpendicular force is F ⊥ = Gm M b ( b 2 + V 2 t 2 ) 3 / 2 = M d V ⊥ d t . (3.50)"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"3.2 Why the Galaxy isn’t bumpy : two-body relaxation 127 Upon integrating over time, we find that, long after the encounter, the perpendicular speed of M is \b V ⊥ = 1 M \u0002 ∞ −∞ F ⊥ ( t )d t = 2 Gm bV ; (3.51) the faster M flies past m , the smaller the velocity change. In this approximation, the speed V of M along its orginal direction is unaffected; the force pulling it forward at times t < 0 exactly balances that pulling it back when t > 0. So the path of M is bent through an angle α = \b V ⊥ V = 2 Gm bV 2 . (3.52) Setting V = c here shows that, according to Newtonian gravity, light should be bent by exactly half the angle that General Relativity predicts in Equation 7.13. Momentum in the direction of F ⊥ must be conserved, so after the encounter m is moving toward the path of M at a speed 2 G M / ( bV ). The impulse approx- imation is valid only if the perpendicular motion does not change the relative positions of M and m significantly over the time \b t ∼ b / V during which most of the velocity change takes place. The perpendicular velocity of approach must be small compared with V , so we need b \u0012 2 G ( m + M ) V 2 . (3.53) So a weak encounter requires b to be much larger than r s , the strong-encounter radius of Equation 3.48. As star M proceeds through the Galaxy many stars m will tug at it, each changing its motion by an amount \b V ⊥ , but in different directions. If the forces are random, then we should add the squares of the perpendicular velocities to find the expected value of \b V 2 ⊥ . During time t , the number of stars m passing M with separations between b and b + \b b is just the product of their number density n and the volume Vt · 2 π b \b b in which these encounters can take place. Multiplying by \b V 2 ⊥ from Equation 3.51 and integrating over b gives the expected squared speed: after time t , \u000f \b V 2 ⊥ \u0010 = \u0002 b max b min nV t \u0003 2 Gm bV \u0004 2 2 π b d b = 8 π G 2 m 2 nt V ln \u0003 b max b min \u0004 .

(3.55) It is not clear what value we should take for \u0003 . Our derivation is certainly not valid if b < r s , and we usually take b min = r s and b max to be equal to the size of the whole stellar system. For stars near the Sun, r s = 1 AU, and 300 pc ∼ < b max ∼ < 30 kpc, giving ln \u0003 ≈ 18–22; the exact values of b min and b max are clearly not important. Although the many weak pulls of distant stars change the direction of motion of a star like the Sun more rapidly than do the very infre- quent close encounters, the time required is still ∼ 10 13 yr, much longer than the age of the Universe. So, when calculating the motion of stars like the Sun, we can ignore the pulls of individual stars, and consider all the stars to move in the smoothed-out potential of the entire Galaxy. We will take advantage of this fact in the next section, where we examine the orbits of stars in the Milky Way’s disk. Table 3.1 gives the average random speed σ r and the relaxation time at the centers of a number of Galactic globular clusters. In ω Centauri, the largest, t relax is about 5 Gyr. This is much longer than the time t cross ≈ 0 . 5 Myr that a star takes to move across the core. We can safely calculate the path of a star over a few orbits by using only the smoothed part of the gravitational force. But, to understand how globular clusters change throughout the lifetime of the Galaxy, we must take account of energy exchanges between individual stars. The central parts of most clusters have been affected by relaxation. Problem 3.16 Assuming an average stellar mass of 0.5 M \u0005 and \u0003 = r c / 1AU, use the information in Table 3.1 to find the relaxation time t relax at the center of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Show that the crossing time t cross ≈ 2 r c /σ r ∼ 10 − 3 t relax . The open clusters are comparable in size to globular clusters, but they have much lower densities, typically n ∼ 10 pc − 3 or less, and the stars move more slowly, σ r ∼ 1kms − 1 . For an average stellar mass of 0.5 M \u0005 Equation 3.55 predicts t relax ∼ 50 Myr, while for r c = 2 − 3 pc the crossing time is about 5 Myr. So, within ten crossing times, the cumulative effect of weak encounters can change the stellar orbits radically. It is exceptionally difficult to calculate how the structure"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"3.2 Why the Galaxy isn’t bumpy : two-body relaxation 129 of an open cluster should develop over time. We cannot simply follow the orbits of stars in the smoothed part of the cluster potential; this would give inaccurate results after only a few orbits. But a gravitational N -body simulation, integrating Equation 3.2 accurately to follow the stars through close encounters where their gravitational forces are strong and rapidly varying, would take far too long on a standard computer. A further complication is that the relaxation time is close to the lifetime of a 5 M \u0005 star, and mass lost from aging stars is likely to escape from the cluster. Some progress is being made with specially built computer hardware. In an isolated cluster consisting of N stars with mass m moving at average speed V , the average separation between stars is roughly half the size R of the system. Equation 3.44 then tells us that 1 2 NmV 2 ∼ G ( Nm ) 2 2 R , so \u0003 = R r s ∼ GmN V 2 · V 2 2 Gm ∼ N 2 . (3.56) The crossing time t cross ∼ R / V ; since N = 4 n π R 3 / 3, we have t relax t cross ∼ V 4 R 2 6 NG 2 m 2 ln \u0003 ∼ N 6 ln( N / 2) . (3.57) In a galaxy with N ∼ 10 11 stars, relaxation will be important only after about 10 9 crossing times, much longer than the age of the Universe. Globular clusters contain about 10 6 stars, so for the cluster as a whole t relax ∼ 10 4 t cross ∼ 10 10 yr. In an open cluster with N = 100, as we saw above, the two timescales are almost equal. Gravitational N -body simulations of galaxies generally use between 10 4 and 10 6 ‘stars’ attracting each other by their gravity, according to Equation 3.2. Galax- ies are centrally concentrated, and, in the dense inner regions, crossing times are only 10 6 − 10 7 years. Equation 3.57 shows that, if the ‘stars’ are treated as point masses, particles are pulled right off their original orbits on timescales t relax ∼ < 10 3 t cross ∼ 10 10 yr. These computations cannot be trusted to behave like a real galaxy for longer than a gigayear or two; beyond that, relaxation is important. We can extend this time limit if we can somehow reduce \u0003 . A common tactic is to soften the potential, reducing the attractive force when ‘stars’ come very near each other. For example, we could substitute the potential of a Plummer sphere from Equation 3.11 for that of each point mass. The attractive pull of a ‘star’ of mass M is limited to G M / a 2 p , and so b min ≈ a P . But we pay the price that our model galaxy becomes ‘fuzzy’; we cannot properly include any structures smaller than a few times a P ."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"130 The orbits of the stars Problem 3.17 Gravitational N -body simulations of galactic disks often confine all the particles to a single plane: instead of n stars per unit volume we have N per unit area. The term 2 π b d b in Equation 3.54 is replaced by 2 d b – why? Show that now t relax does not depend on \u0003 , but only on b min , and that taking b min = r s yields t relax / t cross = V 2 / (4 GRm N ). If the mass density m N is fixed, this ratio is independent of the number of simulation particles. 3.2.3 Effects of two-body relaxation While a star moves in the smoothed potential of a star cluster, Equation 3.27 tells us that its orbit does not depend on whether it is heavy or light, but only on its position or velocity. If the smoothed potential \u0010 ( x ) does not change with time, the energy of the star remains constant. By contrast, two-body ‘collisions’ allow two stars to exchange energy and momentum in a way that depends on both their masses; this is known as two-body relaxation . Just as for the air molecules in a room, the exchanges on average will shift the velocities of the stars toward the most probable way of sharing the available energy: this is a Maxwellian distribution. The fraction f of stars with velocities v between v and v + \bv is given by f M ( E )4 πv 2 \bv , where f M ( E ) ∝ exp \u0003 − E k B T \u0004 = exp \u0005 − \u000b m \u0010 ( x ) + m v 2 2 \f\b ( k B T ) \u0006 , (3.58) where k B is Boltzmann’s constant. The ‘temperature’ T depends on the energy of the system: it is higher when the stars are moving faster. The problem below shows that, for stars of mass m , T is related to the average of the squared velocities by 1 2 m v 2 ( x ) \u000b= 3 2 k B T . (3.59) Just as oxygen molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere move less rapidly than the lighter hydrogen molecules, heavier stars in a Maxwellian distribution move on average more slowly than the less massive ones.

The distribution f M ( E ) includes a small number of stars with arbitrarily high energy; but any stars moving faster than the escape speed v e given by Equation 3.28 are not bound to the cluster and will escape. In a cluster of N stars with masses m α at positions x α , Equation 3.33 tells us that the average kinetic energy needed for escape is \r 1 2 m v 2 e ( x ) \u000e =− 1 N \u0013 α m α \u0010 ( x α ) =− 2 N PE = 4 N KE , (3.60) where PE and KE are the potential and kinetic energy of the cluster as a whole; we have used Equation 3.44, the virial theorem, in the last step. The average kinetic energy needed for escape is just four times the average for each star, or 6 k B T ,so the fraction of escaping stars in the Maxwellian distribution f M is \u0002 ∞ √ 12 k B T / m f M ( E ) v 2 d v \b \u0002 ∞ 0 f M ( E ) v 2 d v = 0 . 0074 ≈ 1 136 . (3.61) These stars leave the cluster; after a further time t relax , new stars are promoted above the escape energy, and depart in their turn. The cluster loses a substantial fraction of its stars over an evaporation time t evap ∼ 136 t relax . (3.62) In the observed globular clusters, t evap is longer than the age of the Universe; any clusters with very short evaporation times presumably dissolved before we could observe them. For open clusters t evap is only a few gigayears. In practice, these clusters fall apart even more rapidly, since evaporation is helped along by the repeated gravitational tugs from the spiral arms and from giant clouds of molecular gas in the disk. Two-body relaxation also leads to mass segregation . Heavier stars congregate at the cluster center, while lighter stars are expelled toward the periphery; we see the result in Figure 3.6. If initially the cluster stars are thoroughly mixed, with similar orbital speeds, the more massive stars will have larger kinetic energy. But, in a Maxwellian distribution, their kinetic energies must be equal. Thus, on average, a massive star will be moving slower after a ‘collision’ than it did before. It then sinks to an orbit of lower energy; the cluster center fills up with stars that have too little energy to go anywhere else. But, as the cluster becomes centrally concentrated, these tightly bound stars must move faster than those further out, increasing their tendency to give up energy. Meanwhile, the upwardly mobile lighter stars have gained energy from their encounters, but spend it in moving out to the suburbs. Their new orbits require slower motion than before, so they have become even poorer in kinetic energy."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132 The orbits of the stars 0 5 10 15 0246 1 10 100 Fig. 3.6. In the Pleiades open cluster, stars with masses above M \u0005 (dashed histogram) are more concentrated toward the center than stars with M < M \u0005 (solid histogram) – J. D. Adams. Mass segregation is a runaway process: the lightest stars are pushed outward into an ever-expanding diffuse outer halo, while the heavier stars form an increasingly dense core at the center. Almost all star clusters have been affected by mass segregation. The smallest and least luminous stars, that carry most of the cluster’s mass (recall Figure 2.3), are dispersed far from the center. So we must be careful to trace them when estimating the cluster’s mass or the stellar mass function. Pairs of stars bound in a tight binary will effectively behave like a single more-massive star, sinking to the core. The X-ray sources in globular clusters are binaries in which a main-sequence star orbits a white dwarf or neutron star; they are all found near the cluster center. Even if all the stars in a cluster have exactly the same mass, stars on low- energy orbits close to the center have higher orbital speeds than do those further out. So the inner stars tend to lose energy, while the outer stars gain it. Over time, some stars are expelled from the cluster core into the expanding halo, while the remaining core contracts. The core becomes denser, while the outer parts puff up and become more diffuse. Calculations for clusters of equal-mass stars predict that, after (12–20) t relax , the core radius shrinks to zero, as the central density increases without limit: this is core collapse . A cluster that is near this state should have a small dense core and a diffuse halo, as we see for M15 in Figure 3.7. What happens to a cluster after core collapse? In the dense core, binary stars become important sources of energy. Just as two-body ‘collisions’ tend to remove energy from fast-moving stars, so encounters between single stars and a tight binary pair will on average take energy from the binary. The energy is transferred to the single star, while the binary is forced closer. Depending on how many are present, binaries may supply so much energy to the stars around them that the core of the cluster starts to re-expand."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"3.3 Orbits of disk stars : epicycles 133 0.1 1 10 1 10 100 0.1 1 10 100 0.5 5 50 10 100 1000 0.1 1 10 100 0.1 1 10 Fig. 3.7.

From now on, when we refer to gravitational forces or potentials, we will mean this averaged quantity. Often, the smoothed potential has some symmetries which simplify the orbit calculations. In this section, we look at the orbits of stars in an axisymmetric galaxy. Like the planets circling the Sun, the stars in the Milky Way’s disk follow orbits that are nearly, but not quite, circular, and lie almost in the same plane. In the Galactocentric cylindrical polar coordinates ( R ,φ, z ) of Section 1.2, the midplane of the disk is at z = 0 and the center at R = 0. If we are prepared to overlook non-axisymmetric structures such as an inner bar, the spiral arms, and local features such as Gould’s Belt (Section 2.2), the smoothed gravitational potential is independent of φ . Thus ∂\u0010/∂φ = 0, and there is no force in the φ direction; a star conserves its angular momentum about the axis z . On writing L z for the z angular momentum per unit mass, for each star we have d d t ( R 2 ̇ φ ) = 0 , so L z ≡ R 2 ̇ φ = constant . (3.64) Since the potential does not change with time, \u0010 = \u0010 ( R , z ). We can write the equation of motion in the radial direction as ̈ R = R ̇ φ 2 − ∂\u0010 ∂ R =− ∂\u0010 eff ∂ R , where \u0010 eff ≡ \u0010 ( R , z ) + L z 2 2 R 2 . (3.65) The effective potential \u0010 eff ( R , z ; L z ) behaves like a potential energy for the star’s motion in R and z . By the same reasoning as that which led us to Equation 3.27, multiplying Equation 3.65 by ̇ R and integrating shows that, for a star moving in the midplane z = 0, 1 2 ̇ R 2 + \u0010 eff ( R , z = 0; L z ) = constant . (3.66) Figure 3.8 shows \u0010 eff ( R , z = 0; L z ) for the Plummer potential of Equation 3.11. Since ̇ R 2 ≥ 0, the L 2 z term in \u0010 eff acts as an ‘angular-momentum barrier’, pre- venting a star with L z \u0014= 0 from coming closer to the axis R = 0 than some perigalactic radius where ̇ R = 0. Unless it has enough energy to escape from the Galaxy, each star must remain within some apogalactic outer limit. The star’s vertical motion is given by ̈ z =− ∂\u0010 ∂ z ( R , z ) =− ∂\u0010 eff ∂ z ( R , z ) . (3.67) If the ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ halves of the disk are mirror images of each other, then \u0010 ( R , z ) = \u0010 ( R , − z ), and the z force is zero in the plane z = 0. Let R g be the average value of R for the star’s orbit; we will define it more precisely below.

The vertical dashed line marks the guiding center R g ; the star oscillates about R g between inner and outer limiting radii. only as large as z 2 / R 2 or ( R − R g ) 2 / R 2 by keeping the leading term alone.

So this is the equation of a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency ν ; z = Z cos( ν t + θ ), for some constants Z and θ . In a flattened galaxy, ν ( R ) is larger than the angular speed \u0002 ( R ) in a circular orbit. A star with angular momentum L z can follow an exactly circular orbit with ̇ R = 0 only at the radius R g where the effective potential \u0010 eff is stationary with respect to R . There, Equation 3.65 tells us that ∂\u0010 ∂ R ( R g , z = 0) = L 2 z R 3 g = R g \u0002 2 ( R g ) , (3.69) where \u0002 ( R ) is the angular speed of the circular orbit in the plane z = 0.

We can show that it approximately follows an elliptical epicycle around its guiding center , which moves with angular speed \u0002 ( R g ) in a circular orbit of radius R g . To derive the epicyclic equations, we set R = R g + x in Equation 3.65.

When κ 2 > 0, this equation describes harmonic motion with the epicyclic frequency κ .If κ 2 < 0, the circular orbit is unstable, and the star moves away from it at an exponentially increasing rate. From the definition of \u0010 eff in Equation 3.65, and recalling that R \u0002 2 ( R ) = ∂\u0010 ( R , z = 0) /∂ R in a circular orbit, κ 2 ( R ) = d d R [ R \u0002 2 ( R )] + 3 L 2 z R 4 = 1 R 3 d d R [( R 2 \u0002 ) 2 ] =− 4 B \u0002, (3.71) where B is Oort’s constant, defined in Section 2.3. Locally, B < 0, so κ 2 is positive and near-circular orbits like that of our Sun are, fortunately, stable. The angular momentum on a circular orbit is R 2 \u0002 ( R ); we see that, if it increases outward at radius R , the circular orbit there is stable. This condition always holds for circular orbits in galaxy-like potentials. Near a static black hole of mass M , however, the last stable circular orbit is at R = 6 G M / c 2 ; those at smaller radii are unstable. Problem 3.20 Effective potentials have many uses. The motion of a star around a non-rotating black hole of mass M BH is given by \u0003 d r d τ \u0004 2 = E 2 − \u0003 c 2 − 2 G M BH r \u0004\u0003 1 + L 2 c 2 r 2 \u0004 ≡ E 2 − 2 \u0010 eff ( r ); (3.72) we can interpret r as distance from the center, and τ as time.

The star moves in an elliptical epicycle around its guiding center at ( x = 0, y = 0), which is carried around the Galactic center with angular speed \u0002 ( R g ). During its epicyclic motion, the star’s azimuthal speed ̇ φ must vary so that the angular momentum L z remains constant: ̇ φ = L z R 2 = \u0002 ( R g ) R 2 g ( R g + x ) 2 ≈ \u0002 ( R g ) \u0003 1 − 2 x R g + ··· \u0004 .

Here, the first two terms give the guiding center’s motion. The third represents harmonic motion with the same frequency as the x oscillation in radius, but 90 ◦ out of phase, and larger by a factor of 2 \u0002/κ (see Figure 3.9). The epicyclic motion is retrograde , namely in the opposite sense to the guiding center’s motion; it speeds the star up closer to the center, slowing it down when it is further out. In two simple cases, the epicyclic frequency κ is a multiple of the angular speed \u0002 of the guiding center. In the gravitational field of a point mass, \u0002 ( r ) ∝ r − 3 / 2 and so κ = \u0002 . The star’s orbit is an ellipse with the attracting mass at one focus; the epicycles are twice as long in the φ direction as in x , rather than circular, as assumed by Ptolemy, Copernicus, and others who used epicycles to describe planetary motions. Within a sphere of uniform density, \u0002 ( R ) is constant and κ = 2 \u0002 . A star moves harmonically in an ellipse which is symmetric about the center, making two excursions in and out during one circuit around, and the epicycles are circular. The potential of the Galaxy is intermediate between these two, so that \u0002<κ< 2 \u0002 . Near the Sun, κ ≈ 1 . 4 \u0002 .

Near the Sun, the period of the epicycles is about 170 Myr, far too long for us to watch stars complete their circuits. But we can measure the velocities of stars close to us, at R ≈ R 0 . Some of these will have guiding centers further out than the Sun, so they are on the inner parts of their epicycles, while others have their guiding centers at smaller radii. Because of its epicyclic motion, a nearby star with its guiding center at R g > R 0 moves faster in the tangential direction than a circular orbit at our radius.

The dispersion in velocities v x and v y for F and G dwarfs near the Sun increases with age. The youngest stars show a vertex deviation : v x and v y tend to have the same sign.

Since κ< 2 \u0002 , v 2 y \u000b < v 2 x \u000b ; even though the epicycles are longer in the tangential y direction, the nearby stars have larger random speeds in the radial x direction. The tangential velocity dispersion is reduced because the epicycles of stars that come from further out in the Galaxy are carrying them in the same direction as the Galactic rotation, augmenting the slower motion of their guiding centers. Conversely, the epicyclic motion of stars visiting from smaller radii opposes their faster guiding-center motion.

The observant reader will have noticed that, in averaging, we did not take account of any radial variations in the density of stars. In fact, the stellar density is higher in the inner Galaxy, so that near the Sun we see more stars with guiding centers at smaller radii than stars that visit us from the outer Galaxy. The majority of stars will be on the outer parts of their epicycles, with x > 0; so, according to Equation 3.76, the average tangential motion of stars near the Sun should fall behind the circular velocity. This prediction is borne out in Figure 3.11 and Table 2.1; the average v y \u000b is negative, an effect known as asymmetric drift . The drift is stronger for groups of older stars, with larger random speeds, since their orbits deviate further from circular motion.

We can also describe the stars in a galaxy as we usually describe atoms in a gas: not by following the path of each atom, but by asking about the density of atoms in a particular region and about their average motion. For simplicity, we assume here that all the stars have the same mass m . The distribution function f ( x , v , t ) gives the probability density in the six- dimensional phase space of ( x , v ). The average number of particles (stars or atoms) in a cube of sides \b x ,\b y , and \b z centred at x , that have x velocity between v x and v x + \bv x , y velocity between v y and v y + \bv y , and z velocity between v z and v z + \bv z ,is f ( x , v , t ) \b x \b y \b z \bv x \bv y \bv z .

(3.81) We want to find equations to relate changes in the density and the distribution function, as stars move about in the Galaxy, to the gravitational potential \u0010 ( x , t ). For simplicity, we look at stars moving only in one direction, x . At time t , the number of stars between x and x + \b x in the ‘box’ of Figure 3.12 is n ( x , t ) \b x . Suppose that these stars move at speed v ( x ) > 0; how does n ( x ) change with time? After a time \b t , all the stars that are now between x − v ( x ) \b t and x will have entered the box, while those now within distance v ( x + \b x ) \b t of the end will have left it. So the average number of stars in the box changes according to \b x [ n ( x , t + \b t ) − n ( x , t )] ≈ n ( x , t ) v ( x ) \b t − n ( x + \b x , t ) v ( x + \b x , t ) \b t .

For example, if v> 0 and ∂ n /∂ x > 0, as in Figure 3.12, the density of stars in our box must fall with time.

Flow in and out of a box in the phase space ( x ,v ) is described by the collisionless Boltzmann equation. acting on individual stars. To derive it, we assume that two-body encounters are unimportant, so that the acceleration d v / d t of an individual star depends only on the smoothed potential \u0010 ( x , t ). In Figure 3.13, we look at stars in the center box; these lie between x and x + \b x and move at speeds between v and v + \bv . After a time \b t , we again find that stars now between x − v\b t and x will have entered the box, while those now within distance v\b t of the end have left it. Here we have specified x and v independently, so v does not depend on x . The number of stars in the box has increased by approximately \bv \b t [ v f ( x ,v, t ) − v f ( x + \b x ,v, t )] ≈− v\b x \bv \b t ∂ f ∂ x . (3.84) But the number of stars in the center box also changes because the stars’ speeds are altered by the applied forces. Suppose that d v/ d t > 0, so that stars are all being accelerated in the x direction. Then, after time \b t , they will all be moving faster by approximately \b t · d v/ d t . Stars now moving with speeds between v and v − \b t · d v/ d t will have come into the center box, because they will be moving at speeds faster than v , while those with speeds now just below v + \bv will have left it.

But a star’s acceleration does not depend on how fast it is moving, only on its position: d v/ d t =− ∂\u0010 ( x , t ) /∂ x . Thus we have the one-dimensional collisionless Boltzmann equation: ∂ f ∂ t + v ∂ f ∂ x − ∂\u0010 ∂ x ( x , t ) · ∂ f ∂v = 0 .

(3.87) Equation 3.87 holds if stars are neither created nor destroyed, and if they also change their positions and velocities smoothly. Close encounters between stars can alter their velocities much faster than their motion changes in the smoothed potential. When these are important, we include their effects as an extra ‘colli- sional’ term on the right-hand side. Often, we do not solve the collisionless Boltzmann equation explicitly, but rather integrate to take velocity-moments. Integrating Equation 3.86 over velocity, and using the definitions 3.80 and 3.81, we find ∂ n ( x , t ) ∂ t + ∂ ∂ x ( n ( x , t ) v ( x , t ) \u000b ) − ∂\u0010 ∂ x ( x , t )[ f ] ∞ −∞ = 0 . (3.88) When f ( x ,v, t ) is well behaved, tending to zero as | v |→∞ , the last term is zero. We arrive back at Equation 3.83, with the velocity v = v ( x , t ) \u000b . Multiplying Equation 3.86 by v and then integrating gives ∂ ∂ t [ n ( x , t ) v ( x , t ) \u000b ] + ∂ ∂ x [ n ( x , t ) v 2 ( x , t ) \u000b ] =− n ( x , t ) ∂\u0010 ∂ x ; (3.89) here the average of the squared velocity v 2 \u000b is defined just as for v \u000b , and we have integrated by parts, assuming that f v → 0as | v |→∞ . The velocity dispersion σ is defined by v 2 ( x , t ) \u000b= v ( x , t ) \u000b 2 + σ 2 ; rearranging terms with the help of Equation 3.88 and dividing by n ,wehave ∂ v \u000b ∂ t + v \u000b ∂ v \u000b ∂ x =− ∂\u0010 ∂ x − 1 n ∂ ∂ x [ n σ 2 ( x , t )] . (3.90) This is analogous to Euler’s equation of fluid mechanics, with the term in σ 2 replacing the pressure force − ∂ p /∂ x . In a fluid, the equation of state specifies the pressure at a given density and temperature. For a stellar system there is no such relation; but sometimes we can make progress by using measured quantities, as in the next subsection. 3.4.1 Mass density in the Galactic disk We can use the collisionless Boltzmann equation and the observed vertical motions of stars to find the mass in the Galactic disk near the Sun. We select a tracer population of stars (for example, the K dwarf stars) and measure its density n ( z ) at height z above the disk’s midplane. Our coordinates are now ( z ,v z ) instead of ( x ,v ). We assume that the potential \u0010 ( z ) does not change with time, and that our stars are well mixed , so that the distribution function f and the density n are also"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"144 The orbits of the stars time-steady. Looking high above the plane, v z \u000b n ( z ) → 0; so Equation 3.88 tells us that the mean velocity v z \u000b = 0 everywhere. In Equation 3.90, we write σ z for the velocity dispersion; the terms on the left-hand side vanish, giving d d z \t n ( z ) σ 2 z =− ∂\u0010 ∂ z n ( z ) . (3.91) So, if we measure how the density of our stars and their velocity dispersion change with z , we can find the vertical force at any height. Poisson’s equation, Equation 3.9, relates that force to the mass density ρ ( x ) of the Galaxy. Assuming that the Milky Way is axisymmetric, so that ρ and \u0010 depend only on ( R , z ), we have 4 π G ρ ( R , z ) =∇ 2 \u0010 ( R , z ) = ∂ 2 \u0010 ∂ z 2 + 1 R ∂ ∂ R \u0003 R ∂\u0010 ∂ R \u0004 . (3.92) The density ρ ( R , z ) here includes all the mass in the disk: luminous stars, gas, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, black holes, and dark matter. Writing ∂\u0010/∂ R = V 2 ( R ) / R , where V ( R ) is the rotation speed in a circular orbit at radius R ,wehave 4 π G ρ ( R , z ) = d d z \u0005 − 1 n ( z ) d d z \t n ( z ) σ 2 z \u0006 + 1 R d d R [ V 2 ( R )] . (3.93) Near the Sun, V ( R ) is nearly constant, so the last term is very small. The density ρ ( R 0 , 0) in the midplane of the disk has recently been estimated from the velocities of nearby A stars, measured with the Hipparcos satellite, to be in the range (70–100) M \u0005 per 1000 pc 3 . To find the volume density ρ , the observationally determined quantity n ( z ) has to be differentiated twice, which amplifies small errors. We can more accurately determine the surface mass density \u0017 ( < z ) within some distance z of the midplane. Assuming that the disk is symmetric about z = 0, we integrate Equation 3.93 to find 2 π G \u0017 ( < z ) ≡ 2 π G \u0002 z − z ρ ( z \u0006 )d z \u0006 ≈− 1 n ( z ) d d z \t n ( z ) σ 2 z . (3.94) Jan Oort in 1932 was the first to try this, measuring n ( z ) for bright F dwarfs and K giants. He assumed that σ z did not vary with height, and found that \u0017 ( < 700 pc) ≈ 90 M \u0005 pc − 2 . But, beyond a kiloparsec from the midplane, the function he derived for \u0017 ( < z ) began to decrease , indicating anti-gravitating matter with ρ ( z ) < 0, or, more probably, a failure of the hypothesis that σ z is constant. Recent work with fainter K dwarf stars, which are more numerous and more evenly spread out in space, indicates that σ z increases with height. At 250 pc from the plane, the vertical dispersion σ z ≈ 20 km s − 1 , growing to 30 km s − 1 at"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"3.4 The collisionless Boltzmann equation 145 z ∼ 1 kpc; at greater heights, a larger fraction of the stars belongs to the thick disk. Taking account of the increasing dispersion, these studies find \u0017 ( < 1100 pc) ≈ (70–80 M \u0005 pc − 2 . Some of this mass must be in the halo, so the surface density of the disk itself is probably between 50 M \u0005 and 60 M \u0005 pc − 2 . We can compare this dynamical estimate with the mass that has been observed in gas and stars. Near the Sun, molecular gas probably amounts to ∼ 2 M \u0005 pc − 2 . There is roughly 8 M \u0005 pc − 2 of neutral atomic hydrogen, and about 2 M \u0005 pc − 2 of ionized gas, though all these numbers are uncertain by at least 30%. Main-sequence stars more massive than M dwarfs, and the giants, are easily counted in surveys; making allowance for the hard-to-find low-mass stars and stellar remnants such as white dwarfs and neutron stars gives a total of about (25–40) M \u0005 pc − 2 in stars. Thus the mass in gas and stars is (40–55) M \u0005 pc − 2 . We see that the disk does not contain much of the Galaxy’s ‘dark matter’. Problem 3.24 Use the divergence theorem to show that the potential at height z above a uniform sheet of matter with surface density \u0017 is \u0010 ( x ) = 2 π G \u0017 | z | . (3.95) Show that the vertical force does not depend on z , and check that ∇ 2 \u0010 = 0 when z \u0014= 0. Suppose that the mass of the Galaxy was all in a flat uniform disk; use Equation 3.91 to find the density n ( z ) of K dwarfs, assuming that they have a constant velocity dispersion σ z . As in the Earth’s atmosphere, where the acceleration of gravity is also nearly independent of height, show that n ( z ) drops by a factor of e as | z | increases by h z = σ 2 z / (2 π G \u0017 ). Estimate h z near the Sun, taking σ z = 20 km s − 1 . 3.4.2 Integrals of motion, and some of their uses Often we are interested in solutions of the collisionless Boltzmann equation that describe stars moving in an unchanging gravitational potential \u0010 ( x ), such that their distribution function is also constant. Then, it is frequently useful to write f ( x , v ) in terms of integrals of the motion . These are functions I ( x , v ) of a star’s position x and velocity v that remain constant along its orbit. One example is the energy per unit mass, E ( x ,v ) = v 2 / 2 + \u0010 ( x ), which is an integral of the motion whenever the potential \u0010 ( x ) does not depend on time. In an axisymmetric potential \u0010 ( R , z , t ), the z component of the angular momentum L z is an integral; in a spherical potential, the total angular momentum L is an integral. For any function I that is constant along the orbit, we have d d t I ( x , v ) ≡ ∂ x ∂ t ·∇ I + ∂ v ∂ t · ∂ I ∂ v = 0 , or v ·∇ I −∇ \u0010 · ∂ I ∂ v = 0 . (3.96)"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146 The orbits of the stars This looks suspiciously like Equation 3.87, which we can write as d f d t ≡ ∂ f ∂ t + v · ∂ f ∂ x + ∂ v ∂ t · ∂ f ∂ v = 0 . (3.97) So the phase-space density f ( x , v , t ) around any particular star remains constant along its orbit. Where the density n ( x ) becomes higher, the dispersion in velocities of the surrounding stars must increase, and any function f ( x , v ) that is a time- independent solution to the collisionless Boltzmann equation is itself an integral of the motion. Conversely, if f ( I 1 , I 2 ,... ) is any function of integrals of the motion I 1 , I 2 ,... , then f is a steady-state solution of the equations of motion. Often it is easy to write down at least some of the integrals of motion, and this is one way to get started on constructing time-steady solutions of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. For example, Equation 3.68 tells us that, for disk stars on nearly circular orbits, motion perpendicular to the Galactic disk is independent of that in the disk plane, so the energy of vertical motion E z = \u0010 ( R 0 , z ) + v 2 z / 2 is an integral of motion. If we select some tracer population of stars that are easy to find and measure, and which are also well mixed so that their distribution function f ( z ,v z ) is not changing with time, we can write f ( z ,v z ) = f ( E z ) = f \u0003 \u0010 ( R 0 , z ) + 1 2 v 2 z \u0004 . (3.98) If we guessed at f ( E z ) and the potential \u0010 ( R 0 , z ), we could integrate f over velocities to find the corresponding density n ( z ) and the velocity dispersion σ z at any height z . Conversely, if we measured n ( z ) and guessed at f ( E z ), we could find the potential \u0010 ( R 0 , z ) by using Equation 3.91. For example, we could take f ( E z ) = n 0 √ 2 πσ 2 exp( − E z /σ 2 ) for E z < 0; (3.99) stars with E z ≥ 0 would escape, so we must set f = 0 there. Integrating over v z shows the density n and velocity dispersion σ z to be n ( z ) = n 0 exp[ − \u0010 ( R 0 , z ) /σ 2 ] , and σ z = σ. (3.100) If n ( z ) and σ 2 are measured, we can calculate the potential \u0010 ( R 0 , z ) by using Equation 3.91; if \u0010 and σ 2 are known, we can find the corresponding density n ( z ). If we also have some reason to think that the stars described by the dis- tribution function f provide all the gravitational force, then the density n ( x , t )"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"3.4 The collisionless Boltzmann equation 147 found by integrating f ( x , v , t ) over velocities must be equal to the density ρ ( x , t ) in Poisson’s Equation 3.9. In this case, we say that f provides a self- consistent model for the system. Many different self-consistent models can give rise to the same gravitational potential \u0010 ( x , t ); the density n ( x , t ) is the same for all of these, but the form of f , and hence the velocities of the stars, will be different. Problem 3.25 For stars moving vertically in the Galactic disk, suppose the distribution function f ( z ,v z ) to be given by Equation 3.99. When the disk is symmetric about the plane z = 0, then d \u0010 ( z ) / d z = 0at z = 0, and we can choose \u0010 (0) = 0 too. Find the integral giving the density of stars n ( z ): what is n (0)? To construct a self-consistent model, let \u0010 ( z ) = σ 2 φ ( z ), and let the average mass of the stars be m ; show from Poisson’s equation that 2d 2 φ/ d y 2 = e − φ , where y = z / z 0 and z 2 0 = σ 2 / (8 π Gmn 0 ) . Integrate this once to find d φ/ d y , and then again (substituting u = e − φ/ 2 )to find φ ( y ) and hence \u0010 ( z ). Show that the number density of stars is n ( z ) = n 0 sech 2 [ z / (2 z 0 )]. What is its approximate form at large | z | ? In a spherically symmetric gravitational potential \u0010 ( r ), any function f ( E , L ) of the energy E and angular momentum L per unit mass that does not include any unbound stars will describe one possible steady distribution of stars in that gravitational field. If we choose f = f ( E ) then the random speeds are isotropic , the same in all directions. Problem 3.26 When the distribution function for stars in a spherical system depends only on their energy, so that f ( x , v , t ) = f ( E ), explain why the velocity dispersion is the same in all directions: \u000f v 2 x \u0010 ≡ 1 n ( x ) \u0002 f \u000b \u0010 ( x ) + v 2 2 \f v 2 x d v x d v y d v z = \u000f v 2 y \u0010 = \u000f v 2 z \u0010 . (3.101) If we choose a form for f ( E ), we can then calculate the density n ( r )as a function of the potential \u0010 ( r ). Then we use Poisson’s equation to find which potentials \u0010 ( r ) lead to a self-consistent model, with n ( r ) ∝ ρ ( r ). For the Plummer sphere, we can combine Equations 3.11 and 3.12 to find ρ P ( r ) =− 3 a 2 p 4 π G 5 M 4 \u0010 5 P ( r ) .

(3.104) Defining a new variable θ by v 2 =− 2 \u0010 ( r )cos 2 θ , we can integrate to show that n ( r ) ∝ ( − \u0010 ) N . Thus the distribution function f P ( E ) = k ( − E ) 7 / 2 gives a self-consistent model for the Plummer sphere. Its mass M is proportional to the constant k , while the depth of the central potential \u0010 ( r = 0) sets the radius a P . Problem 3.27 Fill in the algebraic steps needed to derive Equations 3.102– 3.104. By analogy with expression 3.99, we might also try the isothermal distribution function f I ( E ) = n 0 (2 πσ 2 ) 3 / 2 exp \u0005 − \u000b \u0010 ( r ) + v 2 2 \f\b σ 2 \u0006 for E < 0 , (3.105) as a first guess for representing a spherical galaxy or star cluster.

(3.106) To find \u0010 ( r ), we must integrate this equation outward from r = 0. If the potential is smooth at the center, the radial force there must be zero, so we must start with d \u0010/ d r = 0. But, however we choose \u0010 ( r = 0), we find that the total mass is infinite. We should have expected this result, since, if the mass had been finite, the escape speed v e of Equation 3.28 would drop below the average random speed σ at some radius. But that would contradict our assumption that all the stars were bound to the system. Problem 3.28 Show that, in the potential \u0010 SIS of Equation 3.14, the density ρ ( r ) corresponding to f I ( E ) is exactly equal to ρ SIS ,if σ 2 = 2 π G ρ 0 r 2 0 , and all the stars have mass m so that ρ 0 ≡ mn 0 = ρ ( r 0 ).

(3.107) When we integrate this to find n ( r ), and then solve Poisson’s equation, the term ‘ − 1’ acts to reduce the number of stars with high kinetic energy in the outer regions. The average random speed decreases and the density drops abruptly to zero at some truncation radius corresponding to the outer radius r t of Table 2.3 and Figure 3.7. Including a term involving angular momentum alters the balance between stars on nearly circular orbits and those that follow eccentric orbits. For example, the distribution function f A ( E , L ) = f K ( E )exp \t − L 2 \u0015 2 σ 2 r 2 a \u0016 (3.108) leads to a density n ( r ) which is not very different from that associated with f K ( E ), but it describes a cluster with fewer stars on the near-circular orbits that have high angular momentum. The effect is especially strong in the outer regions, where the angular momentum of a circular orbit is largest; outside the anisotropy radius r a , stars have a decided preference for nearly radial orbits. We see evi- dence for this kind of velocity distribution in some globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. If the distribution function f depends on only one component of the angular momentum, for example L z , it can describe a system that is flattened along the z axis. For example, if f ( E , L z ) = ̃ f ( E ) L 2 z for E > 0 , (3.109) for some function ̃ f , then very few stars have orbits taking them close to the z axis, with L z ≈ 0, but relatively many will follow near-circular orbits in the equatorial plane, with large L z . Postulating that f = f ( E , L z ) seems at first sight to be useful for describing the motions of stars in the Galactic disk. Since v R and v z enter the expression for f in the same way, stars must have equal random motions in those two directions: n ( x ) \u000f v 2 z \u0010 ≡ \u0002 f \u000b \u0010 ( x ) + v 2 2 , R v φ \f v 2 z d v R d v φ d v z = n ( x ) \u000f v 2 R \u0010 .

They cannot have a distribution f ( E , L z ), but f must depend on a third integral of motion. Curiously, it can be proven that, in a general axisymmetric potential \u0010 ( R , z ), there is no function of position and velocity other than E and L z that is conserved along a star’s orbit. This dynamical puzzle will resurface in Section 6.2, when we discuss stellar motions in elliptical galaxies. Further reading: J. Binney and S.

Figure 4.1 shows the brighter members. The three most prominent are M31, the Milky Way, and M33; according to the classification of Section 1.3, these are all spiral galaxies. M31 is about 50% more luminous than the Milky Way, while M33 is only 20% as luminous. Between them, these three galaxies emit 90% of the visible light of the Local Group. The only elliptical galaxy is M32, a satellite to M31. The remaining systems are irregular galaxies, or the even less luminous dwarf irregulars, dwarf ellipticals, and dwarf spheroidals. Many of these smaller galaxies are in orbit either around the Milky Way or around M31. Table 4.1 lists known and probable members of the Local Group within a megaparsec of the Sun. The apparent brightness of each member is generally known to within 10%, except for the Milky Way, where our location within the disk presents special problems. Distances to Local Group galaxies are derived by picking out individual stars, measuring their apparent brightness, and estimating their true luminosity, using methods such as the period–luminosity relation for Cepheid variables. In this way, distances to the ten or so brightest galaxies can be measured to within 10%. But fewer stars are available in the less luminous galaxies, so the distances are less certain; for some dwarfs, they are known to no better than a factor of two. Galaxies are not scattered at random within the Local Group; many small members are satellites of M31 or the Milky Way. The right-hand part of Figure 4.2 shows that most of the Milky Way’s 11 known satellites lie close to a single plane – they may have formed from a single gas cloud captured into an orbit around the Milky Way. The Andromeda galaxy also has its brood of satellites; but many small systems are ‘free fliers’, remote from any larger galaxy.

We can measure proper motions only for the Milky Way’s immediate satellite galaxies (what proper motion corresponds to V t = 120 km s − 1 at a distance of 100 kpc?). Even these are difficult, because we must use faint distant quasars and galaxies to define our nonmoving frame of reference. But the radial velocities are easily found. They are almost all within 60 km s − 1 of the common motion of the Milky Way and M31; the Local Group galaxies have too little kinetic energy to escape.

About half of all galaxies are found in clusters or groups a few megaparsecs across, and are dense enough that their gravity has by now halted the cosmological expansion. The other half lie in looser clouds and associations, within large walls and long filaments such as those in Figure 8.3; these structures are collapsing, or at least are expanding much more slowly than the Universe as a whole. Just as the Sun is a typical star, intermediate in its mass and luminosity, so the Local Group is a typical galactic environment: it is less dense than a galaxy cluster like Virgo or Coma, but contains enough mass to bind the galaxies together. The concentration of galaxies in our Local Group presents an opportunity to study a variety of systems at close range. In particular, we can distinguish, or resolve , individual stars in these nearby galaxies. As with Galactic clusters, we can compare their color–magnitude diagrams with the predictions of stellar-structure theories, to determine how the stellar population has built up.

These gas-rich galaxies are forming new stars and star clusters in abundance. John Herschel, who extended his father William’s nebula-hunting to the southern skies, noted in 1851 that ‘ there are nebulae in abundance, both regular and irregular; globular clusters in every state of condensation; and objects of a nebulous character quite peculiar, which have no analogue in any other region of the heavens. Such is the concentration of these objects [star clusters] ... which very far exceeds the average of any other, even the most crowded part of the nebular heavens ’( Outlines of Astronomy , Longmans, London, p. 164). Like the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds have stars and star clusters with a wide range of ages. They contain variable stars, which we can compare with those of our Galaxy, and calibrate for use as ‘standard candles’ in estimating distances to galaxies beyond the Local Group. By contrast, the Galaxy’s dwarf spheroidal companions are so diffuse that they are almost invisible on the sky. These systems of elderly and middle-aged stars contain hardly any gaseous material from which to make fresh stars. The stars of the dwarf spheroidals contain so little mass that some of these small galaxies may be in the process of dissolving, as they are pulled apart by the Milky Way’s gravitational field. 4.1.1 The Magellanic Clouds The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) measures 15 ◦ × 13 ◦ on the sky, so its long dimension is about 14 kpc; the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) covers 7 ◦ × 4 ◦ , extending roughly 8 kpc. The LMC has about 10% of the Milky Way’s luminosity, L ≈ 2 × 10 9 L \u0005 , and is the fourth most luminous member of the Local Group; the SMC is about ten times fainter; see Table 4.1. The LMC, the prototype of the Sm class of ‘Magellanic spirals’, is basically a flat disk, tilted by about 45 ◦ relative to the plane of the sky; the rotation speed measured from the H I gas reaches 80 km s − 1 .

The H α map of the LMC shows holes, loops, and filaments, which are also present in the H I disk (Figure 4.4). Some of these coincide with sites of recent starbirth, where supernovae and the winds of hot stars have given the surrounding interstellar gas enough momentum to push the cooler H I gas aside, forming a large hot bubble. This morphology is typical of irregular galaxies; see Section 4.4. Each of the Magellanic Clouds contains several hundred million solar masses of neutral hydrogen. The ratio of the H I mass to the luminosity in blue light (both being measured in solar units) is a useful measure of a galaxy’s progress in converting gas into stars. For the Milky Way, M (H I ) / L B ≈ 0 . 1, for the LMC it is about 0.3, and for the SMC and irregular galaxies, M (H I ) / L B ∼ 1. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies contain hardly any H I gas.

Problem 4.1 Use the data of Tables 1.4–1.6 to estimate approximate spectral types for the brightest stars of the LMC, in the right-hand panel of Figure 4.5. The Magellanic Clouds are in orbit about each other, and they also orbit the Milky Way in a plane passing almost over the Galactic pole. Just as an Earth satellite loses energy to the resistance of the upper atmosphere, so the orbit of the Clouds is slowly decaying as energy is drained into random motions of stars in the Galaxy; we will discuss this process further in Section 5.6. We can explain the present positions and velocities of the Magellanic Clouds and the Stream if the Clouds are on an eccentric plunging orbit around the Galaxy, with a period of about 2 Gyr, and made their closest approach to the Milky Way between 200 and 400 million years ago. The centers of the Large and Small Clouds are now about 25 kpc apart, but they probably came within 10 kpc of each other during their last perigalactic passage.

The Magellanic Clouds are extremely rich in star clusters. They are close enough to distinguish individual main-sequence stars; so, just as in Section 2.2, we can use color–magnitude diagrams of these clusters to find their ages, distances, and chemical compositions. On comparing the apparent brightness of those stars that are still on the main sequence in the LMC’s clusters with that of stars in the Galactic open clusters, we find that the LMC is 50 kpc from the Sun. This is about the same distance as we estimated in Section 2.2, from observations of gas around SN 1987a. Measuring the rotation speed in the LMC’s H I disk and using Equation 3.20 yields a mass of (1.5–2) × 10 10 M \u0005 within about 11 kpc of its center. For the SMC, by comparing the stars on the giant branch in its old clusters with those in Galactic globular clusters, and from its variable stars, we find a distance of around 60 kpc. The LMC has some globular clusters similar to those of our Milky Way, although somewhat less dense. They are old ( ≥ 10 Gyr) and poor in heavy elements: some have less than 1 / 100 of the solar abundance of metals. In contrast to the Milky Way, the old metal-poor stars and clusters do not form a metal-poor halo; instead, they lie in a thickened disk. Their random motions are σ r ≈ 25 − 35 km s − 1 , larger than the ∼ 10 km s − 1 found for the H I clouds. The metal-poor objects show strong asymmetric drift (see Section 2.2); they rotate at only 50 km s − 1 , more slowly than the gas disk. Hardly any of the LMC’s clusters have ages in the range 4 − 10 Gyr; this galaxy may have made very few stars during that period. There are many younger clusters and associations; some of these may have formed about 50 Myr ago, when the LMC and SMC had their last close passage. Some of these are 100 times more populous than most Galactic open clusters; they may be young versions of the LMC’s globular clusters. The most luminous is the cluster R136 in nebula 30 Doradus, which is the very bright peak on the left in the H α map of Figure 4.4. The cluster is about 3.5 Myr old, and in blue light its luminosity L B ≈ 10 7 L \u0005 . The youngest stars, and the interstellar gas, are the richest in heavy elements, with a third to a half of the solar proportion of metals. The star clusters of the SMC cover the same age range as found in the LMC, but there is no gap in time during which few clusters were formed. The bulk of their stars may have intermediate ages, between a few gigayears and ∼ 12 Gyr. The gas and youngest star clusters are poorer in metals than those of the LMC, with only 20% − 30% of the solar abundance. 4.1.2 Variable stars as ‘standard candles’ The RR Lyrae and Cepheid variable stars are useful for finding distances to galax- ies within the Local Group and beyond.

L ≈ 50 L \u0005 , and varying in brightness with periods of about half a day. Cepheid variables are massive helium-burning stars, with luminosity ranging up to 1000 L \u0005 and pulsation periods from one to fifty days. Both types of star are fairly easy to identify by taking several images of a galaxy at intervals suitably spaced in time, and searching for stars that have varied their brightness in the expected way. Henrietta Leavitt found in 1912 that, of the Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the brighter stars varied with longer periods (Figure 4.7). Since the stars are all at about the same distance from us, the apparently brighter stars are in fact more luminous; we have a period–luminosity relation . If we measure the period and apparent brightness of Cepheids in another galaxy and assume that the stars have the same luminosity as their LMC counterparts with the same period, we can estimate the galaxy’s distance by using Equation 1.1. Care is needed, because the star’s light output also depends on its composition; Cepheids in the disk of the Milky Way, where the metal abundance is high, are brighter than stars with the same period that have a smaller fraction of heavy elements. We must also correct for the effect of interstellar dust in dimming and reddening the stars. With the Hubble Space Telescope, we can find distances to galaxies within 2 − 3 Mpc using RR Lyrae stars; Cepheids are useful out to about 30 Mpc. This technique of finding objects in a far-off galaxy which resemble those found closer by, and assuming that the distant objects have the same luminosity as their nearby counterparts, is called the method of standard candles .

For example, in the 1920s Hubble observed Cepheids in the disk of M31 and derived their distance by assuming that they had the same luminosity as apparently similar stars in the Milky Way. But the distances of Cepheids in the Milky Way’s disk, and thus their luminosities, had been underestimated because their light was dimmed by interstellar dust. Also, the W Virginis variable stars in Galactic globular clusters, which were thought to be as bright as the Cepheids, are in fact significantly dimmer. Because of these errors, Hubble concluded that the Cepheids in M31 were 1.5 magnitudes dimmer than in fact they are, so his distance to the galaxy was only half of what it should have been. Using Equation 1.28, he then arrived at an expansion age t H for the Universe which was obviously less than the age of the Earth! 4.1.3 Dwarf spheroidal galaxies The Milky Way’s retinue also includes at least ten dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which are named after the constellations in which they appear. Their surface brightness is about a hundred times less than that of the Magellanic Clouds, and Figure 4.8 shows how hard it can be to spot them among the numerous Galactic stars in the foreground.

H I denotes a measurement from H I gas, not stars; globular clusters are labelled gc. 1994 and the Ursa Major system in 2005. Almost certainly, the Local Group contains still-undiscovered dwarf galaxies of low surface brightness. In contrast to the Magellanic Clouds, the dwarf spheroidals are effectively gas-free, and they contain hardly any stars younger than 1 − 2 Gyr. All of them have some very old stars, such as RR Lyrae variables which require at least 10 Gyr to evolve to that stage. These systems began forming their stars as early as did ‘giant’ galaxies like the Milky Way. The smallest of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies are only about as luminous as the larger globular clusters, although their radii are much larger (Table 4.2). But our satellite dwarf spheroidals are really galaxies, not just another form of star cluster. Fornax, and probably Sagittarius, have globular clusters of their own. Unlike star clusters within the Milky Way, the dwarf galaxies did not form all their stars at once; they all include stars born over several gigayears, from gas with differing proportions of heavy elements. Figure 4.9 shows the color–magnitude diagram for stars in the Carina dwarf, along with computed isochrones for metal-poor stars. Only about 2% of the stars are younger than about 2.5 Gyr, and the rest appear to have been born in three bursts, approximately 3, 7, and 15 Gyr ago. Even the most luminous of the dwarf spheroidals are only about 1 / 30 as rich in heavy elements as the Sun, and the less luminous systems are even more metal-poor; see Table 4.2. According to a simple model to be discussed in Section 4.3, we would expect a galaxy that had turned all its gas into stars to have roughly the solar abundance of heavy elements. Their low metallicity suggests that these galaxies lost much of their metal-enriched gas into intergalactic space. Using the information in Table 4.2, we can estimate the masses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies from their sizes and the radial velocities of their stars.

Cole, Padova stellar tracks. random speeds are not very different from those measured in globular clusters, but the stars in dwarf galaxies are spread over distances ten or a hundred times as great. So, if we assume that these galaxies are in a steady state, and use the virial theorem, Equation 3.44, to calculate the masses, we find that the ratio of mass to light M / L is much greater than that for globular clusters. For the lowest-luminosity dwarf spheroidals, Ursa Minor, Carina, and Draco, M / L is even higher than that measured for the Milky Way (Section 2.3) or in spiral galaxies (Section 5.3). Dwarf spheroidal galaxies may consist largely of dark matter, with luminous stars as merely the ‘icing on the cake’.

Use the virial theorem to show that Carina is about six times as massive as ω Centauri, so M / L must be 15 times larger.

It lies nearly in the plane of the Galactic disk, only 20 kpc from the Galactic center. It is strongly distorted and spreads over 22 ◦ × 7 ◦ in the sky, corresponding to the fairly large extent of 12 kpc × 4 kpc. To ask whether other galactic satellites are likely to hold themselves together, we now look at the conditions under which a star cluster or satellite galaxy could survive in the Milky Way’s gravity. 4.1.4 Life in orbit : the tidal limit As a small galaxy or a star cluster orbits a larger system, its stars feel a combined gravitational force that is changing in time: they can no longer conserve their energies according to Equation 3.27. This is the famously insoluble ‘three-body problem’, in which many of the possible orbits are chaotic; a small change to a star’s position or velocity has a huge effect on its subsequent motion. But, if the satellite follows a circular orbit, and the gravitational potential is constant in a frame of reference rotating uniformly about the center of mass of the combined system, we can define an effective potential \u0010 eff for the star’s motion, and find a substitute for the no-longer-conserved energy. If a vector u is constant in an inertial frame, which does not rotate, then an observer in a frame rotating with constant angular velocity Ω will see it changing at the rate d u / d t \u0006 =− Ω × u , where d / d t \u0006 denotes the derivative measured by the rotating observer. (Check this by taking Cartesian coordinates in the inertial frame, and writing Ω = \u0002 z ; look at how a vector along each of the x , y , z axes changes for a rotating observer.) Suppose that a star has position x and velocity v relative to an inertial frame. Then, if the rotating observer chooses coordinates such that the star’s position x \u0006 in that frame instantaneously coincides with x ,he or she measures its velocity as v \u0006 ≡ d x \u0006 d t \u0006 = v − Ω × x . (4.1) For the rotating observer, the star’s velocity v \u0006 changes at the rate d v \u0006 d t \u0006 = d v \u0006 d t − Ω × v \u0006 = d v d t − Ω × v − Ω × v \u0006 =−∇ \u0010 − 2 Ω × v \u0006 − Ω × ( Ω × x ) (4.2) The scalar product of v \u0006 with the last term is (see Table A.2) − v \u0006 · Ω × ( Ω × x ) = \u0002 2 ( x · v \u0006 ) − ( v \u0006 · Ω )( Ω · x ) = 1 2 d d t \u0006 [( Ω × x ) 2 ] ."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"166 Our backyard: the Local Group Since v \u0006 · ( Ω × v \u0006 ) = 0 and x \u0006 = x , taking the scalar product of v \u0006 with Equation 4.2 gives 1 2 d d t \u0006 [ v \u0006 2 − ( Ω × x \u0006 ) 2 ] =− v \u0006 ·∇ \u0010 ( x \u0006 ) . (4.3) If Ω is chosen to follow the satellite in its orbit, then in the rotating frame the gravitational potential \u0010 does not depend on time; so the potential at the particle’s position changes at the rate d \u0010/ d t \u0006 = v \u0006 ·∇ \u0010 . If we define the Jacobi constant E J by E J = 1 2 v \u0006 2 + \u0010 eff ( x \u0006 ) , where \u0010 eff ( x \u0006 ) ≡ \u0010 ( x \u0006 ) − 1 2 ( Ω × x \u0006 ) 2 , (4.4) then Equation 4.3 says that E J does not change along the star’s path. We can write the Jacobi constant in terms of the star’s energy E and its angular momentum L per unit mass, as measured in the inertial frame: E J = 1 2 ( v − Ω × x ) 2 + \u0010 eff = 1 2 v 2 + \u0010 ( x , t ) − Ω · ( x × v ) = E − Ω · L . (4.5) Problem 4.3 You can check that E J is indeed constant by taking Ω along the z axis, and looking at a particle moving in the x − y plane. Show from Equation 4.4 that E J = ( v \u0006 x 2 + v \u0006 y 2 ) / 2 + \u0010 ( x \u0006 ) − \u0002 2 ( x \u0006 2 + y \u0006 2 ) / 2. Write the rate d E J / d t \u0006 at which E J changes along the particle’s path, as measured by the rotating observer: you can use Equations 4.1 and 4.2 to find the derivatives d x \u0006 / d t \u0006 ,d v \u0006 x / d t \u0006 , etc The rate should be zero, showing that E J is conserved along the particle’s orbit. Now allow motion in the z direction, which does not contribute to Ω × x or Ω × v ,in your calculation to show that E J is still conserved. The simplest calculation of a tidal limit is one in which point masses m and M , respectively, represent the satellite and the main galaxy. They are separated by distance D , while orbiting their common center of mass C with angular speed \u0002 . If we measure distance x from the satellite m toward M , C lies at position x = D M / ( M + m ); along the line joining the two systems, \u0010 eff ( x ) =− G M | D − x | − Gm | x | − \u0002 2 2 \u0003 x − D M M + m \u0004 2 . (4.6) The effective potential \u0010 eff has three maxima, at the first three Lagrange points (Figure 4.10). The middle point L 1 is the lowest; the next lowest point, L 2 , lies behind the satellite; and L 3 is behind the main galaxy.

When M \u0012 m , Equation 4.10 tells us that the mean density in a sphere of radius r J surrounding the satellite, 3 m / (4 π r 3 J ), is exactly three times the mean density within a sphere of radius D around the main galaxy. Ignoring for the moment the force from the main galaxy, Equation 3.23 tells us that the period of a star orbiting the satellite at distance r J would be roughly equal to the satellite’s own orbital period. The satellite can retain those stars close enough to circle it in less time than it takes to complete its own orbit about the main galaxy, but it will lose its hold on any that are more remote.

(4.11) In general, star clusters and satellite galaxies do not follow circular orbits. We might expect that the force of gravity at the closest approach will determine which stars remained bound. The truncation radius r t of Section 3.2 and Table 4.2, where the density of stars drops to zero, should then be approximately equal to r J at the pericenter of the orbit. This appears to hold for the Milky Way’s globular clusters, but some of the Magellanic Cloud globulars overflow the Jacobi limit at their estimated perigalactic radius. Stars that are no longer bound to these clusters can perhaps still remain close by for a few orbits about the galaxy. The LMC’s disk is now safely stable against disruption by the Milky Way. Calculations of the orbit of the Magellanic Clouds and Stream indicate that it is now close to pericenter, and that the speed of a circular orbit about the Milky Way at the LMC’s present distance of 50 kpc is about the same as that near the Sun, ∼ 200 km s − 1 . Using Equation 3.20, we estimate the mass within the LMC’s orbit as about 5 × 10 11 M \u0005 .

In addition to about 300 known globular clusters, over twice as many as in the Milky Way, M31 has its own satellite galaxies. These include the elliptical galaxy M32, three dwarf ellipticals, and several dwarf spheroidals. The central bulge of M31 is larger in proportion than that of the Milky Way, providing 30% − 40% of the measured luminosity. The apparent long axis of the bulge does not line up with the major axis of the disk further out. Either the bulge is not axisymmetric and would look somewhat oval if seen from above the disk, or its equator must be tipped relative to the plane of the disk. The bulge is faint in ultraviolet light, because it contains few young stars. As in our Galaxy, the bulge stars are all at least a few gigayears old and are generally rich in heavy elements. The bulge contains dilute ionized gas, and a few denser clouds of H I gas and dust, which are seen as dark nebulae. At the center is a compact semi-stellar nucleus.

The other may be a star cluster which has spiralled into the center under the influence of dynamical friction (see Section 7.1). Unlike that of the Milky Way, the nucleus of M31 is impressively free of gas and dust. Just as in the Milky Way, the metal-poor globular clusters of M31 follow deeply plunging orbits; the cluster system shows little or no ordered rotation. But the bulge also continues smoothly outward as a luminous spheroid. Most of the stars a few kiloparsecs above the disk plane are not those of a metal-poor halo; they are relatively metal-rich, and they probably form a fast-rotating system. It is as if M31’s bulge has ‘overflowed’, largely swamping the metal-poor halo. Like the Milky Way, M31 is a cannibal galaxy. The metal-rich halo stars are roughly 6 Gyr old; they and much of the bulge probably arrived as M31 merged with another metal-rich (and so fairly massive: see Section 4.3) galaxy. A huge stream of stars over 100 kpc long has been found, passing from northwest of the galaxy to the southeast. These stars are also more metal-rich than those of the Milky Way’s halo; they may have been stripped as M31 swallowed a sizable galaxy."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"4.2 Spirals of the Local Group 171 Circling the bulge at a radius of about 10 kpc, the star-forming ‘ring of fire’ is clearly visible in Figure 4.11. Most of the young disk stars lie in this ring or just outside it; on average, M31’s disk forms stars at a slower rate than does that of the Milky Way. Ionized gas in H II regions around the young massive stars glows red in H α ; in the far-infrared we see the dust heated by those stars, and the CO map shows the dense gas from which they formed. Just outside this ring, ultraviolet- bright young stars and strings of H II regions in the disk trace segments of fairly tightly wound spiral arms, where gas, dust, and stars have been compressed to a higher density. However, there is no clear large-scale spiral pattern. Because of its large bulge and moderately tightly wound spiral arms, and the relative paucity of gas and recent star formation in the inner disk, we classify M31 as an Sb galaxy, whereas our Milky Way is Sbc or Sc. M31 has about (4 − 6) × 10 9 M \u0005 of neutral hydrogen, about 50% more than the Milky Way. Molecular gas is probably a smaller fraction of the total, so the ratio of gas mass to stellar luminosity is lower than that in our Galaxy. Figure 4.11 shows that the H I is concentrated at the ring of fire; but, as in the Milky Way, the gas extends to larger radii than the stellar disk. In the region of the spiral arms, high-resolution maps show holes in the H I disk, up to a kiloparsec across; at their edges, shells containing (10 3 − 10 7 ) M \u0005 of dense H I gas are moving outward at 10–30 km s − 1 . At this rate, most of the holes would have taken a few megayears to reach their present sizes. Sometimes an association of massive O and B stars lies within the hole; winds from these massive stars, and recent supernova explosions, have blown away the cool gas. Holes in the inner parts of the disk tend to be smaller, perhaps because the gas is denser or the magnetic field stronger, so it is harder to push cool material out of the way. If we measure the velocity of the H I gas at each point, we can use the fact that the clouds follow near-circular orbits to build up a three-dimensional picture of the gas disk. The outer parts are not flat but bent into an ‘S’ shape; the stellar disk is visibly warped in the same sense. An ‘S’ warp in the outer parts of spiral galaxies is quite common; the Milky Way’s own disk is warped in this way, and systems with a flat disk are probably in a minority. As in our Galaxy, the H I layer flares out to become thicker at greater distances from the center. Some outlying clumps of H I gas clearly do not share the disk’s rotation; lying up to 50 kpc from the center, they are the analogues of the Milky Way’s high-velocity clouds (Section 2.4). The clouds are ∼ 1 kpc across with (10 5 − 10 6 ) M \u0005 of H I . Several of them lie along the same path as the giant star stream, with roughly the same velocities; perhaps they were stripped from the same satellite galaxy. Another lies close in both position and velocity to the dwarf elliptical NGC 205. 4.2.2 M33 : a late-type spiral The other spiral in the Local Group, M33, is definitely an Sc or an Scd galaxy. Its bulge is tiny; the spiral arms are more open than those in M31 and not as smooth,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"172 Our backyard: the Local Group consisting mainly of bright blue concentrations of recently formed stars. M33 is a smaller and much less luminous galaxy than the Milky Way; the scale length is small, h R ≈ 1 . 7 kpc, and the rotation speed V ( R ) rises only to 120 km s − 1 . When observed in the H α emission line, M33 displays a complex network of loops, filaments, and shells, like those in the LMC (Figure 4.4) and in the violently star-forming irregular galaxy IC 10 (see Section 4.4 below). Supernova explosions, and the winds from stars, heat the surrounding gas and drive it away, thus affecting the location and rate of future starbirth. Such feedback has a strong effect on the way that galaxies come into being from lumps of primordial gas, and on their subsequent development. M33 is relatively richer in H I gas than M31 or the Milky Way; there is little CO emission, reflecting either a lack of molecular gas or a smaller ratio of CO to H 2 than in the Milky Way. The latter is more likely, since the disk is rich in young stars, which are born in the dense cores of molecular clouds. Compared with the Milky Way, relatively more of the H I gas is in the warm component and less in cold dense clouds. As in M31, the H I layer has large holes, often centred on star-forming regions in the disk. M33’s neutral-gas disk is very extended. The H I continues out at least to 3 Holmberg radii or about 30 kpc, which is a substantial fraction of the ∼ 200 kpc separating the galaxy from M31. One rather massive cloud with 10 6 M \u0005 of gas lies about 15 kpc from M33’s center; a streamer of H I gas links it to the disk. The outer disk is warped, possibly by tides from M31. At the center of M33, we find a dense nuclear star cluster , with no more than a small bulge around it. This cluster is more luminous than any Galactic globular, with L V ≈ 2 . 5 × 10 6 L \u0005 ; its core is tiny, so the stellar density exceeds 10 7 L \u0005 pc − 3 . In contrast to the single generation of stars in a globular cluster, M33’s nucleus contains old, middle-aged, and young stars. There is no sign of a black hole: if one is present, M BH ∼ < 10 4 M \u0005 , far less than in the Milky Way and in M31. But we do see evidence for a power source other than ordinary stars. M33’s nucleus is the single brightest X-ray source of the Local Group, equivalent to several of the normal binary sources. M33 is only two or three times more luminous than the LMC, yet it has a much more symmetric spiral pattern. Low-luminosity galaxies are in general more likely than larger systems to resemble the LMC in having a strong central bar, with the brightest parts of the galaxy off-center from the outer disk. But the morphology clearly depends on factors other than the galaxy’s luminosity alone. 4.3 How did the Local Group galaxies form? We can now sketch a picture for the formation of the Milky Way and the other galaxies of the Local Group, starting from the hot dense early Universe that we discussed in Section 1.5. Roughly 350 000 years after the brilliant beginning of the Big Bang, photons of the cosmic fireball no longer had enough energy to ionize"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"4.3 How did the Local Group galaxies form? 173 Fig. 4.12. Small galaxies form near large ones: the density of matter (wavy solid line) is a combination of small clumps within a large region that is denser than average (dashed line).

Tidal torques: irregular lumps attract each other and begin to rotate. hydrogen and helium. The nuclei then combined with electrons to form a gas of neutral atoms, through which light could propagate freely; the Universe became transparent. The gas that was to form the galaxies was no longer supported by the pressure of photons trapped within it. If its gravity was strong enough, a region that was denser than average would begin to collapse inward. We will see in Section 8.5 that the denser the gas, the earlier cosmic expansion must halt and give way to contraction. These collapsing regions would not have been evenly spread in space. Where there was a general increase in density, more of the smaller surrounding clumps of matter would have been dense enough to collapse: see Figure 4.12. Clumps near the center of a large infalling region would fall toward each other, eventually merging into a single big galaxy, while those further out might become smaller satellite galaxies. We can think of all the material that is destined to come together into a single galaxy as making up a protogalaxy . At their largest extent, just before they started to collapse in on themselves, the protogalaxies lay closer together than the galaxies do now, because the Universe was smaller. In general they would not have been neat spheres, but irregularly shaped lumps, tugging at each other by gravity. Mutual tidal torques would have pulled them into a slow rotation (Figure 4.13). There is no very definite way to calculate how much spin a galaxy would receive. In large computer simulations, which represent the forming galaxies by of many particles, each attracting the others by the force of gravity, rotation develops such that the average at any radius is about 5% of what is required for a circular orbit there. As the gas clouds within each protogalaxy collide with each other, they lose part of their energy and fall"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"174 Our backyard: the Local Group inward; the protogalaxy’s rotation increases, because the material approximately conserves its angular momentum. When did the galaxies form their earliest stars? Stellar light and the emission lines of hot gas ionized by early stars have been seen from galaxies at redshifts z ∼ > 6, when the Universe was less than 1 Gyr old. Before the first stars could form, the fireball of the cosmic background radiation had to cool enough to allow star-sized lumps of gas to radiate heat away. We now observe nascent stars in the cores of molecular clouds, with temperatures T ∼ < 20 K; see Section 2.4. Using Equation 1.34, we see that the background radiation does not reach this tempera- ture until redshift z ∼ 6, hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. But the very first stars were made from primeval gas, almost pure hydrogen and helium. Their atmospheres would have been much less opaque than the Sun’s outer layers, and so less easily blown away by the pressure of the star’s radiation. Large lumps of gas might have collapsed earlier, at higher temperatures, to form extremely massive stars with M > 100 M \u0005 that could survive for long enough to allow substantial nuclear burning. When these stars exploded as supernovae, they would distribute the heavy elements that they had made to the surrounding gas. We will discuss galaxy formation and early starbirth again in Section 9.4. 4.3.1 Making the Milky Way The first stars may have lived and died not in a galaxy-sized unit, but in smaller lumps of gas, with masses perhaps (10 6 –10 8 ) M \u0005 . Here, one or two supernovae were enough to add elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen to the gas in 1 / 1000 or even 1 / 100 of the solar proportion. This is approximately what we see in the Galaxy’s oldest stars, those of the metal-poor globular clusters. The stars in each cluster generally have very closely the same composition, while abundances in the Galactic gas today are far from uniform. So we think that globular clusters formed in smaller parcels of gas, where the nucleosynthetic products of earlier stars had been thoroughly mixed. Some of the globular clusters may have been born when gas clouds ran into each other, as they fell together to form the Milky Way; the collisions would have compressed the gas, raising its density so that many stars formed in a short time. Stars, unlike gas, do not lose significant energy through collisions; so their formation halts the increase in ordered rotation. The orbits of the old metal-poor globulars and metal-poor halo stars are not circular but elongated. These orbits are oriented in random directions; the metal-poor halo has virtually no ordered rotation. This is probably because the material from which it formed did not fall far into the Galaxy before it became largely stellar. In 1962, Olin Eggen, Donald Lynden-Bell, and Allan Sandage introduced the idea that the stars in the metal-poor halo had formed rapidly, as the proto-Milky Way collapsed under its own gravity. Equation 3.23 tells us that the time taken for a gas cloud of density ρ to fall in on itself is proportional to 1 / √ ρ . Gas in the"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"4.3 How did the Local Group galaxies form? 175 substructure of lumps that made the stars would have been denser than average, so material should have started to contract sooner, and turned into stars before the galaxy-sized cloud had gone far in its own collapse. The problem below shows that the whole process could have been completed within a few tenths of a gigayear. Problem 4.7 For a galaxy like our Milky Way with a mass of 10 11 M \u0005 and radius 10 kpc, find the average density. The virial theorem tells us that, if a galaxy of stars collapses from rest, then, after it has come to equilibrium, it will be eight times denser than at the start: see the discussion following Problem 8.31. Show that, for the proto-Milky Way, the free-fall time of Equation 3.23 was t ff ∼ 300 Myr. This is about ten times longer than a protostar of solar mass takes to reach the main sequence. For the Sculptor dwarf with M ∼ 2 × 10 7 M \u0005 and radius 2 kpc (Table 4.2), show that the average density is only 1 / 40 of the Milky Way’s, so the collapse time t ff ∼ 2 Gyr. By contrast, the material that became the Milky Way’s rotating disk had to lose a considerable amount of its energy. We saw in Section 3.3 that a circle is the orbit of lowest energy for a given angular momentum. Today’s thin-disk stars occupy nearly circular orbits because they were born from gas that had lost almost as much energy as possible. The thick-disk stars, and the more metal-rich globular clusters, predate most of the thin disk. They may have been born from gas clouds that had yielded up less of their energy, but still formed a somewhat flattened rotating system. By the time that the earliest thin-disk stars were born, 8–10 Gyr ago, heavy elements produced by earlier generations of stars had enriched the gas, to perhaps 10% − 20% of the solar abundance. Today, disk gas near the Sun follows nearly circular orbits with speed V ( R ) ≈ 200 km s − 1 . If tidal torques gave this material a rotational speed only 5% of that needed for a circular orbit, the gas must subsequently have fallen inward until it reached an orbit appropriate for its angular momentum. We can use Equation 3.29 to estimate where the local gas must have been when the tidal torques were operating. If the Milky Way’s gravitational potential corresponds to a flat rotation curve, with V ( R ) constant, then this gas must have fallen in from a distance R ∼ 100 kpc; the gas around galaxies must have extended much further out at earlier times. The disk material had to remain gaseous as it moved inward, forming only very few stars, so that it could continue to radiate away energy. It may have been able to do this because it was much less dense than the gas that had earlier given birth to the globular clusters. The color–magnitude diagram of Figure 4.5 shows no horizontal branch in the Galactic bulge. Even allowing for their higher metal content, very few of the bulge stars can be as old as the globular clusters. The over-whelming majority have ages less than 8–10 Gyr, and some may be much younger. We do not yet know how the bulge stars were made. They may have formed in the dense center"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"176 Our backyard: the Local Group of the protogalactic gas that was to make up the Milky Way; the bulge might have grown out of a dense inner region of the disk; or its stars may be the remains of dense clusters that fell victim to dynamical friction, and spiralled into the center; see Section 7.1. The central kiloparsec of galaxies such as M33 and the LMC is not as dense as the inner Milky Way; the low density may have prevented a bulge from developing. Once the dense central bulge had come into being, the gravitational force of the whole Galaxy would have helped it to hold onto its gas. By trapping the hot and fast-moving debris from supernovae, the bulge formed large numbers of metal-rich stars. Both in the Local Group and beyond (see Section 6.3), the stars of more luminous galaxies are richer in heavy elements. Their stronger gravity prevents metal-bearing gas from escaping, and it is incorporated into stars. Much of the Milky Way’s dark matter is in its outskirts, beyond most of the stars of the disk. In Section 5.3 we will see that the same is true of most spiral galaxies. Why does nonluminous material lie mainly in the Galaxy’s outer reaches? Since its composition remains unknown, we lack a definite answer. However, if we presume that all forms of matter were mixed evenly at early times, then the dark matter must have had less opportunity than the star-stuff to get rid of its energy. It would then be left on orbits taking it far from the Galactic center. A dark halo of the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of Section 1.5 could never radiate away energy as heat; so it is bound to remain more extended than the gaseous and stellar body. If the dark matter consists of compact objects such as brown dwarfs or black holes, we would expect that these formed very early in the Milky Way’s collapse, probably predating even the globular clusters. The Milky Way is still under construction today. As we saw in Section 2.2, stars of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy are being added to the Galactic halo. Near the Sun, groups of young metal-poor halo stars have been found, that may be the remnants of another partially digested dwarf galaxy. The orbit of the Magellanic Clouds has been shrinking, and in Section 7.1we will see that the LMC will probably fall into the Milky Way within 3–5 Gyr. Like meteoric cratering in the solar system, these late additions represent the final stages of assembly. 4.3.2 The buildup of heavy elements During its life, a galaxy turns gas into stars. Each star burns hydrogen and helium to form heavier elements, which are returned to the interstellar gas at the end of its life. We might define a ‘clock’ for galactic aging by the mass of stars born and of metals produced, per unit mass of gas that was present initially. Near the Sun, we see some correspondence between the time told by this ‘metal-production clock’ and time as measured by stellar aging; Figure 4.14 shows that older disk stars in general contain little iron, while recently formed stars have larger abundances. We saw in Section 2.2 that the open clusters of the Milky Way’s thin disk are both younger and more metal-rich than the stars and globular clusters of the thick disk, while the globular clusters of the halo are the oldest and the poorest in heavy elements."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"4.3 How did the Local Group galaxies form? 177 1 2 4 6 8 10 20 0.2 2 1 2 4 6 8 10 20 0.5 10 0.1 1 Fig. 4.14. Nearby F and G stars show a large scatter in iron abundance at any age; but younger stars tend to be richer in iron. Stars with ‘thick-disk’ metal abundance (below the dashed line) often move faster than at 80 km s − 1 relative to the local standard of rest (open circles) – B. Nordstr ̈om et al . 2004 AAp 418 , 98. At one stage it was thought that galactic contents could be divided simply into two components. Young stars and metal-rich material in the disk formed Pop- ulation I, while the old metal-poor stars in the bulge and stellar halo belonged to Population II. (Astronomers sometimes refer to the first stars, made from the hydrogen and helium of the Big Bang without any heavy elements, as Popula- tion III.) We now know that this is an oversimplification. For example, the bulges of M31 and the Milky Way are several gigayears old, but they are metal-rich. Dwarf irregular galaxies, and the outer parts of normal spirals, contain young metal-poor stars born within the past 100 Myr. Faced with this complexity, we retreat to a drastically simplified description of how the metals in a galaxy might build up over time. This is the one-zone, instantaneous recycling model. We assume that a galaxy’s gas is well mixed, with the same composition everywhere, and that stars return the products of their nuclear fusion to the interstellar gas rapidly, much faster than the time taken to form a significant fraction of the stars. Initially, we assume that no gas escapes from the galaxy or is added to it – this is a closed-box model – and that all elements heavier than helium maintain the same proportion relative to each other. We define • M g ( t ) as the mass of gas in the galaxy at time t ; • M ( t ) to be the mass in low-mass stars and the white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes that are the remnants of high-mass stars (the matter in these objects remains locked within them throughout the galaxy’s lifetime); and, finally, • M h ( t ) is the total mass of elements heavier than helium in the galactic gas; the metal abundance in the gas is then Z ( t ) = M h / M g ."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"178 Our backyard: the Local Group Suppose that, at time t , a mass \b \u0006 M of stars is formed. When the massive stars have gone through their lives, they leave behind a mass \b M of low-mass stars and remnants, and return gas to the interstellar medium which includes a mass p \b M of heavy elements. The yield p represents an average over the local stars; it depends on the initial mass function , specifying the relative number of stars formed at each mass (see Section 2.1), and on details of the nuclear burning. The distribution of angular momentum in the stellar material, its metal abundance, stellar magnetic fields, and the fraction of stars in close binaries can also affect the yield. The mass M h of heavy elements in the interstellar gas alters as the metals produced by massive stars are returned, while a mass Z \b M of these elements is locked into low-mass stars and remnants. We have \b M h = p \b M − Z \b M = ( p − Z ) \b M ; (4.13) so the metallicity of the gas increases by an amount \b Z ≡ \b \u0003 M h M g \u0004 = p \b M − Z [ \b M + \b M g ] M g . (4.14) If no gas enters or leaves the system, the total in gas and stars remains constant, and \b M + \b M g = 0. When the production of an element in stars does not depend on the presence of other heavy elements in the stellar material, we call it a primary element. If we deal with primary elements, p is independent of Z and we can integrate Equation 4.14 to find how the metal abundance in the gas builds up. We have Z ( t ) = Z ( t = 0) + p ln \u000b M g ( t = 0) M g ( t ) \f . (4.15) The metallicity of the gas grows with time, as stars are made and gas is used up. The mass of stars M ( t ) formed before time t , and so with metallicity less than Z ( t ), is just M g (0) − M g ( t ); we have M ( < Z ) = M g (0)[1 − exp {− [ Z − Z (0) ] / p } ] (4.16) Time does not appear explicitly here; the mass M ( < Z ) of slowly evolving stars that have abundances below the given level Z depends only on the quantity of gas remaining in the galaxy when its metal abundance has reached that value. This simple model explains a basic fact: where the gas density is high in relation to the number of stars formed, the average abundance of heavy elements is low. In gas-rich regions such as in the Magellanic Clouds, or the outer disks of spiral galaxies, the stars and gas are relatively poor in metals (see Figure 4.15)."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"4.3 How did the Local Group galaxies form? 179 01234567 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 7 8 9 Fig. 4.15.

In other cases, the simple model is clearly wrong. Within individual globular clusters orbiting the Milky Way, there is no gas, and the stars all have the same, metal-poor, composition. These clusters must have formed out of gas that mixed very thoroughly after its initial contamination with heavy elements; any material not used in making their single generation of stars would have been expelled promptly.

A more likely explanation is that, as in the globular clusters, most of the heavy elements have been lost. Interstellar gas could easily escape the weak gravitational force, and only a small fraction of the hot metal-rich material from supernovae would have mixed with cool gas, to be incorporated into a new generation of stars. To use Equation 4.15, we must redefine p as the effective yield , taking into account metals lost from the system. For the globular clusters, p ≈ 0; p is always less than the true yield of metals produced. Near the Sun, the Milky Way’s disk contains (30–40) M \u0005 pc − 2 of stars, together with about 13 M \u0005 pc − 2 in gas, for a total of ∼ 50 M \u0005 pc − 2 ; see Sec- tion 3.4.

In that case, we should expect all stars to have metal abundance above some minimum value. Setting Z (0) ≈ 0 . 15 Z \u0005 gives approximately the observed distribution of metal abundance locally; see the following problem. Problem 4.9 If the disk gas had Z = 0 . 15 Z \u0005 at t = 0 when stars first began to form, while Z (now) ≈ Z \u0005 , and M g ( t = 0) / M g ( t ) = 50 / 13, use Equation 4.15 to show that p ≈ 0 . 63 Z \u0005 . From Equation 4.16, show that about 20% of low-mass stars should have Z < Z \u0005 / 4 today. But it is also possible, and even likely, that star formation near the Sun started before the gaseous raw material had been fully assembled. In that case, the first stars would enrich only a small amount of gas to a moderately high metal abun- dance. Subsequent inflow of fresh metal-deficient gas would dilute that material, preventing the abundance from rising as fast as the closed-box model predicts; see the following problem. Incomplete mixing could explain the large dispersion in stellar abundance at any given age (see Figure 4.14). Since gas in the outer parts of galaxies is poorer in heavy elements, a slow inward flow, perhaps caused by energy loss in passing through shocks in the spiral arms, would dilute the metals in the local disk. Long-lived stars formed at early times should also return metal- poor gas as they age. If enough of this gas were released, the fraction of metals in newly made stars might even decline with time. Problem 4.10 Suppose that the inflow of metal-poor gas is proportional to the rate at which new stars form, so that \b M + \b M g = ν\b M for some constant ν> 0. Show that Equation 4.14 becomes \b Z = ( p − ν Z ) \b M M g = p − ν Z ν − 1 \b M g M g , (4.20) so that the metallicity in the gas is Z ( t ) = p ν ! 1 − \u000b M g ( t ) M g (0) \f ν/ (1 − ν ) \" , (4.21) which can never exceed p /ν .

Oxygen is more abundant relative to iron in metal-poor stars. Filled dots show stars of the Milky Way’s halo, open dots represent thick-disk stars, following a slightly different relation from that for the thin-disk stars (star symbols) – T. Bensby. The abundances of heavy elements vary relative to each other: Figure 4.17 shows that stars with low metal abundance have more oxygen relative to the amount of iron than do stars like the Sun. This happens because these elements are made in stars of different masses. Stars more massive than 10 M \u0005 end their lives by exploding as a Type II supernova. They release mainly lighter elements with fewer than about 30 neutrons and protons, such as oxygen, silicon, and magnesium, back into the interstellar gas. Most of the heavier nuclei such as iron, which are made in the star’s core, are swallowed up into the remnant neutron star or black hole. These massive stars go through their lives within 100 Myr, whereas the local disk has made its stars fairly steadily over the last 8–10 Gyr; so the instantaneous-recycling assumption is reasonable. Not all of the ‘lighter’ heavy elements are produced in very massive stars. Stars only slightly more massive than the Sun do not become supernovae, but add carbon and nitrogen to the interstellar gas. These elements are produced during helium burning, and the stars dredge them up into the envelope during helium flashes. Later, at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch , those outer layers are ejected; see Section 1.1. Carbon and silicates often condense as dust grains in the cool stellar atmosphere. These stars often take far longer than 100 Myr to make their contribution to the Galaxy’s store of heavy elements. The main source of iron is supernovae of Type Ia. We saw in Section 1.1 that these occur when a white dwarf in a binary system collapses under its own gravity. If matter is added to a white dwarf in a binary system, taking its mass above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 M \u0005 , it can no longer support its own weight, and it implodes. This heats the interior, triggering nuclear burning, which blows the star apart. No remnant is left; all the iron, nickel, and elements of similar atomic mass are released back to the interstellar gas. Many of the stars that explode as Type Ia"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"4.4 Dwarf galaxies in the Local Group 183 supernovae do so only at ages of a gigayear or more; instantaneous recycling is a poor approximation. In stars formed during the first few gigayears of a galaxy’s life, we expect the ratio of elements such as oxygen and magnesium to iron to be higher than it is in the Sun. To predict the metal abundance of stars in a galaxy, we first need to estimate the birthrate of stars at each mass. We can then calculate how much of each element is released back to the interstellar gas over time. In the Milky Way, long-lived stars that were born soon after the disk formed are now returning metal-poor gas, so the abundance of heavy elements in the gas is growing only slowly. The chemical composition of the new stars also depends on how gas moves within the galaxy, since Figure 4.15 shows that the clock of metal enrichment runs more slowly in the outer regions. We require chemodynamical models, which are still under development. Further reading: for a graduate-level treatment of this subject, see B. E. J. Pagel, 1997, Nucleosynthesis and Chemical Evolution of Galaxies (Cambridge Univer- sity Press, Cambridge, UK) Chapters 7 and 8; and D. Arnett, 1996, Supernovae and Nucleosynthesis (Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey). 4.4 Dwarf galaxies in the Local Group The Local Group contains two main types of dwarf galaxies. In galaxies of the first type, the dwarf ellipticals and the much more diffuse dwarf spheroidals, almost all the stars are at least a few gigayears old. These systems contain little gas to make any new stars. By contrast, dwarf irregulars are tiny, gas-rich galaxies with active star formation, and a profusion of recently formed blue stars. Like the dwarf spheroidals of Section 4.1, the dwarf irregulars are diffuse systems. While all the Local Group’s dwarf ellipticals, and most of its dwarf spheroidal galaxies, orbit either the Milky Way or M31, many of the dwarf irregulars are not satellites of larger systems, but ‘free fliers’. We can use color–magnitude diagrams to chart the star-forming histories of these different varieties of dwarf, and to investigate the relationship between them. Remarkably, all the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group contain some stars on the horizontal branch, which may include RR Lyrae variables. Horizontal branch stars are at least 10 Gyr old, so the dwarf galaxies made their first stars in the first 2–3 Gyr of cosmic history. We will see in Section 8.5 that cosmological models with cold dark matter predict exactly this behavior. 4.4.1 Dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals We discussed the Milky Way’s dwarf spheroidals in Section 4.1: they are not much more luminous than a globular cluster, but so diffuse as to be almost invisible on the sky. Andromeda’s dwarf spheroidals are yet harder to observe; they appear to"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"184 Our backyard: the Local Group be very similar to our own. The dwarf ellipticals are more luminous versions of the dwarf spheroidals, with L ∼ > 3 × 10 7 L \u0005 or M V ∼ < − 14. In the Local Group, they are represented by three of M31’s satellites: NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205. Table 4.2 shows that their sizes are similar to those of the dwarf spheroidals, but they are more luminous, so the stellar density is higher. Because they are close to Andromeda, the dwarf ellipticals are vulnerable to tidal damage. In NGC 205 the random speed of the stars is greater at larger radii, instead of being smaller as Equation 3.47 would imply for an isolated galaxy, because M31 is pulling at the outer stars. Both dwarf spheroidals and dwarf ellipticals appear quite oval on the sky rather than round, yet their stars show no pattern of ordered rotation. We will see in Section 6.2 that these galaxies may have no axis of symmetry; their shapes are probably triaxial. Both NGC 205 and NGC 185 show a few patches of dust, and we can trace small amounts of cool gas by its H I and CO emission. Most of the stars in these two dwarf ellipticals date from at least 5 Gyr ago. Near the center, however, a small number (amounting to no more than 10 6 M \u0005 ) have ages between 100 and 500 Myr; gas lost by the old stars may have supplied the raw material for continued starbirth. By contrast, NGC 147, although otherwise similar, shows no sign of very recent star formation. Its nuclear region contains a very few stars in early middle age, born only a few gigayears ago. In the outer parts, the overwhelming majority is at least 5 Gyr old. M32, the most luminous satellite of M31, contains virtually no cool gas and has no stars younger than a few gigayears. But Figure 4.18 shows its central brightness to be one of the highest yet measured for any galaxy. High-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope reveal no constant-brightness inner core; the density continues to climb, to ∼ > 10 6 L \u0005 pc − 3 within the central parsec. A black hole of a few million solar masses may lurk at its center. Although its luminosity is within the normal range for dwarf ellipticals, its very high density suggests that M32 is a miniature version of a normal or ‘giant’ elliptical galaxy. Perhaps M32 is only the remnant center of a much larger galaxy. It lacks globular clusters, whereas the less luminous dwarf elliptical satellites of M31 do have them. The stars at its center are red, and approximately as rich as the Sun in heavy elements; this is typical of more massive galaxies, that have stronger gravity to confine metal-rich gas from exploding stars; see Section 6.4. The outer regions of M32 still have an elliptical shape, but its long axis is twisted away from that of the inner regions. Tidal forces of M31 have probably affected the orbits of the outermost stars. We cannot yet measure the distances well enough to know how far M32 is from M31, or whether it could have passed close enough for M31’s gravity to strip off the outer stars, as described in Section 4.1. The motion of the stars in M32 is intermediate between that in the disk of the Milky Way and that in its metal-poor halo. The galaxy is slightly flattened, and its stars orbit in a common direction, but they also have considerable random motions. We can measure the degree of ordered rotation in a galaxy by the ratio"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"4.4 Dwarf galaxies in the Local Group 185 Fig. 4.18.

In the Milky Way’s disk, stars like the Sun have V ≈ 200 km s − 1 while σ ≈ 30 km s − 1 ,so V /σ ≈ 7. In M32, V /σ ∼ 1, while for the dwarf spheroidals it is much less than unity. By analogy with the thermal motion of atoms in a gas, we refer to disks with high values of V /σ as ‘cold’; ‘hot’ systems are those in which random motions are relatively more important, so that V /σ is low. The stronger the influence of ordered rotation, the more disklike an object must be. Within the solar system, the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, with a ‘day’ only ten hours long, are considerably more flattened at the poles than the compact and slow-rotating Earth. We will see in Section 6.2 that not all flattened galaxies rotate fast; but strongly rotating galaxies must always be flattened. 4.4.2 Dwarf irregular galaxies Irregular galaxies are so called because of their messy and asymmetric appearance on the sky (see NGC 4449 in Figure 1.13 and NGC 55 in Figure 5.7).

Even quite small irregular galaxies can pro- duce spectacular OB associations, as well as more normal clumps of young stars. Figure 4.18 tells us that their disks have low average surface brightness; so the bright concentrations of young stars stand out, to give the galaxy’s optical image its chaotic aspect. We draw the line between irregular galaxies and the dwarf irregulars at L ∼ 10 8 L \u0005 . Dwarf irregulars contain gas and recently formed blue stars; but in some other ways they resemble the dwarf spheroidals. Irregular galaxies are diffuse, and ordered rotational motion is much less important than in the Milky Way’s disk. The stars and gas clouds have a velocity dispersion of σ ∼ 6–10 km s − 1 , but the peak rotation speed V declines at lower luminosity. In larger irregulars, V /σ ∼ 4–5, falling to V /σ ∼ < 1 in the smallest dwarf irregulars. The proportion of metals in dwarf irregular galaxies is very low, generally below 10% of the solar value, and the least luminous are the most metal-poor. Oxygen in the gas of the smallest systems such as Leo A is present only at about 1 / 30 of the solar level, while the more massive galaxy NGC 6822 has about 1 / 10 of the solar abundance. Dwarf irregulars tend to be brighter than the dwarf spheroidals, but this is only because of their populations of young stars. They contain relatively large amounts of gas, seen as neutral hydrogen, and the gas layer often extends well beyond the main stellar disk.

Fornax has a few stars as young as 500 Myr, so this dwarf spheroidal galaxy must have had some gas until quite recently. The Carina dwarf spheroidal made most of its stars in a few discrete episodes (see Figure 4.9); at times of peak starbirth it may have been a miniature version of Sextans A. Because of their similar struc- tures, small irregulars like the Pegasus dwarf may be at an early stage, while dwarf spheroidals represent the late stages, in the life of a similar type of galaxy. In the dwarf spheroidals, which orbit close to the Galaxy or M31, gas may have been com- pressed by interactions with these large galaxies, perhaps encouraging more stars to form earlier on. By now these galaxies have used up or blown out all their gas, while the dwarf irregulars, perhaps benefiting from a quieter life, still retain theirs. Galaxies such as the LMC might represent a transitional class between spiral galaxies and the dwarf irregulars. Like a spiral galaxy, the LMC is basically a rotating disk, but it lacks regular or symmetric spiral structure, and random motions account for more of the kinetic energy of stars and gas: V /σ ∼ 4 for the old stars. The brightest region of the LMC, the central bar, is off center with respect to the outer part of the disk; such lopsidedness is also common in dwarf irregulars. The neutral-hydrogen layer of the LMC has ‘holes’ similar to those in IC 10, but they are smaller in proportion to the galaxy’s size. In the Local Group and beyond, dwarf galaxies are not simply smaller or less luminous versions of bigger and brighter galaxies. Table 4.2 shows that dwarf elliptical galaxies all have about the same physical size; the core radius is always r c ∼ 200 pc. Thus Figure 4.18 implies that the more luminous dwarfs have higher surface brightness. But, among the normal or ‘giant’ ellipticals, the most luminous galaxies are also the most diffuse. We will see in Section 6.1 that the core radius is so much larger at higher luminosity that among these the central surface brightness is lower in the most luminous systems. Because of these contrasting trends, we think that dwarf galaxies probably developed by processes different from those that produced the giant spiral and elliptical galaxies. 4.5 The past and future of the Local Group The galaxies of the Local Group are no longer expanding away from each other according to Hubble’s law. Their mutual gravitational attraction, and that of any matter present between the galaxies, has been strong enough to pull the group members back toward each other. The Milky Way and M31 are now approaching each other; these two galaxies will probably come near to a head-on collision within a few gigayears. We can use the orbits to make an estimate of the total mass within the Local Group. Readers will not be surprised that this analysis reveals yet more ‘dark matter’. We start by assuming that all the mass of the Local Group lies in or very close to the Milky Way or M31, and we treat these two galaxies as point masses m and"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"4.5 The past and future of the Local Group 189 M . They are now separated by r ≈ 770 kpc, and they are closing on each other with d r / d t ≈− 120 km s − 1 .

Problem 4.12 For a star orbiting in the plane z = 0 around a much larger mass M , its distance r from M changes according to Equation 3.65: d 2 r d t 2 − L 2 z r 3 =− G M r 2 , (4.23) where L z is the conserved z angular momentum. By substituting into this equa- tion, show that its path can be written in terms of the parameter η as r = a (1 − e cos η ) , t = \u0011 a 3 G M ( η − e sin η ) for a = L 2 z G M (1 − e 2 ) . (4.24) This orbit is an ellipse of eccentricity e , with semi-major axis a ; the time t is measured from one of the pericenter passages, where η = 0. The Milky Way and M31 began moving apart at the Big Bang. So combining Equations 4.22 and 4.24 tells us that, at the present time t = t 0 , their relative distance r is changing at the rate d r d t = d r / d η d t / d η = \u0011 G ( m + M ) a e sin η 1 − e cos η = r t 0 e sin η ( η − e sin η ) (1 − e cos η ) 2 . (4.25) Since d r / d t < 0, the galaxies are approaching pericenter; sin η< 0. In a nearly circular orbit, with e ≈ 0, the speed of approach is a very small fraction of the orbital speed, which would imply a large total mass. The smallest combined mass that M31 and the Milky Way could have is given by assuming that the orbit is almost a straight line, with e ≈ 1, and that the galaxies are falling together for the first time, so that π<η< 2 π . Using the measured values of r and d r / d t , and setting 12 Gyr ∼ < t 0 ∼ < 15 Gyr, we can find η by equating the leftmost and rightmost terms of Equation 4.25. Substituting η into the third term gives m + M ≈ (4–5) × 10 12 M \u0005 ; the larger mass corresponds to the smaller age."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"190 Our backyard: the Local Group This is more than ten times the mass that we found for the Milky Way in Prob- lem 2.18; even beyond 2 . 5 R 0 , there is yet more dark matter. We have only 3–4 Gyr until η = 2 π , at the next close passage. Since there are no large concentrations of massive galaxies near the Local Group, that could have pulled on M31 and the Milky Way to give them an orbit of high angular momentum, it is quite likely that e ≈ 1. In that case, we will come close to a direct collision: M31 and the Milky Way could merge to form a single larger system.

The following chapter is devoted to spiral and S0 galaxies. It is often useful to think of M31, the Milky Way, and M33 as typical spiral galaxies. Like them, most spirals live in groups. In Section 7.1 we will see that collisions between group galaxies are fairly common; at earlier times, when the Universe was denser, they would have been even more frequent. As the disks crash into each other, their gas is compressed, swiftly converting much of it into stars. Material from the outer disks will be stripped off as ‘tidal tails’. A few gigayears later a red galaxy might remain, largely free of gas or young stars. Some astronomers believe that many of the giant elliptical galaxies that we see today are the remnants of such galactic traffic accidents."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"5 Spiral and S0 galaxies The main feature of a spiral or S0 galaxy is its conspicuous extended stellar disk. Stars in the disk of a large spiral galaxy, like our Milky Way, follow nearly circular orbits with very little random motion. Ordered rotation accounts for almost all the energy of motion, with random speeds contributing less than ∼ 5%: the disk is dynamically ‘cold’. In smaller galaxies, random motions are proportionally larger, but most of the disk’s kinetic energy is still in rotation. Because the stars have little vertical motion perpendicular to the disk plane, the disk can be quite thin. Spiral galaxies are distinguished from S0 systems by the multi-armed spiral pattern in the disk. The disks of spiral galaxies still retain some gas, whereas S0 systems have lost their disk gas, or converted it into stars. Both S0 and spiral galaxies can show a central linear bar; in Figure 1.11, the sequence of barred galaxies SB0, SBa, ... , SBm runs parallel to the ‘unbarred’ sequence S0, Sa, ... Apart from the bar and spiral arms, the stellar disks of large galaxies are usually fairly round; but many smaller systems are quite asymmetric. Most giant disk galaxies – those with M B ∼ < − 19 or L B ∼ > 6 × 10 9 L \u0005 – are composite systems. Many of them probably have a metal-poor stellar halo like that of the Milky Way (see Figure 1.8). But the halo accounts for only a few percent of the galaxy’s light, and is spread over an enormous volume; so the surface brightness is low, making it difficult to study. The dense inner bulge is prominent in the Sa and S0 systems, less important in Sb and Sc galaxies, and absent in the Sd and Sm classes. Bulge stars have considerable random motions, and they are much more tightly packed than in the disk: near the Sun, the density of stars is n ∼ 0 . 1pc − 3 , whereas in bulges it is often 10 000 times higher. Bulges are generally rounder than the very flattened disks. They tend to be gas-poor, except for their innermost regions; in some respects, they are small elliptical galaxies placed inside a disk. The central hundred parsecs of the bulge may accumulate enough gas to fuel violent bursts of star formation. As in our Milky Way, the centers of many bulges host nuclear star clusters , the densest stellar systems. In some nuclei, we find massive compact central objects, which are probably black holes. 191"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"192 Spiral and S0 galaxies Spirals are the most common of the giant galaxies, and produce most of the visible light in the local Universe. In the opening section we investigate the stellar content of the disks of spiral and S0 galaxies; Section 5.2 considers the gaseous component, and its relationship to the stars. In Section 5.3 we discuss the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, and what these reveal about the gravitational forces. In most spirals, the force required to maintain the outermost disk material in its orbit cannot be accounted for by the visible portion of the galaxy, its stars and gas. The difference is attributed to ‘dark’ material, which we detect only by its gravity. We then pause, in Section 5.4, to consider how much the scheme of Figure 1.11, classifying galaxies according to their appearance in visible light, can tell us about their other properties. Spiral arms and galactic bars form the topic of Section 5.5; these common and prominent features prove surprisingly difficult to understand. In Section 5.6 we discuss bulges and nuclei, and speculate on how they are related to the rest of the galaxy. 5.1 The distribution of starlight The light coming to us directly from the stars of present-day disk galaxies is mainly in the near-infrared region of the spectrum: old stars, such as K giants, give out most of their light at wavelengths close to 1 μ m. Much of the blue light of hot massive stars is intercepted by surrounding dust, and re-radiated in the far-infrared, beyond ∼ 10 μ m. Visible light is next in importance; ultraviolet photons do not carry much of the energy, except in irregular galaxies where dust is less plentiful, and the light of young hot stars more easily escapes absorption. Historically, galaxies have been studied mainly by optical photography. Although infrared detectors are rapidly improving, optical images still yield most of our information about galactic structure. 5.1.1 Astronomical array detectors The standard detector for optical extragalactic astronomy is now the charge- coupled device , or CCD; the same devices are used to record images in mod- ern video and electronic cameras. A CCD consists of a thin silicon wafer that will absorb light (Figure 5.1). A photon’s energy sets free one or more electron– hole pairs; the electrons are collected and amplified, to produce an output signal that should be linearly proportional to the number of photons absorbed. Not every incoming photon produces an electron–hole pair; we define the quantum efficiency as the ratio of detected photoelectrons to incident photons. In an excellent CCD, quantum efficiency can peak above 90%, for red light with 5000 ̊ A ∼ < λ ∼ < 7000 ̊ A. CCDs are analogue detectors: photons are converted into a current which is then amplified, rather than measured individually as they are in photon-counting systems such as photomultiplier tubes."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"5.1 The distribution of starlight 193 8-10 microns pn γ gate e − insulating layer electrodes level of energy bands conducting layer of silicon 2 SiO Fig. 5.1.

We can then produce a two-dimensional image by encoding the signal level from each pixel as a gray scale, where the tone varies, or by false color, with color variations indicating the intensity. Although CCDs are excellent detectors, they are not perfect. The counts, which are stored in a computer file, should be proportional to the number of elec- trons collected, or the number of photons falling on the pixel. Unfortunately, the amplifiers introduce read noise : a random fluctuation in the count rate, expressed in units of electrons. Astronomical CCDs of mid-2000s vintage normally have read noise equivalent to 2–5 electrons per pixel per readout, and devices with read noise below one electron are being developed. Usually, the output signal of a CCD deviates from the ideal linear behavior by a few tenths of a percent. Some CCDs suffer from manufacturing errors; most often, parts of a few columns are ‘blocked’ and fail to respond to light, making dark streaks in the image. Thermal vibrations in the silicon create electron–hole pairs even when no light falls on the detector; these dark counts are an unwanted noise source. To keep dark counts to a minimum, astronomical CCDs are operated at low temperatures of 100–200 K, often with liquid nitrogen (which boils at 77 K) as a coolant. Energetic particles are readily detected by CCDs, giving rise to a cosmic- ray background. This limits the exposure times to about an hour on the ground, and less for telescopes in space, since the atmosphere screens out some cosmic rays. Often, we take two or more images of the same piece of sky, so that these ‘false stars’ can be removed. The potential well of each pixel can typically hold at most a few hundred thousand electrons; so, if the CCD is overexposed (e.g., by a bright star), electrons spill down the column, producing a bright streak in the image; see Figure 5.16 below. When the problem is severe, the streaks also radiate along rows; a residual image of the bright source may be seen in subsequent exposures. CCDs are not useful at all wavelengths: even with anti-reflection coatings, ultraviolet light shortward of about 2000 ̊ A (200 nm) can hardly penetrate into the silicon. At wavelengths λ ∼ > 11 000 ̊ A (1.1 μ m), infrared photons have too little energy to liberate an electron–hole pair; they travel easily through the silicon layer without being absorbed. Photons between these wavelengths give up their energy to produce a single electron–hole pair. Red light could travel through the electrodes on top of the CCD wafer and into the silicon below, but bluer photons, with λ ∼ < 4500 ̊ A, cannot. So blue-sensitive CCDs are made with a thinned lower layer, only 15–20 μ m thick, and are back-illuminated so that the light shines in from below, as in Figures 5.1 and 5.2. CCDs are also efficient X-ray"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"5.1 The distribution of starlight 195 detectors; at wavelengths below 1000 ̊ A, each photon produces many electron– hole pairs. The number of electrons is proportional to the photon energy, so the CCD also provides spectral information. In this respect, energetic particles like cosmic rays behave similarly to X-rays, and CCDs are sometimes used to detect them. When measuring light from an object using a CCD, the astronomer must compensate for the fact that the pixels are not exactly uniform: some are more sensitive than others. Flat fields , images of blank twilight sky, or a diffuse screen (often called the ‘white spot’) on the interior of the telescope dome, are taken to measure and to correct for this effect. The CCD must be calibrated, by observing stars of known brightness to determine how many counts correspond to a given flux or magnitude. To produce an image of a galaxy, we must subtract out the contribution of the night sky, since only the brightest parts of galaxies are brighter than the sky: see Section 1.3. We routinely measure surface brightnesses down to ∼ < 1% of the sky level by using dome or sky flat fields. Special techniques are required to do much better, because the CCD’s sensitivity changes slowly during the night, limiting the accuracy of the flat fields. We can estimate the quality of measurements with a CCD by calculating a signal-to-noise ratio , S / N . The simplest case is when statistical noise in the number of detected photons is the main source of error. We say that the CCD has a gain g if a signal with C counts in some pixel corresponds to S detected photons (or equivalently, S electrons captured), where S = gC . The number of photons arriving at that pixel from the galaxy under study has a random fluctuation of approximately √ S ; so the noise or 1 σ error in S is N = √ gC . When we are photon-noise-limited , then S / N = √ gC ; this is the lowest possible level of noise. The read noise R of a CCD is given in units of photoelectrons; including this, we can write S / N = gC / \u0017 gC + R 2 . At low signal levels, R is the dominant noise source; we are read-noise-limited . In this case R 2 \u0012 gC and the signal-to-noise ratio S / N grows linearly with exposure time t . When photon noise dominates, S / N ∝ √ gC , which grows only as √ t , and doubling the signal-to-noise ratio of a measurement requires that we observe four times longer. Extending this approach to include other noise sources, such as flat field errors, gives us a basis to predict the performance of real CCDs and other similar detectors. We may wish to measure the surface brightness I ( x ), the amount of light per square arcsecond at position x in the image of a galaxy, or the flux F λ in a spectrum. A CCD records only the total amount of light falling on each pixel during an exposure; it gives us no information on where a photon has landed within the pixel. So we can measure the angular size of a feature in the image only if its light is spread over at least two pixels on the CCD. To produce an image of the sky showing details 1 \u0006\u0006 across, the pixels must correspond to a size ∼ < 0 . 5 \u0006\u0006 on the image. Similarly, to obtain a spectrum with wavelength resolution \bλ , our spectrograph must disperse light in this wavelength interval over at least"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"196 Spiral and S0 galaxies two pixels on the CCD. The physical size of CCDs is limited, currently to about 10 cm × 10 cm; so we must compromise between high resolution and a large field of view. Images of objects extending over a large region on the sky are sometimes built up from a mosaic of several exposures, each covering only part of the object. In using a CCD, we must match its properties to those of the instrument for which it serves as the detector and those of the telescope; see the following problem. Problem 5.1 You have a CCD camera with 2048 × 2048 pixels, each 24 μ m square. The angle that a pixel covers on the sky is the angle that it subtends at a distance FL, the focal length of the telescope. This in turn depends on the focal ratio , f , and the diameter D of the mirror: FL = fD . Show that each pixel corresponds to 5 \u0006\u0006 / ( fD ), where D is in meters, and the whole CCD covers a region 168 \u0006 / ( fD ) across. You can use this camera on a 0.6 m telescope with f = 7 . 5 (usually written f / 7 . 5), on a 4 m telescope at f / 7 . 5, or at the prime focus of the 4 m telescope, which has f / 2 . 3. What is its pixel scale and field of view at each location? If atmospheric seeing blurs the image to 0 . 8 \u0006\u0006 across, where would you want to use the camera in order to get the sharpest images? If you take images of a nearby galaxy 10 \u0006 across, which option would you use to obtain a brightness profile I ( x ) for the entire galaxy? Array detectors with large numbers of pixels are used for astronomical obser- vations from X-rays into the infrared. The physical mechanisms that convert pho- tons into an electrical signal depend on the spectral region, but the basic principles are similar to those for CCDs, and the signal-to-noise ratio S / N for an observa- tion depends similarly on the number of photons detected and the sources of noise within the instrument. Unlike CCDs, most of the devices used for X-ray and ultraviolet observations count photons; each detected photon produces exactly one output count, so read noise is absent. But the speed of the electronics then limits both the maximum rate at which photons arriving at any one pixel can be counted and the counting rate across the entire array. A photon-counting device may saturate when observing a bright source. Infrared detectors, like CCDs, are analogue devices; they rely on a variety of physical processes. In the thermal infrared , at wavelengths ∼ > 2 μ m, telescopes and the Earth’s atmosphere, at temperatures ∼ 300 K, radiate strongly. This extra light must be taken into account when estimating the expected signal-to-noise ratio. Cooled telescopes in space can observe in the infrared without this unwanted background, but must still contend with the emission of warm dust in the solar system. At radio frequencies, instead of detecting photons, we take advantage of the wave nature of light; see Section 5.2. Our current perspective on galaxies has been heavily influenced by our ability to observe at many wavelengths, spanning the electromagnetic spectrum."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"5.1 The distribution of starlight 197 Fig. 5.3.

Peletier. The contours in the left panel of Figure 5.3 are the R -band isophotes , lines of constant surface brightness. The isophotes are fairly circular in the bulge region, becoming elliptical in the disk, apart from where they are affected by the spiral arms; they are ragged at the outer edge where the signal-to-noise ratio is low. If we assume that the disk is circular and very thin, it will appear as an ellipse with axis ratio cos i when we view it at an angle i from face-on. Real disks have some thickness, so they appear somewhat rounder at any particular viewing angle; see Section 6.1. For NGC 7331 the diameter along the minor axis of the disk isophotes is only 0.35 of that measured along the major axis; the galaxy is inclined at about 75 ◦ from face-on. Each square arcsecond at the center of the galaxy emits about ten thousand times as much light as the same area at R = 300 \u0006\u0006 ; the center is 100 times brighter than the sky, while the outer regions fade to about 1% of the sky brightness. Our printed image cannot show so much contrast, so we use a graph like Figure 5.4. If we can ignore the absorbing dust within the disk, the surface brightness is larger by a factor 1 / cos i than if we had seen the disk face-on. Using this or another method, we can correct to what we would observe if NGC 7331 had been face-on, and then find the average surface brightness I ( R ) at distance R from the center. Surface brightness is generally given in units of mag arcsec − 2 : the flux coming from each square arcsecond of the galaxy, expressed as an apparent magnitude. At the center of NGC 7331, the I -band surface brightness I I (0) = 15 mag arcsec − 2 . Galaxies do not have sharp outer edges; for historical and technical reasons, we usually measure the size within a given isophote in the B band, centred near 4400 ̊ A. For NGC 7331, the radius at the isophote I B = 25 mag arcsec − 2 is R 25 = 315 \u0006\u0006 ."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"5.1 The distribution of starlight 199 Problem 5.2 Show that a central surface brightness of 15 mag arcsec − 2 in the I band corresponds to 18 000 L \u0005 pc − 2 ; explain why this does not depend on the galaxy’s distance. About how far does I B = 25 mag arcsec − 2 fall below the brightness of the night sky, given in Table 1.9? Integrating the surface brightness over the whole of an image such as the one in Figure 5.3, and extrapolating to allow for those parts of the galaxy too faint to measure reliably, gives the total apparent magnitude . Catalogues usually give these in the B band, or the V band at 5500 ̊ A. A face-on galaxy would be brighter than the same galaxy seen at an angle, since starlight leaving the disk at a slant must travel further through the absorbing layer of interstellar dust in the disk. So, to compare the true brightnesses of galaxies that we observe at different inclinations, we must try to compensate for dust dimming. Finally, we must correct for the effect of foreground dust, within our own Milky Way. Catalogues often quote total magnitudes corrected to face-on viewing, denoted by 0 . For NGC 7331, the corrected total B -magnitude is B 0 T = 9 . 37, and in V it is V 0 T = 8 . 75, so ( B − V ) 0 ≈ 0 . 6; taken as a whole, the galaxy is about the same color as the Sun. In the stellar disk, when we average over features like spiral arms, the surface brightness I ( R ) often follows approximately an exponential form, I ( R ) = I (0) exp( − R / h R ) , (5.1) as we expect if the density of stars in the disk varies according to the double- exponential formula of Equation 2.8. The long-dashed line in Figure 5.4 shows the exponential slope with scale length h R = 55 \u0006\u0006 . For most disk galaxies, 1 kpc ∼ < h R ∼ < 10 kpc. When measured in the B band rather than in I , h R is typically about 20% longer because the disks become redder toward the center. The inner part of the disk is typically richer in heavy elements (as Figure 4.15 shows for M33), and metal-rich stars are redder (Figure 1.5). The outer disk may have a larger fraction of young blue stars, or it may be less heavily reddened by dust; frequently it is hard to separate these effects. The exponential part of the stellar disk in many, though not all, disk galaxies appears to end at some radius R max , usually in the range 10–30 kpc or (3–5) h R . Beyond R max the surface brightness decreases more sharply; but this is not the edge of the galaxy, since H I gas and some disk stars may be found still further out.

This is a moderately dense nearby group of galaxies, about 15 Mpc from us, roughly in the direction of the Virgo cluster. Because all the galaxies have nearly the same distance from us, those that appear brightest, with small values of m K \u0006 , are also the most luminous. But one disadvantage of observing a group is that we do not obtain a complete sample of all types of galaxy, and may not even have a fair sample of ‘average’ galaxies.

The color of the S0 galaxies is approximately that of a K giant; since young blue stars are absent, most of the light comes from red stars which have evolved past the main sequence. Sd and Sm galaxies are bluer because they have a larger fraction of young stars; their optical-band colors are similar to those of late F and G stars. In the optical image of an edge-on disk galaxy, such as the right panel of Figure 5.16 below, we see a thin dark dust lane cutting across the middle of the disk. As in the Milky Way, the light-scattering and light-absorbing dust lies in a much thinner layer than the majority of the stars. In an edge-on disk, if we measure R along the major axis of the image, and z is distance from the midplane, then, above and below the dust lane, the surface brightness often follows approximately I ( R , z ) = I ( R ) exp( −| z | / h z ) .

Some Sc and Sd galaxies are ‘superthin’, with even more extreme flattening, while in Sm and irregular galaxies the disk is quite thick and fluffy (Figure 5.7). In other systems, the surface brightness drops at high z less rapidly than Equation 5.2 would predict: like the Milky Way, they have a thick disk .

We can also use solid-state devices to detect infrared photons; large arrays are available for wavelengths λ ≤ 40 μ m. These cannot be made from silicon, but must use semiconductors with lower bandgap energies, such as indium antimonide. To reduce dark counts, they must be operated very cold, at cryogenic temperatures. Dust grains affect longer-wavelength light less strongly, so infrared images of the central parts of galaxies can reveal stars which at optical wavelengths are hidden behind dust. An infrared image in the 2.2 μ m K band of the central few arcseconds of the spiral galaxy M100 reveals a central bar, with little sign of the four spiral arms so clearly outlined in visible light (Figure 5.9). Because hot young O and B stars emit relatively little of a galaxy’s near-infrared light, images at these wavelengths are used to investigate the old stellar populations. In the infrared, spiral arms generally appear smoother and less prominent, showing that much of their light comes from young massive stars, and that their appearance at visible wavelengths is heavily influenced by dust lanes.

We see bright islands of light along the spiral arms, where clumps of short-lived massive stars have been born in giant molecular clouds. Their brilliance depends both on how many hot stars are concentrated there and on gaps in the obscuring dust that allow light to shine through. Figure 5.10 confirms that the spiral pattern stands out in photographs because of its luminous young stars. When we look in Section 9.4 at the optical images of galaxies at redshifts z ∼ > 1, we are seeing the light which they emitted as ultraviolet radiation, redshifted by cosmic expansion. We must be careful to compare these with ultraviolet images of nearby galaxies, rather than with their optical appearance. Since dust is very opaque at these shorter wavelengths, it can absorb much of a galaxy’s ultraviolet light. In a galaxy like NGC 7331, 20%–30% of the ultraviolet photons are absorbed, but only a few percent escape from the most vigorously star-forming galaxies. The dust re-emits that energy at infrared wavelengths. Fig- ure 2.24 shows the infrared spectrum of the star-forming inner ring of NGC 7331.

In Section 5.1, we saw how to locate concentrations of gas indirectly, by looking in optical images for the dark obscuring dust lanes. Cool gas can be seen directly by its emission in spectral lines at radio wavelengths, which propagate unhindered through the dusty disk. If it is ionized by the ultraviolet radiation of hot stars, or by a shock wave, we see it in optical emission lines such as H α . Because we observe the gas in its spectral lines, we can also measure its velocity at each point within the galaxy, and so explore its motion. 5.2.1 Radio-telescope arrays We observe cool gas mainly at radio wavelengths, longer than about a millimeter. Because of the longer wavelengths, radio telescopes have fuzzier vision than optical telescopes. When observing at wavelength λ with a telescope of diameter D , sources that lie within an angle λ/ D of each other on the sky will appear blended together: this is the diffraction limit , which no telescope can escape. At optical wavelengths of λ ≈ 5000 ̊ A, the diffraction limit would allow images as sharp as 1 \u0006\u0006 from a small telescope of D = 10 cm, while at 1 mm we would need a telescope 200 m across to achieve the same resolution. The largest single-dish radio telescopes are about 100 m in diameter, and most are a few tens of meters across; so in general their images are not as sharp as those from optical telescopes. To make an image with 1 \u0006\u0006 resolution at λ = 20 cm would require a telescope 40 km in diameter; a single dish of this size would collapse under its own weight. At centimeter wavelengths, and increasingly in the millimeter region as well, we use an array of smaller telescopes for aperture synthesis . To see how aperture synthesis works, we can think of radio waves as oscil- lating electric and magnetic fields. If the wavelength is λ , the electric field E ∝ cos(2 π ct /λ ); the voltage V induced at the focus of a radio telescope is proportional to the electric field E at that instant. Suppose that we observe with two telescopes, as in Figure 5.11. Waves from a source at elevation θ must travel an extra distance d cos θ to arrive at telescope 2, so the wavecrests, and the peaks in voltage, are delayed by a time d cos θ/ c relative to those at telescope 1.

(5.3) We multiply the signals V 1 and V 2 in a correlator , and then filter the out- put to remove rapid oscillations. The result is the fringe pattern : a signal S ∝ cos(2 π d cos θ/λ ), which varies slowly as the Earth rotates, changing the angle θ . Two sources that are nearby on the sky will produce completely different fringe patterns if the elevation cos θ differs by an amount λ/ (2 d ). So this simple interferometer can distinguish sources separated only by an angle λ/ ( d sin θ )– it has the resolving power of a large single dish of diameter d sin θ . The vector separating the two dishes is called the baseline . The interferometer’s resolution is set by the component of the baseline that lies perpendicular to a vector pointing at the source. Our two-element interferometer cannot measure the source’s position: it can only tell us the value of cos θ to within a multiple of λ/ d . To get more information, we add more pairs of telescopes, with different baselines. If we could cover all the area of a circle of radius d with small dishes, and examine the signals from each of them in conjunction with every other, we would effectively build up, or synthesize, the whole picture that we would be able to see with a giant dish of diameter d . If the source is not varying with time, then we do not need to have all the small telescopes in place at once. We can space them in an east–west line, as in the synthesis telescope at Westerbork, in the Netherlands. As seen from the source, the dishes move around each other in elliptical tracks as the Earth rotates (Figure 5.12). The Earth’s rotation gives us a large number of baselines at a range of angles, even with only a few dishes. In twelve hours, we could synthesize a map of our source as it would be seen by a large elliptical telescope.

To speed up the observations, radio telescopes like the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico place the dishes in a large ‘Y’. A four-hour observation then includes baselines at a full range of angles, and even a brief ‘snapshot’ contains enough information to construct a crude map. The correlated signal S from each combination of two small telescopes sam- ples the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution on the sky. We measure the transform at a wave vector that is proportional to the component of the baseline separating the two dishes, in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight to the source. To map a source that is more complicated than just a single point, we must use a computer to invert the Fourier transform, and construct the image seen by the large ‘telescope’. A telescope ‘dish’ synthesized in this way has big holes in it, because the small dishes fill only a fraction of its area: we can sample the Fourier transform only at a limited set of points. Depending on how the telescopes are placed, this can make pointlike sources appear elongated or star-shaped instead of round; computer processing is used to correct the images. The synthesized telescope has much less light-collecting area than a filled dish of the same diameter would have; thus, mapping faint sources can require many hours. The radio sky is so much darker than at visible wavelengths that we can ignore it; we do not need to subtract its contribution or worry about how it varies during a long observation. However, radio telescopes can suffer interference of terrestrial origin and from strong radio sources in other parts of the sky. Each dish of diameter D receives radiation only from a patch on the sky which is λ/ D across; this limits the region we can map with each pointing of the synthesis array. If the shortest distance between any pair of small telescopes is d min , then sources that cover an angle on the sky larger than λ/ d min will hardly be detected at all. Since the dishes cannot be closer together than their physical diameter D , maps from synthesis telescopes always make the gas look clumpier than it really is. Synthesis maps should be completed by adding in the information from a single telescope of diameter at least 2 D ; but often this is not practical."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"5.2 Observing the gas 209 Problem 5.6 In the VLA’s C-array configuration, the most widely separated dishes are 3.4 km apart, and the closest are 73 m from each other.

In synthesis telescopes with diameters up to 100 km, the dishes are connected by cabling, and their signals are combined online. With widely separated dishes, we can use an atomic clock at each one for synchronization, and combine the recorded streams of data after the observations are finished. In very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), the combined ‘telescope’ can be as big as the whole Earth, so we can make images of sources less than 0 . 001 \u0006\u0006 across. Putting one of the dishes into space allows even wider separations and finer resolution. Further reading: B. Burke and F.

Since the gas is moving within the galaxy, its line emission is Doppler shifted according to the radial velocity V r . So we set the telescope to observe simultaneously in a number of closely spaced frequency channels; typically, each covers a few kilometers per second in velocity. For the most part, H I in galaxy disks is optically thin ; the 21 cm line suffers little absorption, so the mass of gas is just proportional to the intensity of its emission. Just as for visible light, the radio power that we receive from a given cloud of H I gas decreases with its distance d as 1 / d 2 . We can use the result of Problem 1.9 to find its mass, integrating the flux F ν over the frequencies corresponding to the galaxy’s gas. When we measure d in Mpc, F ν in janskys, and V r in km s − 1 , M (H I ) = 2 . 36 × 10 5 M \u0005 × d 2 \u0002 F ν \u000b 1421 MHz × \u0003 1 − V r c \u0004\f d V r .

A deep H I map traces gas to ∼ 10 19 H atoms cm − 2 , corresponding to 0 . 1 M \u0005 pc − 2 . Generally, H I maps are not as sharp as optical images; because the signal is weak, we use relatively coarse resolution to improve the signal-to- noise ratio.

We can also make a contour plot like Figure 5.13 showing the average radial velocity of gas at each position. The gas clearly lies in the galaxy’s disk. As in the Milky Way and M31, the center is largely gas-poor, while H I is piled up in a ring several kiloparsecs in radius. Figure 5.14 shows how the surface density of H I varies with radius. The gas is spread out much more uniformly than the stellar light; the peak density in the ring is only a few times larger than average, much less than the 10 000- fold variation in surface brightness that we saw in Figure 5.4. The H I disk is larger than that of the stars; on measuring its size at the radius where the density has fallen to 1 M \u0005 pc − 2 , we find that it extends to about twice the optical size R 25 . As Figure 5.15 shows, this is typical for spiral galaxies.

As we discussed in Section 2.4, a thick-enough layer of H I gas can absorb virtually all the ultraviolet photons that would have enough energy to break up hydrogen molecules. If the surface density of gas is higher than about 4 M \u0005 pc − 2 , those atoms deepest in the layer will combine into H 2 molecules, protected by the atomic gas above and below.

We do not know whether the edge of the H I marks the end of the galaxy’s gas disk, or whether there is gas further out that is ionized by intergalactic radiation. The left panel of Figure 5.16 shows the distribution of H I in the unusual edge- on Sc galaxy NGC 891. The dense gas layer in the disk is surrounded by more diffuse H I , continuing out to ∼ 5 kpc above and below the midplane. The gas may have been pushed out of the disk by vigorous star formation, perhaps forming ‘holes’ like those in the H I disks of star-forming galaxies in the Local Group (Figures 4.4 and 4.19). NGC 891 has a remarkably large amount of gas above the disk, but all spiral galaxies show some. The gas is ‘effervescent’, bubbling up from the disk; much of it probably cools and then falls back in. There is much more H I gas on the southern side of this galaxy than to the north; the outer parts of galactic disks are quite commonly lopsided. The right panel of Figure 5.16 shows NGC 891 in the red R band; a thin absorbing lane of dust bisects the galaxy. The middle panel shows that H α emis- sion, from gas ionized by the ultraviolet radiation of hot stars, is brightest at small radii and close to the disk midplane, but diffuse emission persists even up to heights of 5 kpc.

The diffuse emission shows that both ultraviolet light and fast electrons can escape from the galactic disk, where they originate. The gas of the disk must be lumpy, so that both photons and fast particles can stream out between the clumps or clouds. High above the disk, this galaxy prob- ably has a halo of hot gas like that of the Milky Way, at temperatures close to a million degrees. We cannot search directly for emission lines from cool molecular hydrogen; see Section 1.2. Instead, we rely on detecting the spectral lines of molecules such as carbon monoxide, generally at millimeter wavelengths. Radio receivers at centimeter wavelengths work better than those in the millimeter region; and, locally, the ratio of CO molecules to H 2 is only about 10 − 4 . Hence observations of molecular gas are less sensitive than those for H I ; it is usually easier to detect a given mass of atomic gas than the same amount of molecular material. But, because of the shorter wavelength, maps of molecular gas often have better spatial resolution than those in H I . In Figure 5.3 we see CO emission from a ring within 2 \u0006 ,or2.2 h R , of the center of NGC 7331, corresponding to about 3 × 10 9 M \u0005 of H 2 . CO emission in spiral galaxies is generally most intense in the inner regions; there, most of the gas is molecular. Some spirals, like the Milky Way and NGC 7331, have an inner ring of dense molecular gas, while in others the CO emission peaks at the center. Unlike H I , molecular gas is not usually detected beyond the stellar disk, and the majority of gas in the disk is atomic. Often, we use the ratio of the H I mass M (H I ) to the blue luminosity to measure how gas-rich a galaxy is. This ratio does not depend on the galaxy’s distance d , because the apparent brightness in visible light, and the radio power received, both diminish as 1 / d 2 . In S0 and Sa galaxies, M (H I ) / L B ∼ (0 . 05–0 . 1) M \u0005 / L B , \u0005 ;it is about ten times larger in the gas-rich Sc and Sd systems. The Sc, Sd, and Sm galaxies have been consuming their gas supply fairly slowly; a smaller fraction of their light comes from older, redder, stars and relatively more from hot young stars. From Figure 5.6, we saw that these galaxies have the bluer colors expected when young stars predominate. In them, young associations and their H II regions stand out more clearly, and the individual H II regions around these associations are also larger than those in Sa and Sb galaxies.

On the basis of Problem 2.8, assume that M / L ∼ > 2 for the stars in NGC 7331; show that, even if we include the molecular gas, the mass in its stars is at least five times larger than that in cool gas.

The gas content of S0 galaxies is very different from that of spirals. The stellar disks of most S0s have so little gas that it is hardly measurable. Star formation or some other process has depleted the gas, leaving behind ‘stellar fossils’: disks where no significant numbers of new stars have been made over the past few gigayears. But a few S0 and elliptical galaxies have ∼ > 10 10 M \u0005 of H I , as much as the most gas-rich spirals. Often this gas does not lie in the galaxy disk, or share the orbital motion of the disk stars, but forms a tilted ring encircling the galaxy. Occasionally, the rotation of the gas is retrograde , opposite to that of the disk stars; in other cases – see Figure 5.17 – it orbits as a polar ring, perpendicular to the galaxy’s disk. Because the angular momentum of the ring and that of the central galaxy are so different, we think that the gas was captured at a late stage, after the galaxy’s central body had formed. In a few S0 galaxies, such as NGC 4550, a substantial minority of the disk stars rotate in the opposite sense to the majority: they presumably formed from late-arriving gas, which was caught into a retrograde orbit. Counter-rotating stars are not common; they are detected in fewer than 1% of all disk galaxies. 5.3 Gas motions and the masses of disk galaxies We saw in Section 2.3 that the stars and gas of the Milky Way account for only a fraction of its mass; most of it is ‘dark’, undetectable except through its grav- itational attraction.

We saw in Section 5.2 that the H I layer of a spiral galaxy generally extends out about twice as far as the stellar disk, as measured by the isophotal radius R 25 . Usually, the gas speeds are approximately constant to the edge of the H I disk, implying that M ( < R ) continues to rise; the outer parts of the galaxy contain much mass but emit little light. This section discusses how we determine a spiral galaxy’s rotation curve V ( R ), and what we know about gravitational forces and dark matter in disk galaxies. 5.3.1 The rotation curve The predominant motion of gas in a spiral galaxy is rotation; random speeds in the H I gas are typically only 8–10 km s − 1 , even less than for the stars. So the asymmetric drift , which we discussed in Section 2.2, is small; we can assume that, at radius R , a gas cloud follows a near-circular path with speed V ( R ). All we can detect of this motion is the radial velocity V r toward or away from us; its value at the galaxy’s center, V sys , is the systemic velocity . Suppose that we observe a disk in pure circular rotation, tilted at an angle i to face-on, as in Figure 5.18. We can specify the position of a star or gas cloud by its radius R and azimuth φ , measured in the disk from the diameter AB lying perpendicular to our viewing direction. There, the radial velocity is V r ( R , i ) = V sys + V ( R )sin i cos φ. (5.5)"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"216 Spiral and S0 galaxies 012345 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 3 3 5 5 Fig. 5.19.

Contours of constant V r connect points with the same value of V ( R ) cos φ , forming a ‘spider diagram’ like that in Figure 5.19. The line AB is the kinematic major axis , the azimuth where V r deviates furthest from V sys . In the central regions, where approximately V ( R ) ∝ R , the contours are parallel to the minor axis; further out, where the rotation speed is nearly constant, they run radially away from the center. If V ( R ) begins to fall, the extreme velocity contours close back on themselves. Taking V max as the peak of the galaxy’s rotation curve, the spread between the largest and the smallest values of the measured velocity is W = 2 V max sin i . Problem 5.8 In a galaxy where the potential follows the Plummer model of Equation 3.11, use Equation 3.20 to find the rotation curve V ( R ); show that V 2 max = V 2 ( √ 2 a P ) = 2 G M / (3 √ 3 a P ).

For inclination i = 30 ◦ , draw a spider diagram with contours of V r − V sys at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 times V max sin i ; show that the last of these forms a closed loop. In many galaxies, like our Milky Way, the inclination i changes with radius; the gas disk is warped. Then, the outer part of the spider is generally rotated with respect to the inner region; we can use that twist in the kinematic major axis to deduce the amount of warping. If V r \u0014= 0 along the apparent minor axis, the gas must have some motion toward or away from the galaxy’s center. We will see in Section 5.5 that radial motion is characteristic of barred galaxies, where the gas follows elongated oval orbits. Random motions of the gas clouds, and streaming velocities induced by the spiral arms (see Section 5.5 below), also distort the contours. But the characteristic spider pattern is usually visible: we see it in the velocity field in the right panel of Figure 5.13. We can find V ( R ) and the inclination i by choosing values so that the computed velocity contours are close to those measured in H I .

As in many giant spirals, the rising part of the rotation curve is very steep; often, as here, H I observations lack the spatial resolution to follow the rapid climb. At all radii, the angular speed V ( R ) / R is decreasing; gas further out takes longer to complete an orbit about the galactic center. This differential rotation is typical of spiral galaxies. 5.3.2 Dark matter in disk galaxies We can compare the rotation curve of Figure 5.20 with what we would expect if the mass of the galaxy had been concentrated entirely in its stars and gas. For the stellar disk and the bulge, we assume that the density of stars is proportional to the R -band light, and guess at the mass-to-light ratio M / L . For the gas disk, the surface density is approximately 1.4 times that measured in H I , since helium contributes a mass about 40% of that in hydrogen; see Section 1.5. We calculate the contributions to the radial force from each component separately, and we add them to find the total. Thus V 2 ( R ) for the galaxy is the sum of contributions from the various parts. Taking the bulge to be nearly spherical, we can find its inward force from Equation 3.20. Because the stellar and gas disks are flattened, their force can point either inward or outward. At R ∼ < 6 kpc, the force from the gas disk is outward,"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"218 Spiral and S0 galaxies 0 5 10 15 20 0 100 200 300 400 Irr Sc Sd Sb Sbc Sc Sab Scd LSB LSB LSB Fig. 5.21.

In Figure 5.20, the ratio M / L has been adjusted so that gas and luminous stars account for as much of the galaxy’s rotation as possible: this is the ‘maximum-disk’ model. If no other matter had been present, we see from Figure 5.20 that the rotation speed should have begun to fall at around 20 kpc from the center. Like the Milky Way, this galaxy contains substantial mass in regions beyond the visible stellar disk. The curve labelled ‘halo’ shows how a spherical halo of dark matter could provide enough inward force to account for the measured rotation speed; at least 75% of the total mass appears to be dark. The outer reaches of this galaxy contain almost exclusively H I gas and unseen matter.

(This is considerably higher than the value M / L ≈ 3 that we found for the gas and stars of the Galactic disk near the Sun in Problem 2.8; the visible parts of the galaxy contribute only a small fraction of its mass.)

Beyond its peak, V ( R ) remains fairly steady; it does not drop as it should if the mass of the galaxy had been in an exponential disk. As in NGC 7331, the higher-than-expected rotation requires an additional inward force, which we ascribe to a dark halo. Peak rotation speeds in spiral galaxies are usually 150–300 km s − 1 . They rarely rise above 400 km s − 1 , and the fastest measured rotation is about 500 km s − 1 , in the S0 / Sa galaxy UGC 12591. Larger galaxies, with longer scale lengths h R , generally rotate more rapidly; these tend to be the Sa and Sb galaxies, rather than the Sc, Sd, and Sm systems. The rotation curves of Sa and Sb galaxies initially climb steeply, showing that relatively more of their mass is closer to the center. In these systems, the luminous matter in the disk and the bulge is concentrated at small radii, and the dark matter in the halo also becomes very dense there. In Sd and Sm galaxies, the rotation speed increases more gradually. These galaxies do not have large bulges, and Figure 5.8 showed us that their luminous disks have low central surface brightness. The rotation curves show that the dark halo also lacks central concentration; its core, where the density is nearly constant, must be larger in relation to the galaxy’s stellar disk. Most low-surface-brightness galaxies rotate slowly, with gently ascending rotation curves like those of Sd or Sm galaxies; but there are some with higher speeds and faster-rising rotation curves. The proportion of dark matter required to explain these rotation curves varies from about 50% in Sa and Sb galaxies to 80%–90% in Sd and Sm galaxies. There may be yet more dark material out beyond the last point where we have observed H I gas; the ‘total mass’ of a spiral galaxy measured in this way is only a lower bound. We must turn to the orbital motion of galaxies in binary pairs or groups to study the dark matter at larger radii: look back at Section 4.5, or forward to Chapter 7. Galaxies and their dark matter do not provide enough mass to halt the cosmic expansion. For most galaxies, we must use Hubble’s law and the recession speed V sys to give a rough estimate of the distance d . Equation 1.27 tells us that d ≈ h − 1 [ V sys (kms − 1 ) / 100] Mpc , (1.27) where h = H 0 / 100 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . So when we estimate the luminosity L of a galaxy from its apparent brightness by using Equation 1.1, L ∝ h − 2 . The mass inferred from Equation 3.20 depends on the Hubble constant as M ∝ h − 1 ,so the mass-to-light ratios derived from the rotation curves of spiral galaxies follow M / L ∝ h . For most spirals, we find 5 h ∼ < M / L ∼ < 25 h , in units of the Sun’s mass and blue luminosity. From Equation 1.25, the blue light of all the galaxies averages out to 2 × 10 8 hL \u0005 Mpc − 3 . So if the mass-to-light ratio for each were roughly the same as that for the gas-rich disk systems where we observe H I gas, they would contribute a density ρ gal ∼ (1 − 5) × 10 9 h 2 M \u0005 Mpc − 3 , less than 0.02 of the critical density ρ crit given by Equation 1.30.

Most of those neutrons and protons are not in the galaxies. We will see below, in Chapter 7, that groups and clusters of galaxies contain hot diffuse intergalactic gas, which could be a storehouse for the ‘hidden’ baryons. 5.3.3 The Tully–Fisher relation If we want to know only the peak rotation speed V max in a galaxy, we can use a single-dish radio telescope with a large enough beam to include all the H I gas, and measure how much there is at each velocity. Figure 5.22 shows this global profile for NGC 7331. Because much of the gas lies at radii where V ( R ) is nearly constant, most of the emission is crowded into two peaks near the extreme velocities. This double-horn profile is characteristic of galaxies where the rotation curve first rises, then remains roughly flat; the separation of the peaks is W ≈ 2 V max sin i . If instead we had observed a galaxy in which the rotation curve was rising at all radii, or if we looked only at the inner part of the disk in Figure 5.19, we would see a flat-topped or centrally peaked profile instead. Brighter galaxies rotate faster on average, which tells us that they are more massive. Brent Tully and J. Richard Fisher showed that the rotation speed of a galaxy increases with its luminosity, roughly as L ∝ V α max , with α ∼ 4: this is the Tully–Fisher relation. The observed values fall closer to a single curve when L is measured in the red or near-infrared. The blue luminosity is more likely to fluctuate over time, since young massive stars contribute much of the light. In the blue, a galaxy that has recently had a burst of star formation will temporarily be much brighter than it usually is, while V max remains unchanged; so the observed luminosities will scatter widely about their mean at any given rotation speed.

(5.6) When the luminosity L is measured in blue light, the exponent of V max is close to three. Figure 5.6 showed us that more luminous galaxies tend to be redder, so a fast-rotating luminous galaxy will be even brighter relative to a faint and slowly rotating one at red or infrared wavelengths than when both are measured in blue light. This is another of the confusing consequences of the way that the average luminosity and color of galaxies are related to their other properties. If galaxies contained no dark matter, we could understand the Tully–Fisher relation fairly easily; see the following problem. But, since the rotation speed V max is set largely by the unseen material, while the luminosity comes from the stellar disk, the link between them is puzzling. Somehow, the amount of dark matter is coordinated with the luminous mass. The Tully–Fisher relation can be used to estimate distances to galaxies and galaxy groups; it gives us an important step on the cosmic distance ladder .We first calibrate the relation, using galaxies close enough that we can estimate their distances by using Cepheid variables. From the H I profile of a more distant system observed with a radio telescope, we measure V max , and then use the Tully–Fisher relation to infer the galaxy’s intrinsic luminosity in visible or infrared light. Comparing this with the observed apparent magnitude yields the distance. If we know the Hubble constant H 0 , we can find the peculiar velocities of our galaxies – the amount by which their motion differs from the homogeneous and isotropic cosmic expansion.

Spiral arms are absent from the disks of S0 galaxies, while ‘ as the sequence progresses, the arms increase in bulk at the expense of the nuclear region, unwinding as they grow, until in the end they are widely open and the nucleus is inconspicuous ’: the ‘nucleus’ here is what we would today call the galaxy’s bulge. Hubble’s original scheme has since been extended to include the Sd galaxies, which almost completely lack a bulge, and the Magellanic Sm systems. Nearby galaxies are still classified by a human expert, comparing optical images of the systems under study with those of galaxies that have already been assigned a type. The modified Hubble classification is useful because other characteristics of galaxies are linked with their position along the sequence. Table 5.1 lists these, beginning with the spiral structure. Some are linked fairly directly with the spiral properties: for example, S0 galaxies, which lack the hot young stars that outline spiral arms, are redder than Sc and Sd galaxies. Figure 5.24 shows spectra of an S0 galaxy, an Sb, and an Sc. Most of the light of the S0 galaxy emerges at the longest wavelengths, where we see absorption lines characteristic of cool K stars. In the blue, we see the H and K lines of calcium, and the G band, features characteristic of the hotter solar-type stars that produce most of the light at these wavelengths; see Section 1.1.

By contrast, the Sc galaxy emits most of its light in the blue and near-ultraviolet part of the spectrum; the light comes mainly from hot young stars, which also heat and ionize the gas responsible for the prominent emission lines. The uppermost spectrum is for a starburst galaxy, where many stars have recently been born: see Section 5.6. We saw from Figure 5.8 that Sc and Sd galaxies contain a higher proportion of gas than do the Sa and Sb systems. So perhaps it is not surprising that Sc and Sd galaxies have made a larger fraction of their stars in the past gigayear. Galactic bulges are much brighter at their centers than the disks; see Figure 5.4. Thus galaxies early in the sequence have higher central brightness I (0). When galaxies are too distant to allow a clear view of the spiral arms, Figure 5.25 shows that we can base a classification on the degree to which their light is concentrated toward the center. We can also calculate the coarseness or asymmetry, both of which measure how far the galaxy’s appearance differs from an axially symmetric disk. Both spiral arms and patches of vigorous star formation are absent in S0 galaxies; Figure 5.25 shows how they become more prominent along the sequence from Sb to Sm. Distant galaxies can also be classified on the basis of their spectra: Figures 8.5 and 9.15 make use of such a scheme. Figure 5.6 showed us that S0 and Sa galaxies are on average more luminous than Sd and Sm systems, and we saw in the previous section that they also are generally more massive. Somehow, more luminous and more massive galaxies know that they must develop into one of the former types, while smaller systems become Sd and Sm galaxies. But all the relations we have described in this section hold true only on average. Although the S0, Sa, and Sb galaxies tend to have higher central surface brightness than do Sd systems, low-surface-brightness S0 galaxies are also found.

Such partial linkage of the various properties of galaxies is infuriating to theoreticians, who do not yet have much understanding of it. Because so many characteristics of galaxies are related, we must be careful in studying any particular property. Early work on rotation curves provides a cautionary tale. In local samples of galaxies within ∼ 20 Mpc, rotation speeds of early-type spirals were found to be higher than those of late-type Sc galaxies, inviting the conclusion that early-type spirals are in general faster rotators.

Later surveys further afield revealed very luminous and rapidly rotating Sc galaxies: V max depends mainly on luminosity, through the Tully–Fisher relation. 5.5 Spiral arms and galactic bars The photogenic arms of spiral galaxies are the most striking luminous structures in any galaxy atlas, yet spiral structure still has its puzzling aspects. Almost all giant galaxies with gas in their disks have some kind of spiral, although simple arguments imply that spiral arms should rapidly disappear. Two properties of the disk seem to be essential: differential rotation, which tends to shear any feature into a trailing arm-segment, and self-gravity, which allows the spiral to grow, fed by the energy of the galaxy’s rotation. Gas appears to be required for a spiral, although not for a bar: the disks of S0 galaxies lack both gas and spiral arms, but they are as likely to be barred as are the gas-rich spiral galaxies. Beyond these simple statements, the subject becomes confusingly complex. 5.5.1 Observed spiral patterns The arms of a spiral galaxy are bluer than the rest of the disk, and H α emission betrays hot ionized gas around young massive stars.

Some galaxies have a flocculent pattern, with many short arm-segments instead of a continuous spiral; see Figure 5.27, or M33 in Figure 4.1.

In a disk rotating anticlockwise, where the rotation rate \u0002 ( R ) falls with radius R , stars that initially lie along a radial line are wound into a trailing spiral; the angle i is the pitch angle of the spiral. We can characterize a spiral as leading , with the tips of the arms pointing forward in the direction of the galaxy’s rotation, or trailing , with tips aimed in the direction opposite to the rotation. To know which applies, we must first find which side of the galaxy is nearest to us, usually by looking for differences in the obscuring effects of dust. This is not easy; but where we can determine the sense, the spiral arms almost always trail . In Figure 5.26, the narrow dust lanes on the concave inner sides of the spiral arms show that dust-bearing gas is being compressed there. We will see this as a sign that the arms do not contain a fixed population of stars and gas, but form a density wave , a ‘stellar traffic jam’ where stars are packed more densely and move more slowly along their orbits. One reason why we believe many spiral arms to be density waves is that the galaxy’s differential rotation would otherwise wind them rapidly into a very tight curl. To see why, suppose that stars are initally spread along a straight line through the galaxy’s center, given by φ = φ 0 (Figure 5.28). Each star moves in its orbit with speed V ( R ), at the angular rate \u0002 ( R ) = V ( R ) / R , so after time t they lie on a spiral given by the curve φ = φ 0 + \u0002 ( R ) t . In the language of Equation 5.7, we have f ( R , t ) =− φ 0 − \u0002 ( R ) t . Since the angular speed \u0002 ( R ) generally drops with radius, then, if we take \u0002 ( R ) > 0, f ( R , t ) increases on moving out along the arm to larger R ,so φ must diminish. This is a trailing spiral, since the tip of the arm points in the opposite sense to the galaxy’s rotation. As time goes on, this spiral becomes ever more closely wound.

Any initial spiral pattern would suffer a similar winding-up; the stars of the spiral arms must perpetually be renewed. 5.5.2 Theories for spiral structure Spiral structure is a complex phenomenon, and it is likely that no single process is responsible for the whole range of observed structures. Some galaxies, particularly those with flocculent spiral arms, may simply recreate their spiral patterns every few rotation periods. Once a cloud of gas has made its first stars, blast waves from the supernova explosions of short-lived massive stars will compress the surrounding gas. This may trigger the birth of yet more stars, so that star formation propagates through the gas. Differential rotation then draws the cloud out into a segment of a trailing spiral arm. By the time this fragment is strongly stretched, the gas will have been used up, the hot stars will have faded, and the region will have blended back into the disk. This model of self-propagating star formation will work only if the pace of starbirth can be regulated so that it neither dies out completely nor sets the whole disk afire, exhausting it of gas. It may be able to explain the fragmentary spiral arms of a galaxy like M33, but is less likely to apply to a system like M100: in Figure 5.26, the spiral arms can be traced over more than 180 ◦ . A spiral pattern can last longer if the stars that make it up are not on circular orbits, but are arranged in a particular order in their slightly eccentric paths: this is called a kinematic spiral . In Section 3.3, we saw that a star’s path on a nearly circular orbit can be described as the sum of circular motion of a guiding center, at the rate \u0002 ( R g ) appropriate to its radius R g , and an epicyclic oscillation moving the star in and out. The azimuth of the guiding center is φ gc = \u0002 ( R g ) t , while epicyclic motion causes the star’s radius to vary as R = R g + x = R g + X cos ( κ t + ψ ) . (3.70) Here X is the amplitude of the radial motion, κ is the epicyclic frequency, and the constant ψ prescribes the initial radius. If we start by placing stars with their guiding centers spread around the circle at R g , and set ψ = 2 φ gc (0) for each of them, they will lie on an oval, with its long axis pointing along φ = 0. At a later time t , the guiding centers move, so that φ gc ( t ) = φ gc (0) + \u0002 t . The stars advance on their epicycles, to lie at radius R = R g + x , where x = X cos { κ t + 2[ φ gc ( t ) − \u0002 t ] }= X cos[(2 \u0002 − κ ) t − 2 φ gc ( t )] . (5.10) The long axis of the oval now points along the direction where (2 \u0002 − κ ) t − 2 φ = 0 , or φ = ( \u0002 − κ/ 2) t ≡ \u0002 p t .

Right, a one-armed spiral, with R = R g [1 + 0 . 15 cos(5 − 5 R g + φ )] − 1 . We have defined the pattern speed \u0002 p so that the pattern made up by stars with guiding center R g will return to its original state after a time 2 π/\u0002 p , even though individual stars complete their orbits about the center in the shorter time 2 π/\u0002 .A two-armed spiral can be made up from a set of nested ovals of stars with guiding centers at different radii R g , as shown on the left of Figure 5.29. Because the pattern speed \u0002 p varies with R g , this spiral will in time also wind itself into a tight trailing pattern, but it will do so more slowly by the factor \u0002 p /\u0002 , which is about 0.3 when the rotation curve is flat. To describe an m -armed spiral, we would set ψ = m φ gc (0) in Equation 5.10; stars with a given guiding center then lie on m -fingered shapes that turn with a pattern speed \u0002 p = \u0002 − κ/ m . The right panel of Figure 5.29 shows a one-armed kinematic spiral. The density-wave theory of spiral structure is based on the premise that mutual gravitational attraction of stars and gas clouds at different radii can offset the kinematic spiral’s tendency to wind up, and will cause the growth of a pattern which rotates rigidly with a single pattern speed \u0002 p . One way to test whether a spiral pattern can develop spontaneously is to examine how it would affect the orbits of disk stars: the spiral will grow only if the stars respond to its gravity by moving so as to reinforce the pattern. A star orbiting at radius R passes through an arm of an m -fold spiral pattern with frequency m [ \u0002 p − \u0002 ( R )]. To see how this periodic tugging affects the stellar motions, we add a forcing term to the epicyclic equations. The calculation is lengthy but not difficult: we refer readers to Section 3.3 of Binney and Tremaine’s book. Finding how the forced motions of all the stars in turn affects the gravitational potential of the galaxy’s disk is much more difficult. In general the calculation can be done only for a tightly wound spiral; it shows that stars respond so as to strengthen the spiral only if the perturbing frequency m | \u0002 p − \u0002 ( R ) | is slower than the epicyclic frequency κ ( R ) at that radius. Hence, a continuous spiral wave can propagate only in the region between the inner Lindblad resonance , where \u0002 p = \u0002 − κ/ m , and the outer Lindblad resonance , where \u0002 p = \u0002 + κ/ m ."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"5.5 Spiral arms and galactic bars 231 6 5 4 3 2 1 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 OLR CR p radius R/a P frequency Fig. 5.30.

If the pattern speed were twice as large, the inner Lindblad resonances would be absent. Figure 5.30 shows positions of the m = 2 Lindblad resonances for the Plum- mer potential of Equation 3.11. Spirals with two or more arms always have an outer Lindblad resonance, but, if the pattern speed is high, there may be no inner Lindblad resonance. Stars beyond the outer resonance, or between the two inner resonances, find that the periodic pull of the spiral is faster than their epicyclic frequency κ ; they cannot respond to reinforce the spiral, and the wave dies out. Thus we would expect to see a continuous spiral only in the region between the inner and outer Lindblad resonances. Since for m > 2 the spiral is restricted to just a narrow annulus of the disk, we would expect two-armed spiral patterns to be more prominent than those with three or four arms.

But disk stars can reinforce a spiral wave, and help it to grow, only if their random motion is small enough so as not to take them outside the spiral arms. Alar Toomre showed in 1964 that axisymmetric ( m = 0, so nonspiral) waves can grow in a thin rotating disk of stars only if the disk is ‘cold’.

Hence Q ∼ 1 . 4 near the Sun, which is safely greater than unity. Why does the disk develop trailing spiral arms, instead of leading arms? It turns out that, in a trailing spiral, the inner parts of the disk exert a torque on the outer disk, which transfers angular momentum outward and allows material at small radii to move inward. As we saw in Problem 3.8, this decreases the energy of the disk’s rotational motion. By contrast, a disk could develop a leading spiral only if energy were supplied from outside; for example, by the close passage of another galaxy. The energy released by the spiral torques goes to increase the epicyclic motion of the stars. Figure 5.31 shows a gravitational N -body simulation, following what happens to a disk of ‘stars’ attracting each other by gravity. It is initially axisymmetric, with the stars on nearly circular orbits. The growing spiral pattern is two-armed; a straight central bar also forms. As the stellar random speeds grow, the disk ‘heats up’ and the spiral eventually disappears. The disk of an S0 galaxy, where no gas is present, would behave in the same way: any spiral pattern would be short-lived. But, as we saw in Section 2.2, stars freshly born from the disk gas have very small random speeds. Continued addition of these new stars may be important in prolonging the life of a spiral pattern, or in re-creating it periodically. The density-wave theory has not been a complete success. Spiral waves, like water waves, travel: the individual stars, or water molecules, oscillate about a fixed radius or position, but the waves move off to leave the water calm, and the disk without a spiral. Energy taken from the disk’s rotational motion would be sufficient to regenerate a spiral wave, but we do not understand exactly how it could be transferred to the wave. Simulations like that in Figure 5.31 suggest that this happens only if the spiral pattern speed \u0002 p is high enough for the inner Lindblad resonances to be absent. Then, waves can travel through the center of the disk, changing from a trailing to a leading spiral as they do so. The galaxy’s differential rotation pulls the leading spiral pattern into a trailing one, amplifying it in the process; the new trailing waves restart the cycle. Another possibility is that the spiral is driven by the gravitational pull of a companion galaxy, or by internal forces from a central rotating bar (see below). Many of the galaxies with the best grand-design spiral patterns have either close companions or pronounced central bars. Close to M100, we find the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 4322. In Figure 7.2 below, the galaxy M81 has a two-armed spiral; its two companions, the starburst galaxy M82 and NGC 3077, lie within 50 kpc. We will see in Section 7.1 that close passage of a neighboring galaxy can create at least a temporary two-armed spiral. An orbiting companion might trigger spiral arms as it came closest to the disk; if Q were close to unity, the disk stars could cooperate to strengthen the induced spiral. Similarly, a strong bar might encourage a spiral in a disk that was on the verge of producing one for itself, and would organize that pattern into a two-armed form."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"234 Spiral and S0 galaxies Fig. 5.32. The barred galaxy NGC 1300, classified as SBb or SBbc. The spiral arms trail; note the dust lanes on the leading edge of the bar – WIYN telescope. The gravitational pull of the spiral arms affects gas even more strongly than the stellar disk, because the random speeds of gas clouds are only 5–10 km s − 1 , much lower than for the stars. Except immediately around the corotation radius, where \u0002 ( R ) = \u0002 p , the linear speed R [ \u0002 ( R ) − \u0002 p ], with which gas and stars move into the spiral arm, is supersonic . Shocks develop as the gas flows into the arms, compressing it enormously. The fact that the dust lanes of Figure 5.26 lie on the concave side of the arm tells us that gas is entering the spiral from this side. So the local rotation rate \u0002 ( R ) must exceed the pattern speed \u0002 p ; this part of the arm lies inside the corotation radius. It takes about 10 Myr for young stars to be born in the compressed gas and begin to shine; in the lower left panel of Figure 5.26, the peak of the H α emission from gas ionized by these stars is not on top of the dust lane, but ‘downstream’ of it. Radiation from the hottest of these stars also splits some of the H 2 molecules apart, raising the density of atomic hydrogen, H I , in the spiral arms (lower right). 5.5.3 Barred disks About half of all disk galaxies show a central linear bar, containing up to a third of the total light. The ratio of the long to the short axis of the bar can be as extreme as 1 : 5, as in Figure 5.32. If the bars were much thicker than the disks, we would expect to see anomalous central thickening in roughly half of all edge-on spiral and S0 galaxies; this is not observed, so we think that bars must be almost as flat"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"5.5 Spiral arms and galactic bars 235 Fig. 5.33. Left, gas density from a computer simulation of flow within a bar; the solid curve outlines the bar, rotating clockwise.

The gas flow is compressed in shocks along the leading edge of the bar, where the aligned orbits have their greatest curvature – P. Englmaier, after MNRAS 287 , 57 (1997). as disks. S0 galaxies are about as likely to be barred as Sa or Sb spirals; in contrast to spiral arms, a bar can persist even if the disk is empty of gas. Barred galaxies still pose a riddle: we do not yet understand why some galaxies are barred while other, apparently similar, systems are not. Like spirals, the figure of the bar is not static, but rotates with some pattern speed \u0002 p . But, unlike spiral arms, bars are not density waves; most of their stars always remain within the bar. Inside a rotating bar, stars and gas no longer follow near-circular paths, but stay close to orbits that close on themselves as seen by an observer moving with the bar’s rotation. We can investigate these orbits by adding a term to the epicyclic equations of Section 3.3 to represent the force of the bar. Within corotation, where \u0002 p <\u0002 ( R ), we find a family of closed orbits that line up with the long axis of the bar; see Figure 5.33. In a stable bar, most of the stars would remain fairly near to these orbits, but outside the corotation radius, all the closed orbits lie perpendicular to the bar; there are no aligned orbits for stars to follow. For this reason, we think that bars probably rotate slowly enough that corotation falls beyond the end of the bar. Gas in the disk of a spiral galaxy can flow in toward the center only if it can get rid of its angular momentum. The strongly asymmetric gravitational forces of a bar help it to do just that. In many barred galaxies, dark dust lanes run along the leading edge of the bar; in Figure 5.32 they are visible as the light lines on the side of the bar opposite to the (trailing) spiral arms. The left panel of Figure 5.33 shows a computer simulation of the gas flow within a barred galactic disk. Within the bar, gas stays close to the aligned orbits, shown on the right of the figure."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"236 Spiral and S0 galaxies At the ends, the flow converges sharply, and gas pressure becomes important. A shock forms, compressing the gas and dust along the leading edge of the bar, as we see in NGC 1300. In the shock, the gas loses part of the energy of its forward motion as heat, so it drops down onto more tightly bound orbits closer to the center of the galaxy. This energy dissipation continues until the gas meets the rounder orbits that lie perpendicular to the bar; then, inflow stops, and the gas piles up in a central ring. The dust lanes produced in simulations where the corotation radius is only slightly beyond the end of the bar look most like those we observe in real barred galaxies. So we believe that the pattern speed \u0002 p is usually high, and rotation is almost as fast as it can be; corotation lies just beyond the bar’s end. Because the spiral arms in barred galaxies usually appear to start from the ends of the bar, it is often assumed that bar and spiral share the same pattern speed and always maintain the same relative alignment. This need not be the case: in Figure 5.31, the outer spiral has a lower pattern speed than the bar. But the eye joins the spiral pattern to the bar, so that the arms always appear to start near the end of the bar. There is nothing to prevent a galaxy from developing a bar that rotates faster (or slower) than the pattern of a surrounding spiral, or from having two or more independent spirals with discrepant pattern speeds or different numbers of arms. Further reading: D. M. Elmegreen, 1998, Galaxies and Galactic Structure (Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey), unfortunately now out of print, treats spiral structure on an undergraduate level; and Chapter 6 of J. Binney and S. Tremaine, 1987, Galactic Dynamics (Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey) gives a graduate-level discussion of the theory. 5.6 Bulges and centers of disk galaxies Bulges, along with the centers of small elliptical galaxies, are some of the densest known stellar systems (see Figure 4.18). The Milky Way’s bulge is largely hidden from us by dust; but when we look at M31 through a small telescope or binoculars, or at an ‘underexposed’ optical image of a disk galaxy, only the bright bulge is visible. In Figure 5.4, the surface brightness at the center of NGC 7331 rises to fifty times that of the inward-extrapolated exponential disk. The bulge is the ‘big city’ of a disk galaxy: a centrally placed dense region, where old and new stars are crammed tightly together. Within the central few parsecs we can find a hundred million stars, packed into a nuclear cluster; these in turn often harbor a large black hole. In these tiny central regions, densities are enormous, and timescales short. 5.6.1 Bulges In the images of two edge-on galaxies in Figures 5.5 and 5.16, the bulges appear as round ellipsoids. Other bulges are quite flattened, almost like bright central disks."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"5.6 Bulges and centers of disk galaxies 237 Some, including those of the Milky Way (Section 2.2) and M31 (Section 4.2) appear barlike; they may be triaxial ellipsoids, with three unequal axes. SB0, SBa, and SBb galaxies have a substantial bulge as well as a stellar bar; Figure 1.13 shows the SB0 galaxy NGC 936. When seen edge-on, most bulges appear roughly elliptical, but about 20% of them have the appearance of a peanut: the isophotes dip down toward the disk’s midplane at the center. Studies of gas motions within them suggest that peanut-bulges may in fact be fast-tumbling bars. The Milky Way’s bulge and that of M31 are fairly typical in being more metal- rich than the disk, and gas-poor except at the very center. On average, bulges are only slightly redder than the inner part of the disk; they continue the pattern seen in the disks, namely that galaxies become redder closer to the center. Like the colors of disks, bulge colors show a broad spread, varying from B − R ≈ 1 . 2, the color of a late F star, to B − R ≈ 1 . 8, corresponding to a late G star. Almost all the stars in the bulges of the Milky Way and M31 are at least several gigayears old. Beyond the Local Group we cannot resolve individual bulge stars, so we have no good estimates for their ages. Bulge stars share a common sense of rotation about the center, but have larger random motions than the disk stars: usually the ratio of rotational to random speeds V /σ ∼ 1. We would not expect round bulges to rotate very rapidly; if they did, they should be thin and disklike. In Section 6.2 we will discuss the minimum flattening that should be associated with a given amount of rotation, and we will find that large elliptical galaxies rotate less rapidly than would be possible for their flattening. Bulges and small ellipticals, by contrast, have about as much rotation as is permitted by their shapes; in these terms they are fast-rotating. The surface brightness of a bulge is often approximated by S ́ ersic’s formula I ( R ) = I (0)exp[ − ( R / R 0 ) 1 / n ] . (5.13) If the parameter n = 1, this is the same exponential law as Equation 5.1, whereas for n = 4itisthe de Vaucouleurs formula, which was developed to describe the light distribution in elliptical galaxies: we will meet it again in Section 6.1. According to this formula, the surface brightness should continue to increase all the way to the center; the three-dimensional density of stars would then grow without limit. Because our telescopes have a limited angular resolution, we do not know how far the stellar density increases; observed values reach thousands of stars per cubic parsec. A good measure of a bulge’s extent is the effective radius R e , the radius of a circle drawn on the sky that includes half of the bulge light. A galaxy in which the disk has a large scale length h R generally has a bulge with a large effective radius; one recent study found the ratio R e / h R ≈ 0 . 1. R e ranges from about 100 pc up to a few kiloparsecs in galaxies with the largest dimensions; for the bulge of the Sombrero galaxy in Figure 5.5, R e ≈ 4 kpc."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"238 Spiral and S0 galaxies The prominence of the bulge, along with the appearance of the spiral arms, is used to order the disk galaxies along the sequences of Figure 1.11. In S0 and Sa galaxies the bulge produces a larger fraction of the light than it does in Sb and Sc systems, while in the Sd class it is usually absent. The bulges of the early- type S0 and Sa systems have higher surface brightness I (0) at the center, but not necessarily larger sizes as measured by R e , compared with those in Sb and Sc galaxies. Most low-surface-brightness galaxies lack a substantial bulge; but in some, including the giant Malin 1, the bulge is similar to those of high-surface- brightness galaxies. On the basis of its bulge, Malin 1 could be classified as an Sb or Sa galaxy. But the spiral arms have the open character of Sc or Sd systems, although with much lower surface brightness than normal, and many times larger radial extent. Because bulges are so much denser than the disks surrounding them, they may have their origin earlier in the history of the Universe, when the average cosmic density was higher. Alternatively, they could have been formed later, out of gas which had been able to lose a great deal of its angular momentum, so it could sink toward the center of the galaxy. Or gas may have flowed inward, causing the disk to form a central bar, which in turn became unstable, thickening to become a peanut-bulge. None of the current theories gives a plausible account of the entire range of observed bulges. A bulge like that of the Milky Way probably formed most of its stars within the first few gigayears after the Big Bang. The Hubble Space Telescope has revealed a number of compact galaxies at redshifts z ∼ > 3 which may be building their bulges. These objects seen in light that was emitted at 1400 ̊ A ∼ < λ ∼ < 1900 ̊ A have sizes comparable to those of present-day galactic bulges; their luminosities correspond to the birth of (10–100) M \u0005 of new stars per year. At this rate, it would take only about 1 Gyr to make the entire bulge of a galaxy like our own. But not all bulges are so old. In the spiral galaxy NGC 7331, some of the bulge stars orbit the center in the opposite sense to the disk’s rotation! The bulge of this normal-looking galaxy probably contains material that fell into the system later, from outside. NGC 7331 is the only galaxy known where bulge stars orbit counter to the disk; such a major late addition cannot be common. 5.6.2 Nuclei and central black holes Just as water runs downhill, gas tends to flow into the center of a galaxy. In the bulge, clouds of gas shed from dying stars will collide with each other, lose energy, and sink to form a fast-rotating inner disk. As we saw in the last section, the action of a bar can also bring disk gas inward. In the central region, where the galaxy’s rotation curve V ( R ) rises linearly, the angular speed V ( R ) / R is nearly constant: shear is absent. In contrast to the main disk, gas clouds here would not be pulled apart by differential rotation; they might collapse easily under their own gravity, becoming dense enough to make stars. Just as in the Milky Way (see Section 2.2),"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"5.6 Bulges and centers of disk galaxies 239 in most spiral galaxies we see abundant gas within the central 100 pc, and some newly formed stars. In some galaxies, a central starburst is taking place: stars are being made so rapidly as to exhaust the gas supply within ∼ 100 Myr. This exuberant starbirth cannot be sustained; it will die away, perhaps leaving a compact inner disk of stars. The uppermost spectrum in Figure 5.24 is from a blue starburst galaxy. Its massive young stars are bright at short wavelengths; they ionize the gas around them to produce the strong emission lines. If the young stars are shrouded in dust, that will intercept most of their light, re-radiating the energy at infrared wavelengths. Starbursts are often triggered when gas falls into the center of a galaxy, as it is tugged by another galaxy passing nearby: we discuss this further in Section 7.1. They sometimes occur in cycles: supernovae from a starburst heat the surrounding gas and blow it out of the bulge, after which gas must accumulate before the next burst. This process might build up a dense central cluster of stars. At the center of the Milky Way, about 10 7 M \u0005 of stars are packed into a tight cluster only ∼ 3 pc in radius. Such nuclear star clusters are often seen in spiral and dwarf elliptical galaxies. They differ from the open and globular star clusters of the Milky Way, where all stars share a common birth, and any leftover gas was swiftly dispersed. Gas flowing into a galaxy center has nowhere else to go than into the nuclear cluster; it provides the raw material for multiple episodes of starbirth. In a single nucleus, we might see the spectral signatures of short-lived main-sequence B stars, along with much older red giants. The cluster grows as more stars form; while the radii of nuclear star clusters are no larger than for the Milky Way’s globulars, their mass, and thus the velocity dispersion, can be many times higher. Problem 5.14 The nuclear star cluster of M33 has core radius r c ∼ < 0 . 4 pc and measured velocity dispersion σ = 24 km s − 1 (Table 4.2). The luminosity L V ≈ 2 . 5 × 10 6 L \u0005 . Approximating it crudely as a Plummer model, use Equation 3.13 and the virial theorem (see Problem 3.13) to estimate its mass M . Show that the mass-to-light ratio M / L V ∼ 0 . 2 – much lower than for a globular cluster, because young massive stars are present. (Our M / L is less than in Table 4.2 because the newest stars are concentrated to the cluster center; r c reflects their distribution, rather than that of the older stars that carry most of the mass.) As in the Milky Way, nuclear clusters can hide objects so small and so massive that they are almost certainly black holes. As material spirals around and into a black hole, its energy can be liberated more efficiently than by any other known process. Turning a mass M of hydrogen into helium releases merely 0 . 007 M c 2 as energy; throwing it into a black hole can yield ∼ 0 . 1 M c 2 . Some large black holes, with M BH ∼ > 10 7 M \u0005 , are believed to be power sources for active galactic nuclei : we will discuss these later in Section 9.1. Others, like that in the center"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"240 Spiral and S0 galaxies of our Milky Way, are quiescent, and can be ‘seen’ only by their gravitational effects. In disk galaxies with an active nucleus, we see light from the very center of the galaxy, which does not come from its stars, or gas ionized by their radiation. The nucleus shines at all wavelengths from radio to γ -rays; in visible light it is extremely luminous, sometimes as bright as the entire galaxy around it. The optical and ultraviolet spectrum shows broad emission lines, with widths corresponding to velocities V r > 5000 km s − 1 . Some of these lines come from atoms that are much more highly ionized even than the gas around hot stars in a starburst. Our Milky Way has only a very-low-level active nucleus, with a weak central radio source. A striking example of an active nucleus is that in the barred spiral galaxy NGC 4258; see Figure 9.2. Within a few parsecs of its center is a rotating disk of dense gas. Radiation from the nucleus excites water molecules in the disk, so that they emit maser radiation in a line at 22.2 GHz. The bright masing spots can be located very precisely by very long baseline interferometry, and we can use the Doppler effect to measure the radial velocity V r . The gas lies in a disk 0 . 015 \u0006\u0006 across, which corresponds to only 0.5 pc, and orbits the center at over 1000 km s − 1 . Within the disk must lie a compact object with a mass M > 3 × 10 7 M \u0005 ; see the following problem. The density exceeds 10 9 M \u0005 pc − 3 or 100 000 times higher than at the center of a globular cluster: this is far too concentrated to be a cluster of normal stars. Problem 5.15 The inner edge of the masing gas disk in NGC 4258 is about 0 . 004 \u0006\u0006 from the center. By measuring the motion of the masing spots across the sky, Herrnstein et al. (1999 Nature 400 , 539) found its distance to be 7 . 2 ± 0 . 3 Mpc: what is the radius of the inner edge of the disk in parsecs? Gas there orbits at 1100 km s − 1 : use Equation 3.20 to show that the mass inside the disk is ∼ 4 × 10 7 M \u0005 . Supposing that the central object consists of solar-type stars, find the density n per cubic parsec, and the cross-sectional area σ ∼ π R 2 \u0005 of each star.

As their name implies, they appear round on the sky; the light is smoothly distributed, and they lack the bright clumps of young blue stars and patches of obscuring dust which are such obvious features of spiral galaxies. Ellipticals are almost devoid of cool gas, except at the very center; in contrast to S0 systems, they have no prominent disk. Their smooth appearance suggests that, like the molecules of air in a room, their stars have had time to reach a well-mixed equilibrium state. As with stars on the main sequence, we would expect the properties of elliptical galaxies to reflect the most probable state of a fairly simple system, with ‘no surprises’. Instead, detailed studies reveal a bewildering complexity. Elliptical galaxies cover a huge range of luminosity and of light concentration. Some ellipticals rotate fast, others hardly at all. Some appear to be oblate (grapefruit shaped), while others have a triaxial shape with three unequal axes, like a squashed (American or rugby) football. These properties are interlinked: luminous ellipticals are more likely to be triaxial, slowly rotating, and also strong X-ray sources, while the less luminous systems are oblate and relatively rapidly rotating, and have dense stellar cusps at their centers. It was a mistake to think that elliptical galaxies might be close to an equilibrium state, because stellar systems have a very long memory. Most of a galaxy’s stars have made fewer than 100 orbits about the center; we saw in Section 3.2 that the relaxation time required to randomize their motions is far greater than the age of the Universe. If a galaxy was assembled in a triaxial shape, or with a dense central cusp, these characteristics would not yet have been erased. The variety among elliptical galaxies suggests that they originated by a number of different pathways. Present-day elliptical galaxies are ‘fossils’ of the earlier Universe; our task is to reconstruct their birth and youthful star-forming lives from the old low- mass stars that remain. We begin this chapter with a section on photometry: how the images of ellip- tical galaxies appear in visible light, and what this tells us about the distribution of stars within them.

We consider what stel- lar orbits would be possible in a triaxial galaxy, with three unequal axes. In Section 6.3 we look at the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies and at their gaseous content. Elliptical galaxies are quite rich in interstellar gas, but that gas is much hotter than the gas in disk systems; it can be studied only in X-rays. Sec- tion 6.4 discusses the dark matter in elliptical galaxies and the black holes at their centers. 6.1 Photometry The brightest galaxies in the Universe are ellipticals, but so also are some of the dimmest: these systems share little more than their general shape, and their lack of cool gas and young stars. It is useful to divide elliptical galaxies into three classes. The luminous giant ellipticals have L ∼ > L , the characteristic luminosity of a large galaxy that we defined in Equation 1.24: L ≈ 2 × 10 10 L \u0005 , equivalent to blue magnitude M B ≈− 20. Midsized ellipticals are less luminous, but still have L ∼ > 3 × 10 9 L \u0005 ,or M B ∼ < − 18. Finally, dwarf elliptical galaxies are those with luminosities below 3 × 10 9 L \u0005 . We saw in Chapter 5 that many attributes of a disk galaxy are determined by its position in the classification scheme of Figure 1.11, with galaxies in each class covering a wide range in size and luminosity. By contrast, when we measure the luminosity of an elliptical galaxy, we have largely fixed the other properties. Elliptical galaxies come in ‘one size (sequence) only’. Figure 6.1 shows the isophotes , contours of constant surface brightness, of four elliptical galaxies. In Figure 6.1(a), the isophotes are remarkably close to being true ellipses. The ratio of the semi-major axis a and the semi-minor axis b quantifies how far the isophote differs from a circle: the ellipticity \u001a is defined as \u001a = 1 − b / a . Often the ellipticity is fairly constant, and the position of the center and the direction of the long axis remain stable, from the bright inner isophotes to the faint outer contours. This allows us to label elliptical galaxies by the Hubble type E n , where n = 10(1 − b / a ); E0 galaxies appear circular on the sky, while for an E5 galaxy the short diameter of the image is half the size of the long diameter. The index n is usually rounded to the nearest whole number, roughly the accuracy to which we can classify galaxies by eye from photographic plates. Unlike the classification of a disk galaxy, the Hubble type of an elliptical galaxy depends on our viewing direction. The light in elliptical galaxies is much more concentrated toward the center than it is in the disks of spirals. As for spirals, we can plot the surface brightness I ( R ) on the major axis of the image against radius R , as in Figure 6.3. There, we see that the surface brightness in NGC 1399 falls by more than 10 000, and the corresponding volume density more than a millionfold, between the center and the outskirts where the galaxy disappears into the sky."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"6.1 Photometry 243 Fig. 6.1.

For it, R e = 15 . 7 \u0006\u0006 ≈ 1 . 4 kpc, so measurements cover R ∼ < 850 \u0006\u0006 or 75 kpc.

Caon. this is a common way to quantify the seeing. The overplotted solid curve shows what we would expect to find if the galaxy followed exactly the R 1 / 4 law, but the seeing was such as to blur stellar images to their measured extent. The biggest and brightest systems are generally best fit with larger values of n , while the surface brightness of dwarf elliptical galaxies is often close to an exponential profile with n ≈ 1, as in Figure 6.2. The most luminous of all galaxies are the cD galaxies . These enormous ellipti- cals contain the largest stellar mass of any galaxies; they are significantly brighter than L . In Figure 6.3, the profile of the cD galaxy NGC 1399 (with L ≈ 2 L or 4 × 10 10 L \u0005 ) follows the R 1 / 4 formula fairly well, out to R ∼ 20 R e . Beyond that, the surface brightness is higher than the formula would predict. This outer envelope of ‘extra’ light is characteristic of cD galaxies, which are found only at the centers of galaxy groups and clusters: NGC 1399 is in the Fornax cluster. Although it is not classified as a cD galaxy, the outer envelope of the giant elliptical galaxy M87, at the center of the Virgo cluster, is also very extended. The starlight can be traced for nearly 100 kpc on a deep photograph (Figure 6.4). These stars may belong to the cluster rather than to individual galaxies, or they might be the shredded remains of smaller galaxies that came too close to the central monster system.

A few of the galaxies with shells have clearly suffered a recent merger; they show faint tidal tails such as those seen in Figure 7.5. After a few gigayears, the shells and tails will be gone, leaving galaxies that appear in optical images as fairly normal ellipticals. Unlike for disk galaxies, in an elliptical the central brightness is tightly linked to luminosity. Figure 6.6 shows the central brightness I V (0) and the core radius r c , where the surface brightness drops to half its measured central value, for ellipticals, the central bulges of spirals, and star clusters. Just as with stars in a color–magnitude diagram, we see that the points are confined to certain regions of this plane. Among the luminous and midsized ellipticals, namely those brighter than L ∼ 3 × 10 9 L \u0005 , we find that the more luminous the galaxy, the lower its cen- tral surface brightness and the larger its core. The surface brightness in some of the most luminous galaxies, such as the cD systems, is almost as low as that in the disks of spirals. We will see in Section 7.1 that collisions between galaxies increase the internal motion of the stars within them, causing them to expand and become less tightly bound. If the most luminous ellipticals were produced by the merger of two smaller systems, that could explain why their centers are more diffuse.

The dimmest of the ellipticals, with L ∼ < 3 × 10 9 L \u0005 ,or M B ∼ > − 18, fall into two types: rare compact ellipticals like M32 (see Section 4.4) are distinct from the dwarf elliptical (dE) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies described in Sec- tions 4.1 and 4.4. Compact ellipticals have appreciable rotation, whereas the dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals do not rotate significantly. Dwarf spheroidals are less luminous versions of the dEs, with L ∼ < 3 × 10 7 L \u0005 or M V ∼ > − 14. Most are so diffuse as to be barely visible in images of the sky. Figure 6.6 shows that the dE and dSph galaxies have larger cores than the midsized ellipticals. The trend in surface brightness reverses itself: the central brightness is lowest in the least-luminous dE and dSph galaxies. We understand why stars populate only certain regions of a color–magnitude diagram; both luminosity and temperature are controlled largely by the star’s mass, and the zones where it burns nuclear fuel. Explaining the distribution in Figure 6.6 is harder, since it almost certainly reflects the conditions under which the galaxies formed, rather than their internal workings at the present day. The pattern tells us that galaxy formation had some regularity; the way that a galaxy came into being must be related to its mass. But this clue requires interpretation, which so far is lacking. We gain a sharper view of galaxy centers from above the Earth’s atmosphere; the Hubble Space Telescope can resolve details as fine as 0 . 05 \u0006\u0006 across.

Midsized galaxies, with L ∼ < L , typically have central cusps , not cores. If we assume that the luminosity density is proportional to the number density n ( r ) of stars, then n ( r ) must rise more steeply toward the center than r − 1 ; see the following problem. Even in galaxies with cores, a central plateau in surface brightness may conceal a peak in stellar density, so long as this is shallower than n ( r ) ∝ r − 1 . These results from space observations show that we must be careful when interpreting diagrams such as Figure 6.6. The measured central surface brightness observed through the Earth’s turbulent atmosphere is only a lower bound to the true value. The measured ‘core radius’ may in fact mark a point where the intensity profile changes its slope, rather than the outer limit of a region where the stellar density is constant.

If the galaxy is symmetric about some axis, then an observer looking along that direction will always see a circular image. But, since we view galaxies with random orientation, we can use the distribution of apparent shapes to infer the average true three-dimensional figure.

The contours of constant density ρ ( x ) are ellipsoids m 2 = constant. An observer looking directly along the z axis will see a round E0 galaxy; when viewed at an angle, the system appears elliptical. To calculate the apparent axis ratio q = b / a , we place the observer in the x − z plane, as in Figure 6.8, looking at an angle 0 ◦ < i < 90 ◦ to the axis z . The line of sight grazes the constant-density surface m 2 = x 2 / A 2 + z 2 / B 2 at the point T where it is tangent to this ellipse; so we have tan i = d x / d z =− ( z / x )( A 2 / B 2 ) . (6.6) So the elliptical image has semi-major axis a = mA , while its semi-minor axis b = OR = OQ sin i . Using Equations 6.5 and 6.6, we have OQ = OP + PQ = z + ( − x )cot i = B 2 m 2 / z ; (6.7) the ratio q of apparent minor to major axis is q obl ≡ b a = OQ sin i mA = B 2 m zA sin i = \u0003 B 2 A 2 + cot 2 i \u0004 1 / 2 sin i , (6.8) where we have used the definition 6.5 in the last step.

A prolate galaxy can be described by the same function ρ ( x ) of Equation 6.5, with A < B .

(6.10) Thus q prol ≥ A / B ; again, the apparent flattening cannot be more than the true axis ratio. Looking from a random direction, the fraction of galaxies that we see at an angle between i and i + \b i to the polar axis is just sin i · \b i , the fraction of a sphere around each galaxy corresponding to these viewing directions. If they are all oblate with axis ratio B / A , then from Equation 6.9 the fraction f obl \b q with apparent axis ratios between q and q + \b q is f obl ( q ) \b q = sin i · \b q | d q / d i | = q \b q \u0017 1 − ( B / A ) 2 \u0017 q 2 − ( B / A ) 2 . (6.11) For very flattened systems with B \u0011 A , this is almost a uniform distribution; all values q > B / A are about equally probable. For the disks of spiral and S0 galaxies, apparent shapes rounder than q ≈ 0 . 2 are found with roughly equal frequency; so we conclude that most of their disks have B / A ∼ < 0 . 2. Very few disk galaxies show outer isophotes as elliptical as q ∼ < 0 . 1; so few disks can be as flattened as B / A ≈ 0 . 1. This is consistent with what we learned in Section 5.1: the ratio of the vertical and horizontal scale lengths h z / h R ≈ 0 . 1 − 0 . 2. There are no elliptical galaxies in the sky more flattened than E7, or q = 0 . 3. Astronomers suspect that such a galaxy would be dynamically unstable. A system with high angular momentum would probably separate into a thin fast-rotating disk and a central bulge, rather than becoming a very flattened oblate elliptical. We know that a needle-like prolate galaxy, or a non-rotating oblate ‘pancake’, would buckle and thicken to a rounder shape. Figure 6.9 shows that the apparent shapes of small elliptical galaxies are generally more elongated than those of large luminous systems.

The rightmost set of ellipses shows how, if the axis ratios of a triaxial galaxy vary with radius, the isophotes may twist even when the principal axes do not – after J. Kormendy. 6.1.2 Twisty, disky, or boxy? The isophotes of elliptical galaxies are close to being true ellipses; but the small deviations yield information about how the galaxy departs from a simple axisym- metric form. In Figure 6.1(b), we see the long axis of the isophotes swing from roughly horizontal in the inner galaxy to almost vertical at the outermost isophote. An observed isophote twist is generally taken as an indication that the galaxy may be triaxial. The isophotes of an oblate galaxy always form a sequence of nested ellipses; the long axis points along the line where the galaxy’s equatorial plane intersects the plane of the sky, normal to the observer’s direction. Figure 6.10 shows how this twisting can result if the galaxy is triaxial, with the ratio A : B : C of the axes changing with the radius m , and we view it from a direction other than along one of the principal axes. The isophotes of some elliptical galaxies differ from exact ellipses in appearing disky . They show extra light along the major axis, as though the galaxy contained an equatorial disk embedded within it; see Figure 6.1(c). Measurements of the stellar motions show that this is exactly the case; disks containing up to 30% of the total light are embedded within the elliptical body. By contrast, a galaxy with boxy isophotes has more light in the ‘corners’ of the ellipse; see Figure 6.1(d). To quantify these distortions, we write the equation of the ellipse that best matches a given isophote as x = a cos t , y = b sin t , (6.14) where x and y are distances along the major and minor axes, and the parameter t describes the angle around the ellipse.

Terms a 3 and b 3 would describe slightly egg-shaped isophotes, and they are generally very small. The term b 4 is also usually small, but a 4 is not. If a 4 > 0, the isophote is ‘disky’: it is pushed out beyond the best-fitting ellipse on the major and minor axes, at t = 0 , ± π/ 2 ,π where \b r > 0. When a 4 < 0, the isophote bulges out at 45 ◦ to the axes, giving a ‘boxy’ or peanut-shaped appearance. Boxy galaxies are more likely to show isophote twists. They are often luminous ellipticals, which are also the most likely to be triaxial. Figure 6.11 shows that boxy ellipticals more often have strong radio and X-ray emission; we will see below that they also are the slowest rotating. By contrast, midsized elliptical galaxies are more likely to be disky, oblate, and faster rotating, with less of the X-ray- luminous hot gas. They resemble S0 galaxies where the bulge is so large as to swallow the disk. The larger boxy systems may have formed by merger of smaller galaxies, which would destroy any disks that were present, and can easily leave a triaxial shape. Some astronomers have suggested that we should describe elliptical galaxies by their degree of boxiness, in preference to Hubble’s E n classification: disky ellipticals would form an intermediate class between luminous boxy systems and the S0 galaxies. 6.2 Motions of the stars In contrast to disk galaxies, the stars of elliptical galaxies do not follow an orderly pattern of rotation. Instead, most of their kinetic energy is invested in random"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"6.2 Motions of the stars 255 motion. Just as a spiral galaxy’s luminosity is linked to its rotation speed, the more luminous ellipticals have a higher velocity dispersion; we can use this relation to determine distances to galaxies. Many astronomers were surprised to find that elliptical galaxies rotate as slowly as they do; it shows that the stars have not relaxed into anything close to a most probable final state. Elliptical galaxies still retain considerable information about their origins. 6.2.1 Measuring stellar velocities Measuring the orbital velocities of stars within galaxies is relatively difficult. We can quite easily find the speed of a cool or warm gas cloud using the Doppler shift at the bright peak of an emission line, such as H α from warm ionized gas, or the radio-frequency 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen. But for stars, we must use absorption features in the spectra; many of these are not narrow atomic lines, but have an appreciable intrinsic spread in wavelength. We will see below that we must be concerned not just with the position of the line center, but with its width and often its shape as well; measuring these demands a high signal-to-noise ratio and long observations. The absorption-line spectra of galaxies are usually measured with a long-slit spectrograph. The slit is placed across the galaxy; reflection from a grating then spreads the light in wavelength along the perpendicular direction before it falls onto a detector, most commonly a CCD; see Section 5.1. Sometimes fiber-optic bundles are used instead; the fibers collect light from various positions across the face of the galaxy and deliver it onto the grating. Light entering at the ends of the slit, or through fibers placed far from the galaxy, allows the observer to record the emission of the night sky (often with that of distant street lights). Except near its center, the sky is brighter than the galaxy; so we must subtract its spectrum from what we measure, to recover that of the galaxy. The light of all the stars in a galaxy is the sum of their individual spectra, each Doppler-shifted in wavelength according to their motion. Their orbital motion causes lines in the summed spectrum to be wider and shallower than those of an individual star. We will see in Section 6.3 that most of the light of elliptical galaxies comes from G and K giant stars. Typically we observe some nearby stars of these types as templates for comparison. We take these spectra with the same telescope and spectrograph setup as for the galaxy, so that we can correct for instrumental effects. For example, a spectrograph broadens the lines by an amount \bλ corresponding to the spectral resolution ; generally λ/\bλ ∼ > 5000 for these observations, giving a resolution of 60 km s − 1 . Elliptical galaxies contain little cool dusty gas, so their light is quite close to the sum of what is emitted by all their stars. Let us write the energy received from a typical star, when it is at rest with respect to an observer, as F λ, ( λ ) \bλ between wavelengths λ and λ + \bλ . We choose Cartesian coordinates x , y , z with z pointing from our position toward the galaxy. Then, if the star moves away from us with velocity v z \u0011 c , the light that we receive at wavelength λ was emitted"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"256 Elliptical galaxies at wavelength λ [1 − v z / c ]. To find the spectrum at position x , y on the galaxy image, we must integrate over all the stars along our line of sight. Approximating the number density of stars at position x with z velocities between v z and v z + \bv z as f ( x ,v z ) \bv z , the observed spectrum is F λ, g ( x , y ,λ ) = \u0002 ∞ −∞ F λ, ( λ [1 − v z / c ]) \u0005 \u0002 ∞ −∞ f ( x ,v z )d z \u0006 d v z . (6.16) If we knew the distribution function f ( x , v ) for each type of star, and their spectra F λ, ( λ ) were exactly the same as those of our template stars, we could use Equation 6.16 to construct the galaxy’s spectrum. In practice, we usually guess at a form for the integral of f ( x ,v z ) along the line of sight, the term in curly braces, depending on a few parameters. We then choose those parameters to reproduce the galaxy’s observed spectrum as well as possible. A common choice is the Gaussian form \u0002 ∞ −∞ f ( x ,v z )d z ∝ exp \t − ( v z − V r ) 2 / \u0015 2 σ 2 r \u0016 ; (6.17) here σ r ( x , y ), usually written simply as σ , is the velocity dispersion of the stars, while V r ( x , y ) is the mean radial velocity at that position. Rotation is evident as a gradient in V r ( x , y ) across the face of the system. When the spectrum is measured to high precision, the Gaussian might not provide an adequate approximation. For example, in some disky ellipticals a long ‘tail’ of rapidly moving stars shows that a fast-rotating disk is buried within the slower-rotating body of the galaxy. Figure 6.12 shows the mean radial velocity and velocity dispersion measured along the major axis of the cD galaxy NGC 1399 out to a distance of about 5 R e , where the surface brightness has fallen more than 100-fold below its central level. In a spiral galaxy like our own, the ordered rotation of disk stars is almost ten times faster than their random speeds; but in this elliptical, we see a peak rotation speed V max \u0011 σ r . We would not expect elliptical galaxies to rotate as rapidly as spirals, since they are not disks; but we will see in the next subsection that most of them do not even rotate as fast as they ‘ought to’ for their rounder shapes.

Use Equation 3.46 to combine the measured dispersion σ r from Figure 6.12 with the result of Problem 6.3, to show that the mass-to-light ratio in the central parts is M / L V ∼ 7. This is only slightly larger than that in the Milky Way’s globular clusters (Section 3.1), suggesting that the core of this galaxy contains little dark matter.

Just as for spirals, the stars move faster in more luminous galaxies. At the centers of bright ellipticals, the dispersion can reach 500 km s − 1 , while σ ∼ 50 km s − 1 in the least luminous objects. The left panel of Figure 6.13 shows that roughly L ∝ σ 4 ; this is often called the Faber–Jackson relation. In the V band, roughly L V 2 × 10 10 L \u0005 ≈ \u0003 σ 200 km s − 1 \u0004 4 . (6.18) Like the Tully–Fisher relation for spirals, the Faber–Jackson relation can be used to estimate a galaxy’s distance from its measured velocity dispersion. But it is hard to determine the total amount of light we receive from a galaxy, because much of it comes from the faint outer parts; distances derived from the Faber–Jackson relation are not very precise.

Popular choices for D take an average surface brightness of 20 − 21 mag arcsec − 2 in the B band. Another possibility is to use the fundamental plane relation. The right panel of Figure 6.13 shows that the elliptical galaxies of the Coma cluster all lie close to a plane in the three-dimensional ‘space’ of central velocity dispersion σ , effective radius R e , and surface brightness I e = I ( R e ). Approximately, we have R e ∝ σ 1 . 2 I − 0 . 8 e . (6.19) Like Figure 6.6, the fundamental plane relation reflects some basic processes, still to be understood, by which elliptical galaxies form. We see the galaxies at z ∼ 1 as they were when the cosmos was half its present age. They are brighter than those nearby, and do not follow the same fundamental plane; their mass-to-light ratios are roughly five times lower.

To understand why astronomers expected elliptical galaxies to rotate faster than they do, we use a form of the virial theorem. We start from the equation for the gravitational force on star α at position x α due to the other stars in the galaxy, at positions x β , with masses m β : d d t ( m α v α ) =− \u0013 β α \u0014= β Gm α m β | x α − x β | 3 ( x α − x β ) . (3.2) Then, we follow the process that led us to Equation 3.38 of Section 3.1. But instead of taking a scalar product, we multiply the z component of Equation 3.2 by the z coordinate z α and sum over all the stars, to get \u0013 α d d t ( m α v z α ) z α =− \u0013 α,β α \u0014= β Gm α m β | x α − x β | 3 ( z α − z β ) z α , (6.20) where v z α is the z component of v α , the velocity of star α . But we could also have started with the force on star β ,tofind \u0013 β d d t ( m β v z β ) z β =− \u0013 α,β α \u0014= β Gm α m β | x α − x β | 3 ( z β − z α ) z β . (6.21) Averaging these two yields an equation similar to Equation 3.42: 1 2 d 2 I zz d t 2 = 2 KE zz + PE zz , (6.22) where the z component of the moment of inertia is defined as I zz ≡ \u0013 α m α z α z α , (6.23) the kinetic energy associated with motion in the z direction is KE zz ≡ 1 2 \u0013 α m α v z α v z α , (6.24) and the zz contribution to the potential energy is PE zz ≡− \u0013 α,β α \u0014= β 1 2 Gm α m β | x α − x β | 3 ( z α − z β ) 2 .

(6.26) where the angle brackets denote a long-term average. Similar equations hold for the x and y components of the motion; they make up part of the tensor virial theorem . This theorem tells us that not only must the average kinetic and potential energies be in balance, but also contributions in the different directions must separately be equal. If a galaxy is highly flattened, like the Milky Way, PE zz will be much smaller in magnitude than PE xx . Equation 6.26 then tells us that the energy in random speeds in the z direction must be less than that from the random motion and rotation which make up the x component of the kinetic energy. Suppose that an elliptical galaxy is axisymmetric, with the density of stars described by Equation 6.5, and it rotates about the symmetry axis z . Then we can split the kinetic energy in the x direction into the sum of rotation and random motions. If we make the simplifying assumption that the rotation speed V and the velocity dispersions σ x and σ z in these two directions are almost constant throughout the galaxy, then PE zz \u000b PE xx \u000b = KE zz \u000b KE xx \u000b ≈ σ 2 z 1 2 V 2 + σ 2 x , (6.27) since the kinetic energy of rotation is split between the x and y directions. The ratio of the two potential-energy terms turns out to depend only on the axis ratio B / A , or equivalently the ellipticity \u001a ≡ 1 − B / A . It is not affected by how the mass is distributed inside the galaxy; roughly, PE zz \u000b PE xx \u000b ≈ ( B / A ) 0 . 9 = (1 − \u001a ) 0 . 9 . (6.28) The true rotation speed V is higher than the measured average speed V max , since the stars spend part of their time in motion across the sky, which does not contribute to V max ; to allow for this, we write V max ≈ π V / 4. If random motions are isotropic , the same in all directions, we have σ x = σ z = σ , and Equation 6.27 becomes \u0003 V max σ \u0004 = \u0003 V σ \u0004 iso ≡ π 4 \u0017 2[(1 − \u001a ) − 0 . 9 − 1] ≈ \u0017 \u001a/ (1 − \u001a ); (6.29) the approximation is valid when \u001a is small.

Points with downward-extending bars indicate upper limits on V max . The dashed line gives ( V /σ ) iso , the fastest rotation expected for a given flattening – R. Bender. We cannot measure the true flattening B / A for a galaxy, but only the apparent axis ratio b / a . If we view it at an angle i to the direction of the axis z , the measured rotation speed V max is reduced by a factor sin i from the value it would have if we looked at it from a position in the x − y plane. But, if the galaxy is not too flattened, the following problem shows that 2 \u001a ≈ sin 2 i [1 − ( B / A ) 2 ], so the right and left sides of Equation 6.29 both decrease approximately as sin i . Thus, if we compute ( V /σ ) iso using the apparent ellipticity \u001a app = 1 − b / a , oblate galaxies with isotropic velocity dispersions should still fall close to the line V max /σ = ( V /σ ) iso in a plot like Figure 6.14. But the giant E1 galaxy NGC 1399 is nowhere close to this relation: for \u001a app ≈ 0 . 1 we expect ( V /σ ) iso = 0 . 33, while Figure 6.12 shows that V max /σ ∼ < 0 . 15.

These are com- posite systems, with a fast-rotating stellar disk embedded within a slow-rotating outer body. Recall from Section 4.4 that dwarf ellipticals commonly rotate with V max /σ ∼ < 1, despite a considerably flattened appearance; they are also flattened by velocity anisotropy. The slow rotation of ellipticals disproved an explanation that had been devel- oped to explain the very smooth appearance of these galaxies. A star like the Sun is a round smooth ball of gas because frequent random encounters or ‘col- lisions’ between atoms change their direction of motion. Statistical mechanics tells us that, as a result, the velocities of the atoms will tend to be near their most probable overall state. In this state, the star is slightly flattened along the axis of its rotation, and is symmetric about that axis. The random velocities v of parti- cles with mass m at any position x in the star are very close to the Maxwellian distribution: f M ( x , v ) ∝ exp \t − m v 2 / ( k B T ) , (3.58) where k B is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the gas temperature. Random motions are the same in all directions, since they are set by the single temperature T . We saw in Section 3.2 that it would take about 10 13 years for encounters between pairs of stars in a galaxy to change their motions significantly. The smooth roundness of elliptical galaxies must have a different explanation from the smooth roundness of the Sun. So the theory of violent relaxation was developed.

But while lumps of matter were falling together to form the galaxy, the potential \u0010 ( x , t ) at any point x would swing up and down by large amounts, changing the star’s energy. This process was expected to mix stars among the various orbits, giving them equal random motions in all directions. The observed slow rotation of elliptical galaxies tells us that violent relaxation was not complete. The stars in these galaxies, unlike the atoms of gas that make up stars, retain information about the way in which they were assembled. In particular, they might not have relaxed enough for the galaxy to develop an axis of symmetry. A further indication of only partial mixing is given by the rotation curve of Figure 6.12. The innermost part of the galaxy NGC 1399 seems to rotate in the opposite direction to the outer regions. These kinematically decoupled cores have been found increasingly often, as the precision of measurement improves. Some elliptical galaxies also show a gradient in the mean velocity V r when measurements are made along the apparent minor axis. This state could not last long in an axisymmetric galaxy, but we will see below that it can persist if the potential is triaxial. Minor-axis rotation is generally reckoned as one further piece of evidence that at least some elliptical galaxies have triaxial shapes. 6.2.4 Stellar orbits in a triaxial galaxy To understand the implications of a triaxial elliptical galaxy, we must study the orbits that stars would follow in such a system. One of the simplest triaxial poten- tials is the triaxial harmonic oscillator \u0010 HO ( x ) = 1 2 \u0015 ω 2 x x 2 + ω 2 y y 2 + ω 2 z z 2 \u0016 (6.31) with ω x <ω y <ω z . This describes the gravitational force inside a homo- geneous galaxy described by Equation 6.12 with A , B , and C held fixed, and constant density ρ ( m 2 ) for m ≤ 1; there is no mass outside that ellipsoidal sur- face. A star in this potential would follow independent harmonic motion in the x , y , and z directions, with frequencies ω x ,ω y , and ω z , respectively; these are complicated functions of the axis ratios A : B : C . Unless the frequencies are rational multiples of each other, this orbit completely fills a rectangular block, with sides parallel to the axes: we call it a box orbit. We saw in Section 3.3 that a star moving in an axisymmetric potential must stay away from the center unless its angular momentum is exactly zero; by contrast, a star on a box orbit can travel right to the origin. A box orbit has no fixed sense of angular momen- tum. The sign of L z reverses as the orbit reaches the ‘edge’ of the block in the x and y directions, and similarly for L x and L y ; so each of these is zero on average."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"264 Elliptical galaxies Problem 6.9 For a particle moving in the potential \u0010 HO , use the x component of Equation 3.3, the force equation, to show that E x ≡ 1 2 \u0015 ̇ x 2 + ω 2 x x 2 \u0016 (6.32) is constant, as are E y and E z when defined similarly: this potential has three inte- grals of motion . Write E x in terms of the maximum extent x max of the orbit along the x axis, and explain why the average x speed is independent of the particle’s motion in the y and z directions. (Unlike the distribution function f ( E , L z ) that we discussed in Section 3.4, making a model galaxy with f = f ( E x , E y , E z ) lets us choose the velocity dispersion in the z direction independently of motion in the x − y plane: the triaxial potential makes it easier to set up a galaxy with σ z \u0011 σ x .) Problem 6.10 Show that the potential of Equation 6.31 corresponds to a uniform density ρ ( x ) such that 4 π G ρ = ω 2 x + ω 2 y + ω 2 z . Taking the values ω x = 1 ,ω y = π/ 2, compute the path of a star that at t = 0 has x = 2 , y = 1 , z = 0 with ̇ x = 0 = ̇ y = ̇ z ; plot its position at intervals of 0.1 for − 10 ≤ t ≤ 10. Show that L z = x ̇ y − y ̇ x reverses sign at t = 0. Orbits in an axisymmetric potential have the rosette shapes of Figure 3.10: these are loop orbits. A star on a loop orbit is prevented by its angular momentum from passing through the center, but always circles it in the same sense, keeping a minimum distance. Triaxial potentials in general allow both loop orbits and box orbits, along with some more complicated orbits which are generally less important. Loops can circle any one of the three symmetry axes: a loop around the z axis has a fixed sense of L z , while L x and L y oscillate. In general, most loop orbits around the longest and the shortest axes of a triaxial potential are stable. A star that is initially close in position and velocity to one of these loops will always remain near it. But a star placed near a loop orbit around the intermediate axis will move away from that orbit at an exponentially increasing rate; these orbits are unstable. In triaxial galaxies, we expect to find some stars following orbits that circle the shortest axis, as in an oblate galaxy; so we will measure a gradient in the mean velocity V r along the galaxy’s major axis. Other stars will loop around the longest axis; if these all circle in the same sense, we would then find a gradient along the minor axis, with V r increasing on one side and decreasing on the other.

The box orbit has roughly a rectangular form, elongated in the same direction as the potential; stars on loop orbits, that avoid the center, are stretched out in the perpendicular direction. To maintain its shape, we might expect a triaxial galaxy to contain many stars on box orbits and only a few on loops; since box orbits have no fixed sense of rotation, we would measure high random motions and only slow average rotation. The third orbit is a chaotic orbit, neither loop nor box. Like a loop it avoids the galaxy center, but it occasionally reverses the sense in which it circles the center. To produce this orbit, we have added to \u0010 L a Plummer potential corresponding to a small mass M = 0 . 2 with core a P = 0 . 1. This changes the asphericity of the potential close to the center, and disrupts box orbits which venture there.

If a potential \u0010 ( x ) has too many chaotic orbits, it may be impossible to make a self-consistent model , in which the density of stars on their orbits gives rise to the potential \u0010 . In particular, the inner regions of a galaxy might not be able to remain triaxial if a big black hole grows at the center. Problem 6.11 Show that, if the density of stars ρ ( r ) = ρ 0 ( r 0 / r ) α , then the mass within radius r follows M ( < r ) ∝ r 3 − α , and the radial force F r ( r ) =− G M ( < r ) r 2 ∝ r 1 − α . We see that F r ( r ) → 0 at small radii if the density increases more slowly than r − 1 . Recall that this is the same condition as we found in Problem 6.4 for the surface density \u0017 ( R ) to remain finite at the center. (If the forces tend to zero at the center of a triaxial potential, box orbits will exist much as in the triaxial harmonic oscillator. Otherwise, many of the boxes are replaced by chaotic orbits. Galaxies with central luminous cusps are probably not triaxial near their centers.) A compact way of showing a number of orbits is a surface of section plot, as in the lower right of Figure 6.16. Each time the orbit crosses the x axis in the direction ̇ y > 0, we plot the value of x and the x velocity ̇ x . The points made by the loop orbit fall along the small closed curve on the left; the orbit always transits the x axis anticlockwise. The points from the box orbit lie on the largest curve, circling around the origin. This orbit has no fixed sense of circulation, but crosses the x axis with ̇ y > 0 both on x > 0 and on x < 0; ̇ x is large whenever x is small, as the par- ticle passes close to the center. The chaotic orbit shows both senses of circulation about the center; but, like the loop, it avoids the origin. The points from this orbit do not fall on a curve at all ; their more disorderly distribution betrays the differ- ence between a chaotic orbit, and the non-chaotic or regular boxes and loops.

So, even in the closest ellipticals, we are limited to the AGB stars and those near the tip of the red giant branch. The integrated spectra of ellipticals, such as that in Figure 6.17, show deep absorption lines of heavy elements such as calcium and magnesium, similar to the K-star spectrum in Figure 1.1. There is little light below 3500 ̊ A, showing that they have made very few new stars in the last 1 − 2 Gyr. Table 1.1 shows that only stars with masses below 2 M \u0005 will survive as long as 1 Gyr, and these produce most of their light as red stars after they have left the main sequence. So the galaxy’s light comes mainly from red giants. Unlike the old stars in the Milky Way’s globular clus- ters, but like those of the Galactic bulge, stars at the centers of elliptical galaxies appear fairly metal-rich, with about the same composition as the Sun. The spec- trum shows a break at 4000 ̊ A, since lines of metals absorb much of the light at shorter wavelengths. Figure 6.18 shows the spectrum of a model galaxy that has made all its stars in a sudden burst lasting 100 Myr. Shortly afterward, the galaxy is bright and very blue; helium absorption lines characteristic of hot O and B stars are prominent. We would also see emission lines from gas ionized by these stars. About 100 Myr after star formation has ceased, it is both dimmer and redder. At 1 Gyr, we see a post- starburst spectrum, with the deep Balmer lines characteristic of A stars. Elliptical galaxies with such a spectrum are called ‘E + A’ systems. They experienced rapid starbirth ∼ 1 Gyr ago followed by a sharp decline to almost nothing. After the first ∼ 2 Gyr cool giants predominate, and the model spectrum starts to resemble that of the elliptical in Figure 6.17.

If these distant galaxies made all their stars in a single burst and then simply faded to resemble the galaxies of the Coma cluster, explain why they must have formed < 1Gyr before we observe them. (It is not likely that this random set of ellipticals all formed very close to 9 Gyr ago. More probably, some starbirth continued until close to z = 1.) We saw in the previous section that the central brightness, velocity dispersion, and rotation speed of an elliptical galaxy depend on its luminosity. Figure 6.19 shows that the same is true of the overall color of its light: both at visible wave- lengths and in the near-infrared K band at 2.2 μ m, brighter galaxies are redder and fainter systems bluer. This trend could be explained if small elliptical galaxies were either younger or more metal-poor than large bright ones. Some astronomers argue that almost all the stars of luminous ellipticals date from at least 10 Gyr ago, while those of their smaller counterparts are a few gigayears younger."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"6.3 Stellar populations and gas 269 2.8 3 3.2 3.4 13 12 11 10 9 8 red blue K3 K4 K5 1.2 1.4 1.6 13 12 11 10 9 8 red blue G5 G8 Fig. 6.19.

Luminous galaxies do on average contain more older stars. The right panel of Figure 6.20 shows the stellar birthrates in nearby galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These were estimated from the intensity of the H α line ionized by young stars, and the strength of the 4000 ̊ A break. The largest galaxies appear to complete their starbirth early: in galaxies more than about twice as luminous as the Milky Way, starbirth is at ∼ 1% of its cosmic average. We saw this already in Figure 1.16: the most luminous galaxies today are red systems full of old and middle-aged stars. Among midsized galaxies, those of roughly the Milky Way’s luminosity or L ∼ L of Equation 1.24, in a minority starbirth has slowed as strongly as in the massive galaxies. But most midsized galaxies are making stars at near or above the average rate needed to build their present stellar content over the lifetime of the Universe. Dwarf galaxies less luminous than M r ∼− 18 are forming stars even faster than at their average rate. The dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies, where starbirth has now ceased, are so dim that few are included in this survey. Other astronomers claim that the relation between color and luminosity that we see in Figure 6.19 can be explained mainly by differences in chemical composition: big ellipticals are richer in heavy elements than the midsized ones. The left panel of Figure 6.20 shows the metal abundance in a large sample of nearby galaxies, calculated from the emission lines of gas at their centers. The most luminous galaxies are clearly richer in metals. Smaller galaxies may lack them because they lost most of the metal-enriched gas shed by their old stars. Larger systems were better able to trap theirs, incorporating the heavy elements into new stars. Figure 1.5 showed us that metal-poor stars of a given mass are bluer, especially while they are burning helium in their cores.

Right, time taken to build up a galaxy’s present stellar content, at its current rate of starbirth. In the most luminous systems, star formation is now far below its cosmic average. Many small galaxies are making stars considerably faster than that average – C. Tremonti and J. Brinchmann. When we look at absorption lines such as the Mgb feature at 5175 ̊ A, we find that stars at the centers of elliptical galaxies are more metal-rich than those in the periphery. This is the same pattern as we saw in Figure 4.15 for disk galaxies. The central stars of luminous ellipticals are at least as metal-rich as the Sun; but they do not contain heavy elements in the same proportions. Relatively light atoms such as oxygen, sodium, and magnesium are a few times more abundant relative to iron. We find the same pattern in old metal-poor stars near the Sun (Figure 4.17), and in the interstellar gas of the young galaxy cB58 in Figure 9.16, seen less than 3 Gyr after the Big Bang. The effect is weaker in midsized ellipticals. As we discussed in Section 4.3, iron in the interstellar gas has been released mainly by supernovae of Type Ia, which occur in binary stars. Many of the stars that explode in this way do so at ages of 1 Gyr or more. Stars near the Sun that have high ratios of oxygen to iron probably formed before many Type Ia supernovae had exploded, or before the gas they ejected could be confined within the Galaxy. But the lighter elements like oxygen are ejected mainly in Type II supernova explosions, of massive stars which run through their lives in 100 Myr or less. These should be added quickly to the gas, and incorporated into new stars. A similar argument may apply to elliptical galaxies. Perhaps the most lumi- nous ellipticals formed most of their stars so early that Type Ia supernovae had"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"6.3 Stellar populations and gas 271 not yet begun to add iron to the galactic gas. Or these galaxies may have lacked Type Ia supernovae, because they made relatively more of the massive stars, or fewer binaries. Another possibility is that, early on, the products of Type Ia supernova explosions were able to leave the galaxy, perhaps mixing with the hot X-ray-emitting gas of a surrounding cluster of galaxies. The gas ejected in Type II supernova explosions moves slower, and so is easier to confine within the galaxy. Surprisingly, despite their lack of young hot stars, elliptical galaxies (and the bulges of disk systems) are not dark at ultraviolet wavelengths. Metal-rich ellipticals tend to be brightest, suggesting that the sources are not old metal-poor stars on the horizontal branch, like the ones we see in globular clusters. Instead, the emission presumably comes from old metal-rich stars that have left the main sequence and then lost most of their hydrogen envelope, exposing the hot stellar core. No such stars are found near the Sun, since the Milky Way’s disk is too young. So we have not been able to study them in detail, and models remain uncertain. X-ray sources in elliptical galaxies include active galactic nuclei; stellar bina- ries where material is accreted onto a black hole or neutron star, or burns on the surface of a white dwarf; and hot gas at temperatures T ∼ > 10 6 K, either filling the galaxy or localized in stellar atmospheres, stellar winds, or supernova remnants. Most elliptical galaxies lack an active nucleus, and X-rays come mainly from the hot interstellar medium. Their supernova remnants are not strong X-ray sources. When supernova remnants expand into the cool and warm gas of a galaxy disk where T ∼ < 10 4 K, they are highly supersonic and create strong shocks that heat gas to X-ray-emitting temperatures. But in an elliptical galaxy the remnants expand into the hot gas with barely supersonic speeds, developing only weak shocks. When the galaxy is gas-poor, stellar binaries are the most important sources of X-rays. We should not be surprised that ellipticals today largely lack new stars, since most now contain very little cool gas from which to make any. At first glance, ellip- ticals seem generally free of dust and gas. According to Hubble, ‘ small patches of obscuring material are occasionally silhouetted against the luminous background, but otherwise these nebulae present no structural details ’. Closer examination shows that almost all of them have some dust in the nuclear regions, which is presumably mixed with cold gas. But only 5% − 10% of normal ellipticals contain enough atomic hydrogen or molecular gas to be detectable – which means that most big elliptical galaxies have less than (10 8 − 10 9 ) M \u0005 of cool gas, while a large Sc galaxy contains almost 10 10 M \u0005 . A minority of elliptical galaxies, especially those with ‘peculiarities’ such as outer shells or obvious dust lanes, go against this trend: a few have as much cool gas as a large spiral. Where H I gas is plentiful, it often forms a ring well outside the stellar body of the galaxy, and it frequently orbits about an axis that is nowhere close to the short axis of the galaxy’s image or the rotation axis of its stars.

Matsushita et al. 2002 AAp 386 , 77. elliptical NGC 5128 (Centaurus A), which is also a powerful radio galaxy, has a spectacular ring of gas and dust circling its apparent major axis. This pattern contrasts with spirals, but is similar to the gas-rich S0 galaxies that we discussed in Section 5.2. The cool gas is unlikely to be either a remnant of the raw material from which the galaxy’s stars were made or gas lost from those stars. Instead, it was probably captured from outside the galaxy. However, the average elliptical galaxy contains huge quantities of hot ionized gas. Over several gigayears, gas lost from aging stars builds up a substantial reservoir. For a population of stars that is more than a few gigayears old, mass shed during the red giant and AGB phases amounts to roughly (1–2) M \u0005 of gas per year for each 10 10 L \u0005 of luminosity. The hot gas is invisible at optical and radio wavelengths because it is too diffuse to emit or absorb much at those energies. At temperatures of (1–3) × 10 7 K, it radiates mainly in X-rays. More luminous galaxies, with higher velocity dispersions, have hotter galactic ‘atmospheres’. These extend typically at least 30 kpc from the center; the brightest ellipticals have (10 9 − 10 11 ) M \u0005 of gas, which is 10% − 20% of their mass in luminous stars. Small, low-mass ellipticals have much less gas; their weaker gravity is less capable of preventing its escape to intergalactic space. Figure 6.21 shows the X-ray spectrum of the hot gas around M87. Over this energy range, the galaxy emits ∼ 3 × 10 35 W, or 10 9 L \u0005 , where L \u0005 is the Sun’s total (bolometric) luminosity of 3 . 86 × 10 26 W. We see metal lines, meaning that at least part of this gas has been processed by nuclear burning in stars; it has about half the solar proportion of iron.

Zepf. by supernova explosions should be far richer; most of the hot gas is probably the outer envelope material shed by aging stars. Those stars have large random motions within the galaxy; as gas from one star runs into that of another at speeds close to the stellar velocity dispersion σ , shocks convert its kinetic energy into heat. Since σ ∼ > 350 km s − 1 in bright ellipticals, this provides enough energy to heat the gas to the temperatures that we observe. In giant ellipticals at the centers of rich galaxy clusters, this hot atmosphere merges into the gas of the cluster: see Section 7.2. Elliptical galaxies are surrounded by swarms of globular clusters: on aver- age, each has about twice as many as a similarly bright disk system. The cD galaxy NGC 1399 has 7000 known globular clusters. The number can vary greatly between galaxies: M87 is about as luminous as NGC 3923, but is four times richer in bright globulars. Figure 6.22 shows that the clusters around both these galaxies split into a red- der and a bluer group. The bluer clusters are older, or poorer in metals. The Milky Way’s globular clusters would have a similar color distribution, with the two peaks corresponding to metal-rich clusters of the thick disk and to metal-poor halo clus- ters; see Section 2.2. The arclike shells around NGC 3923 (Figure 6.5) indicate that another galaxy has merged into it; perhaps the more metal-rich and presum- ably younger globular clusters formed as part of that process. Some astronomers consider the similar color distribution among M87’s clusters to indicate that it too has suffered a merger. 6.4 Dark matter and black holes We saw in Sections 2.3 and 5.3 that, for spiral galaxies, we could find the mass within radius R of the center by using the measured rotation speed V ( R )ofgas"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"274 Elliptical galaxies following near-circular orbits, along with Equation 3.20 for the gravitational force. Generally, the mass of these galaxies is more spread out than the luminous stars; the mass-to-light ratio M / L is larger when measured further from the center. Most of whatever makes up the outer parts of a spiral emits very little light; we call it dark matter . Do elliptical galaxies also contain dark matter? To answer this question, we must estimate the mass within a given region, from measurements of the gravitational force. If that is significantly larger than the mass present in stars and gas, we ascribe the difference to dark matter. Finding the distribution of stars in elliptical galaxies is easier than for spirals, since ellipticals contain little dust to obscure their light. We can calculate the expected mass-to- light ratio by comparing the galaxy’s spectrum with models like that of Figure 6.18. This yields 3 ∼ < M / L V ∼ < 5, close to what we found by using the virial theorem for the galaxy cores; see Problem 6.6. But, if we measure at larger radii, generally we find M / L ∼ > 20. As in disk galaxies, most of the mass in the outer parts of ellipticals is dark. 6.4.1 Dark halos For the few elliptical galaxies that have cold gas, we can use the same techniques as for disk systems to find their mass. For example, the luminous E4 galaxy NGC 5266 has a prominent dust lane along its apparent minor axis. Mapping in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen reveals about 10 10 M \u0005 of H I gas, extending to 4 \u0006 from the center, and apparently following near-circular orbits with V ( R ) ≈ 250 km s − 1 . Within a radius of 50 kpc, this galaxy has M / L ≈ 10–20 in solar units, which is much larger than we found in Problem 6.6 for the center of NGC 1399, but similar to results for spiral galaxies in Section 5.3. If the systems containing cold gas are otherwise typical, then the outer parts of elliptical galaxies consist mainly of dark matter. Problem 6.13 The redshift of NGC 5266 is cz ≈ 3000 km s − 1 ;if H 0 = 75 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 , show that its distance d ≈ 40 Mpc. Use Equation 3.20 to show that the mass M ( < 4 \u0006 ) ≈ 7 × 10 11 M \u0005 . The total apparent magnitude B 0 T = 12 . 02; show that L B ≈ 4 × 10 10 L \u0005 – this is a big galaxy – so that the mass-to-light ratio M / L B ≈ 18. The motions of globular clusters can also be used to test for dark matter in the outer reaches of elliptical galaxies. In NGC 1399, velocities were measured for 468 globular clusters out to 9 \u0006 from the center. Like the halo globular clusters of our Milky Way, they appear to follow random orbits with no overall rotation, and the velocity dispersion is almost constant at σ r ∼ 275 km s − 1 . Within 50 kpc of the center, the mass-to-light ratio M / L V ∼ 50 (see below), several times higher than we found in Problem 6.6.

With a distance d = 20 Mpc for NGC 1399, show that the measured velocity dispersion corresponds to a rotation speed V H that implies M ∼ 2 × 10 12 M \u0005 within 50 kpc. NGC 1399 has absolute V -magnitude M V =− 21 . 7; show that M / L ∼ 50. 6.4.2 Central black holes Recent spectroscopic observations with high spatial resolution, from the ground and with the Hubble Space Telescope, have helped in the hunt for massive black holes at the centers of nearby galaxies. Stars close to a central black hole should move faster than those further out (as we see in Figure 2.17). If they orbit in random directions, we will see a central rise in the velocity dispersion measured from the absorption lines of the galaxy’s spectrum. We should notice this effect when we probe close enough to the center that the circular speed of an orbit around it exceeds the velocity dispersion σ c of the surrounding stars, meaning that V 2 ( r ) ≈ G M BH r ∼ > σ 2 c . (6.34) So we must observe within a radius r BH such that r BH ≈ 45 pc × \u0003 M BH 10 8 M \u0005 \u0004 × \u0003 σ 2 c 100 km s − 1 \u0004 − 2 .

In the Local Group galaxy M32, we need an extra 2 × 10 6 M \u0005 within the central parsec; in the giant elliptical M87 the excess mass is ∼ 3 × 10 9 M \u0005 within 20 pc. Our own Milky Way’s black hole with M BH ≈ 4 × 10 6 M \u0005 fits neatly onto the trend: M BH ≈ 2 × 10 8 M \u0005 × \u0003 σ c 200 km s − 1 \u0004 4 . 86 . (6.36) The largest central masses are found in galaxies where the velocity dispersion σ is highest, and the virial theorem indicates the deepest gravitational potential wells. These are also the most luminous objects, as we should expect from the Faber–Jackson relation and the fundamental plane of Figure 6.13. The right panel shows that these masses are close to the minimum that could have been found in the best current observations. Smaller objects could have remained hidden.

In M87, there is a small disk of gas around the nucleus: its rotation speed, as measured from the gas emission lines, is exactly as expected for material orbiting a central object of 3 × 10 9 M \u0005 . We suspect, but cannot prove, that these large masses are black holes. To confirm it would require observations of gas at a few times the Schwarzschild radius, orbiting at speeds close to that of light; that is far from our present capabilities.

Groups and clusters no longer expand with the cosmic flow: mutual gravitational attraction is strong enough that the galaxies are moving inward, or have already passed through the core. Clusters are the denser and richer structures. Within the central megaparsec, they typically contain at least 50 luminous galaxies: those with L ∼ > L ∼ 2 × 10 10 L \u0005 . Poorer associations are called groups; they are generally less massive than ∼ 10 14 M \u0005 . Galaxies and clusters are not simply concentrations of galaxies: the fact that a galaxy is a member significantly affects its development. The most common inhabitants of groups are spiral and irregular galaxies. The Local Group is typical; its three bright members are all spirals. Almost all the large galaxies of the Ursa Major group, featured in Figures 5.6, 5.8, and 5.23, are disk systems; there are no more than two ellipticals among the brightest 79 galaxies. Elliptical and S0 galaxies predominate in dense clusters. Curiously, both the most luminous giant ellipticals and the dwarfs with L ∼ < 3 × 10 9 L \u0005 are concentrated more strongly into clusters than the midsized ellipticals. By contrast with groups, which we discuss in Section 7.1, we will see in Section 7.2 that most of the baryonic (‘normal’) matter in galaxy clusters is not in the galaxies themselves. Galaxy clusters are filled with hot gas at temperatures T ∼ 10 7 –10 8 K, and glow brightly in X-rays. As new galaxies join a cluster they fall in through the hot gas, and its pressure strips away their cool atomic and molecular gas. The H I disks of galaxies in dense regions, such as the inner parts of the Virgo cluster, are much smaller than those further out, since they have lost the cool gas in their outer parts. Galaxy groups largely lack this relatively dense hot atmosphere of intergalactic gas. However, far more dilute gas between their galaxies may contain 90% of all the baryons in the Universe. Since this gas is too diffuse to cool by radiation, we can trace it only as it absorbs the light of bright background galaxies. 278"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"7.1 Groups: the homes of disk galaxies 279 Problem 7.1 Measured speeds of galaxies in the Coma cluster are σ r ∼ 1000 km s − 1 near the center, falling to σ r ∼ 800 km s − 1 at radii R ∼ > 1 . 5 Mpc. How long will it take for an average galaxy at R ∼ 3 Mpc to cross the cluster? Show that this is almost half of the cosmic time t H . Compared with the oldest stars in our Milky Way, galaxy groups and clusters are latecomers to the cosmos. The motions of galaxies within a cluster are only a few times larger than the speeds of stars within the galaxies, but the clusters are a hundred times larger; so galaxies on the outskirts have not had time to travel once through the cluster since the Big Bang. In our Local Group, we saw in Section 4.5 that the Milky Way and M31 are falling together for the first time. So how did our Milky Way, which began to form its stellar disk at least 10 Gyr ago, ‘know’ that it would spend its life in a sparse group? How did the elliptical galaxies that are already full of old red stars at redshifts z ∼ > 2 develop into typical cluster mem- bers, long before the rich clusters in which they live had come together? We will discuss these questions in Section 7.3, but unfortunately we cannot answer them yet. As in galaxies themselves, most of the mass in groups and clusters appears to be dark. However, our usual methods for estimating masses assume that the system is in equilibrium, so that its overall structure is not changing, and also that it is isolated. Neither of these is true for most galaxy groups and clusters. In Section 7.4 we discuss how to measure masses using the gravitational bending of light, a method that can be applied even when the cluster is still growing and changing. Further reading: there is no comprehensive undergraduate-level treatment of these topics. A graduate-level text is M. S. Longair, 1998, Galaxy Formation (Springer, Berlin).

Instead, a tail of H I over 100 kpc long curls around the hot gas to the south and east. Probably, cool H I gas was stripped from the galaxy disks as they came close.

Thus, as group galaxies run into each other, the energy of their motion can heat gas to the observed temperature. Figure 7.2 shows the sparse group around the nearby spiral M81. We see only a few intergalactic stars, but the galaxies are connected by long streamers of atomic hydrogen torn from their disks as they passed close to one another. Because the H I layer of a spiral galaxy extends much further in radius than its main stellar disk, the gas disks are more easily damaged. Here, almost all of the gas that was torn from the galaxies has remained cool. Similarly, in Figure 4.6, we see H I gas from the Magellanic Clouds pulled out into a stream around the Milky Way.

Our usual tricks can tell us the mass of a galaxy group: we watch something that moves, and apply the equations of Newton’s gravity. In the NGC 1550 group, the velocity dispersion of the galaxies is σ r = 310 km s − 1 . If we assume that the group is isolated and in equilibrium, and approximate its density by the Plummer sphere of Equations 3.12 and 3.37 with a P = 100 kpc, then Equation 3.44 (the virial theorem) tells us that its mass M is 3 M σ 2 r 2 = KE =− PE 2 = 3 π 64 G M 2 a P , so M ≈ 2 × 10 13 M \u0005 . When a group contains hot gas we have another way to find its mass, as we did for elliptical galaxies in Section 6.4. We first estimate the X-ray temperature T X from spectral lines. The gas is diffuse, so we can use Equation 2.23 from Section 2.4 to find the density. When T X ∼ > 10 7 K, gas of roughly the Sun’s composition loses energy mainly by free–free radiation, also called thermal bremsstrahlung . If each cubic centimeter contains n atoms, its luminosity is L X = n 2 \u0003 ( T X ) , where \u0003 ≈ 3 × 10 − 27 T 1 / 2 X erg s − 1 . (7.2) (Look back at Figure 2.25 to see how slowly \u0003 increases with temperature.) So we can work backward from the measured surface brightness I X to find n . The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium tells us how much gravity is needed to prevent the hot gas from blowing away as a wind. Its pressure p must be counterbalanced by an inward pull: if ρ ( r ) is the gas density, then, in a spherical galaxy, d p d r =− ρ ( r ) G M ( < r ) r 2 . (7.3) We write the average mass m of a gas particle as m = μ m p : for fully ionized hydrogen μ = 0 . 5, whereas μ ≈ 0 . 6 for gas of solar composition.

In general, the mass-to-light ratio of groups is in the range 80 ∼ < M / L ∼ < 300 M \u0005 / L \u0005 . Stars and gas hot enough to shine in X-rays typically make up less than 10% of the total. Groups as a whole appear to contain several times more mass than what we found in Section 5.3 from the rotation curves of individual spirals. Either the dark matter halo of each galaxy extends several times further out than the H I disk gas with which we measure its rotation, or substantial mass is present between the galaxies as a ‘group halo’. Problem 7.5 Suppose that all galaxy groups share a common form for the density ρ ( r ): for example, the Plummer sphere of Equations 3.12 and 3.37. If all groups have the same radius a P , and their mass is proportional to the number of members N , show that the virial theorem predicts that σ r ∝ √ N . This is roughly what we see in Figure 7.3. Points for the sparsest groups lie above this relation: show that those groups should have smaller radii. Figure 7.3 shows that the speeds of group galaxies are σ r ∼ 100–500 km s − 1 , not much faster than the motion of stars within the galaxies. Because of their low relative speeds, gravity has more time to pull strongly at the gas and stars in the outer parts of other galaxies as they pass. In the next subsection, we see how this can lead two galaxies to merge and become one. 7.1.1 Close encounters between galaxies: dynamical friction We use the methods of Section 3.2 to examine what happens as two galaxies pass close to one another: part of their energy of forward motion is transferred to motion of the stars within them. Thus, as they separate, they travel more slowly than they did on their approach. If the galaxies are then moving too sluggishly to escape from one another, their orbits bring them back together to encounter each other again. Usually, they end by merging. In Figure 7.4, as in Figure 3.5, an object of mass M moves at speed V past a star of mass m at a distance b from its path. But now M is one of our galaxies, while the star m belongs to another: so M / m ∼ 10 8 –10 11 (!)

This formula applies when the approach is not too close, so that galaxy M is contained within a radius \u0011 b .We also require a rapid flyby, in which M and m do not move significantly toward each other during the encounter. As before, we must have b \u0012 2 G ( M + m ) V 2 ≡ 2 r s (3.53) (for M = m , r s is the strong-encounter radius defined by Equation 3.48). The star m in the second galaxy must gain an equal and opposite momentum, so the"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"7.1 Groups: the homes of disk galaxies 285 total kinetic energy in perpendicular motions is \b KE ⊥ = M 2 \u0003 2 Gm bV \u0004 2 + m 2 \u0003 2 G M bV \u0004 2 = 2 G 2 m M ( M + m ) b 2 V 2 . (7.5) Note that the object of smaller mass acquires most of the energy. This energy can be provided only from the forward motion of the galaxy M , which consequently changes by an amount \b V \u0018 . Long before the encounter and long afterward, the potential energy is small; so the kinetic energies are equal, and we have M 2 V 2 = \b KE ⊥ + M 2 ( V + \b V \u0018 ) 2 + m 2 \u0003 M m \b V \u0018 \u0004 2 . (7.6) If \b V \u0018 \u0011 V , we can drop terms in \b V 2 \u0018 to find that each star m in the ‘stationary’ galaxy slows M by an amount − \b V \u0018 ≈ \b KE ⊥ M V = 2 G 2 m ( M + m ) b 2 V 3 . (7.7) Because the kinetic energy transferred to m grows as M 2 , the forward motion is braked more quickly as the mass M of the passing galaxy increases. The faster M flies by, the less time it has to transfer energy to m , and the less speed it loses. Suppose that our intruding galaxy M passes through a region of the second galaxy that contains n stars of mass m per cubic parsec. Then we can integrate over all those stars to find the average rate at which it slows: − d V d t = \u0002 b max b min nV 2 G 2 m ( M + m ) b 2 V 3 2 π b d b = 4 π G 2 ( M + m ) V 2 nm ln \u0003, (7.8) where \u0003 = b max / b min . As in the discussion following Equation 3.55, we usually take b min as the radius r s of Equation 3.48, within which M ’s deflection is no longer small, and b max as the distance at which the density of stars becomes much less than it is in the neighborhood of M . This deceleration is described as dynamical friction , since it acts to brake any motion relative to the background of stars. According to Equation 7.8, the slower the galaxy M moves, the larger its deceleration. A high-speed encounter between two galaxies drains less energy from their forward motion than a slow passage. But this is true only as long as we can neglect the random motions of the stars m compared with the forward motion of galaxy M . If not, the drag is reduced. When V is far below the velocity dispersion of the stars in the second galaxy, we have d V / d t ∝− V , just as in Stokes’ law describing the fall of a parachutist through the air."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"286 Galaxy groups and clusters Formula 7.8 can be applied, for example, to a small satellite galaxy orbiting within the dark halo of a larger galaxy; its orbit decays, like that of an Earth satellite subject to atmospheric drag, and it spirals inward. The frictional force does not depend on the mass of whatever objects make up the dark halo, but only on their mass density, through the product nm . A massive satellite is slowed more quickly than a small one. So the following problem shows that the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is likely to merge with our Galaxy within a few gigayears, but most of the globular clusters, which are 10 5 times lighter, are in no danger. Problem 7.6 Far outside the core a H of the ‘dark halo’ potential of Equation 2.19, use Equation 3.14 to show that the density ρ ( r ) ≈ V 2 H / (4 π Gr 2 ). Explain why the force opposing the motion of a satellite of mass M in a circular orbit at radius r is approximately F \u0018 =− G M 2 r 2 ln \u0003 · F . The force is reduced by a factor F compared with Equation 7.8 because the particles of the dark halo have their own random motions: F ≈ 0 . 4 if the ran- dom speeds of the halo particles are equal to V H / √ 2 in all directions, as in the singular isothermal sphere of Equation 3.105. As the satellite spirals in, its angu- lar momentum is L = M rV H . Setting the frictional torque equal to the rate of change in L , show that r d r d t =− G M V H ln \u0003 · F , and so t sink = r 2 V H 2 G M 1 ln \u0003 · F , where t sink is the time that the satellite takes to reach the center of the potential. For the LMC, with M ≈ 2 × 10 10 M \u0005 , V H ≈ 200 km s − 1 , and r ≈ 50 kpc, estimate the radius r s ≈ b min , and hence show that \u0003 ∼ 20. Show that, with F ≈ 0 . 4, this simple formula predicts that the LMC will merge with the Milky Way within 3 Gyr, but a globular cluster with M = 10 6 M \u0005 will not sink far in that time unless it orbits within a kiloparsec of the Galactic center. (In fact, we are on shaky ground when we use Equation 7.8 for two galaxies in orbit about each other. To find the rate at which M is slowed, we added the effects of successive encounters with masses m , assuming that these were independent of each other. But the stars m are bound together in a galaxy and affect each other’s motion. Also, as M orbits that galaxy, it will encounter the same stars m repeatedly, experiencing resonance effects that may either weaken or strengthen the ‘friction’.) Dynamical friction removes energy from the forward motion of two passing galaxies, transferring it to the random motions of their stars. Long afterward, though, the combination of rotational motion and random speeds within each"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"7.1 Groups: the homes of disk galaxies 287 galaxy will be lower than before the collision. To see why, suppose that, before the encounter, the internal kinetic energy of one of the galaxies was KE 0 .By Equation 3.44, the virial theorem, the potential energy PE 0 =− 2 KE 0 ; so its internal energy E 0 must be E 0 = KE 0 + PE 0 =− KE 0 . (7.9) Dynamical friction increases the energy in random stellar motions, and hence the galaxy’s internal energy, by \b KE . The system is less strongly bound, so it expands. Long after the encounter, when it is once again in virial equilibrium, the kinetic energy is less than before: KE 1 =− ( E 0 + \b KE ) = KE 0 − \b KE . (7.10) The stars that acquire the most energy escape from the galaxy; those receiving less remain loosely attached, as a bloated outer envelope. In a spiral or S0 galaxy, the energy added to vertical motions thickens the stellar disk. If two galaxies pass by one another at the high speeds typical of rich galaxy clusters, they are unlikely to slow each other enough to become a bound pair. They separate, leaving both somewhat dishevelled. But in groups the galaxies travel more slowly, not much faster than the stellar motions within them; so a close passage is far more disturbing. Almost all galaxies that we now see in the process of merging are group members. Many group galaxies show evidence of near-miss encounters. These can push a galaxy into making a bar or spiral that would not have done so if it had been alone. Like M81, many galaxies with spectacular two-armed spirals have close companions. Mergers and near-misses also force disk gas in toward the galaxy’s center. Because the changing gravity pulls material away from its near-circular orbits, gas streams converge from different directions. As we discussed in Sec- tion 5.5, this causes shocks that remove energy from the gas, letting some of it fall inward. If it reaches the galaxy’s center, it can grow a massive black hole or fuel activity in the nucleus. Both NGC 7319 in Stephan’s Quintet and M81 are Seyfert galaxies, a type of active nucleus that we discuss in Section 9.1. 7.1.2 Galaxy mergers and starbursts If an encounter has drained enough energy from the galaxies’ orbital motion to leave them bound to each other, they will probably merge. Figure 7.5 shows three views of what appears to be such a merger in progress, and Figure 7.6 shows a computer simulation of the collision that may have led to it. This is a gravitational N -body simulation , in which roughly 10 6 particles attract each other by the gravitational force of Equation 3.2.

This simulation uses a ‘tree code’, which divides space into cells by a grid, and approximates the pull of distant material by regarding all the mass in any grid cell as making up a single particle. Each particle has its own grid, which is coarser for more distant material, while the forces of near-neighbor particles are calculated one by one. Even this is too time-consuming for the largest simulations. Then, we simply lay down a single grid for the whole calculation, and average the forces from all particles within each cell. Using a grid also has the same beneficial effect as the ‘softening’ that we discussed in Section 3.2, in suppressing unwanted two-body relaxation. In this collision, the disk of one galaxy happens to lie close to the plane in which the two systems orbit one another, and rotates in the same sense; so we see particularly strong effects. On the side of the disk nearer to the intruding system, the rotation cancels out much of the relative motion of the two bodies. Stars and gas here spend a long time close to the perturber. They receive both angular momentum and energy, pushing them onto elongated orbits which can take them out to very large radii. The material that has been torn off the disks will remain visible as ‘tidal tails’ for several gigayears before it falls back onto the merged remnant of the galaxies."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"7.1 Groups: the homes of disk galaxies 289 Fig. 7.6.

Material at the tips of the tails is still travelling outward at the end of the run; it will not fall back onto the galaxies for many gigayears – J. Hibbard and J. Barnes. Because the close passage or merger of two gas-rich galaxies compresses their gas, it often causes a starburst : stars form so rapidly as to exhaust the gas supply within a few hundred million years. Galaxies with tidal tails and other indications of a recent merger often have (10 9 –10 10 ) M \u0005 of dense molecular gas at the center. Much of it was probably brought inward from the main disk during the encounter."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"290 Galaxy groups and clusters As this gas is squeezed by gravity, the likely result is violent star formation. After this dies away, it may leave a bright compact inner disk of stars. The uppermost spectrum in Figure 5.24 is from a blue starburst galaxy. Its newly-born massive stars are bright in the ultraviolet, and ionize the gas around them to produce the strong emission lines. The small galaxy M82 in Figure 7.2 is also a starburst. It is making (2–4) M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars, about the same as a large spiral like the Milky Way, but in a region only 600 pc across. The radio-bright knots show where young stars have ionized the gas, producing free–free radiation. At this rate, its supply of 2 × 10 8 M \u0005 of atomic and molec- ular gas will be consumed within 100 Myr, the free-fall or dynamical time of Equation 3.23. On the back cover are two images of M82, showing how the starburst is blowing gas out of the galaxy as a strong wind. The top image was taken in infrared light at 3–9 μ m. The new stars have heated dust in the escaping wind, which glows ‘red’ at 8 μ m while the stellar disk is ‘blue’. The lower one shows dust lanes crossing the whitish stellar disk; the purple color shows emission in the H α line from the wind, which removes about as much mass from the galaxy as it turns into new stars. Starbursts are not simply scaled-up versions of the star-forming regions in galaxies like our own. In M82, where we can directly measure the gas pressure, it is 100 times greater than that in the solar neighborhood. More of their gas is actively star-forming: emission lines of HCN, which trace the dense gas of star-forming cores (see Table 1.8) are about five times stronger in starbursts relative to the CO emission from more diffuse gas. In Section 9.4, we will find that many distant galaxies have the chaotic appearance and high surface brightness characteristic of starbursts. The very fact that we can observe them at all means that they are much more powerful than most local starbursts, and also relatively unobscured by dust. These gigantic starbursts at z ∼ > 2, less than 5 Gyr after the Big Bang, probably built up the dense old regions of present-day galaxies. If a starburst is shrouded in the dusty gas from which the stars were born, that dust intercepts most of the stellar light, re-radiating the energy at infrared wavelengths. Figure 7.7 shows that about 90% of M82’s starlight suffers this fate. A galaxy like the Milky Way radiates about 10 10 L \u0005 in the far-infrared, but a powerful starburst surrounded by dust will be seen as a luminous infrared galaxy with L FIR ∼ > 10 11 L \u0005 , while only a few percent of its starlight escapes directly. Even brighter sources with L FIR > 10 12 L \u0005 are known as ultralumi- nous infrared galaxies or ULIRGs. Almost all ULIRGs are in the late stages of a merger. If we assume that starbursts form the same relative numbers of stars of different masses as in the Milky Way (the initial mass function of Section 2.1 is the same), then the energy emitted at infrared wavelengths tells us how fast new stars are made.

In the starburst M82 and the ultraluminous infrared galaxy, dust intercepts far more of the light, and it is hotter, radiating mainly at λ< 100 μ m.

(7.11) So the most powerful ULIRGs, radiating L FIR ∼ > 10 13 L \u0005 , give birth to ∼ 1000 M \u0005 of new stars each year. About half of these have an active nucleus (see Section 9.1) in addition to a ferocious starburst. Arp 220, a merging pair of galaxies with characteristic tidal tails, is only 75 Mpc away, giving us a close-up view of a ULIRG. It is making ∼ 200 M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars, but only a few percent of their light escapes directly. The rest is absorbed by dust, so we see L FIR ∼ 1 . 5 × 10 12 L \u0005 . Radio and infrared observations that can see through the dust reveal two nuclei, each surrounded by a gas disk ∼ 20 pc in radius with 6 × 10 8 M \u0005 of gas at densities n (H 2 ) ∼ 10 3 cm − 3 . These in turn are embedded in a kiloparsec-sized disk with > 10 9 M \u0005 of dense gas. Typically a ULIRG contains (5–10) × 10 9 M \u0005 of dense molecular gas, mainly in a rotating disk or ring in the central kiloparsec. The Milky Way has half as much gas (see Table 2.4), but it is spread over ten times the area and forms stars a hundred times more slowly.

Often the inner part of the combined galaxy has become rounder, and the former disk stars now make up a system with large random motions and little rotation. Its structure looks very much like an elliptical galaxy. Many astronomers would argue that all bright ellipticals have their origin in such a violent galactic collision: we will discuss this further in Section 7.3. What does the future hold for a galaxy group? The Local Group is quite isolated, with no substantial galaxies poised to fall into it. In Section 4.5 we saw that M31 and the Milky Way are likely to collide, and will probably merge. The Local Group will probably become a ‘fossil group’, with a single isolated galaxy that has eaten all the luminous systems, so that only small satellites remain. The cannibal might end up as an elliptical, or a giant S0 or Sa galaxy like the Sombrero in Figure 5.5. While new galaxies fall into a group, as they are still doing in Stephan’s Quintet, their gravitational pull increases the random speeds of the other galaxies. That replaces some of the energy sapped by dynamical friction, and delays merging. We will see in the next section that rich clusters grow by absorbing clumps of galaxies. Many groups will end by dissolving in larger systems before their component galaxies merge. 7.2 Rich clusters: the domain of S0 and elliptical galaxies About 5%–10% of luminous galaxies live in clusters. The nearest populous clusters are 15–20 Mpc from us, in the constellations of Virgo in the northern sky and Fornax in the south. We list some of their properties in Table 7.1, comparing them with richer clusters and with Stephan’s Quintet. George Abell’s 1958 catalogue and its 1989 supplement list 4073 rich clusters having at least 30 giant member galaxies within a radius of ∼ 1 . 5 h − 1 Mpc. Of the 1300 catalogued members of the Virgo cluster, only 150 are brighter than apparent total B -magnitude B T = 14, equivalent to L ∼ > 10 9 L \u0005 if the distance d = 16 Mpc. Figure 7.8 shows that most of the galaxies are dwarfs. In the densest part of the Virgo cluster, near the giant elliptical M87, the averaged B -band surface brightness is ∼ 5 × 10 11 L \u0005 Mpc − 2 , or about 0 . 5 L \u0005 pc − 2 . The core radius , where the surface density of galaxies falls to half its central value, is approximately r c = 1 . 7 ◦ or 0.5 Mpc. Making the very rough approximation that the cluster is spherical, in the core we have 3 × 10 11 L \u0005 Mpc − 3 . Within the central 6 ◦ , the cluster’s total luminosity is L ≈ 1 . 3 × 10 12 L \u0005 , giving an average density of 4 × 10 10 L \u0005 Mpc − 3 . At the core of the Fornax cluster is the cD galaxy NGC 1399. Fornax has only a fifth as many bright members as Virgo but is more compact; at its center we find one of the highest galaxy densities anywhere in the local Universe. Continuing the trend that we found among galaxy groups, Fornax has less hot gas in proportion to its starlight than does the more luminous Virgo cluster."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"7.2 Rich clusters: the domain of S0 and elliptical galaxies 293 Table 7.1 Nearby galaxy clusters, compared with a distant cluster and a nearby group Coma Perseus RDCS Stephan’s Virgo Fornax A1656 A426 1252.9–2927 Quintet Distance (Mpc) 16 20 100 80 a z = 1 . 24 85 Number of galaxies > 10 9 L \u0005 150 30 450 350 120 4 B -band starlight L B (10 10 L \u0005 ) 130 20 500 300 b 300 7 Velocity dispersion σ r (km s − 1 ) 700–800 350 ∼ 1000 1300 → 600 800 350 Core r c (kpc) 400 200 200 250 100 25 X-ray L X (10 10 L \u0005 ) 1.3 0.03 25 50 20 0.005 Temperature T X (10 7 K) 2 1–2 9 7 7 0.6 c Hot gas M X (10 10 M \u0005 ) 2 000 ∼ > 60 7 000 7 000 2 000 ∼ > 0 . 07 c Mass M (10 10 M \u0005 ) 20 000 5 000 40 000 50 000 20 000 100 M / L B 150 250 80 180 b ∼ 200 14 M / M X 10 80 6 7 10 > 1000 a At z = 1 . 24 the benchmark cosmology gives d L = 8 . 5 Gpc, d A = 1 . 7 Gpc. b Luminosity in the z band at 9000 ̊ A. c Mass within 1 Mpc of the cluster’s center.

The Coma cluster, Abell 1656, and Perseus cluster, Abell 426, are even bigger than Virgo. Coma is three times more luminous; although it is 70 h − 1 Mpc from us, it stretches more than 4 ◦ across the sky, or about 7 Mpc. The cluster looks round and quite symmetric; at the center is a pair of very luminous elliptical galaxies. Perseus is the brightest cluster in the X-ray sky. Near the center, 10–15 bright galaxies appear strung out into a line. At one end is the huge elliptical NGC 1275 shown in Figure 7.9, which is also a radio galaxy (see Section 9.1). But Perseus has been less well studied because it is only 13 ◦ from the Galactic plane, so we must view it through the Milky Way’s dust. Most clusters have irregular or lumpy shapes. Like big cities, they grow as they absorb surrounding groups and clusters. But unlike suburbs, the orbits of newly-acquired groups take them ‘downtown’ through the core of the cluster. Clusters become more massive, but their radii increase only slowly. In the Virgo cluster, roughly a third of the galaxies form a clump around the elliptical M49, while the rest surround M87 about 1 Mpc to the north (see Figure 8.2).

The diffuse emission is from hot cluster gas, the point sources are distant active galaxies – M. van Haarlem. Universe has reached 2–3 times its present size, we expect cosmic acceleration caused by the dark energy (see Section 8.2) to overpower the cluster’s gravity, so that infall almost ceases. The Virgo cluster is a fairly loose cluster, and contains many spiral galaxies which are still forming new stars. By contrast, spirals are almost excluded from the densest parts of rich clusters. Figure 7.10 illustrates this morphology–density relation : Coma’s core contains only elliptical galaxies, while the spirals are rele- gated to the outer suburbs. Perseus has an even stronger deficiency of star-forming galaxies. Figure 7.11 shows quite generally that, in dense places such as rich clus- ters, the most luminous galaxies are red, with spectra that show no sign of recently born hot stars. There are hardly any luminous blue galaxies, and we see star for- mation only in unusual central galaxies, such as NGC 1275 in Figure 7.9. In the sparse ‘void’ regions (illustrated in Section 8.1 below), a fairly luminous galaxy is as likely to be a blue star-former as to be ‘red and dead’, while dwarf galaxies are overwhelmingly blue star-forming irregulars. In clusters, most of the dwarfs are of types dE and dSph, which contain only old and middle-aged stars. Most cluster galaxies can no longer make stars because they have lost all their cool gas. As galaxies fall in to join a cluster, they rush through the hot cluster gas much faster than the sound speed in the galaxy’s gas ( ∼ 10 km s − 1 in the disk of a galaxy like ours: recall Problem 2.21 of Section 2.4).

Luminosity functions of blue star-forming galaxies (stars) and red galaxies (filled dots). Bright red galaxies predominate in clusters, but dim blue galaxies are more frequent in the low-density field or void regions. Clouds of neutral hydrogen, found in low-density regions, resemble blue galaxies in that small systems are far more common than big ones – D. Croton, 2dF survey; M. Zwaan, HIPASS. at the boundary between the galaxy’s gas and the hot intergalactic gas, which prevents them from moving freely through each other. The stars and dark matter are unaffected, so the gas can be left behind while the rest of the galaxy falls in. In spiral galaxies nearest to the cores of the Virgo and Coma clusters, the H I disks have smaller radii; these inner spirals have already lost the outer parts of their neutral hydrogen layers. Just as in galaxy groups, there are stars between the galaxies of rich clusters, but they are hard to find because they are so thinly spread. The Hubble Space Telescope barely picks out red giants at the distance of Virgo; in most clusters, only special objects such as an exploding nova or supernova, or planetary nebulae, can be seen individually. Some intergalactic novae have been spotted in the Fornax cluster. In a planetary nebula, a low-mass star has exhausted its nuclear fuel and blown off its outer layers, baring the hot stellar core. The core’s ultraviolet radiation ionizes the ejected gas, which glows strongly in emission lines, particularly the oxygen line at 5007 ̊ A. By searching for objects shining brightly in this line, planetary nebulae have been found between the galaxies in several nearby clusters. In the Virgo cluster, their numbers imply that 10%–20% of all the stars lie between the galaxies. The ‘vagabond’ stars could have been torn from galaxies during a merger, or they may be remnants of loosely bound small galaxies torn apart by tides (recall Section 4.1).

The rate at which the spiral galaxies in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster fall in toward the center depends on the mass at smaller radii: we infer M ≈ 2 × 10 14 M \u0005 , so the mass-to-light ratio M / L ∼ 150 M \u0005 / L \u0005 . The mass is only approximate, because the clusters are neither spherical nor in dynamical equilibrium. Problem 7.8 In the Coma cluster, the core radius measured from the galaxy den- sity is r c = 200 kpc from Table 7.1. Make a crude model by assuming the cluster to be a Plummer sphere; from Problem 3.2, show that a P ≈ 300 kpc. Taking the average velocity dispersion σ r from Table 7.1, use the result of Problem 3.11 and follow the method of Problem 3.13 to show that M ∼ 7 × 10 14 M \u0005 , implying M / L ∼ 150 M \u0005 / L \u0005 . As for groups, we can use Equation 7.4 to find the cluster masses from observations of hot gas. In the Virgo cluster, this yields M ∼ 3 × 10 14 M \u0005 within 6 ◦ or 1.7 Mpc of the cluster’s center. It is more than we found from the motions of the galaxies, because the gas can be traced to larger radii. A recent study of 32 clusters using this method found that the mass-to-light ratio mostly lies in the range 180 ∼ < M / L ∼ < 300. These ratios are much greater than the range 5 h ∼ < M / L ∼ < 25 h that we found for individual spiral galaxies in Sec- tion 5.3, or for ellipticals in Problems 6.6 and 6.14. Like the hot gas (see below), most of a cluster’s dark matter must lie between the galaxies rather than within them. 7.2.1 Hot gas in clusters of galaxies Galaxy clusters do not really deserve their name: they are huge accumulations of X-ray-luminous hot gas, cohabiting with a few galaxies. The mass of hot gas is roughly equal to that in stars in a poorer cluster like Fornax; it rises to a ratio of 10 : 1 in the richest systems like Coma. Table 7.1 shows that the largest clusters have been least efficient at turning their gas into stars. By contrast with groups like Stephan’s Quintet, there is so much hot gas in rich clusters that it cannot all have been stripped from the galaxies. The hot gas fills the whole cluster, and can often be traced to larger radii than can the stellar light. Figure 7.12 shows that the most luminous clusters contain the hottest gas, with temperatures of up to 10 8 K. As in groups, the cluster gas is roughly at the virial temperature predicted from the velocity dispersion σ r of the galaxies. Because new clumps of galaxies are continually added to a cluster, both its X-ray luminosity and the virial temperature should grow over time. Models predict that the temperature increases faster, so that a cluster with a particular luminosity should be cooler at earlier times. But we see no sign of this effect in Figure 7.12, even for clusters at z ∼ 1 when the Universe was half its present age. Perhaps winds from early starburst galaxies and active nuclei also added energy to the gas."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"298 Galaxy groups and clusters 0.6 0.8 1 2 4 6 8 10 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10 50 100 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 SQ N1550 Fig. 7.12. The X-ray luminosity L X of a galaxy cluster or group, in units of the Sun’s bolometric luminosity, increases with the gas temperature T X : the dashed line shows L X ∝ T 3 X . Stephan’s Quintet and the NGC 1550 group follow the same trend. This relation has changed little since redshift z ≈ 1. In most clusters with T X > 3 × 10 7 K, the gas has roughly one-third of the solar content of iron – D. Horner. Problem 7.9 Suppose that all galaxy groups and clusters have the same average density, according to Problem 8.2 below. If the gas in a cluster is heated to the virial temperature of Problem 7.2, show that the cluster’s mass M ∝ T 3 / 2 X . If hot gas makes up a fixed fraction of the cluster’s mass, the average density n is the same for all of them. Use Equation 7.2 to show that we expect L X ∝ M √ T X so that L X ∝ T 2 X . (Figure 7.12 shows that L X increases even more steeply with temperature; the gas in galaxy groups and poor clusters must be less dense than that in rich clusters.) The cooling time t cool measures how fast the hot gas radiates away its thermal energy. A cubic centimeter of completely ionized hydrogen containing n atoms has thermal energy 2 n × (3 k B T / 2), so from Equation 7.2 t cool = 3 nk B T 3 × 10 − 27 n 2 √ T s ≈ 14 \u0003 10 − 3 cm − 3 n \u0004\u0003 10 7 K T \u0004 1 / 2 Gyr . (7.12) The gas density in galaxy clusters varies from a few times 10 − 2 cm − 3 in the center to 10 − 4 cm − 3 in the outer parts. In the cores of rich clusters, around the most luminous galaxies, the gas should cool within the cosmic time t H . Unless its energy is replenished, that gas should cool and become dense, giv- ing birth to new stars.

So we believe that the gas is reheated, perhaps by hot winds from supernovae, or the outflows from radio sources that we will discuss in Section 9.1. Gas in the outskirts will remain hot for > 10 Gyr, so it cannot form stars. Problem 7.10 Around NGC 1399 at the center of the Fornax cluster, the X-ray emission from hot gas extends out to radii of 100 kpc. The gas temperature T X ≈ 1 . 5 × 10 7 K; within 45 \u0006\u0006 or 5 kpc of the center, the density n H ≈ 0 . 02 cm − 3 , falling approximately as n H ∝ r − 1 . Show that t cool ≈ 0 . 5 Gyr in the core, increasing to 10 Gyr at r = 100 kpc. Galaxy clusters often appear lumpier in an X-ray image than at optical wave- lengths. On the lower right of Figure 7.10, we see X-rays from the clump around the galaxy NGC 4839 in the Coma cluster. Here, the gas is only half as hot as the main cluster. At the ‘neck’ in the X-ray contours, temperatures roughly double to 10 8 K where the clump gas meets the main cluster. In the Perseus cluster, we see low-density ‘bubbles’ in the central X-ray gas, which probably were blown by energetic outflows from the radio galaxy NGC 1275. Most galaxy clusters today are still growing; even their centers are not always near equilibrium, since they are disturbed as newly-added galaxies fall through them. The hot cluster gas contains iron and other heavy elements in roughly one-third of the solar proportion: see Figure 7.12. Gas near the center is more metal-rich; neither infalling clumps of galaxies nor the outflows from active galaxies have been able to mix it with the rest of the cluster gas. Although these heavy elements must have been ‘cooked’ by nuclear burning in stars, most of a cluster’s supply of metals is now in the hot gas. Perhaps they were made in galactic stars, and the force of supernova explosions carried metal-bearing material out into the cluster. Or perhaps many early stars formed in smaller clumps which later fell together to make galaxies, releasing metal-enriched gas as they merged. However, the stars of the galaxies themselves are as metal-rich as the Milky Way. So, if the metals were made inside the galaxies, these systems must have been very efficient at producing heavy elements. The hot gas itself accounts for roughly a tenth of the mass of a luminous cluster, but much less in systems with T X < (2–3) × 10 7 K. If we take M / L B = 4–8 for the stars of the galaxies, then stars and hot gas together make up roughly a sixth of the cluster’s mass. This is close to the cosmic average for the benchmark cosmology of Section 1.5, so galaxy clusters appear to be a ‘fair sample’ of the mix of dark and luminous material. By contrast, baryons are more concentrated into galaxies: recall from Problem 2.18 that at most half the mass inside the Sun’s orbit around the Milky Way can be dark. In galaxy groups, we find too little luminous gas and stars for the amount of dark matter. Some baryons may have been lost, blown out during episodes of violent star formation; others may be hidden as very dilute gas between the galaxies."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"300 Galaxy groups and clusters Table 7.2 The cosmic baryon budget Where it is Density (10 − 3 ρ crit ) Total (benchmark cosmology) 45 Intergalactic gas Diffuse and ionized ≈ 40 Damped Lyman- α clouds 1 Hot gas in clusters and Es 1.8 Stars and stellar remnants Stars in Es and bulges 1.5 Stars in disks 0.55 Dead stars 0.48 Brown dwarfs 0.14 Cool gas in galaxies 0.78 We can find only 10% of the baryons, which make up ∼ < 15% of the matter, which is ∼ < 30% of the critical density – M. Fukugita and P. J. E. Peebles 2004 ApJ 616 , 643. 7.2.2 Where have all the baryons gone? Throughout this book, we have seen that the stars and gas within galaxies form only a fraction of their mass. Table 7.2 shows that luminous and dead stars, together with the cool gas in galaxy disks, make up only (3–4) × 10 − 3 ρ crit . But Equation 1.40 tells us that baryons (neutrons and protons) in the Universe account for a fraction \u0002 B of the critical density, where 0 . 03 ∼ < \u0002 B ∼ < 0 . 07. The stars and the cool gas together contribute only 10% of this total. Where is the rest? The hot X-ray-emitting gas in clusters of galaxies holds nearly as much mass as all the stars. In groups, there is cool gas between the galaxies: recall the H I stream- ers of the M81 group, in Figure 7.2. The amount of ionized gas that they might accomodate is unknown; but it could be large, since galaxy groups are more numer- ous than rich clusters. If gas is heated close to the virial temperature of Figure 7.3 as the group forms, then Equation 7.12 shows that, if n < 10 − 3 cm − 2 , its low den- sity will prevent it from cooling. It would remain ionized up to the present; since it does not absorb in the Lyman- α line, it would be almost impossible to detect. In Section 9.3 we will discuss the intergalactic gas, which we can investigate through the absorption lines it produces in the spectra of distant objects. The densest gas is in the damped Lyman- α clouds, which are mainly neutral and atomic, and contain more cool gas than there is in today’s galaxies. But they leave us far from balancing the account. Most of the baryons are likely to be in the Lyman- α forest, the most diffuse gas, in which hydrogen is almost completely ionized. 7.3 Galaxy formation: nature, nurture, or merger?

This segre- gation is puzzling, because the stars of elliptical galaxies may be almost as old as the Universe, while we will see in Section 8.1 that galaxy clusters are still coming together today. As a galaxy forms, how can it know whether it will end up ‘downtown’ in the cluster core, or as a spiral in the suburbs? We do not understand this process yet, and have only some hints. In Section 4.3 we took a brief look at the origin of galaxies. Early in cosmic history, dark matter was evenly spread, mixed with baryons in the form of hot gas. In slightly denser regions, clumps of matter were pulled together under their own gravity. The larger clumps absorbed smaller ones that fell into them, much as we see in galaxy clusters today. As clumps collided, their gas was compressed and heated. If it was dense enough to cool, the gas lost energy and fell inward. The particles of dark matter could not lose energy, so the central parts of a galaxy consist mainly of cool gas and luminous stars. Where the heated gas was too diffuse it did not cool, and its pressure prevented it from flowing inward. Perhaps elliptical galaxies are not as old as their stars. We know that some nearby ellipticals have recently eaten other galaxies. They show faint shells and other asymmetries in the outer parts (Section 6.1); stars in the core rotate differently from those in the main galaxy (Section 6.2); cold gas orbits at seemingly random inclination (Section 6.3). We will see in Section 9.4 that 5%–10% of fairly bright galaxies at z ∼ 1 appear to be in the throes of a major merger. At this rate, between one and two thirds of today’s fairly luminous galaxies (with L ∼ > 0 . 4 L ) underwent a major merger within the past 5 Gyr. Did all elliptical galaxies form by merger of smaller galaxies, so that their stars were born before the galaxy had completely assembled? If so, we could understand why they live in rich clusters, which grow by adding smaller clumps of galaxies. The clumps are excellent sites for mergers because their galaxies have fairly low random speeds, as we discussed in Section 7.1. What should a merger remnant look like, long after the initial disturbance and subsequent vigorous starbirth? That depends on whether the colliding systems contained gas, or only stars and dark matter. When two galaxies of about the same size merge, their stellar disks are destroyed. When cool gas is present, a disk where new stars will be born can be rebuilt. Without cool gas, no new stars can form; the remnant will have only old and middle-aged stars. For these, the virial theorem makes a strong prediction: the merged system should become less dense. Problem 7.11 Suppose that a galaxy is made from N identical fragments, each of mass M and size R . In each one, the average separation between any two stars (or particles of dark matter) is R / 2; so the potential energy PE ≈− G M 2 / R , as in Equation 3.56. Use Equation 3.44 to show that each fragment has energy PE / 2, so that, while they are well separated and moving toward each other only"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"302 Galaxy groups and clusters slowly, the total energy E ≈− G M 2 N / (2 R ). Long after the merged galaxy has come to virial equilibrium, its energy is − G ( M N ) 2 / (2 R g ); show that its new size R g = NR , and its density is only 1 / N 2 as large as that of the original fragments. Explain why Figure 6.6 supports the idea that giant elliptical galaxies (filled circles) arise by repeated merger. But we cannot just combine the stellar populations of two smaller gas-free galaxies to form a massive elliptical. Recall from Figure 6.20 that stars at the center of a luminous elliptical galaxy are more abundant in heavy elements than those in any part of a smaller galaxy. If the merging systems contain some cool gas, then new stars can be made. As we discussed in Section 7.1, rapidly changing gravitational forces will drive gas inward to form a central disk and trigger star formation. If more than one generation of stars is born, later stars incorporate heavy elements released by the earliest, so the galaxy can develop a dense metal- rich center. In the disorder of a collision such as that in Figure 7.6, the spin of the inward-driven gas need not be aligned with the stars around it. The galaxy’s core then differs in its rotation from the rest of the system, as it does in NGC 1399: see Figure 6.12. Thus merging two systems that contain some cool gas could produce a ‘disky’ elliptical galaxy of moderate luminosity with a bright center. Because of the small dense inner disk, containing the youngest stars, these galaxies would rotate rapidly, as Figure 6.15 shows that disky ellipticals do. Some of these in turn might collide to form the most luminous ellipticals. Gravitational N -body simulations show that the result is likely to be triaxial, with a ‘boxy’ shape. Indeed, Figure 6.11 shows that boxy systems are the most luminous. But we still have some potentially awkward facts to explain. Astronomers who do not agree that most elliptical galaxies result from merger will point to the fundamental plane of Figure 6.13, relating a galaxy’s luminosity to its core size and central brightness. Why should galaxies merge in such a way as to pro- duce this relation? What is more, a galaxy’s luminosity should depend mainly on the total of stars and gaseous raw material assembled throughout its history, whereas color is sensitive to the metal abundance. So why are the two linked, as Figure 6.19 shows them to be? If the most luminous galaxies are formed by multiple generations of merger, then early in cosmic history they should be very rare indeed. But we will see in Section 9.4 that very luminous red galaxies were fairly common as far back as redshift z ∼ 2, when the Universe was less than 5 Gyr old. These systems contain up to twice the mass of stars that the Milky Way has today. They lack young blue stars or the deep Balmer absorption lines of A stars, so those stars formed at least a gigayear earlier. A few galaxies at z ∼ > 6, when the cosmic age was not even 1 Gyr, already show a strong 4000 ̊ A break. Models such as that in Figure 6.18 tell us that their stars are at least 100 Myr old, while the galaxies appear to have grown to a fifth or more of the Milky Way’s stellar"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"7.4 Intergalactic dark matter: gravitational lensing 303 Fig. 7.13.

If these early galaxies formed by merger, both the merging process and early starbirth must have been far more efficient than either is today. 7.4 Intergalactic dark matter: gravitational lensing Gravity acts on light itself, bending the paths of photons. If we look at two galaxies that are neighbors on the sky, then the light of the more distant system swerves toward the nearer galaxy as it passes by on its way to us. Figure 7.13 shows the cluster Abell 383 at redshift z = 0 . 188. The bright arc curving around the huge cD galaxy is the image of a background galaxy at z = 1 . 01. The gravity of the entire cluster has bent its light, forming multiple images that run together to make up the arc. Another distant galaxy gives rise to the broken arc further out that twists past two fainter cluster members. The cluster’s gravity has deflected more light toward us than we would otherwise receive, so the arcs are brighter than the original sources. They are also distorted and magnified in size. This effect is called gravitational lensing , even though the light is not brought to a focus. Gravitational lensing provides a powerful method to study the dark matter between galaxies, because the effect does not depend on whether a cluster has reached equilibrium, or is still growing and changing.

Lensing allows us to study distant objects that would otherwise be far too faint. Some of the best-studied galaxies at high redshift, such as cB58 in Figure 9.16, are strongly brightened in this way. But we must beware of lensing when taking a census of any type of distant object. 7.4.1 Microlensing: light bent by a compact object The Sun’s bending of light provided one of the first tests of Einstein’s General Relativity. During the total solar eclipse of 1919, an expedition led by Arthur Eddington took photographs of the sky around the obscured Sun. They found that light was bent as shown in Figure 7.14, so that nearby stars appeared to have moved very slightly away from the calculated position of the Sun’s center. Einstein predicted that light passing at distance b from a mass M is bent by an angle α given by α ≈ 4 G M bc 2 = 2 R s b . (7.13) Here R s is the Schwarzschild radius 2 G M / c 2 , about 3 km for an object of the Sun’s mass. The approximation holds as long as the bending is small, with α \u0011 1. This formula prescribes exactly twice the bending that we get by applying Equa- tion 3.51 to particles travelling at speed c . Using this formula, we can calculate where the image of a distant source will appear, if a point object of mass M is placed in front of it to act as a gravitational lens. If the lens L in Figure 7.14 had been absent, we would have seen the star S \u0006 at an angle β on the sky from the direction to L; β ≈ y / d S if the distance d S \u0012 y .

Finally, the impact parameter b = θ d Lens as long as d S \u0012 b . Using Equation 7.13 for α , we divide by d S to find θ − β = α d LS d S = 1 θ 4 G M c 2 d LS d Lens d S ≡ 1 θ θ 2 E ; (7.14) the angle θ E is called the Einstein radius . We have a quadratic equation for the angular distance θ between L and the star’s image: θ 2 − βθ − θ 2 E = 0 , so θ ± = β ± \u0014 β 2 + 4 θ 2 E 2 . (7.15) A star exactly behind the lens, with β = 0, will be seen as a circle of light on the sky, with radius θ E . When β> 0, the image at θ + is further from the lens, with θ + >β , and it lies outside the Einstein radius: θ + >θ E . These exterior images were the ones seen around the eclipsed Sun. The image at θ − is inverted; it lies within the Einstein radius, on the opposite side of the lens. Problem 7.12 Show that, when d Lens = 1AU \u0011 d S , then θ − β ≈ α .

The Sun’s disk has a diameter of 30 \u0006 or 0.5 ◦ ; show that starlight that just grazes the Sun’s surface would be bent by about 2 \u0006\u0006 , making the star appear further from the Sun’s center. Quite regularly, one star in the Milky Way’s bulge is gravitationally lensed by another in the disk. The images θ + and θ − are then too close to distinguish individually. But we can tell that a star is lensed because it appears to become brighter (see below). Because of the small size of the Einstein ring, gravitational lensing by compact objects in the halo of a galaxy is often called microlensing . Problem 7.13 If the lens L is an object of mass M \u0005 at distance d Lens from us, show that the Einstein radius for a star at distance d S = 2 d Lens is θ E = \u0012 R s d Lens ≈ 2 × 10 − 3 \u0012 1 kpc d Lens arcsec .

An image I of S \u0006 occupies the same angle \bφ , but distances from the center are expanded or contracted: x / y = θ/β while \b x /\b y = d θ/ d β .

The closer image, θ − , is dimmer unless β 2 < (3 − 2 √ 2) θ 2 E / √ 2or β< ∼ 0.348 θ E . This also holds when the lens is an extended system such as a galaxy or cluster: at least one of the images is brighter than the source would be without lensing. Problem 7.14 From Equation 7.17, show that A + + A − > A (source): more light reaches us in the two images, taken together, than we would have received from the source S if the lens had been absent.

We can then calculate the bending by summing up the effect of all the mass within the lens. If the lens is compact compared with both the distance d Lens from us and the distance d LS from it to the light source, then the deflection depends only on the surface density \u0017 ( x ) of the lens. In general we must specify the light ray’s closest approach to the cluster’s center by a vector b ; integrating over the cluster gives the vector deflection α : α ( b ) ≡∇ ψ L ( b ) , where ψ L ( b ) = 4 G c 2 \u0002 \u0017 ( b \u0006 )ln | b − b \u0006 | d S \u0006 .

In general we must calculate ψ L ( b ) with a computer, from the distribution of matter given by \u0017 ( b ). But suppose that the lens galaxy or cluster is axisymmetric, so that the surface density depends only on the projected distance R from the center.

(7.20) To prove this, we adapt the arguments that we used in Section 3.1 to show that the gravitational force at distance r from a spherical object is the same as if all the matter at radii less than r had been concentrated at the center of the sphere. Readers who are willing to trust our assertion should skip beyond Equation 7.24 for applications of the result. First, we show that a light ray passing through a uniform circular ring is not bent at all. In Figure 7.16, a ray through point S is pulled in opposite directions by the sections of the ring falling within the cone at A and at B. The sides AO and BO of the triangle AOB are equal; so the angle OAB between the line AB and the normal OA at A is the same as the angle OBA at B. Thus the arcs lying within the narrow cone have lengths (and masses) in the ratio SA/SB. Since the bending is inversely proportional to the distance from S, the deflections by the matter at"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"308 Galaxy groups and clusters a P Q P' Q' P Q P' R R Q' O Fig. 7.17. Gravitational bending of light passing outside a uniform circular ring. A and B are equal and opposite, cancelling each other out. So the ray is not bent; the lensing potential ψ L must be constant inside the ring. It is easiest to calculate ψ L at the center; for a ring of mass M and radius a , ψ L ( R < a ) = 4 G M c 2 ln a . (7.21) Next, we must prove that a ray passing outside the ring is bent in the same way as by a point mass at its center. We use Figure 7.17 to show that the lensing potential ψ L (P) at a point P lying at distance R > a from the center of a uniform ring of mass M is the same as the potential ψ \u0006 L (P \u0006 ) inside a ring of the same mass, but with radius R . In the picture on the left, the mass in an arc \bθ around Q \u0006 contributes an amount \bψ L (P) = 4 G c 2 M \bθ 2 π ln | x (P) − x (Q \u0006 ) | (7.22) to the potential at P. From the picture on the right, the mass within the same wedge at Q contributes to the lensing potential at P \u0006 an amount \bψ \u0006 L (P \u0006 ) = 4 G c 2 M \bθ 2 π · ln | x (P \u0006 ) − x (Q) | . (7.23) But PQ \u0006 = P \u0006 Q, so these are equal; integrating over the whole ring, ψ L (P) = ψ \u0006 L (P \u0006 ) = 4 G M c 2 ln R : (7.24) the bending angle for light passing outside the ring at radius R is the same as if all its mass had been concentrated at the center. So we arrive at Equation 7.20: if the lens is axisymmetric, light is bent just as if all the material projected within that radius had been exactly at the center. We can use Equation 7.20 to find how an axisymmetric galaxy cluster bends the light of a distant galaxy behind it, as in Figure 7.14.

(7.26) The quantity M ( < b ) / ( π b 2 ) is just the average surface density within radius b ; usually the surface density \u0017 ( R ) declines from a peak at the center, so this average will fall as well. If the central density exceeds \u0017 crit , then the image of a source at β = 0, exactly in line with the cluster’s center, will be a thin circular Einstein ring , of angular size θ E = b E / d Lens , where b E is the radius where the average density falls to the critical value: M ( < b E ) π b 2 E = \u0017 crit .

The mass required to account for the positions of the arcs agrees well with what is indicated by the X-ray observations. Disagreement is most common for lumpy clusters, where clumps of galaxies are still falling in and may heat the cluster gas, or where two clumps lie behind each other. The light of the various images reaches us by different paths, and rays that left the source together do not arrive simultaneously.

With more mass at large radii the curve approaches the dotted line θ = β (no bending) much more slowly. the images furthest from the center: those rays have suffered the least bending, and have spent less time in the depths of the potential. Time delays have been measured by observing quasars that vary their light output, so the different images brighten in sequence. The positions and shapes of the images tell us how mass is distributed within the lensing galaxy or cluster. Figure 7.18 shows how we can apply Equation 7.26 to find image positions in the simple cluster models of Equations 7.30 and 7.32. The images of a source directly behind the cluster are a point at θ = 0, and an Einstein ring at the radius θ E where the curve β ( θ ) crosses the axis β = 0. An object close to the center forms three images: one on the same side of the cluster and two on the opposite side. The image nearest to the center is inverted, since d θ/ d β< 0. As the source is taken further from the axis OS, the two images closest to the center move together: as d β/ d θ → 0, at β = β r , they fuse and then disappear. A source further out produces only a single image. The odd-image theorem guarantees that, if the lens has a finite surface density everywhere, then a single source produces an odd number of images. If the galaxy is almost centred behind the cluster, β is small, and Equation 7.17 tells us that its images can be highly magnified and hence very bright. Two of them form arcs near the circle θ = θ E , called the tangential critical curve . If the cluster is not exactly round, these can each split into a number of separate images. Images near the center where θ ≈ 0 will always be faint. When the source is just inside the radius β r , then d β/ d θ → 0, and Equa- tion 7.17 tells us that the image is again extremely luminous.

In the left panel, the cluster has the density of a Plummer sphere, and θ E = √ 5 a P / d Lens . The right panel shows critical points for a cluster with the potential of the dark halo of Equation 2.19. The Einstein radius θ E is larger in relation to θ r than for the Plummer model, because its mass is less concentrated to the center. Problem 7.21 For the Plummer model, show that the surface density (Equa- tion 3.13) drops to half its central value at the core radius r c = 0 . 644 a P . What is r c for the ‘dark halo’ potential of Problem 7.19? Taking the central density to be 2 \u0017 crit , 4 \u0017 crit , and finally 10 \u0017 crit , find the Einstein radius θ E for the Plummer model in units of r c / d Lens . Now do the same for the dark halo. (For a wide range of central density, and for many cluster-like potentials, d Lens θ E is a few times the core radius.) Problem 7.22 In the galaxy cluster Abell 383 of Figure 7.13, a radial arc lies 2 \u0006\u0006 ≈ θ r from the center. The large tangential arc of Figure 7.13 is at 16 \u0006\u0006 ≈ θ E . Find d Lens , assuming H 0 = 70 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 (if you have read Sec- tion 8.3: use the angular size distance d A and the benchmark cosmology). Show that d Lens θ E ∼ 50 kpc; the cluster’s core radius r c will be a few times smaller. From Equation 7.29, show that the mass projected within the tangential arc is M ( <θ E ) ∼ 2 × 10 13 M \u0005 . The luminosity within θ E corresponds to L V ∼ 4 × 10 11 L \u0005 ,so M / L ∼ 50. (A model placing both radial and tangential arcs at the observed positions has r c ≈ 40 kpc; in the X-ray-emitting gas, the core is twice as large.) 7.4.3 Weak gravitational lensing When galaxies lie behind a cluster but well outside its Einstein radius, their images are weakly magnified and slightly stretched in the tangential direction. Figure 7.15 shows why the image of a round galaxy will be an ellipse, with tangential and radial axes in the ratio x / y : \b x /\b y or | d β/ d θ | : | β/θ | . The shear γ measures the difference in the amount that the image has been compressed in the two directions.

Why must we specify θ \u0012 θ E ? Show that, if the surface density \u0017 ( R ) is constant, then we have θ ∝ β . Use Figure 7.15 to explain why images of a round galaxy will be circular: the shear is zero. This mass-sheet degeneracy means that we can always add a uniform sheet of matter to our model cluster without changing the shapes of the images. Measuring the average shape of many galaxies in the background that have been weakly distorted allows us to estimate the shear, and hence the distribution of mass in the outer parts of galaxy clusters. Generally the results agree with what we found from the hot gas. But, for some clusters, weak lensing indicates a higher mass. These may be composites, with one cluster behind the other. Some distant clusters have even been discovered by the signature of their weak lensing alone. Weak lensing has also been used to study the halos of individual bright galax- ies. To do this, we measure the average shape of more distant galaxies that lie close to the nearby lensing system on the sky, and then average these results over many lens-galaxies. Recent studies show that the dark halo of a typical bright elliptical or S0 galaxy, with L ∼ L , extends to at least 200 kpc and has mass ∼ > 10 12 h − 1 M \u0005 ; so the mass-to-light ratio M / L > 50 in solar units. So dark halos are larger and more massive than we were able to show by measuring rotation in the outer parts of disk galaxies. Blue galaxies that are still making stars are brighter for a given dark-halo mass. The halo appears to be slightly aspherical, distorted in the same sense as the galaxy’s stellar body. Unlike galaxies themselves, groups and clusters do not separate cleanly from one another: we will see in the next chapter how they are connected by walls and filaments of luminous galaxies. Weak lensing lets us measure how the dark matter is distributed in this structure, but the calculation is more complex. The light of a distant source is bent many times as it passes by each of these large structures on its way to us, so we cannot make the approximation of Equation 7.19, that all the bending takes place at a single lens-distance d Lens . Instead, we must use computers to calculate it. Further reading: a detailed presentation of gravitational lensing is given by P. Schneider, J. Ehlers, and E. E.

These large surveys have revealed a very surprising picture of the luminous matter in the Uni- verse. Many astronomers had imagined roughly spherical galaxy clusters floating amongst randomly scattered field galaxies, like meatballs in sauce. Instead, they saw galaxies concentrated into enormous walls and long filaments, surrounding huge voids that appear largely empty. The galaxy distribution has been compared to walls of soapy water, surrounding bubbles of air in a basinful of suds; linear filaments appear where the walls of different soap bubbles join, and rich clusters where three or more walls run into each other. A more accurate metaphor is that of a sponge; the voids are interlinked by low-density ‘holes’ in the walls. Sometimes we think of the filaments as forming a cosmic web . For a star like the Sun in the disk of our Milky Way, the task of finding where it formed is essentially hopeless, because it has already made many orbits about the galaxy, and the memory of its birthplace is largely lost. But the large structures that we discuss in this chapter are still under construction, and the regions where mass is presently concentrated reveal where denser material was laid down in the early Universe. The peculiar motions of groups and clusters of galaxies, their speeds relative to the uniformly expanding cosmos, are motions of infall toward larger concentrations of mass. So the problem of understanding the large-scale structure that we see today becomes one of explaining small variations in the density of the early Universe. We begin in Section 8.1 by surveying the galaxies around us, mapping out both the local distribution and the larger structures stretching over hundreds of megaparsecs. The following sections discuss the history of our expanding Uni- verse, within which the observed spongy structures grew, and how the expansion and large-scale curvature affect our observations of galaxies.

Figure 8.1 shows the positions on the sky of almost 15 000 bright galaxies, taken from three different catalogues compiled from optical photographs. Very few of them are seen close to the plane of the Milky Way’s disk at b = 0, and this region is sometimes called the Zone of Avoidance. The term is unfair: surveys in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen, and in far-infrared light, show that galaxies are indeed present, but their visible light is obscured by dust in the Milky Way’s disk. Dense areas on the map mark rich clusters: the Virgo cluster is close to the north Galactic pole, at b = 90 ◦ . Few galaxies are seen in the Local Void, stretching from l = 40 ◦ , b =− 20 ◦ across to l = 0 , b = 30 ◦ . The galaxy clusters themselves are not spread evenly on the sky: those within about 100 Mpc form a rough ellipsoid lying almost perpendicular to the Milky Way’s disk. Its midplane, the supergalactic plane , is well defined in the northern Galactic hemisphere ( b > 0), but becomes rather scruffy in the south. The pole or Z axis of the supergalactic plane points to l = 47 . 4 ◦ , b = 6 . 3 ◦ . We take the supergalactic X direction in the Galactic plane, pointing to l = 137 . 3 ◦ , b = 0, while the Y axis points close to the north Galactic pole at b = 90 ◦ , so that Y ≈ 0 along the Zone of Avoidance. The supergalactic plane is close to the Great Circle through Galactic longitude l = 140 ◦ and l = 320 ◦ , shown as a heavy line in Figure 8.1. It passes through the Ursa Major group of Figures 5.6 and 5.8, and the four nearby galaxy clusters described in Section 7.2; the Virgo cluster at right ascension α = 12 h , declination δ = 12 ◦ ; Perseus at α = 3 h , δ = 40 ◦ ; Fornax at α = 4 h , δ =− 35 ◦ ; and the Coma cluster at α = 13 h , δ = 28 ◦ , almost at the north Galactic pole. Figure 8.2 shows the positions of the elliptical galaxies within about 20 Mpc, tracing out the Virgo and Fornax clusters.

Positions of nearby elliptical galaxies on the supergalactic X – Y plane; the origin is the Milky Way. Shading indicates recession velocity V r – J. Tonry. So the surface brightness of any square fluctuates about some average value. The closer the galaxy, the fewer stars lie within each square, and the stronger the fluctuations between neighboring squares: when N is large, the fractional variation is proportional to 1 / √ N . So if we measure the surface brightness fluctuations in two galaxies where we know the relative luminosity of the bright stars that emit most of the light, we can find their relative distances. This method works only for relatively nearby galaxies in which the stars are at least 3–5 Gyr old. In these, nearly all the light comes from stars close to the tip of the red giant branch. As we noted in Section 1.1, these have almost the same luminosity for all stars below about 2 M \u0005 . These stars are old enough that they have made many orbits around the center, so they are dispersed smoothly through the galaxy.

The technique fails for spiral galaxies, because their brightest stars are younger: they are red supergiants and the late stages of intermediate-mass stars, and their luminosity depends on the stellar mass, and so on the average age of the stellar population. Since that average changes across the face of the galaxy, so does the luminosity of those bright stars. Also, the luminous stars are too short- lived to move far from the stellar associations where they formed. Their clumpy distribution causes much stronger fluctuations in the galaxy’s surface brightness than those from random variations in the number of older stars. In Figure 8.2, we see that the Virgo cluster is roughly 16 Mpc away. It appears to consist of two separate pieces, which do not coincide exactly with the two velocity clumps around the galaxies M87 and M49 that we discussed in Section 7.2. Here, galaxies in the northern part of the cluster, near M49, lie mainly in the nearer grouping, while those in the south near M86 are more distant; M87 lies between the two clumps. The Fornax cluster, in the south with Y < 0, is at about the same distance as Virgo. Both these clusters are part of larger complexes of galaxies. Because galaxy groups contain relatively few ellipticals, they do not show up well in this figure. The Local Group is represented only by the elliptical and dwarf elliptical companions of M31, as the overlapping circles just to the right of the origin. Problem 8.1 In Section 4.5 we saw that the motions of the Milky Way and M31 indicate that the Local Group’s mass exceeds 3 × 10 12 M \u0005 : taking its radius as 1 Mpc, what is its average density? Show that this is only about 3 h − 2 of the critical density ρ crit defined in Equation 1.30 – the Local Group is only just massive enough to collapse on itself. Problem 8.2 The free-fall time t ff = 1 / √ G ρ of Equation 3.23 provides a rough estimate of the time taken for a galaxy or cluster to grow to density ρ .In Problem 4.7 we saw that, for the Milky Way, with average density of 10 5 ρ crit within the Sun’s orbit, this minimum time is ∼ 3 × 10 8 years or 0 . 03 × t H , the expansion age given by Equation 1.28. Show that a cluster of galaxies with den- sity 200 ρ crit can barely collapse within the age of the Universe. This density divides structures like the Local Group that are still collapsing from those that might have settled into an equilibrium. To probe further afield, we use a ‘wedge diagram’ like Figure 8.3 from the 2dF survey, which measured redshifts of galaxies in two large slices across the sky. If we ignore peculiar motions, Equation 1.27 tells us that the recession speed V r ≈ cz ≈ H 0 d , where H 0 is the Hubble constant; the redshift is roughly proportional to the galaxy’s distance d from our position at the apex of each wedge.

Between the filaments we find large regions that are almost empty of bright galaxies: these voids are typically ∼ > 50 h − 1 Mpc across. The galaxies appear to thin out beyond z = 0 . 15 because redshifts were measured only for objects that exceeded a fixed apparent brightness. Figure 8.4 shows that, at large distances, just the rarest and most luminous systems have been included.

The extra mass in a wall or filament attracts nearby galaxies in front of the structure, pulling them toward it and away from us. So the radial velocities of those objects are increased above that of the cosmic expansion, and we overestimate their distances, placing them further from us and closer to the wall. Conversely, galaxies behind the wall are pulled in our direction, reducing their redshifts; these systems appear nearer to us and closer to the wall than they really are. In fact, the walls are only a few times denser than the local average. By contrast, dense clusters of galaxies appear elongated in the direction toward the observer. The cores of these clusters have completed their collapse, and galax- ies are packed tightly together in space. They orbit each other with speeds as large as 1500 km s − 1 , so their distances inferred from Equation 1.27 can have random errors of 15 h − 1 Mpc. In a wedge diagram, rich clusters appear as dense ‘fingers’ that point toward the observer. Problem 8.4 How long is the narrow ‘finger’ in the left panel of Figure 8.5 near z = 0 . 12 and 12 h 30 m ?

These are luminous galaxies, with − 21 < M ( B J ) < − 19. The elliptical and S0 galaxies cluster more strongly than the spiral-like systems. of young massive stars and the ionized gas around them. In Figure 8.4 we see clumps of galaxies around 13 h 20 m at z = 0 . 05, 0.08, 0.11, and 0.15. These are quite clear in the left wedge of Figure 8.5, but much weaker in the right wedge. Similarly, the void at 12 h and z = 0 . 08 is emptier in the left wedge – why? The left-wing galaxies are red elliptical and S0 systems, while on the right are spirals and irregulars. As we saw in Section 7.2, elliptical galaxies live communally in the cores of rich clusters, where spiral galaxies are rare. Accordingly, the clustering of the red galaxies is stronger than that of the bluer systems of the right panel. Whether galaxies are spiral or elliptical is clearly related to how closely packed they are: we see a morphology–density relation . In fact, we should not talk simply of ‘the distribution of galaxies’, but must be careful to specify which galaxies we are looking at. We never see all the galaxies in a given volume; our surveys are always biassed by the way we choose systems for observation. For example, if we select objects that are large enough on the sky that they appear fuzzy and hence distinctly nonstellar, we will omit the most compact galaxies. A survey that finds galaxies by detecting the 21 cm radio emission of their neutral hydrogen gas will readily locate optically dim but gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies, but will miss the luminous ellipticals which usually lack H I gas. The Malmquist bias of Problem 2.11 is present in any sample selected by apparent magnitude. Even more insidious are the ways in which the bias changes with redshift and apparent brightness. Mapping even the luminous matter of the Universe is no easy task."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"322 The large-scale distribution of galaxies 8.1.1 Measures of galaxy clustering One way to describe the tendency of galaxies to cluster together is the two-point correlation function ξ ( r ). If we make a random choice of two small volumes \b V 1 and \b V 2 , and the average spatial density of galaxies is n per cubic megaparsec, then the chance of finding a galaxy in \b V 1 is just n \b V 1 . If galaxies tend to clump together, then the probability that we then also have a galaxy in \b V 2 will be greater when the separation r 12 between the two regions is small. We write the joint probability of finding a particular galaxy in both volumes as \b P = n 2 [1 + ξ ( r 12 )] \b V 1 \b V 2 ; (8.1) if ξ ( r ) > 0 at small r , then galaxies are clustered, whereas if ξ ( r ) < 0, they tend to avoid each other. We generally compute ξ ( r ) by estimating the distances of galaxies from their redshifts, making a correction for the distortion introduced by peculiar velocities. On scales r ∼ < 10 h − 1 Mpc, it takes roughly the form ξ ( r ) ≈ ( r / r 0 ) − γ , (8.2) with γ> 0. When r < r 0 , the correlation length , the probability of finding one galaxy within radius r of another is significantly larger than for a strictly random distribution. Since ξ ( r ) represents the deviation from an average density, it must at some point become negative as r increases. Figure 8.6 shows the two-point correlation function ξ ( r ) for galaxies in the 2dF survey. The correlation length r 0 ≈ 5 h − 1 Mpc; it is 6 h − 1 Mpc for the ellipticals, which are more strongly clustered, and smaller for the star-forming galaxies. The slope γ ≈ 1 . 7 around r 0 .For r ∼ > 50 h − 1 Mpc, which is roughly the size of the largest wall or void features, ξ ( r ) oscillates around zero: the galaxy distribution is fairly uniform on larger scales. Unfortunately, the correlation function is not very useful for describing the one-dimensional filaments or two-dimensional walls of Figure 8.3. If our volume \b V 1 lies in one of these, the probability of finding a galaxy in \b V 2 is high only when it also lies within the structure. Since ξ ( r ) is an average over all possible placements of \b V 2 , it will not rise far above zero once the separation r exceeds the thickness of the wall or filament. We can try to overcome this by defining the three-point and four-point correlation functions, which give the joint probability of finding that number of galaxies with particular separations; but this is not very satisfactory. We do not yet have a good statistical method to describe the strength and prevalence of walls and filaments.

Left, the correlation function ξ ( s ) for the 2dF galaxies, at small (circles, left logarithmic scale) and large (triangles, right linear scale) separations; vertical bars show uncertainties. ξ ( s ) is calculated assuming that Hubble’s law holds exactly: the ‘fingers’ of Figure 8.5 reduce ξ ( s ) on scales r ∼ < 1 Mpc, but infall to the walls makes clustering look stronger on scales near r 0 . The dashed line shows ξ ( r ), corrected for these effects. Right, the variance σ R of Equation 8.4, describing how much the average density varies between regions of size R – S. Maddox and S. Cole. Since ξ ( r ) is dimensionless, P ( k ) has the dimensions of a volume. The func- tion sin( kr ) / kr is positive for | kr | <π , and it oscillates with decreasing amplitude as kr becomes large; so, very roughly, P ( k ) will have its maximum when k − 1 is close to the radius where ξ ( r ) drops to zero. In Figure 8.17 we show P ( k ) cal- culated by combining the 2dF galaxy survey with observations of the cosmic microwave background. Problem 8.5 Prove the last equality of Equation 8.3. One method is to write the volume integral for P ( k ) in spherical polar coordinates r ,θ,φ and set k · r = kr cos θ . Show that, because ξ ( r ) describes departures from the mean density, Equation 8.1 gives \u0007 ∞ 0 ξ ( r ) r 2 d r = 0, and hence P ( k ) → 0as k → 0. Problem 8.6 Show that the power spectrum P ( k ) ∝ k n corresponds to a corre- lation function ξ ( r ) ∝ r − (3 + n ) . Hence γ ≈ 1 . 5 implies n ≈− 1 . 5. Figure 8.17 shows that when k is large P ( k ) declines roughly as k − 1 . 8 , about as expected. Another way to describe the non-uniformity of the galaxy distribution is to ask how likely we are to find a given deviation from the average density. We can write the local density at position x as a multiple of the mean level ̄ ρ ,as ρ ( x ) = ̄ ρ [1 + δ ( x )], and let δ R be the fractional deviation δ ( x ) averaged within a sphere of radius R .

Its variance σ 2 R = δ 2 R \u000b measures how clumpy the galaxy distribution is on this scale. We can relate it to k 3 P ( k ), the dimensionless number prescribing the fluctuation in density within a volume k − 1 Mpc in radius. If clumps of galaxies with size k − 1 ≈ R are placed randomly in relation to those on larger or smaller scales (the random-phase hypothesis), we have σ 2 R ≈ k 3 P ( k ) 2 π 2 ≡ \b 2 k ; so, if P ( k ) ∝ k n , then σ R ∝ R − ( n + 3) / 2 . (8.4) Thus, if n > − 3, the Universe is lumpiest on small scales. Figure 8.6 shows σ R (or \b k ) for the 2dF galaxies. It increases with k : the smaller the region we consider, the greater the probability of finding a very high density of galaxies. We often parametrize the clustering by σ 8 , the average fluc- tuation on a scale R = 8 h − 1 Mpc: Figure 8.6 shows that σ 8 ≈ 0 . 9. The wiggles at k ∼ 0 . 1 correspond to the ‘baryon oscillations’ that influence the cosmic back- ground radiation: see Section 8.5. If P ( k ) ∝ k n and σ ( M ) is the variance in density over a region containing a mass M ≈ 4 π R 3 ̄ ρ/ 3, then, since M ∝ R 3 ,wehave σ ( M ) ∝ M − ( n + 3) / 6 . Cosmological models for the development of structure can predict P ( k ); we return to this topic in Section 8.5. Problem 8.7 The quantity \b 2 k \u000b 1 / 2 gives the expected fractional deviation | δ ( x ) | from the mean density in an overdense or diffuse region of size 1 / k . Write δ ( x ) and \u0010 ( x ) as Fourier transforms and use Equation 3.9, Poisson’s equation, to show that these lumps and voids cause fluctuations \b\u0010 k in the gravitational potential, where k 2 | \b\u0010 k |∼ 4 π G ̄ ρ \b 2 k \u000b 1 / 2 . Show that, when P ( k ) ∝ k , the Harrison–Zel’dovich spectrum, | \b\u0010 k | does not depend on k : the potential is equally ‘rippled’ on all spatial scales. In this section we have seen that the present-day distribution of galaxies is very lumpy and inhomogeneous on scales up to 50 h − 1 Mpc. But measurements of the cosmic background radiation show that its temperature is the same in all parts of the sky to within a few parts in 100 000. As we saw in Section 1.5, before the time of recombination when z = z rec ≈ 1100, the cosmos was largely filled with ionized gas. Since light could not stream freely through the charged particles, the gas was opaque and glowing like a giant neon tube. The Universe became largely neutral and transparent only after recombination. Because the cosmic background radiation is smooth today, we know that the matter and radiation were quite smoothly distributed at that time. How could our present highly structured Universe of galaxies have arisen from such uniform beginnings? To understand what might have happened, we must look at how the Universe expanded following the Big Bang, and how concentrations of galaxies could form within it."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"8.2 Expansion of a homogeneous Universe 325 8.2 Expansion of a homogeneous Universe Because the cosmic background radiation is highly uniform, we infer that the Universe is isotropic – it is the same in all directions. We believe that on a large scale the cosmos is also homogeneous – it would look much the same if we lived in any other galaxy. Then, mathematics tells us that the length s of a path linking any two points at time t must be given by integrating the expression \b s 2 = R 2 \u0003 \bσ 2 1 − k σ 2 + σ 2 \bθ 2 + σ 2 sin 2 θ\bφ 2 \u0004 , (8.5) where σ, φ, θ are spherical polar coordinates in a curved space . The origin σ = 0 looks like a special point, but in fact it is not. Just as at the Earth’s poles where lines of longitude converge, the curvature here is the same as everywhere else, and we can equally well take any point to be σ = 0. The constant k specifies the curvature of space. For k = 1, the Universe is closed , with positive curvature and finite volume, analogous to the surface of a sphere; R is the radius of curvature. If k =− 1, we have an open Universe, a negatively curved space of infinite volume, while k = 0 describes familiar unbounded flat space. Near the origin, where σ \u0011 1, the formula for \b s is almost the same for all values of k ; on a small enough scale, curvature does not matter. If we look at a tiny region, the relationships among angles, lengths, and volumes will be the same as they are in flat space. We can call the comoving coordinate σ of Equation 8.5 an ‘area radius’, because at time t the area of a sphere around the origin at radius σ is A ( σ, t ) = 4 π R 2 σ 2 . (8.6) Problem 8.8 In ordinary three-dimensional space, using cylindrical polar coor- dinates we can write the distance between two nearby points ( R ,θ, z ) and ( R + \b R ,θ + \bθ, z + \b z )as \b s 2 = \b R 2 + R 2 \bθ 2 + \b z 2 . The equation R 2 + z 2 = R 2 describes a sphere of radius R : show that, if our points lie on this sphere, then the distance between them is \b s 2 = \b R 2 (1 + R 2 / z 2 ) + R 2 \bθ 2 = R 2 \u0003 \bσ 2 1 − σ 2 + σ 2 \bθ 2 \u0004 , (8.7) where σ = R / R . Integrate from a point P, at radius R and with z > 0, to the ‘north pole’ at z = R to show that the distance s = R arcsin σ . Show that the circumference 2 π R of the ‘circle of latitude’ through P is always larger than 2 π s , but approaches it when s \u0011 R . When k = 1 in Equation 8.5, any surface of constant φ is the surface of a sphere of radius R . The cosmic expansion is described by setting R = R ( t ), allowing the radius of curvature to grow with time. Apart from their small peculiar speeds, galaxies"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"326 The large-scale distribution of galaxies remain at points with fixed values of σ, φ, θ ; so these are called comoving coordinates . The separation d of two galaxies is just the length s of the short- est path between them. So, if they stay at fixed comoving coordinates, d expands proportionally to R ( t ): Hubble’s law is just one symptom of the expansion of curved space. Equation 8.5 tells us that the two systems are carried away from each other at a speed V r = ̇ d = ̇ R ( t ) R ( t ) d ≡ H ( t ) d . (8.8) Here H ( t )isthe Hubble parameter , which at present has the value H 0 . Equation 8.8 describes the average motion of the galaxies; we defer discussion of the peculiar motions that develop from the gravitational pull of near neighbors until Section 8.4 below. General Relativity tells us that the distance between two events happening at different times and in different places depends on the motion of the observer. But all observers will measure the same proper time τ along a path through space and time connecting the events, which is found by integrating \bτ 2 = \b t 2 − \b s 2 / c 2 . (8.9) Light rays always travel along paths of zero proper time, \bτ = 0. If we place ourselves at the origin of coordinates, then the light we receive from a galaxy at comoving distance σ e has followed the radial path c \b t R ( t ) =− \bσ √ 1 − k σ 2 . (8.10) The light covers less comoving distance per unit of time as the scale length R ( t ) of the Universe grows. We can integrate this equation for a wavecrest that sets off at time t e , arriving at our position now at time t 0 : c \u0002 t 0 t e d t R ( t ) = \u0002 σ e 0 d σ √ 1 − k σ 2 . (8.11) Suppose that another wavecrest sets off later, by a time \b t e . We receive it at time t 0 + \b t , given by the same equation with the new departure and arrival times. The galaxy’s comoving position σ e , and the integral on the right-hand side of Equation 8.11, have not changed. So the left-hand side also stays constant: \u0002 t 0 + \b t t e + \b t e d t R ( t ) = \u0002 t 0 t e d t R ( t ) , so \b t e R ( t e ) = \b t R ( t 0 ) , (8.12) as long as \b t \u0011 R ( t ) / ̇ R ( t ).

So the wavelength grows along with the scale length R ( t ), while the frequency, momentum, and energy of each photon decay proportionally to 1 / R ( t ). The measured redshift z of a distant galaxy tells us how much expansion has taken place since the time t e when its light set off on its journey to us. This is the cosmological redshift of Equation 1.34: 1 + z = λ obs λ e = R ( t 0 ) R ( t e ) . (8.13) We often use redshift z ( t ) as a substitute for time t e or comoving distance σ e . The time t e corresponding to a given redshift depends on how fast the Universe has expanded, while Equation 8.11 tells us the comoving distance σ e from which the light would have started. The rate at which the Universe expands is set by the gravitational pull of matter and energy within it. We first use Newtonian physics to calculate the expansion, and then discuss how General Relativity modifies the result. Consider a small sphere of radius r , at a time t when our homogeneous Universe has density ρ ( t ); we take r \u0011 R ( t ), so that we can neglect the curvature of space. Everything is symmetric about the origin r = 0, so we appeal to Newton’s first theorem in Section 3.1: the gravitational force at radius r is determined only by the mass M ( < r ) within the sphere. If our sphere is large enough that gas pressure forces are much smaller than the pull of gravity (see Section 8.5 below), then Equation 3.20 gives the force on a gas cloud of mass m at that radius: m d 2 r d t 2 =− Gm M ( < r ) r 2 =− 4 π Gm 3 ρ ( t ) r . (8.14) Our sphere of matter is expanding along with the rest of the Universe, so its radius r ( t ) ∝ R ( t ). The mass m of the cloud cancels out, giving ̈ R ( t ) =− 4 π G 3 ρ ( t ) R ( t ); (8.15) the higher the density, the more strongly gravity slows the expansion. Nothing enters or leaves our sphere, so the mass within it does not change: ρ ( t ) R 3 ( t ) is constant. Multiplying by ̇ R ( t ) tells us how the kinetic energy decreases as the sphere expands: 1 2 d d t [ ̇ R 2 ( t )] =− 4 π G 3 ρ ( t 0 ) R 3 ( t 0 ) R 2 ( t ) ̇ R ( t ) , (8.16) where the time t 0 refers to the present day. Integrating, we have ̇ R 2 ( t ) = 8 π G 3 ρ ( t ) R 2 ( t ) − kc 2 , (8.17)"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"328 The large-scale distribution of galaxies where k is a constant of integration. Although we derived it using Newtonian theory, Equation 8.17 is also correct in General Relativity, which tells us that the constant k is the same one as in Equation 8.5. According to thermodynamics, as heat \b Q flows into a volume V its internal energy E must increase, or it expands and does work against pressure: \b Q = \b E + p \b V = V \b ( ρ c 2 ) + ( ρ c 2 + p ) \b V , (8.18) where the density ρ includes all forms of matter and energy. The cosmos is uniform, so no volume V gains heat at the expense of another: \b Q = 0 = \bρ + * ρ + p c 2 + \b V V , or d ρ d t =− 3 ̇ R ( t ) R ( t ) * ρ + p c 2 + . (8.19) Differentiating Equation 8.17 and substituting for d ρ/ d t yields ̈ R ( t ) =− 4 π G 3 R ( t ) \u000b ρ ( t ) + 3 p ( t ) c 2 \f . (8.20) This change to Equation 8.15 shows that, in General Relativity, the pressure p adds to the gravitational attraction. Equations 8.17 and 8.20 describe the Friedmann models , telling us how the contents of the Universe determine its expansion. For cool matter, the pressure p ∼ ρ c 2 s , where the sound speed c s \u0011 c .So we can safely neglect the pressure term in Equation 8.20, and Equation 8.19 tells us that the density follows ρ ( t ) ∝ R − 3 ( t ). For radiation, and particles moving almost at the speed of light, pressure is important: p ≈ ρ c 2 / 3, where ρ is the energy density divided by c 2 .Wehave ρ ( t ) ∝ R − 4 ( t ) from Equation 8.19. For any mixture of matter and radiation, the term ρ + 3 p / c 2 must be positive, so the expansion always slows down . While matter and radiation account for most of the energy, ρ ( t ) R 2 ( t ) decreases as R ( t ) grows. Thus, in a closed Universe with k = 1, the right-hand side of Equation 8.17 becomes negative at large R . But ̇ R 2 cannot be negative, so the distance between galaxies cannot grow forever; R ( t ) attains some maximum before shrinking again. If the Universe is open with k ≥ 0, the expansion will never halt. General Relativity also allows a vacuum energy , with constant density ρ VA C = \u0003/ (8 π G ). Since ρ VA C does not change, the rightmost term of Equation 8.19 must also be zero, so the pressure p VA C =− \u0003 c 2 / (8 π G ). Instead of a pressure pushing inwards on the contents of our sphere, this term represents a tension pulling outwards. The vacuum energy contributes a positive term to the right- hand side of Equation 8.20, speeding up the expansion. If the Universe expands far enough, the vacuum energy must become the largest term, and R ( t ) then grows exponentially."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"8.2 Expansion of a homogeneous Universe 329 Problem 8.9 By substituting into Equation 8.20, show that, when vacuum energy dominates the expansion, we have R ( t ) ∝ exp( t √ \u0003/ 3). There are reasons to believe that very early, at t ∼ < 10 − 32 s, ρ VA C might have been much larger than the density of matter or radiation. During this period, R ( t ) inflated , growing exponentially by a factor ∼ e 70 ≈ 10 30 . The almost uniform cosmos that we now observe would have resulted from the expansion of a tiny near-homogeneous region. Because this patch was so small, the curvature of space within it would have been negligible; hence devotees of inflation expect our present Universe to be nearly flat, with k = 0. We will see in Section 8.4 that the measured temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation imply that this is in fact so. Further reading: for a discussion of the physics behind inflation, see Chapter 11 of Ryden’s Introduction to Cosmology . In the borderline case when space is flat and k = 0, Equation 8.17 requires that the density ρ is equal to the critical value ρ ( t ) = ρ crit ( t ) ≡ 3 H 2 ( t ) 8 π G . (8.21) At the present day, the critical density ρ crit ( t 0 ) = 3 . 3 × 10 11 h 2 M \u0005 Mpc − 3 .We can measure the mass content of the Universe as a fraction of this critical density, defining the density parameter \u0002 ( t )as \u0002 ( t ) ≡ ρ ( t ) /ρ crit ( t ) , (8.22) and writing \u0002 0 for its present-day value. Equation 8.17 then becomes H 2 ( t )[1 − \u0002 ( t )] =− kc 2 / R 2 ( t ) . (8.23) If the Universe is closed, with k = 1, then \u0002 ( t ) > 1 and the density always exceeds the critical value, whereas if k =− 1, we always have \u0002 ( t ) < 1. If the density is now equal to the critical value, then Equation 8.23 tells us that \u0002 ( t ) must be unity at all times. The present value \u0002 ( t 0 ) is often written as \u0002 tot or (especially when \u0003 = 0) as \u0002 0 . We already saw in Section 1.5 that normal (baryonic) matter, largely neutrons and protons, makes up only 4%–5% of the critical density. Including the dark matter, in Section 8.4 below we arrive at only (0 . 2 − 0 . 3) ρ crit . Radiation contributes hardly anything. So space can be flat only if there is a nonzero vacuum energy.

A warning: although \u0002 m , \u0002 \u0003 , and similar quantities do not carry the subscript 0, they always refer to the present day. After inflation ended, the Universe was radiation-dominated . It was so extremely hot that its energy was almost entirely due to radiation and relativistic particles, moving so close to light speed that their energy, momentum, and pres- sure are related in the same way as for photons. From Equation 8.19, we know that the energy density ρ r c 2 is proportional to R − 4 ( t ).

Show that Equation 8.26 then implies that H ( t ) = ̇ a / a ∝ a − 2 ,so ̇ a ∝ 1 / a ( t ); hence R ( t ) ∝ t 1 / 2 , and H ( t ) = 1 / (2 t ). Early on, the leftmost term of Equation 8.25 is tiny, so H 2 ( t ) ≈ 8 π G ρ ( t ) / 3: show that the temperature T ( t ) is given by Equation 1.38.

According to this model, we live during that small fraction of cosmic history in which normal gravity and the cosmological constant have roughly equal influence on the expansion. At z ≥ 1, the \u0003 term hardly affects the expansion, whereas when R ( t ) ≥ 2 R ( t 0 ), the gravitational pull of matter will become irrelevant. Problem 8.13 Show that, when cool matter accounts for most of the energy density, and the Universe is flat with k = 0, we have ̇ a ∝ a − 1 / 2 , and a ( t ) ∝ t 2 / 3 .

If the curvature is negative, with \u0002 tot = \u0002 r + \u0002 m + \u0002 \u0003 < 1, the third term of Equation 8.26 exceeds the second when 1 + z < (1 − \u0002 tot ) /\u0002 m . Expansion then proceeds almost at a constant speed, with a ( t ) ∝ t ; it is barely slowed by the matter, and not accelerated by dark energy until (1 + z ) 2 <\u0002 \u0003 / (1 − \u0002 tot ). Equation 8.27 is a good description of the expansion over much of cosmic history. In particular, most of the structure of galaxy clusters and voids that we see today developed after the Universe became matter-dominated, but before the dark energy became important. Problem 8.14 Even if the cosmos has infinite volume, we can observe only a finite part of it because light travels at a finite speed. From Equation 8.11, light reaching us at time t has travelled no further than the distance σ H given by c \u0002 t 0 d t \u0006 R ( t \u0006 ) ≡ \u0002 σ H 0 d σ √ 1 − k σ 2 , (8.28) so we cannot see beyond our horizon , at comoving radius σ H . Explain why only points within σ H ( t ) of each other can exchange signals or particles before time t . Use Equation 8.27 to show that, while the Universe was matter-dominated, R ( t ) σ H ≈ 3 ct ; at the time t rec of recombination R ( t rec ) σ H ≈ 0 . 43 Mpc in the benchmark model of Figure 8.7. We will see below that a sphere of matter with this diameter would cover only about 2 ◦ on the sky. So it is very surprising that the cosmic microwave background has almost the same spectrum across the whole sky. An inflationary cosmology can explain this horizon problem .

After inflation, the Universe is radiation-dominated, so a ( t ) ∝ t 1 / 2 . Show that, by the time of matter–radiation equality at ∼ 0 . 35 Myr, this distance has grown by z ( t eq ) / z ( t f ) to about 30 Gpc. Inflation expands a region within which light signals could be exchanged, until it is much larger than the entire Universe that we can see today.

Lookback times and ages Because light travels at a finite speed, we see a younger cosmos as we look toward more distant galaxies at higher redshifts. As we observe a galaxy at redshift z ,at what time t e did those photons leave on their journey toward us? Equation 8.13 tells us that they arrive today at time t 0 with redshift 1 + z = R ( t 0 ) / R ( t e ). Light from another galaxy at a smaller redshift z − \b z must have been emitted slightly later by a small interval \b t e , when R ( t e ) was larger by \b R = ̇ R ( t e ) \b t e . Since \b z =− \b R R ( t 0 ) R 2 ( t e ) , we have \b t e =− 1 H ( t e ) \b z 1 + z , (8.30) where H ( t ) ≡ ̇ R ( t ) / R ( t ) is the Hubble parameter.

Because of the expansion, distant galaxies look bigger than we would expect: at redshifts z larger than 1 /\u0002 m a given object covers more of the sky when it is further from us. But the starlight of these big galaxies is rapidly dimmed as it spreads out in the expanding cosmos. Their ultraviolet and visible light is also shifted into the infrared, where strong emission lines from the Earth’s atmosphere (see Figure 1.15) make it more difficult to observe from the ground. To estimate how densely galaxies are scattered through space, we need to take account of both cosmic expansion and the curvature of space. 8.3.1 Luminosity, size, and surface brightness For nearby objects, the apparent brightness F of a star or galaxy at distance d is related to its luminosity L by F = L / (4 π d 2 ) . (1.1) In an expanding Universe, this no longer holds. Objects appear dimmer because the cosmic expansion saps photons of their energy, and the area of the sphere over which the light rays must spread is expanding. This is just as well, because in a homogeneous static cosmos the light of distant stars would accumulate without limit, making the sky bright everywhere: this is Olbers’ paradox . Problem 8.18 Suppose that galaxies of luminosity L are spread uniformly through space. Show that the number N ( > F ) that you observe to have apparent brightness larger than F varies as F − 3 / 2 , while the number between F and F + \b F varies as N ( F ) ∝ F − 5 / 2 .

Show that the total light from all galaxies that appear brighter than F is proportional to \u0007 ∞ F FN ( F )d F . Whenever N ( F ) rises faster than 1 / F as F → 0, this grows without limit as F decreases. To see how we should modify Equation 1.1, let σ e be the comoving distance or ‘area radius’ of a galaxy G that we observe today with redshift z . The apparent brightness of a distant galaxy is diminished by one power of 1 + z because each photon carries less energy, and by another because those photons arrive at a slower rate. The left panel of Figure 8.9 shows that G’s light is now spread over a sphere with area 4 π R 2 ( t 0 ) σ 2 e . The flux of energy F that we receive, in W m − 2 , is related to the total or bolometric luminosity L by F = L 4 π R 2 ( t 0 ) σ 2 e (1 + z ) 2 ≡ L 4 π d 2 L , where d L = (1 + z ) R ( t 0 ) σ e .

The right panel of Figure 8.9 shows that, at time t e , it covered a fraction D / [2 π R ( t e ) σ e ] of the circumference of the sky. So it extends over an angle α (in radians) = D R ( t e ) σ e ≡ D d A , so d A = R ( t e ) σ e = R ( t 0 ) σ e 1 + z .

Right, the fraction of the total light within this radius. At small redshifts, the exponential disk shrinks less than the spheroid, but when z ∼ > 1 it is more strongly affected. Problem 8.19 Show that a galaxy of known luminosity L and diameter D at redshift z will appear larger by a factor of (1 + z ) 2 than one would expect by using Equation 1.1 to calculate its distance from its measured apparent brightness, and then finding the apparent diameter from Equation 1.2. The surface brightness I ( x ) of a galaxy is the flux we receive from each square arcsecond as it appears on the sky.

If we neglect changes caused by the birth of new stars or by stellar aging, then a given isophote always corresponds to a fixed radius in the galaxy, and encloses the same fraction of the galaxy’s light, regardless of the distance. But at redshifts beyond a few tenths I ( x ) drops rapidly, making photometry increasingly difficult and expensive. Figure 8.10 shows how an isophote defined by a fixed surface brightness shrinks, and the amount of light within it decreases.

We can interpret the brightening with models to tell us how the light of new stars should fade through time; Figure 6.18 illustrates a simple model in which all the galaxy’s stars are born at once. To turn this into a prediction about luminosity at a given redshift, we need Equation 8.31, which involves the expansion rate H ( z ) as well as the redshift. To calculate the distances d L and d A to a galaxy G seen at redshift z , we must know its comoving ‘area’ distance σ e . We start by asking how far its light must go to reach us. According to Equation 8.5, at time t the distance from the origin to a point with area radius σ is R ( t ) χ ≡ \u0002 σ 0 d s = R ( t ) \u0002 σ 0 d σ \u0006 √ 1 − k σ \u0006 2 .

(8.39) The two distances are the same if the Universe is flat, with k = 0. In a closed Universe, with k = 1, the area radius σ is smaller than the distance radius χ , just as the length of a circle of latitude on the Earth is less than 2 π times the distance to the pole. Conversely, if k =− 1, and the Universe is open, we have σ>χ : the perimeter of a circle, or the area of a sphere, is larger than we would expect, compared with the distance from the center to its boundary. Moving at light speed, in time \b t galaxy G’s light travels a distance c \b t = R ( t ) \bχ toward us.

Cosmic expansion changes a galaxy’s color: when we observe in a particular waveband, the light we now see was radiated in a bluer part of the spectrum. Suppose that, at time t e , a galaxy that we see at redshift z has luminosity L λ ( λ, t e ) \bλ in the wavelength range from λ to λ + \bλ . The apparent brightness F BP in a bandpass BP that transmits all the light between wavelengths λ 1 and λ 2 is given by Equation 8.35, if we take the luminosity L to be the energy emitted at wavelengths that will pass through our bandpass when we receive it.

From Equation 8.44, we have k BP ( z ) ≡ 2 . 5 log 10 (1 + z ) − 2 . 5 log 10 ! \u0007 λ 2 λ 1 L λ [ λ/ (1 + z ) , t 0 ]d λ \u0007 λ 2 λ 1 L λ ( λ, t 0 )d λ \" , (8.46) where L λ ( λ, t 0 ) is the present-day spectrum. Of course, we cannot measure the spectrum of a distant galaxy as it is today; that light is still on its way to us. But we can calculate how a present-day galaxy would appear if we observed it at a redshift z . Figure 8.12 shows that, if we observe in the B band at 4400 ̊ A, an elliptical galaxy will dim rapidly as its redshift increases, since our passband moves into the ultraviolet region where its stars emit little light. A starburst galaxy will fade much less, because its hot young stars are bright at short wavelengths. At z ∼ < 1 both galaxies fade much less in the red light of the I band at 8000 ̊ A than in the B band. So the B − I color becomes progressively redder at higher redshift. At redshifts z ∼ > 2, the light of both galaxies has largely moved into the infrared region. Problem 8.24 If a galaxy emits a spectrum L ν ∝ ν − α , show that L λ ∝ λ α − 2 , and that k ( z ) = ( α − 1) × 2 . 5 log 10 (1 + z ). The k correction is zero if ν L ν is nearly constant so that α ≈ 1, as it is for many quasars (see Section 9.1). When the spectrum declines more rapidly than L ν ∝ ν − 1 toward high frequencies, k ( z ) > 0, and the object appears dimmer. A photometric redshift is an estimate of a galaxy’s redshift made by comparing its apparent brightness in several bandpasses with that predicted by a diagram like Figure 8.12. For example, an elliptical galaxy at z ∼ 0 . 5 has already become very red in the B − I color, but it is less so in V − I .At z ∼ 1, it is fading rapidly in the I band, so the I − H color starts to redden. With 17 filters at wavelengths from 3640 ̊ A to 9140 ̊ A, the COMBO-17 team could estimate redshifts to \b z ≈ 0 . 05 over the range 0 . 2 < z < 1 . 2. The most spectacular use of photometric redshifts has been to find galaxies at z > 3. These Lyman break galaxies almost disappear at wavelengths less than 912(1 + z ) ̊ A, where intergalactic atoms of neutral hydrogen absorb nearly all their light (see Section 9.4).

Space densities To trace the formation of galaxies through cosmic history, we must take account of the expansion in counting the number within any given volume. The number of objects that we will see between redshifts z and z + \b z is proportional to the corresponding volume of space \b V . This is just the product of the area A ( σ e , t e ) = 4 π R 2 ( t e ) σ 2 e of the sphere containing the galaxy at the time its light was emitted and the distance c | \b t e | that the light travels toward us in the time corresponding to this interval in redshift. From Equations 8.30 and 8.31, we have A c | \b t e | \b z ≈ d V d z = 4 π c R 2 ( t 0 ) σ 2 e H ( z )(1 + z ) 3 , (8.47) where we replaced R ( t e )by R ( t 0 ) / (1 + z ) in the last step. The volume \b V at redshift z will expand to fill a volume \b V (1 + z ) 3 by the present day: we refer to \b V (1 + z ) 3 as the comoving volume. If the number of galaxies in the Universe had always remained constant, then the comoving density , the number in each unit of comoving volume, would not change.

(8.48) Comparing the measured number of galaxies d N / d z at each redshift with d N − / d z from Equation 8.48 tells us how the comoving density has changed. The left panel of Figure 8.8 shows the comoving volume (1 + z ) 3 d V / d z between redshifts z and z + \b z . It is much larger in the open Universe with \u0003 = \u0002 0 = 0 than it is in the flat model with \u0002 0 = 1. So we expect to see relatively more galaxies at high redshift in the open model. The benchmark model has slightly more volume at low redshift than the \u0003 = \u0002 0 = 0 model, but less at z ∼ > 2. Problem 8.26 Use Equations 8.23 and 8.42 to show that, if \u0002 0 = 0, then redshift z = 5 corresponds to R ( t 0 ) σ e = 2 . 92 c / H 0 , whereas for \u0002 0 = 1, R ( t 0 ) σ e = 1 . 18 c / H 0 . For any given density n ( z ), use Equation 8.48 to show that, if \u0002 0 = 0, then at z = 5 we would expect to find roughly 15 times as many objects within a small redshift range \b z as we would see if \u0002 0 = 1. What is this ratio at z = 3? Quasars, the extremely luminous ‘active’ nuclei of galaxies which we discuss in the following chapter, are so bright that we can see them across most of the observable Universe. They also have strong emission lines that make it easy to measure their redshifts. Figure 1.16 told us that each cubic gigaparsec now contains ∼ 10 6 galaxies with L ≈ L , where L ≈ 2 × 10 10 L \u0005 is the luminosity of a bright galaxy defined by Equation 1.24. At present, each cubic gigaparsec contains about one very luminous quasar with L ∼ > 100 L ; bright quasars are much rarer than luminous galaxies. But Figure 8.13 shows that, at redshifts z ≈ 2, the brightest quasars were about 100 times more common than they are today. There was roughly one quasar for every 10 000 present-day giant galaxies. What happened to them? If quasars represent the youth of a galactic nucleus, then at least one in 10 000 luminous galaxies must have been bright quasars in the past. The fraction could be as high as 100% if the nuclear activity lasts much less than a gigayear. A period with a quasar nucleus might be a normal part of a galaxy’s early development. We will see in Section 9.1 that quasars shine by the energy released as gas falls into a hugely massive black hole of ∼ > 10 9 M \u0005 . In Section 6.4 we found that today’s luminous galaxies harbor massive black holes at their centers; perhaps these remain from an early quasar phase. It takes time to build up the black hole as it consumes gas, so quasars are rare during the first quarter of cosmic history, before z ∼ 2. It is perhaps more surprising that we begin to see them already at z > 6, less than a gigayear after the Big Bang."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"344 The large-scale distribution of galaxies 10 100 1000 0.01 0.1 1 0246 0.925 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.5 0.3 Fig. 8.13.

Wall. 8.4 Growth of structure: from small beginnings The cosmic background radiation is almost, but not quite, uniform: across the sky, its temperature differs by a few parts in 10 5 . These tiny differences tell us how lumpy the cosmos was at the time t rec of recombination, when the radi- ation cooled enough for neutral atoms to form. Quantum fluctuations in the field responsible for inflation left their imprint as irregularities in the density of matter and radiation. Most versions of inflation predict that fluctuations should obey the random-phase hypothesis, and that the power spectrum P ( k ) ∝ k (see Problem 8.7): we will call these the benchmark initial fluctuations . Equation 8.4 then tells us that the density varies most strongly on small spatial scales or large k . The largest features, extending a degree or more across the sky, tell us about that early physics. Smaller-scale irregularities are modified by the excess grav- itational pull toward regions of high density and by the pressure of that denser gas. Observing them tells us about the geometry of the Universe and its matter content. After recombination, dense regions rapidly became yet denser as sur- rounding matter fell into them. By observing the peculiar motions of infalling galaxies, we can probe the large-scale distribution of mass today and compare it with what is revealed by the light of the galaxies. 8.4.1 Fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation How did the distribution of matter affect the cosmic background radiation as we observe it today?

In doing this, it suffers a gravitational redshift proportional to \b\u0010 g , the excess depth of the potential: its temperature T changes by \b T , where \b T / T ∼ \b\u0010 g / c 2 . The temperature is reduced where the potential is unusually deep, since \b\u0010 g is negative there. But time also runs more slowly within the denser region by a fraction \b t / t = \b\u0010 g / c 2 ,sowesee the gas at an earlier time when it was hotter. The radiation temperature decreases as T ∝ 1 / a ( t ), so \b T T =− \b a a =− 2 3 \b t t =− 2 3 \b\u0010 g c 2 , (8.49) where we have used a ∝ t 2 / 3 from Equation 8.27. This partly cancels out the gravitational redshift to give \b T / T ∼ \b\u0010 g / (3 c 2 ). At these early times, the aver- age density ̄ ρ is very nearly equal to the critical density of Equation 8.21. If our region has density ̄ ρ (1 + δ ) and radius R , its excess mass is \b M = 4 π ̄ ρ R 3 δ/ 3. We can write 3 c 2 \b T T = \b\u0010 g ∼− 2 G \b M R =− 8 π 3 G ̄ ρ R 2 δ ≈− δ ( t )[ ̄ H ( t ) R ] 2 . (8.50) Radiation reaching us from denser regions is cooler . The best current measurements of the cosmic microwave background on scales larger than 0.3 ◦ are from the WMAP satellite, which was launched in June 2001. WMAP confirmed that the background radiation has the form of a blackbody everywhere on the sky: only its temperature differs slightly from point to point. This is exactly what we would expect if it was affected by non-uniformities in the matter density. We can describe the temperature variations by choosing some polar coordinates θ,φ on the sky. As we look in a given direction, we can write the difference \b T from the mean temperature T using the spherical harmonic functions Y m l : \b T ( θ,φ ) = \u0013 l > 1 \u0013 − l ≤ m ≤ l a m l Y m l ( θ,φ ) . (8.51) Since Y m l has l zeros as the angle θ varies from 0 to π , the a m l measure an average temperature difference between points separated by an angle (180 / l ) ◦ on the sky. Apart from the l = 1 terms which reflect our motion relative to the background radiation, all the a m l must average to zero; their squared aver- age measures how strongly T fluctuates across the sky. Theorists aim to predict C l =| a m l | 2 \u000b averaged over all the m -values, since this does not depend on which direction we chose for θ = 0, our ‘north pole’. Figure 8.14 shows \b T ( l ), defined by \b 2 T = T 2 l ( l + 1) C l / (2 π ). Gravity, which makes denser regions even denser, and pressure forces that tend to even out the density, have modified the fluctuations left behind after inflation.

When the gas became transparent, the comoving distance σ H to the horizon was R ( t rec ) σ H = 3 ct rec = 2 c H ( t rec ) ≈ 2 c H 0 √ \u0002 m (1 + z rec ) 3 / 2 , (8.52) where we used Equation 8.26 in the last step. (Why can we ignore \u0002 \u0003 ?) A region of this size will expand to 184 / ( h 2 \u0002 m ) 1 / 2 Mpc by today. Because inflation left us with P ( k ) ∝ k , on larger scales (at small l ), we should expect \b T ( l ) to rise smoothly as l increases. The angle θ H that the horizon covers on the sky depends on \u0002 \u0003 and \u0002 m through the angular-size distance d A . When \u0003 = 0 and \u0002 0 z \u0012 1, Equation 8.42 tells us that d A → 2 c / ( H 0 z \u0002 0 ).

Setting \u0002 m + \u0002 \u0003 = 1 changes the way that the distance radius d A depends on the matter density. From Equation 8.43 we have d A ∝ 1 /\u0002 0 . 4 m at large redshift, so the angular size of the ripples is almost independent of \u0002 m . The observed position of the acoustic peak is the most powerful current evidence in favor of dark energy. We will see in the following section that, before recombination, irregularities built up most strongly in the dark matter. The mixed fluid of baryons and radiation then simply fell into the denser regions under gravity. The maximum distance through which that mixed fluid can fall by t rec sets the position of the first peak in \b T ,at l = 220. In the benchmark cosmology, this distance corresponds to 105 Mpc today, or a sphere containing 2 . 5 × 10 16 M \u0005 . The second peak, at l = 540, corresponds to a smaller lump of dark matter, where the fluid has time to fall in and be pushed out again by its own increased pressure. The third peak corresponds to ‘in–out–in’, the fourth to ‘in–out–in–out’, and so on: hence the label of ‘acoustic peaks’. The more dark matter is present, the stronger its gravity causes its irregularities to become, and so the greater the height of the main peak. The mass of the baryonic matter ‘helps’ the baryon–radiation fluid to fall into dense regions of dark matter, but hinders its ‘bouncing’ out again; this strengthens the odd-numbered peaks relative to the even peaks. The benchmark model, with \u0002 B ≈ 0 . 045, \u0002 m = 0 . 3, \u0002 \u0003 = 0 . 7, and H 0 = 70 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 , gives correct predictions for the abundance of deuterium and lithium (see Section 1.5), the motions of the galaxies, and fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation. Further reading: see Chapter 6 of the book by Padmanabhan. 8.4.2 Peculiar motions of galaxies One way that we can explore the largest structures is to map out the galaxies, as in Figure 8.3; but this samples only the luminous matter. Another is to look at the peculiar motions of galaxies, their deviation from the uniform flow described by Equation 8.8. Peculiar motions grow because of the extra tug of gravity from denser regions. In the Local Group, the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy M31 approach each other under their mutual gravitational attraction (Section 4.5), while groups of galaxies fall into nearby clusters (Section 7.2). We saw how to use these motions to weigh the groups and clusters. Similarly, we can use the observed peculiar motions on larger scales to reconstruct the distribution of mass, most of which is dark. We can see the peculiar motions of the nearby elliptical galaxies in Figure 8.2. Although the Fornax cluster is roughly as far away as the Virgo cluster, the galaxies of Fornax on average are moving more rapidly away from us. It appears that the Local Group, and the galaxies nearby, are falling toward the complex of galaxies around Virgo.

The peculiar velocities of individual galaxies are affected by their orbits within the group, but averaging over the whole group should reveal the larger- scale motions. These velocities are plotted in the left panel. The two largest white symbols represent the two clumps of Virgo cluster galaxies, around M86 and M49. The other big symbols, indicating groups close to Virgo, fall below the general linear trend. The right panel of Figure 8.15 shows the result of subtracting out Virgocentric inflow according to a simple model, which predicts an infall speed of 270 km s − 1 at our position. We now see roughly V r ∝ d . Within about 25 Mpc of Virgo, most of the plotted values deviate from the linear trend by less than 100 km s − 1 . Peculiar motions complicate our attempts to measure H 0 . If we tried to do this by finding distances and velocities of galaxies in the direction of Virgo, we would underestimate the Hubble constant, because Virgocentric inflow partially cancels out the cosmic expansion. But if we had observed galaxies in the opposite direction, our value for H 0 would be too high. The best-measured peculiar motion is that of the Local Group, determined from the Sun’s velocity relative to the cosmic microwave radiation: recall Sec- tion 1.5. The Local Group now moves with V pec ≈ 630 km s − 1 in the direction ( l , b ) ≈ (276 ◦ , 30 ◦ ). Most of that peculiar motion seems to be caused by the"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"8.4 Growth of structure: from small beginnings 349 gravitational pull of very distant matter, tugging at both us and the Virgo cluster. The velocities of galaxies furthest from the Virgo cluster, which are mostly on the opposite side of the sky, lie mainly above the sloping line in the right panel of Figure 8.15. This is what we would expect if more distant matter were pulling Virgo and Fornax apart. Both the local velocity dispersion and the Local Group’s motion toward the Virgo cluster are significantly less than our motion relative to the cosmic microwave background. The flow of galaxies through space is ‘cold’ on small scales: galaxies within tens of megaparsecs of each other share a large fraction of their peculiar velocity. Problem 8.27 Here you use Monte Carlo simulation to show that the peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies must be very close to that of the Milky Way, or Hubble could never have discovered the cosmic expansion from his sample of 22 local galaxies. Your model sky consists of galaxies in regions A (1 Mpc < d < 3 Mpc), B (3 Mpc < d < 5 Mpc), C (5 Mpc < d < 7 Mpc), and D (7 Mpc < d < 9 Mpc). If the density is uniform, and you have four galaxies in region B, how many are in regions A, C, and D (round to the nearest integer)? For simplicity, put all the objects in region A at d = 2 Mpc, those in B at 4 Mpc, those in C at 6 Mpc, and those in D at 8 Mpc. Now assign peculiar velocities at random to the galaxies. For each one, roll a die, note the number N on the upturned face, and give your galaxy a radial velocity V r = H 0 d + ( N − 3 . 5) × 350 km s − 1 , taking H 0 = 70 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . (If you like to program you can use more galaxies; place them randomly in space, and choose the peculiar velocities from a Gaussian random distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of 600 km s − 1 .) Plot both V r and also the average velocity in each region against the distance d ; is there a clear trend? How many of your model galaxies have negative radial velocities? How does your plot compare with the right panel of Figure 8.15? Hubble found no galaxies beyond the Local Group that are approaching us. 8.4.3 How do peculiar velocities build up? Peculiar velocities tend to die away as the Universe expands, because a mov- ing galaxy keeps overtaking others, until it reaches the region where its motion matches that of the cosmic expansion. We can imagine two nearby comoving observers, P and Q, at rest relative to the background radiation; they recede from each other only because of cosmic expansion. A galaxy passes observer P heading toward Q with a peculiar motion V pec , and arrives there after a time ≈ d / V pec .IfP and Q are close enough that V pec \u0012 H ( t ) d , their separation remains almost con- stant as the galaxy travels between them. But relative to observer Q, the galaxy moves only at speed V pec − H ( t ) d . The galaxy’s speed, relative to a comoving"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"350 The large-scale distribution of galaxies observer at its current position, has decreased at the rate d V pec d t =− H ( t ) d d / V pec =− V pec ̇ R ( t ) R ( t ) . (8.54) Integrating this shows that V pec ∝ 1 / R ( t ); a galaxy’s peculiar velocity V pec falls in exactly the same way as the momentum of a photon is reduced according to Equation 8.12. If peculiar velocities simply decreased according to Equation 8.54, then shortly after recombination at z ≈ 1100, the material of the Local Group would have been moving at nearly the speed of light. But this would have caused shocks in the gas and huge distortions in the cosmic microwave background. In fact, the peculiar motions of the galaxies were generated quite recently, by their mutual gravitational attraction. When some part of the Universe contains more matter than average, its increased gravity brakes the expansion more strongly. Where there is less matter than average, the expansion is faster; the region becomes even more diffuse relative to its surroundings. So the galaxies move relative to the cosmic background: they acquire peculiar motions. To calculate how this happens, suppose that the average density of matter is ̄ ρ m ( t ), and the average expansion is described by the scale factor ̄ a ( t ) and the Hubble parameter ̄ H ( t ). Locally, within the volume we are studying we can write ρ m ( t ) = ̄ ρ m ( t )[1 + δ ( t )] , and a ( t ) = ̄ a ( t )[1 − \u001a ( t )] . (8.55) If our region is approximately spherical, the matter outside will not exert any gravitational force within it; it will behave just like part of a denser, more slowly expanding, cosmos. Where \u0002 m [1 + δ ( t )] > 1 so the local density exceeds the critical value, expansion can be halted to form bound groups and clusters of galaxies. Life is much simpler if we stay in the linear regime, where δ and \u001a of Equa- tion 8.55 are much less than unity. We saw in the discussion following Equa- tion 8.4 that this applies to structures with sizes larger than about 8 h − 1 Mpc: their density differs by only a small fraction from the cosmic average. When we substitute the expressions for ρ m ( t ) and a ( t ) into Equation 8.25, we can then ignore terms in δ 2 ,δ\u001a,\u001a 2 , and higher powers of these variables. Remembering that a ( t ) H ( t ) = ̇ a ( t ) and that terms involving only barred average quantities will cancel out, Equation 8.25 becomes \b \t H 2 0 (1 − \u0002 tot ) + 2 d ̄ a d t d d t [ ̄ a \u001a ( t )] + 8 π G 3 ̄ ρ ( t ) ̄ a 2 ( t )[ δ ( t ) − 2 \u001a ( t )] = 0 . (8.56) Here the first term represents the change in the present density and expansion rate within our denser region."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"8.4 Growth of structure: from small beginnings 351 We saw from Figure 8.7 that, for most of the period during which galaxy clus- ters and groups were forming, dark energy was not important, and we can simply use Equation 8.27 to describe the average expansion ̄ a ( t ). While the Universe is matter-dominated, ρ a 3 is constant, so δ = 3 \u001a . Then δ ∝ t 2 / 3 ∝ ̄ a ( t ) as long as 1 + z \u0012 (1 − \u0002 tot ) /\u0002 m , ( \u0002 \u0003 /\u0002 m ) 1 / 3 (8.57) is a ‘growing’ solution to Equation 8.56 (substitute back to check!). Early on, the contrast δ grows proportionally to R ( t ). If \u0002 m + \u0002 \u0003 < 1, then at some point the first condition on z is violated, and the average motion becomes ̄ a ∝ t : matter coasts outward with constant speed. Once the matter exerts too little gravity to have any effect on the expansion, δ remains fixed: the structure freezes out .In a flat model with \u0002 tot = 1, growth continues until 1 + z ∼ ( \u0002 \u0003 /\u0002 m ) 1 / 3 .In the benchmark model, large structures continued to grow until very recently, at z ∼ 0 . 3. In a low-density Universe with \u0002 m = 0 . 3 and \u0002 \u0003 = 0, they would have ceased to become denser around redshift z ∼ 2. Further reading: On peculiar motions, see Chapter 4 of Padmanabhan’s book. 8.4.4 Weighing galaxy clusters with peculiar motions Any denser-than-average region pulled the surrounding galaxies more strongly toward it. While the fractional deviations δ ( x , t ) from uniform density remain small, Equation 8.57 tells us that, over a given time, δ ( x ) increased by an equal factor everywhere. Because the pull on a galaxy from each overdense region increases in the same proportion, its acceleration, and hence its peculiar velocity, is always parallel to the local gravitational force. So, by measuring peculiar motions, we can reconstruct the force vector, and hence the distribution of mass. To see how this works, we can write the velocity u ( x , t ) of matter at point x as the sum of the average cosmic expansion directly away from the origin and a peculiar velocity v : u ( x , t ) = ̄ H ( t ) x + v ( x , t ) . (8.58) The equation of mass conservation relates the velocity field u ( x , t ) to the density, which we write as ρ ( x , t ) = ̄ ρ ( t )[1 + δ ( x , t )]: \u0003 ∂ρ ∂ t \u0004 x +∇ x · ρ u = 0 . (8.59) Remembering that terms involving only the barred average quantities will cancel out, and dropping terms in δ 2 ,δ v , and v 2 ,wehave \u0003 ∂δ ∂ t \u0004 x + ̄ H ( t ) x · ∇ x δ +∇ x v = 0 .

(8.62) For a small enough volume, if we assume that the Universe beyond is homo- geneous and isotropic, we can use Newton’s laws to calculate the gravitational potential \u0010 g corresponding to local deviations from the average density ̄ ρ . The gravitational force F g =−∇ \u0010 g = d v ( x , t ) / d t ,sowehave0 = d( ∇× v ) / d t . Peculiar motions that have grown in this way from small initial fluctuations thus have ∇× v ≈ 0, and we can define a velocity potential \u0010 v such that v =∇ x \u0010 v . Rewriting Equation 8.62 in terms of \u0010 v gives ∇ 2 x \u0010 v =− \u0003 ∂δ ∂ t \u0004 r . (8.63) Equation 3.9, Poisson’s equation, tells us that ∇ 2 x \u0010 g =−∇ x · F g = 4 π G ̄ ρδ ( x , t ) (8.64) – which looks suspiciously like the equation for \u0010 v . Equation 8.57 assures us that all perturbations grow at the same rate: if δ is twice as large, then so is ̇ δ . Thus δ ( x , t ) ∝ ∂δ ( x , t ) /∂ t , and the right-hand sides of Equations 8.63 and 8.64 are proportional to each other. Then, as long as both v ( x , t ) and F g diminish to zero as | x | increases, they must also be proportional: the peculiar velocity is in the same direction as the force resulting from local concentrations of matter . On dividing the right-hand side of Equation 8.63 by that of 8.64, we find | v ( x , t ) | | F g | = ̄ H ( t ) f 4 π G ̄ ρ ( t ) , where f ≡ ̄ a ( t ) δ \u0003 ∂δ ∂ t \u0004 r \b d ̄ a d t .

(8.67) Show that, while it is early enough that we can use Equation 8.57 for δ ( r ), the peculiar velocity v ∝ t 1 / 3 . (Why did we have to transform to comoving coordinates to apply Equation 8.57?) So, if we can measure the overdensity δ ( x ) of the nearby rich galaxy clusters, and the peculiar velocities of the galaxies around them, we should be able to test Equation 8.66, and solve for the matter density \u0002 m . First, we determine the average peculiar motion v ( x ) of our galaxies. We must assume that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on even larger scales, so that forces from galaxies outside our survey volume will average to zero. Inverting Equation 8.66 should then yield the product f ( \u0002 0 ) · δ ( x ), from which we can find \u0002 m . But the mass distributions predicted from measured peculiar velocities do not match the observed clustering of galaxies very well. Alternatively, we could say that the forces calculated from the galaxies at their observed positions do not yield the measured peculiar motions. The pull of matter outside the volume of our present surveys appears to be significant. In particular, we still do not know that concentration of matter is responsible for most of the Local Group’s peculiar motion of ∼ 600 km s − 1 . Work is under way on this problem, and galaxy surveys are being extended as techniques for finding distances improve. Locally, we can use the crude model of Figure 8.15 for the Virgocentric infall to estimate the mass density \u0002 m . Let d V ≈ 16 Mpc be the distance of the Local Group from the center of the Virgo cluster. Within a sphere of radius d V about the cluster’s center, the density of luminous galaxies is roughly 2.4 times the mean; if the mass density is increased by the same factor, then the overdensity δ ≈ 1 . 4. Although Equation 8.65 was derived for δ \u0011 1, we can use it to make a rough calculation of f ( \u0002 ). Assuming that the Virgo cluster is roughly spherical, the additional gravita- tional pull on the Local Group is F g ≈ 4 π Gd V ̄ ρδ/ 3, just as if all the cluster’s mass had been concentrated at its center. So our peculiar motion toward Virgo is | v LG |≈ ( H 0 d V ) \u0002 0 . 6 m δ 3 ≈ 270 km s − 1 . (8.68) Cosmic expansion is pulling the cluster away from us at a speed H 0 d V ≈ 1200 km s − 1 , so this yields \u0002 m ≈ 0 . 3, in reasonable agreement with the bench- mark model."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"354 The large-scale distribution of galaxies 8.4.5 Tidal torques: how did galaxies get their spin? The Sun rotates for the same reason that water swirls around the plug-hole as it runs out of a sink. The material originally had a small amount of angular momentum ρ x × v about its center in a random sense. This is approximately conserved as the fluid is drawn radially inward, so as | x | decreases the rotation described by v must speed up. But galaxies and clusters do not owe their rotation to early random motions; this peculiar motion arises from irregular lumps of matter pulling on each another by gravity, as illustrated in Figure 4.13. In Problem 8.29 we saw that, while the Universe is matter-dominated, peculiar velocities grow as t 1 / 3 , while the distance d between galaxies follows a ( t ) ∝ t 2 / 3 . So angular momentum builds up as d × v ∝ t as long as we remain in the linear regime with δ ( t ) \u0011 1. It stops increasing when the dense region starts to collapse on itself, as we will discuss in Section 8.5. The denser the initial lump, the sooner it collapses and the less time it has to spin up. But tidal torques are stronger in denser regions, so, in a cosmos filled with cold dark matter, objects acquire the same average angular momentum in relation to their mass and energy. To measure how important a galaxy’s angular momentum is, we note that a galaxy of radius R , mass M , and angular momentum L will rotate with angular speed ω ∼ L / ( M R 2 ). The angular speed ω c of a circular orbit at radius R is given by ω 2 c R ∼ G M / R 2 . The energy E ∼− G M 2 / R (see Problem 3.36 and recall the virial theorem). So the ratio λ = ω ω c = L M R 2 × R 3 / 2 √ G M = L | E | 1 / 2 G M 5 / 2 (8.69) tells us how far the galaxy is supported against collapse by rotation, rather than pressure or random motion of its stars. Gravitational N -body simulations show that the distribution of galaxies we observe would not spin up collapsing lumps very strongly: we expect 0 . 01 <λ< 0 . 1. This is similar to what we see in elliptical galaxies, but disk galaxies like our Milky Way have λ ≈ 0 . 5. The parameter λ can increase if material loses energy to move inward, as a gas disk can do by radiation. This argument already tells us that the Milky Way has a dark halo – otherwise its disk would not have time to form. Without a halo, L and M do not change as the proto-disk moves inward, so its radius must shrink 100-fold to increase E by the same factor. Disk material near the Sun must originate 800 kpc from the center, but the mass M ( < R ) within that radius would be just what now lies between the Sun’s orbit and the Galactic center. Equation 3.20 shows that the orbital period would then be 1000 times longer than that in the Sun’s current orbit, or about 240 Gyr. The Galaxy would shrink at roughly the same rate; it would take several times longer than the age of the Universe to make the disk. But in Problem 3.5 we saw that the Milky Way has M / L ∼ > 50; at least 90% of its mass is dark. Because the dark halo cannot lose energy and shrink, the gas that"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"8.5 Growth of structure: clusters, walls, and voids 355 is to become the disk originates closer to the center by a factor M (disk) / M (total). So our disk had to collapse only to a tenth of its original size to reach λ ≈ 0 . 5. Since the infall and orbital speeds are set by the dark halo, they would have been near today’s values. Shrinking at 200 km s − 1 from a radius of 80 kpc, the disk could have formed in ∼ < 2 Gyr. Further reading: see Chapter 8 of Padmanabhan’s book. 8.5 Growth of structure: clusters, walls, and voids The galaxy clusters and huge walls that we see in Figure 8.3 are visible because the density of luminous matter in them is a few times greater than that in the surrounding regions. If galaxies trace out the mass density, then the fractional variations in density are now large: in the language of Equation 8.55, δ ( t 0 ) ∼ > 1. How did the small fluctuations that we examined in Section 8.4 develop into the structure that we now see? 8.5.1 Pressure battles gravity: the Jeans mass Objects like stars are supported by gas pressure, which counteracts the inward pull of gravity. The larger a body is, the more likely it is that gravity will win the fight against the outward forces holding it up. In life, the giant insects of horror movies would be crushed by their own weight. For a spherical cloud of gas, we can estimate the potential energy PE using the result of Problem 3.11 for a uniform sphere of radius r and density ρ . We then compare it with the thermal energy KE . The sound speed c s in a gas is close to the average speed of motion of the particles along one direction, so we can write PE ≡− 1 2 \u0002 ρ ( x ) \u0010 ( x )d 3 x ≈− 16 π 2 15 G ρ 2 r 5 , and KE ≈ 3 c 2 s 2 4 π r 3 ρ 3 . (8.70) In equilibrium the virial theorem, Equation 3.44, requires | PE |= 2 KE ;we might expect the cloud to collapse if the kinetic energy is less than this. That always happens if the cloud is big enough: KE < | PE | / 2 when 2 r ∼ > \u0011 15 π \u0012 c 2 s G ρ ≈ λ J , where λ J ≡ c s \u0011 π G ρ . (8.71) The length λ J is called the Jeans length .

If its diameter is less than λ J , the additional pressure more than"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"356 The large-scale distribution of galaxies offsets the increased gravity: the cloud re-expands. In a larger cloud gravity wins, and collapse ensues. Early on, while the Universe is radiation-dominated, the density ρ r = a B T 4 / c 2 is low and the pressure is high, with c s = c / √ 3. So Equation 8.71 gives λ J = c 2 \u0003 π 3 Ga B T 4 \u0004 1 / 2 ∝ T − 2 . (8.72) The Jeans mass M J is the amount of matter in a sphere of diameter λ J : M J ≡ π 6 λ 3 J ρ m , (8.73) where ρ m refers only to the matter density. In the radiation-dominated period we have M J ∝ ρ m T − 6 , with T ∝ 1 / R ( t ) and ρ m decreasing as R − 3 . So the Jeans mass grows as M J ∝ R 3 ( t ); the mass enclosed in a sphere of diameter λ J increases as the Universe becomes more diffuse. At the time t eq when the density of matter is equal to that of radiation, the temperature is T eq and ρ m = ρ r = a B T 4 eq / c 2 . Radiation still provides most of the pressure, so p ≈ c 2 ρ r / 3 and M J ( t eq ) = π 6 ρ m ( t eq ) 0 π c 4 / 3 Ga B T 4 eq 1 3 / 2 = π 5 / 2 18 √ 3 c 4 G 3 / 2 a 1 / 2 B 1 T 2 eq . (8.74) If equality occurs at the redshift 1 + z eq = 24 000 \u0002 m h 2 of Problem 8.10, then M J ( T eq ) = 3 . 6 × 10 16 ( \u0002 m h 2 ) − 2 M \u0005 . (8.75) This is 100 times more than the Virgo cluster, or roughly the mass that we would find today in a huge cube 50 / ( \u0002 m h 2 ) Mpc on a side. This is approximately the spatial scale of some of the largest voids and complexes of galaxy clusters in Figure 8.3. Overdense regions with masses below M J could not collapse because the outward pressure of radiation was too strong. Instead, radiation gradually diffused out of them, taking the ionized gas with it, and damping out small irreg- ularities. After this time, matter provides most of the mass and energy, but the pressure comes mainly from the radiation: so ρ ≈ ρ m ,but p ≈ c 2 ρ r / 3. If a small box of the combined matter–radiation fluid is squeezed adiabatically, then, just as in the cosmic expansion, the change \bρ m in the matter density is related to \bρ r by 4 \bρ m /ρ m = 3 \bρ r /ρ r . So the sound speed c 2 s = ∂ p ∂ρ = c 2 \bρ r / 3 \bρ m = c 2 3 4 ρ r 3 ρ m ∝ 1 R ( t ) , so λ J = c s \u0011 π G ρ m ∝ R ( t ) (8.76) and the Jeans mass of Equation 8.73 stays constant."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"8.5 Growth of structure: clusters, walls, and voids 357 By a redshift z rec ∼ 1100 when the temperature T rec ≈ 3000 K, hydrogen atoms had recombined. Radiation streamed freely through the neutral matter, and no longer contributed to the pressure. The sound speed dropped to that of the matter: c s ( t rec ) ≈ \u0012 k B T m p ≈ 5kms − 1 . (8.77) Just afterward, the Jeans mass is M J = π 6 ρ m \u0003 π k B T rec G ρ m m p \u0004 3 / 2 ≈ 5 × 10 4 ( \u0002 m h 2 ) − 1 / 2 M \u0005 ; (8.78) it has fallen abruptly by a factor of ∼ 10 12 . Radiation continues to transfer some heat to the matter, keeping their tem- peratures roughly equal until z ∼ 100. Now the Jeans mass M J ∝ T 3 / 2 ρ − 1 / 2 m , and, because the radiation cools as T r ∝ R − 1 , that decrease offsets the drop in density ρ m to keep M J nearly constant. If the first dense objects formed with roughly this mass, similar to that of a globular cluster, they could subsequently have merged to build up larger bodies. Once it is no longer receiving heat, the matter cools according to T m ∝ R − 2 . To see why, think of the perfect gas law relating temperature to volume, or recall that expansion reduces the random speeds of atoms according to Equation 8.54. So the Jeans mass falls further; after recom- bination, gas pressure is far too feeble to affect the collapse of anything as big as a galaxy. But how can we make objects the size of galaxies or galaxy clusters, that are too small to grow before recombination? Equation 8.57 tells us that the fraction δ by which their density exceeds the average grows with time as t 2 / 3 or R ( t ). To reach δ ∼ > 1 before the present, we would need δ ( t rec ) ∼ > 10 − 3 at z rec = 1100. But, aside from the highest peak in Figure 8.14, \b T < 50 mK or 2 × 10 − 5 times the average temperature. This is far too small; so why do we see any galaxies and galaxy clusters today? 8.5.2 WIMPs to the rescue! The dark matter far outweighs the neutrons and protons. Although we have yet to detect the particles themselves, dark matter is most probably composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Like neutrinos, WIMPS lack strong and electromagnetic interactions – or they would not be ‘dark’ – and they have some small but nonzero mass. WIMPs can collapse into galaxy-sized lumps early on, because, unlike the baryons, they are unaffected by radiation pressure."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"358 The large-scale distribution of galaxies To describe this collapse, we can follow the same calculation as for the Jeans length and Jeans mass, but for WIMPs with density ρ w and typical random speeds c w . Instead of Equation 8.73, we find that a dense region has too little kinetic energy and falls in on itself if it contains a mass larger than M J , wimp = π 6 ρ w \u0003 π c 2 w G ρ w \u0004 3 / 2 . (8.79) While the WIMPs are relativistic, their Jeans mass is high and grows with time just as in the radiation-dominated case. A slightly overdense region that is not actively collapsing simply disperses, as WIMPs stream out of it at light speed. All structure smaller than the horizon scale of Problem 8.14 is erased in this way. But as soon as the speed c w of random motions drops appreciably below c / √ 3, the Jeans mass starts to fall. Very roughly, all dense clumps of WIMPs that are larger than the horizon scale at the time when they cease moving relativistically now begin to collapse. Since inflation left behind fluctuations with a power spec- trum P ( k ) rising with k , lumps just larger than this will have the highest densities. The more massive the WIMPs, the smaller the horizon scale when they cease to move relativistically, and the smaller and denser the structures that form. Neutrinos, with masses of a few electron-volts, remain relativistic until almost t eq , when the comoving size of the horizon is ∼ 16( h 2 \u0002 m ) − 1 Mpc. Such light par- ticles are called hot dark matter . If the dark matter is hot, we still have difficulty in understanding how something as small as a galaxy or even a galaxy clus- ter can form. WIMPs massive enough that their sound speed c w fell below the speed of light long before the time t eq of matter–radiation equality are called cold dark matter . The most popular WIMP candidates have masses ∼ > 1 GeV; their random motions drop well below light speed when T < 10 13 K, only 10 − 6 s after the Big Bang, when the mass M H (WIMP) within the horizon was less than M \u0005 . As it escaped from the contracting clouds of WIMPs, the radiation took the normal matter with it. So both of these should be quite evenly spread at recombination, and the temperature of the cosmic background radiation should be nearly the same across the whole sky. At recombination, as the matter became neutral and was freed of the radiation pressure, it fell into the already-dense clumps of WIMPs. Fluctuations in the density of normal matter could then grow far more rapidly than Equation 8.57 allows, building up the galaxies and clusters. If the dark matter is cold, galaxies themselves would be built from successive merger of these smaller fragments. We call this the bottom-up picture because galaxies form early, and then fall together to form clusters and larger structures.

Notice the profusion of small dense clumps linked by the filamentary cosmic web, and that smaller structures look like denser, scaled-down copies of larger ones. The densest regions, shown in the side boxes, have ceased to expand and have fallen back on themselves. Gas would accumulate there, cooling to form clusters of luminous galaxies.

The results agree with P ( k ) mea- sured from the galaxies of 2dF in the region where they overlap.

To find out how long a galaxy or cluster takes to reach its present density, we can use the ‘top-hat’ model, thinking of the overdense protocluster as a uniform sphere. In a homogeneous Universe, the matter beyond that sphere does not exert any forces within it. So we are free to make our sphere more or less dense than its surroundings, and the Friedmann equations still hold. In the following problem, we use Equation 8.26 to examine the collapse of a denser-than-usual region that is destined to become a galaxy or cluster. Problem 8.30 Suppose that the time t 0 refers to a moment when the Universe is matter-dominated, and \u0002 m > 1 in our spherical protocluster. By substituting into Equation 8.26, show that the parametric equations R ( t ) R ( t 0 ) = \u0002 m 2( \u0002 m − 1) (1 − cos η ) , (8.80) H 0 t = \u0002 m 2( \u0002 m − 1) 3 / 2 ( η − sin η ) describe a solution. (This is the same as Equation 4.24 of Section 4.5, for e = 0 – why?) Show that R ( t ) is largest when η = π , at the turn-around time t ta = π\u0002 m / [2 H 0 ( \u0002 m − 1) 3 / 2 ], and that the sphere collapses to high density at time 2 t ta ."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"8.5 Growth of structure: clusters, walls, and voids 361 At time t 0 , suppose that this denser region is expanding at the same rate as its surroundings, and that t 0 is early enough that we can apply Equation 8.27: R ( t ) ∝ t 2 / 3 so that ρ ( t ) ∝ 1 / t 2 , and t 0 H 0 = 2 / 3. Using the result of Prob- lem 8.16, show that, between t 0 and t ta , the density ρ out outside the sphere drops such that ρ out ( t ta ) ρ out ( t 0 ) = \u000b 9 π 2 16 \u0002 2 m (1 − \u0002 m ) 3 \f while inside ρ in ( t ta ) ρ in ( t 0 ) = \u0003 \u0002 m − 1 \u0002 m \u0004 3 . (8.81) So ρ in ( t ta ) /ρ out ( t ta ) = (3 π/ 4) 2 . As it turns around and begins to collapse, this sphere is roughly 5.6 times denser than its surroundings. Just as the free-fall time of Equation 3.23 is the same for all particles in a sphere of uniform density, the collapse time 2 t ta is the same throughout this sphere. So, in our simple model, all the particles reach the center at the same moment. In the real cosmos, they would have small random motions which prevent this. The dark matter and any stars present will undergo violent relaxation (see Section 6.2) as they settle into virial equilibrium. Gas can lose energy by radiating heat away as it is compressed. Once our protocluster settles into equilibrium, the virial theorem tells us that its energy E 1 = PE 1 + KE 1 =− PE 1 / 2. The final energy E 1 can be no greater than the total energy E 0 = PE 0 when it was at rest at time t ta , poised between expansion and contraction: so we must have PE 1 < 2 PE 0 . Problem 8.31 Use Equation 3.33 for the potential energy PE of a galaxy of stars to show that, if the distances between stars all shrink by a factor f ,sothe density increases as 1 / f 3 , then PE increases as 1 / f . If we make the too-simple approximation that the collapse is homologous , so that all distances between particles shrink by an equal factor, Problem 8.31 tells us that our protocluster’s final radius is no more than half as large as it was at turn-around, and the density is at least eight times greater. Meanwhile, the cosmos continues to expand, and its average density has dropped at least four times since t ta (why?). So at the time that it reaches virial equilibrium, our cluster is 4 × 8 × 5 . 6 ≈ 180 times denser than the critical density for the Universe around it: recall Problem 8.2. In a galaxy cluster, we define the radius r 200 such that, within it, the average density is 200 times the critical density; r 200 is sometimes called the virial radius . At larger radii, the cluster cannot yet be relaxed and in virial equilibrium. Even the relaxed core will be disturbed when new galaxies fall through it as they join the cluster. We can use the ‘top-hat’ model to estimate when the galaxies and clusters could have formed. Within the Sun’s orbit, the Milky Way’s density averages to 10 5 ρ crit .

It could have been later, since the gas can radiate away energy, and become denser than the virial theorem predicts. But it could not have taken place any earlier. Problem 8.32 In Problem 7.7 we found that, in the core of the Virgo cluster, luminous galaxies are packed 2500 times more densely than the cosmic average. Assuming that dark and luminous matter are well mixed in the cluster, show that its core could not have assembled before redshift z = 1 . 3. How early could the central region of NGC 1399, from Problem 6.4, come together? 8.5.4 Using galaxies to test model cosmologies How well does the benchmark cosmology with cold dark matter account for real galaxies? Its huge success is to explain why the cosmic microwave background is so smooth, while the distribution of galaxies is so lumpy. We can even explain the shape of the power spectrum P ( k ) in Figure 8.17, which describes the non- uniformity. That power spectrum requires that the smallest lumps of matter are now densest, as we saw in Figure 8.6. Problem 8.30 shows that they are the first to stop expanding and collapse on themselves. So we might expect that all galaxies will contain some very dense regions, which should have made stars early on. Even the smallest galaxies should have some very old stars – as we saw in Section 4.4 for the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group. Structures that collapsed most recently should be larger and less dense than those that formed earlier. Using Equation 8.21 for the critical density, we can find the mass M 200 measured within the virial radius r 200 : M 200 = 4 3 π r 3 200 × 200 ρ crit = 100 r 3 200 H 2 ( t ) G , (8.82) while the speed of a circular orbit at that radius is V 2 c ( r 200 ) = G M 200 r 200 , so M 200 ( t ) = V 3 c ( r 200 ) 10 GH ( t ) . (8.83) So, if we measure rotational or random speeds near the radius r 200 (or if they do not change very much with radius), the mass or luminosity should increase steeply with those measured speeds. We see this pattern in the Tully–Fisher relation for disk galaxies (Figure 5.23), the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies (Figure 6.13), and the relation between temperature and X-ray luminosity for gas in galaxy clusters (Figure 7.12)."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"8.5 Growth of structure: clusters, walls, and voids 363 In the past the Hubble parameter H ( t ) was larger, so we expect that temperatures and speeds were higher for a given mass or luminosity. Figure 6.13 shows this effect, but in Figure 7.12 galaxy clusters at z ∼ 1 follow the same relation as local objects. Adding gas to simulations like that of Figure 8.16 does result in model galaxies that follow Tully and Fisher’s dependence of mass on rotation speed. But the ‘galaxies’ fail to gather enough gas from large distances, so the disk has too little angular momentum and its radius is too small. The slope of P ( k ) in Figure 8.17 means that small objects will be far more numerous than large ones. The smallest have roughly the solar mass, since this is the mass M H (WIMP) within the horizon when the random motions of the WIMPs drop below near-light speeds. The halo of a galaxy like the Milky Way is made by merging many thousands of smaller objects, most of which are torn apart. Those that fall in relatively late survive today as distinct objects: satellite dark halos. In models such as that in Figure 8.16 a Milky-Way-sized dark halo will have ∼ 300 dark satellites massive enough to have V c > 10 km s − 1 . But the real Milky Way only has ten or so luminous satellites. Choosing ‘warm’ dark matter, for which the random motions remained relativistic until the mass within the horizon M H (WIMP) ∼ > 10 9 M \u0005 , would erase all but the largest satellites. Some theories of particle physics include a ‘sterile neutrino’ with mass ∼ 1 keV, which would have this property. Other possibilities are that their first few stars blew all the remaining gas out of most of these dark halos, or that fierce ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the first galaxies heated it so far that it could not cool to make new stars. The Milky Way would then have 10 luminous satellites and 290 dark ones. Another facet of the same difficulty is that we see large objects ‘too early’ in cosmic history. In Section 9.4 we will find that some massive galaxies have formed more than 10 11 M \u0005 of stars, corresponding to more than 10 12 M \u0005 of dark matter, less than 2 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z ∼ > 3. The benchmark model with cold dark matter predicts that such early ‘monster’ galaxies should be extremely rare; it is not clear whether the model already conflicts with the observations. If the dark matter is cold, then all galaxies should have very dense cores. Figure 8.6 shows that σ R , the variation in density on lengthscale R , rises at small R or large k . So the first regions to collapse will be the smallest and also the densest. Equation 8.83 shows that the velocities of particles within them will also be low, because H ( t ) is large. So the positions and velocities of these first objects are tightly grouped: the density in phase space is high. Simulations like Figure 8.16 show that, as the galaxy is built, such objects fall together into a very dense center: the density of WIMPs follows ρ w ∝ r − α , where 1 ∼ < α ∼ < 1 . 5. The Navarro–Frenk–White model of Equation 3.24 was developed to describe this central cusp . The prevalence of dwarfs in galaxy clusters (see Figure 7.8) shows that they must indeed be robust, and hence dense, to avoid being torn apart by tidal forces. But the stars we observe are never as concentrated as this model requires the WIMPS to be, and the rotation curves of spiral galaxies in Figure 5.21 also seem to rise more gently than this form of ρ w would allow."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"364 The large-scale distribution of galaxies However, we know that galaxy centers contain mostly normal baryonic matter, and that gas physics is complex – we do not even know how to predict the masses of stars formed locally in our own Milky Way. So it is no surprise that we cannot yet use basic physics to calculate exactly how the galaxies should form. In the next chapter we turn to observations of the distant Universe, and to what we can learn by viewing galaxies and protogalactic gas as they were 8–10 Gyr ago as the Milky Way began to form its disk, and even earlier when our oldest stars were born."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"9 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies We begin this chapter by discussing galaxies with an active nucleus , a compact central region from which we observe substantial radiation that is not the light of stars or emission from the gas heated by them. Active nuclei emit strongly over the whole electromagnetic spectrum, including the radio, X-ray, and γ -ray regions where most galaxies hardly radiate at all. The most powerful of them, the quasars, easily outshine their host galaxies. With luminosities exceeding 10 12 L \u0005 , many are bright enough to be seen most of the way across the observable Universe. But the emitting region may be no bigger than the solar system; its power source is probably the energy released by gas falling into a central black hole. Very luminous active nuclei, such as the quasars, were far more common when the Universe was 20%–40% of its present age than they are today; nuclear activity seems to be characteristic of a galaxy’s early life. In many bright quasars, narrow twin jets are seen to emerge from the nucleus; they are probably launched and kept narrow by strong magnetic fields that build up in the surrounding disk of inflowing matter. In some cases, the jets appear to move outward faster than the speed of light. This is an illusion: the motion is slower than, but close to, light speed. In Section 9.2 we discuss these and similar ‘superluminal’ jets from stellar-mass objects: microquasars, which are neutron stars and black holes accreting mass from a binary companion, and γ -ray bursts, the final explosion of a very massive star. In Section 9.3 we consider gas lying between us and a distant galaxy or quasar, which produces absorption lines in its spectrum. Most of the absorbing material is very distant from the quasar, and simply lies along our line of sight to it. The denser gas is probably in the outer parts of galaxies, while the most tenuous material, only a few times denser than the cosmic average, follows the filamentary ‘cosmic web’ of the dark matter. Surprisingly, this gas is not pristine hydrogen and helium; even when it lies far from any galaxy, it is polluted with the heavy elements which result from nuclear burning in stars. In the last section of this final chapter, we turn to the question of how today’s galaxies grew out of the primeval mixture of hydrogen and helium.

Beyond a redshift z ∼ 2, they are furiously star-forming, often very dusty, and can no longer be classified according to the scheme of Figure 1.11. The most distant observed systems are seen at z ∼ 6, less than a gigayear after the Big Bang. New and more sensitive telescopes in the infrared and millimeter-wave regions promise us a much clearer view of the birth of the galaxies. 9.1 Active galactic nuclei Twinkle, twinkle, little star, We know exactly what you are: Nuclear furnace in the sky, You’ll burn to ashes, by and by.

Gamow and N. Calder Many galactic nuclei are very luminous at optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths. Others are far dimmer than their host galaxies in these spectral regions, but are strong radio sources. What they have in common is a large energy output from a very small volume, and internal motions that are relativistic , with speeds > 0 . 1 c and often much larger. The optical and ultraviolet spectrum of a quasar typically shows strong broad emission lines characteristic of moderately dense gas (Figure 9.1). The widths of the lines correspond to the Doppler shifts expected from emitting gas travelling at speeds ∼ 10 000 km s − 1 . These emitting clouds are moving much faster than the galaxy’s stars, which typically orbit at a few hundred kilometers per second. Many active nuclei are variable, changing their luminosity substantially within a few months, days, or even hours. The emission lines also strengthen and decline, within a few days or weeks. To allow such fast variability, both broad lines and continuum radiation must come from a region no more than a few light-weeks across. This tiny volume contains a huge mass. We can use Equation 3.20 to calcu- late the gravitational force required to prevent the clouds that produce the broad emission lines from escaping out of the nucleus. For velocities V ∼ 10 4 km s − 1 , and radii r = 0 . 01 pc or about two light-weeks, the inferred mass is ∼ 10 8 M \u0005 .In the nearby radio galaxy M87, we have ∼ 3 × 10 9 M \u0005 within 10 pc of the center"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"9.1 Active galactic nuclei 367 1000 800 600 2000 3000 4000 6000 0 1 2 3 4 Fig. 9.1.

What is R s for the black hole in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4258, of Problem 5.15? Broad emission lines from a galactic nucleus were first reported in 1907, in the early days of galaxy spectroscopy, but no systematic study was made until 1943. Then, Carl Seyfert published a list of 12 galaxies in which the nuclear spectrum showed strong broad emission lines of ions that could be excited only by photons more energetic than those of the young stars that ionize H II regions. These were later divided into the Seyfert 1 class, with very broad emission lines like those of Figure 9.1, and Seyfert 2 spectra with lines ∼ < 1000 km s − 1 wide. Most of Seyfert’s galaxies were spirals, but his list included the huge cD galaxy NGC 1275 at the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, which is an elliptical; see Figure 7.9. Table 9.1 shows that 1%–2% of luminous galaxies have Seyfert nuclei. In the 1950s, as radio astronomy blossomed, many of the strongest radio sources were found to be associated with luminous elliptical galaxies; these are now called radio galaxies .

Better radio maps revealed tiny central cores at the nuclei of radio galaxies, linked to the outer lobes by bright linear jets that carried energy outward. The first quasars (for ‘quasi-stellar radio source’) were discovered in the fol- lowing decade, as ‘radio galaxies with no galaxy’. They appeared pointlike in optical photographs; only their enormous redshifts betrayed that they were not Galactic stars. Rather, they were gigaparsecs distant, and hence extremely lumi- nous. Subsequently ‘radio-quiet’ quasars, called quasi-stellar objects ,or QSOs , were found by searching for objects that appeared stellar, but emitted too strongly at infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths relative to their brightness in visible light. Radio-quiet QSOs outnumber radio-loud quasars by at least a factor of 30; both are now believed to be variants of the same type of object, so we use the term ‘quasar’ to include the QSOs. In the 1980s, deep images of nearby quasars showed us that they were in fact the bright nuclei of galaxies, so luminous as to outshine the surrounding stars. Most astronomers now regard quasars as more powerful versions of a Seyfert nucleus. Quasars cover a very wide range in luminosity: Table 9.1 shows that the most powerful are also the rarest. BL Lac objects are quasars with very weak emission lines; they may be the most extreme form of active nucleus. They are named after their prototype, which was originally thought to be a variable star, and designated BL Lacertae. The light output of these objects can fluctuate enormously within a few days; one was seen to double its brightness within three hours. Both radio and optical emission"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"9.1 Active galactic nuclei 369 are strongly polarized. Quasars with the same pattern of variability, but having stronger emission lines, are called ‘optically violently variable’ (OVV) quasars; these and the BL Lac objects are collectively known as blazars . All known blazars are radio-loud. Blazars appear as the most luminous objects in the Universe: if their light were emitted equally in all directions – but see below for reasons why we do not think this is the case – their total output would exceed 10 14 L \u0005 . Active nuclei all derive their energy in the same way: gas gives up potential energy as it falls into a black hole. Here, we briefly sketch some of the physical processes involved in turning that energy into the radiation we observe, and explain how a single basic model might explain the diversity observed among active galaxies.

In visible light, we see the spiral arms and bright nucleus of a galaxy of type Sbc. The radio map shows emission from bright knots in spiral arms, but also two narrow jets emerging from the nucleus, bending into an ‘S’ shape, and terminating in twin bright lobes on either side of the galaxy. The nucleus is a bright pointlike source in both radio and X-ray bands. The radio emission is strongly polarized, which tells us that it is synchrotron radiation, given off as electrons spiral around lines of magnetic field at speeds close to that of light. In this galaxy the radio jets are unusually strong; they overlap with thin helical jets of ionized gas, from which we see emission lines in the optical and ultraviolet. NGC 4258 shows two features common to Seyfert galaxies: radiation that does not appear to originate from stars, and the directed outflow of matter and energy. As we saw in Section 5.5, the nucleus is surrounded by a small disk of fast-rotating gas which we see edge-on; it probably harbors a black hole with a mass exceeding 10 7 M \u0005 . Seyfert galaxies and quasars shine brightly at infrared, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths, as well as in visible light; but most are not strong radio sources. The quantity ν L ν is roughly constant from the infrared to the X-rays; equal energy is emitted in each interval over which the frequency increases by a factor of ten. The luminosity drops at γ -ray energies, above ∼ 100 keV.

Seyfert nuclei have M V ∼ > − 22 . 5or L ∼ < 10 11 L \u0005 ; more luminous objects would be classified as quasars. The X-ray power ranges from ∼ 2 × 10 8 L \u0005 to 10 11 L \u0005 . The active nucleus is probably powered by gas that falls into a central black hole. Because it inevitably has some angular momentum, infalling gas forms an accretion disk . Viscosity causes the disk gas to spiral slowly inward, heating up and radiating away its gravitational potential energy, until it reaches the last stable orbit around the black hole (see Problem 3.20) and falls in. Theoretically, up to 42% of M c 2 , the rest energy of the material, can be extracted from a mass M falling into a black hole. In practice, astronomers do not expect more than ∼ 0 . 1 M c 2 to emerge as radiation. This is still much more efficient than nuclear burning, which releases less than 1% of M c 2 . Magnetic fields are pulled inward with the flow of the hot ionized gas. Close to the black hole, the field can become strong enough to channel twin jets of relativistic plasma, moving out along the spin axis at speeds close to that of light. Some of the infrared flux and all the radio emission comes from particles accelerated to relativistic energies in the jet; paradoxically, we can use long- wavelength radio waves to trace extremely energetic processes. Electrons in the jet scatter some radio or visible-light photons, boosting them to γ -ray energies. The X-ray and ultraviolet emission might come from the hot innermost part of the"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"9.1 Active galactic nuclei 371 disk, or from the jet; the visible light probably originates further out in the disk or jet. Additional infrared light may be emitted by surrounding dust grains heated by the nuclear radiation. The light of a Seyfert nucleus is intense enough to exert considerable pressure on gas around it. If that outward push is too strong, no gas can fall into the center, and the nucleus runs out of fuel. So we have a limit on the luminosity that it could sustain. For a spherically symmetric object, we can calculate at what point radiation pressure just balances the inward force of gravity. We assume that the gas near the nucleus is fully ionized hydrogen, and we calculate the outward force due to Thomson scattering by the electrons; scattering from protons is much less efficient because of their larger mass. The cross-section σ T of each electron is σ T = e 4 6 π\u001a 2 0 c 4 m 2 e (SI) or 8 π e 4 3 c 4 m 2 e (cgs) = 6 . 653 × 10 − 25 cm 2 , (9.2) where e is the charge on the electron and m e is its mass. If the central source emits photons carrying luminosity L , these have momentum L / c , so an electron at radius r receives momentum σ T L / (4 π r 2 c ) each second. The electrons cannot move outward unless they take the protons with them; electrostatic forces are strong enough to prevent the positive and negative charges from separating. So we must compare the combined outward force on the proton and the electron with the inward force of gravity on both of them. If the central object has mass M , radiation pressure and gravity balance when G M ( m e + m p ) r 2 ≈ G M m p r 2 = σ T L 4 π r 2 c , (9.3) where m p is the proton mass. The Eddington luminosity L E is the largest value of L that still allows material to fall inward: L E = 4 π G M m p c σ T ≈ 1 . 3 × 10 31 M M \u0005 W ≈ 30 000 × M M \u0005 L \u0005 , (9.4) where L \u0005 is the Sun’s bolometric luminosity of 3 . 86 × 10 26 W. Stars like the Sun come nowhere near the Eddington luminosity, though the brightest super- giants approach it. Although part of the radiation of a Seyfert nucleus comes out in a directed jet, its total luminosity is unlikely to be more than a few times greater than L E .If L ∼ 10 9 L \u0005 then Equation 9.4 shows that the central mass must exceed 10 7 M \u0005 , to avoid blowing away all the gas that could fuel the active nucleus."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"372 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies Problem 9.2 As a mass m of gas falls into a black hole, at most 0 . 1 mc 2 is likely to emerge as radiation; the rest is swallowed by the black hole. Show that the Eddington luminosity for a black hole of mass M is equivalent to 2 × 10 − 9 M c 2 yr − 1 . Explain why we expect the black hole’s mass to grow by at least a factor of e every 5 × 10 7 years. The spectrum of a Seyfert 1 nucleus is similar to the quasar spectrum shown in Figure 9.1; broad emission lines from a wide range of ions are present. Some of these, such as the Balmer lines of hydrogen and lines of singly ionized species such as Mg II , can be excited by ultraviolet photons; they are also seen in the H II regions around hot stars. Others, such as the multiply ionized species N V and O VI , require higher energies. The relative strengths of the various lines can be understood if they are photoionized by radiation from the nucleus; its soft X-rays excite the high-ionization lines. Figure 9.3 illustrates a basic model for an active nucleus. In the broad-line region , gas forms dense clouds with n H ∼ > 10 10 atoms cm − 3 . From most Seyfert nuclei, we see continuum radiation with wavelengths λ< 912 ̊ A, shortward of the Lyman limit. These photons would be absorbed if they had to travel through the broad-line emitting gas; so the clouds must cover up only a small fraction of the central source. The emission lines we observe are the sum of Doppler-shifted components from many individual clouds close to the nucleus, each moving at thousands of kilometers per second. As the continuum radiation waxes and wanes, so do the broad emission lines. High-ionization lines follow the continuum with a delay of a few days. Those of low ionization respond later, within a few weeks, showing that they originate further from the nucleus. The narrow emission lines, such as [O II ] at 3727 ̊ A and [O III ] at 5007 ̊ A, come from forbidden transitions; see Section 1.2. Forbidden lines are seen only when the density n H ∼ < 10 8 atoms cm − 3 ; at normal laboratory densities, collisions would knock the ion out of its excited state before a photon could be emitted. The forbidden lines of Seyfert galaxies and quasars have widths corresponding to velocities below 1000 km s − 1 . Forbidden lines have not been observed to vary as the nucleus brightens, indicating that they originate further from the nucleus than the broad lines. The narrow-line region is generally a few kiloparsecs across, although in some objects ionized gas has been seen hundreds of kiloparsecs from the center. It is probably a combination of gas glowing in response to the active nucleus and material ionized by massive stars nearby. Further reading: on the emission-line spectra of active nuclei, see D. E. Osterbrock and G. J. Ferland, 2005, Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei , 2nd edition (University Science Books, Mill Valley, California).

Radiation from the disk and jet photoionizes the dense fast-moving clouds of the broad-line region, which is often ∼ < 1pc across. The more diffuse and slower-moving gas of the narrow-line region is at larger radii. Observers looking directly down the jet would see a brilliant Seyfert 1 nucleus; but when it is viewed sideways, through the opaque accretion torus (gray), we have a Seyfert 2 galaxy. Intermediate classes are used to indicate their strength; a galaxy with fairly weak broad wings might be labelled a Seyfert 1.8 or 1.9. Some Seyfert 2 galaxies, including NGC 4258, have been observed in polarized light: the spectrum then resembles that of a Seyfert 1, with broad emission lines. Reflected light is gener- ally polarized; that is why polaroid sunglasses reduce the glare of light reflected from snow or water. Seyfert 2 galaxies probably have a hidden broad-line region, which we can see only by the reflection of its light in a layer of dust or gas. Figure 9.3 illustrates how a galaxy could appear as either a Seyfert 1 or a Seyfert 2, depending on the viewing angle. This object would be a Seyfert 1 nucleus for observers looking down on the central disk. For those viewing the galaxy close to the plane of the inner disk (as we do for NGC 4258), the continuum source and the broad-line region are hidden by the doughnut-shaped accretion torus ; they would see a Seyfert 2 nucleus.

Roughly 10% of all Sa and Sb spirals have them, so either all these galaxies spend about 10% of their lives as Seyferts, or one in ten of them has a long-lasting Seyfert nucleus. Most Seyfert galaxies are fairly luminous with L > 0 . 3 L , where L of Equation 1.24 represents the luminosity of a sizable galaxy. But NGC 4395, a tiny Sd galaxy with M B =− 17 . 1or L B ∼ 10 9 L \u0005 ∼ 0 . 05 L , has a Seyfert 1 nucleus. The spectra of Seyfert 2 nuclei often show absorption lines characteristic of hot massive stars; there is a starburst in addition to the nuclear activity. About 25% of Sa and Sb galaxies have low-ionization nuclear emission regions , known as LINERs . These are less luminous than Seyfert 2 nuclei, and have spectra with emission lines such as [O I ] at 6300 ̊ A and [S II ] at 6716 ̊ A and 6731 ̊ A, which do not require high energies for their excitation. The ratios of the line strengths suggest that the gas is ionized as it passes through shock waves. In LINERs [N II ] lines at 6548 ̊ A and 6583 ̊ A are normally stronger than H α , unlike for the galaxies of Figure 5.24. In star-forming systems, [O III ] at 5007 ̊ A is strong relative to H β only when [N II ] / H α is weak, while in active nuclei both ratios are normally > 1 / 3. In large surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF, we use these ratios to select galaxies with LINER or Seyfert nuclei. How does the galaxy feed gas into the central black hole? The fuel required is usually less than the mass lost by aging stars in a sizable galaxy. Large quantities of molecular gas, above 10 8 M \u0005 , have been found in the central regions of some nearby Seyfert galaxies. But several nearby disk galaxies, including our Milky Way, have gas at their centers, and nuclear black holes exceeding 10 6 M \u0005 – with little or no nuclear activity. The presence of dilute gas or stars near the black hole is insufficient to fuel activity. Large concentrations of massive stars could move the interstellar gas around, aiding the accretion. Intense star formation is often found in Seyfert nuclei, supporting this idea. But many radio galaxies conspicuously lack any sign of starbirth.

As they age, stars like those in the solar neighborhood eject about M \u0005 per year of gas for each 10 10 L \u0005 of stars. If all the gas lost by stars in our Galaxy could be funnelled into the center, and 10% of its mass released as energy, how bright would the Milky Way’s nucleus be? 9.1.2 Radio galaxies If our eyes could see in radio wavelengths, many of the brightest objects in the sky would not be within our Milky Way; they would be the luminous active nuclei of galaxies halfway across the Universe.

Radio galaxies are much rarer than Seyfert nuclei: Table 9.1 shows that there is only one for every 10 4 normal galaxies.

The stronger"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"376 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies the radio source, the bigger the lobes tend to be; the largest are ∼ 3 Mpc across. To allow time for emitting material to fill the lobes, the nucleus must have been active for at least 10–50 million years. When the radio source is less powerful, the lobes are smaller; in Seyfert galaxies, they often fit within the optical image of the galaxy, as in Figure 9.2. The lobes are optically thin and are brightest at low radio frequencies. Within them are luminous ‘hot spots’ with sizes of ∼ 1 kpc. About 10% of these emit polarized visible light, also synchrotron radiation. We often approximate a radio spectrum as L ν ∝ ν − α ; (9.5) in the lobes, the spectral index α is usually 0 . 7 ∼ < α ∼ < 1 . 2. The active nucleus is seen as a core radio source, only a few parsecs across. The cores have spectral index α ∼ 0; in contrast to the lobes, they are brightest at higher radio frequencies. The cores are optically thick , and low-frequency radiation has the most difficulty in escaping. Many cores vary in luminosity over periods of a year or less; so they must be less than a light-year across. Narrow bright jets of emission are often seen to emerge from deep within the central core. Some of these are two-sided, while others are visible on only one side of the galaxy. The path of the jet shows where energy is channelled outward from the nucleus to the radio lobes; we will see below that this matter moves at near-light speeds when it is close to the galactic nucleus. Some jets also emit synchrotron radiation at optical and X-ray wavelengths. The optical jet of the radio galaxy M87, shown in Figure 9.5, was already noted as a ‘curious straight ray’ in a 1918 report by H. D. Curtis. Much later, M87 was discovered to be a radio galaxy; the radio jet coincides with the optical jet and is also bright in X- rays. Galaxies with large radio lobes turn out to be giant ellipticals and cD galaxies. Often, they are the brightest galaxies in a cluster. Most radio galaxies appear fairly normal in visible light, although some, especially the more powerful, are very peculiar objects indeed. Many have blue colors, and signs of recent star formation at the center. Their nuclei can show an emission-line spectrum similar to that of a Seyfert: an example is the bizarre elliptical NGC 1275 in Perseus (Figure 7.9). When a radio source is present in a less luminous elliptical that is orbiting within the cluster, its motion through the hot cluster gas can sweep the jets sideways into a ‘C’ shape. The top right and lower left panels of Figure 9.4 show a narrow-tail and a wide-tail source, respectively. A relative paucity of cool gas appears to favor strong radio emission: radio galaxies are always ellipticals, while Seyfert galaxies are generally spirals. Seyfert galaxies are weaker radio sources than the radio galaxies. The core produces a larger fraction of their emission, and, if twin lobes are present, they are only a few kiloparsecs across, as in Figure 9.2. It is as though the radio lobes are ‘smothered’ by the dense gas around a Seyfert nucleus."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"9.1 Active galactic nuclei 377 Fig. 9.5.

Biretta. 9.1.3 Synchrotron emission from radio galaxies The energy stored in the lobes of a giant radio galaxy is enormous. To estimate it, we use results from the books by Longair and by Shu, which readers should consult for more detail. Longair uses SI units, and Shu the cgs system which is still common in astronomical publications. An accelerated charge q radiates away its energy E at the rate − d E d t = q 2 | a | 2 6 π\u001a 0 c 3 (SI) or 2 q 2 | a | 2 3 c 3 (cgs) , (9.6) where a is the acceleration in the frame where the charge is instantaneously at rest (see formula 3.9 of Longair’s book or Chapter 16 of Shu’s). The radiation is polarized, with its electric vector perpendicular to the direction of the acceleration: we can think of the charge dragging its electric field lines along as it moves, as in Figure 9.6. In a uniform magnetic field B , an electron spirals around the field lines with frequency ν L = eB 2 π m e (SI) or eB 2 π m e c (cgs) .

An electron spirals with speed V ≈ c around a magnetic field pointing into the page; its radiation is beamed forward in the direction of travel. The acceleration of an electron moving with speed V at an angle θ to the field lines is then a = 2 πν L V sin θ , so we can use Equation 9.6 to calculate the energy that it loses through cyclotron radiation at frequency ν L . The radiation is emitted in a dipole pattern, so its intensity is highest in the direction of that component of the electron’s motion that is perpendicular to the field. Because of their larger mass, protons are less strongly accelerated, and their radiation is weaker by the factor ( m p / m e ) 2 ≈ 3 × 10 6 . As its speed V → c , the electron’s inertia increases. Its orbital frequency drops to ν L /γ , where γ ≡ 1 / \u0017 1 − V 2 / c 2 , but the frequency of its radiation increases by a factor γ 2 . When the electron moves relativistically, with γ \u0012 1, it emits synchrotron radiation ; almost all of the radiation propagating ahead of it is squeezed into a narrow cone, within an angle 1 /γ of the forward direction. In Figure 9.7, the emission is beamed toward us only during the small interval"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"9.1 Active galactic nuclei 379 \b t ∼ 2 /ν L when the electron is between points A and B. The arrival of that energy is squeezed into an even shorter time. Photons from point B are emitted later than those from A by a time \b t , but their arrival is delayed only by \b t (1 − V / c ) ≈ \b t / (2 γ 2 ) ∼ 1 / ( γ 2 ν L ) . (9.8) Thus the frequency of the light received is not ν L /γ , but roughly γ 2 ν L . A more accurate calculation (see Chapter 18 of both Longair’s book and Shu’s book) shows that most power is emitted close to the frequency ν c = 3 2 γ 2 ν L = 4 . 2 γ 2 \u0003 B 1 G or 10 − 6 T \u0004 MHz . (9.9) Problem 9.4 Show that, in a radio lobe where B ≈ 10 μ G, an electron radiating at 5 GHz must have γ ∼ 10 4 . Equation 9.6 tells us how fast the electron loses its energy. We first compute its four-velocity \u0019 u and four-vector acceleration \u0019 a = d \u0019 u / d τ , where τ is the proper time of Equation 8.9. In the instantaneous restframe of the spiralling electron \u0019 a = (0 , a ), so | a | 2 of Equation 9.6 is equal to |\u0019 a ·\u0019 a | . But \u0019 a ·\u0019 a is a Lorentz invariant, the same for all uniformly moving observers; we can compute it in our observer’s frame. There, d t / d τ = γ ; apart from radiative losses, γ remains constant as the electron circles the field lines, so we have \u0019 u ≡ d \u0019 x d τ = d \u0019 x d t d t d τ = γ \u0003 1 v \u0004 and d \u0019 u d τ = γ 2 \u0003 0 d v / d t \u0004 =\u0019 a . (9.10) Since | d v / d t |= 2 π ( ν L /γ ) V sin θ , the product |\u0019 a ·\u0019 a |= (2 πγν L V sin θ ) 2 ; the radiated energy − d E / d t ∝ γ 2 . (Compare this with Longair’s derivation of formula 18.5.) To calculate how fast the energy of an average electron decays, we assume that they move in random directions, so that sin 2 θ averages to 2 / 3. When γ \u0012 1, the energy loss is − d E d t = 4 3 σ T cU mag γ 2 , where U mag = B 2 2 μ 0 (SI) , or B 2 8 π (cgs) .

(9.13) For the fields of 10 − 5 G believed to be typical in radio lobes, the life of electrons emitting at 5 GHz is about 10 million years. But those responsible for the higher- frequency optical and X-ray synchrotron radiation of jets and hotspots lose their energy much more rapidly. In ambient magnetic fields of ∼ 10 − 4 G, electrons radiating visible light at 10 15 Hz lose half their energy in 10 3 –10 4 years, and those producing X-rays last no more than 100 years. Since the emitting regions lie many kiloparsecs from the galaxy’s center, electrons must be boosted to high energies when they are well outside the nucleus. They are probably accelerated as they pass through shock waves in the jet, and are then scattered by tangled magnetic fields. Further X-ray and γ -ray emission can be produced by the synchrotron-self- Compton process. As radio-frequency photons scatter off relativistic electrons, the photon energy is increased by a factor ∼ γ 2 . Equation 9.11 relates the power output L ν at frequency ν from a volume V , filled with a number density n of electrons radiating at that frequency, to the total energy U e in the emitting electrons. We have L ν ∝ n VE 2 B 2 , while U e = n VE ∝ L ν B − 3 / 2 . (9.14) The energy required to produce the observed emission is the sum of the electron energy U e , which is lower in a stronger magnetic field, and the magnetic energy U mag ∝ V B 2 , which becomes larger. The source’s total energy is minimized close to equipartition , when U mag ≈ U e . For the lobes of giant radio galaxies, this amounts to 10 59 –10 61 erg; 10 60 erg represents the luminosity of 10 10 suns over a gigayear, or the emission of a powerful radio source for 10 7 years. The energy stored in the compact core and jets is much less, only 10 52 –10 58 erg. We have hardly any other information on the field strength and electron energy in radio sources, and we tend to assume that they are close to these equipartition values. Typically B = 1–10 μ Gor10 − 11 –10 − 12 T for the giant radio lobes, about the same strength as near the Sun’s position in the disk of the Milky Way. Fields in the radio jets are about ten times higher. In the very compact cores, the equipartition magnetic fields are about 0.1 G. So electrons emitting at 5 GHz have γ ∼ 100, and can radiate for only about 100 years. 9.1.4 Quasars Quasars are active nuclei so bright as to outshine their host galaxies: all but the closest appear quasi-stellar in optical images.

Right, radio-loud objects (those with R L > 1, shaded) are rarely found among the less luminous quasars with L < 10 12 L \u0005 – J. McDowell. L V ∼ > 5 L or 10 11 L \u0005 ; fainter objects would be labelled Seyfert 1 nuclei. Quasars are the most luminous objects known and have been observed with redshifts z > 6, when the Universe was no more than one-seventh of its present size. Curiously, the spectra of quasars look very similar at all redshifts. It is difficult to estimate the composition of the broad-line clouds, but the relative strength of the lines shows that they have at least the solar abundance of heavy elements. Just less than a gigayear after the Big Bang, the central parts of some galaxies have already formed, and a first generation of stars has polluted the gas with metals. The spectral energy distribution of a quasar is very different from that of a normal galaxy, with substantial power all the way from the radio to γ -rays. Only a few percent of quasars are strong radio sources (see Table 9.1). In the radio-quiet remainder, Figure 9.8 shows that the radio power is ∼ < 1% of its level in the loud variety. The central core and the jets of a radio-loud quasar are typically 10–100 times stronger than in radio galaxies; the core accounts for a larger fraction of the emission compared with the extended lobes. The quasars showing the highest optical polarization, and some of the blazars (see below), emit most of their energy as γ -rays: Figure 9.9 shows that ν F ν in γ -rays can be ten times as large as in the radio, millimeter, optical, or X-ray parts of the spectrum. In the same way as for Seyfert 2 nuclei, a quasar can be hidden from us by the dense gas of the accretion torus shown in Figure 9.3, which conceals the clouds producing the broad emission lines. In these Type 2 quasars , we do not see the inner torus that gives out most of the optical and ultraviolet light, and the emission lines are less than 2000 km s − 1 broad. We have found only the most luminous of them, from their powerful X-ray emission and very strong lines of [O III ] at 5007 ̊ A. In both Seyfert 2 galaxies and Type 2 quasars, the intense radiation shining through the dense gas of the torus can power water masers beamed toward us and radiating at 22.2 GHz, like that in NGC 4258."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"382 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 0.001eV 1eV 1keV 1MeV 1GeV 9 10111213141516171819202122232425 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 radio visible X-ray gamma Fig. 9.9.

The lower-energy peaks in the ultraviolet and X-ray regions represent synchrotron radiation from electrons in the jet; these photons scatter from the same spiralling electrons to produce the γ -ray peak. When the electrons are more energetic, both peaks move to higher frequency – G. Fossati. Figure 8.13 shows that the very brightest active nuclei of all kinds were most common at z ∼ 2, roughly 3 Gyr after the Big Bang. Then we see 30 − 100 times more quasars than in the local Universe, while at z ∼ 5 the density was only a few times larger than at present. Less luminous active nuclei show a pattern more like star-forming galaxies (look ahead to Figure 9.17), being most common closer to z ∼ 1. Nuclear activity is characteristic of a galaxy’s youth, and the masses of black holes in galaxies today tell us that it must be a passing phase. Equation 9.4 tells us that in a quasar shining at 10 12 L \u0005 the central black hole has M BH ∼ > 3 × 10 7 M \u0005 , and must put on weight at ∼ > M \u0005 per year while it maintains that power. So, if activity lasts for at least 100 Myr, a mass of at least 10 9 M \u0005 should remain. No nearby galaxy has a black hole as massive as 10 10 M \u0005 (Figure 6.23): so quasars probably do not remain as bright as 10 12 L \u0005 for longer than ∼ 1 Gyr. But, just as for radio galaxies, activity is likely to continue for at least 100 Myr. How does the active nucleus ‘know’ about the galaxy in which it lives, so that the black hole can grow large enough to produce the relation that we see in Figure 6.23 between its mass and the random stellar speeds? Probably they are connected through star formation. Despite their intense radiation, quasars contain dense molecular gas. Radio emission from CO molecules has been found in a few dozen objects at redshifts z > 2; half of them are quasars, along with a few radio galaxies. In the high-redshift quasar J1148 at z = 6 . 4, roughly 10 10 M \u0005 of molecular gas orbits 2.5 kpc from the center at almost 300 km s − 1 . On average, quasars detected in CO contain ∼ (10 10 − 10 11 ) M \u0005 of molecular gas. J1148 emits 10 13 L \u0005 in the far-infrared.

Problem 9.5 Show that the mass within the orbiting molecular gas of J1148 is M orbit ∼ 5 × 10 9 M \u0005 . The quasar’s bolometric luminosity is roughly L bol = 4 × 10 40 W; use Equation 9.4 to show that the central mass M BH ∼ > 3 × 10 9 M \u0005 . The black hole and the molecular gas account for almost all of M orbit ; the galaxy probably lacks the massive bulge that we would expect on the basis of Figure 6.23. Some quasars show very broad absorption lines with widths up to 10 000 km s − 1 , at redshifts that imply that the absorbing material moves toward us at speeds ∼ 0 . 1 c . The most prominent lines are those of ions such as Si IV , C IV ,N V , and O VI , which require high energies for their excitation. The absorbing gas is dense, with 10 19 –10 21 atoms cm − 2 . Few radio-loud quasars show broad absorption lines: they may lack gas in the required form. We do not know whether the 15% of quasars with broad absorption lines are different from those without, or whether every quasar has clouds of dense gas along the line of sight to 15% of all possible observers. We do not know exactly how the quasar throws this absorbing gas outward at such high speeds. For example, the broad absorption might be produced if our line of sight passed by chance through one of the broad-line emitting clouds. Another possibility is that absorption takes place in supernova remnants, in a dense star clus- ter around the quasar; this would explain why the gas is metal-rich. Or the absorb- ing material may be propelled outward by the pressure of the quasar’s radiation. 9.2 Fast jets in active nuclei, microquasars, and γ -ray bursts The central compact radio cores of quasars and radio galaxies are only a few parsecs across, but they can be mapped by very long baseline interferometry (see Section 5.2) to reveal features less than a milli-arcsecond across. The majority show a bright inner core with an elongated feature or a series of blobs stretching for 10–50 pc away from it. Where the outer, kiloparsec-scale jet is one-sided, the central elongated feature always lies on the same side as the jet. Figure 9.10 shows the jet of BL Lac. Close to the inner core, the jet of blobs is often curved through tens of degrees, but its outer parts are aligned with the larger-scale jet. So the material of the outer jets, which can be hundreds of kiloparsecs long, must have been focussed into a narrow beam within a parsec of the galaxy center. Nearly all compact cores are variable, changing their luminosity over days, weeks, or months. Times of peak brightness coincide with the appearance of new blobs, which travel out along corkscrew paths as they fade, as in Figure 9.10. In about half the well-studied cores, motion is superluminal : the blobs appear to"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"384 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies Fig. 9.10.

Denn. move away from the core with transverse speeds of (3 − 50) c . These high apparent speeds arise because the emitting gas is moving toward us at speeds close to that of light. The one-sidedness of the parsec-scale jet is only apparent; the approaching side is enormously brightened by relativistic beaming. In the 1990s astronomers learned that the compact remnants of stars can also shoot out narrow jets of material at near-light speeds. In microquasars , jets emerge as mass captured from a binary companion forms an accretion disk around a black hole or neutron star. Supernovae marking the violent death of a very massive star can produce twin relativistic jets that are seen as gamma-ray bursts . 9.2.1 Superluminal motion and relativistic beaming To understand these apparently superluminal speeds, consider an observer who sees a blob of jet material approaching at speed V , on a course making an angle θ with the line of sight (Figure 9.11). The blob passes point S at time t = 0, and point T at a time \b t later. Radiation emitted at T reaches our observer later than radiation from S; but, because T is closer, the interval between the two arrivals is only \b t obs = \b t (1 − V cos θ/ c ) . (9.15) In this time, the blob has travelled a distance V \b t sin θ across the sky, so its apparent transverse speed is V obs = V sin θ 1 − V cos θ/ c . (9.16) As V → c , the blob’s motion can appear faster than light."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"9.2 Fast jets in active nuclei, microquasars, and γ -ray bursts 385 θ S T V Δ t V Δ t sin θ Fig. 9.11. Luminous blobs ejected at angle θ to the line of sight can appear to move superluminally across the sky if their speed V ≈ c . Problem 9.6 Defining γ = 1 / \u0017 1 − V 2 / c 2 , show that V obs ≤ γ V , with equality when cos θ = V / c , and that V obs can exceed c only if V > c / √ 2. Expansion speeds in blazars are most often around (5–10) c ; thus the blobs must move outward with γ ∼ > 5–10, which is well below the average energy that Equation 9.9 gave us for the radiating electrons. We will observe superluminal motion only in jets that point within an angle 1 /γ of our direction, which is less than 10 ◦ in most cases. But, because the radiation is beamed in the direction of the jet’s motion, those cores where the jet points toward us will appear much brighter. To calculate this brightening, we recall that, for the stationary observer, atomic clocks aboard an emitting blob appear to run slow by a factor of γ . But, by Equation 9.15, its forward motion multiplies observed time intervals by the factor (1 − V cos θ/ c ). So radiation emitted over a time \b t blob with frequency ν e in the restframe of the blob arrives during an interval \b t obs at frequency ν obs , where \b t obs = \b t blob [ γ (1 − V cos θ/ c )] , and ν obs = ν e [ γ (1 − V cos θ/ c )] − 1 . (9.17) Thus, when γ \u0012 1 and the jet moves toward us, so that θ ≈ 0, we have \b t obs ∼ \b t blob / (2 γ ). Just as in our discussion of synchrotron radiation, the observer sees all the emission squeezed into a narrow cone, within an angle 1 /γ of the direction of motion. If the radiation is isotropic in the blob’s restframe, this brightens an approaching blob by a factor ∼ (2 γ ) 2 . The photons are blueshifted according to Equation 9.17, which also expands their frequency range. Gathering all the factors, we find that the flux F ν ( ν ) received at frequency ν from a single blob, which in its restframe emits a power L ν ∝ ν − α , is amplified by ∼ (2 γ ) 3 + α when it moves directly toward the observer. The blob appears dimmed by the same factor when receding. If oppositely directed twin jets are made up of a series of identical blobs, and each radiates for a fixed time as measured in its restframe, then Equation 9.17 shows that the observed lifetime of approaching blobs is shortened. Thus the jet pointed directly at us is brightened only by the"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"386 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies factor (2 γ ) 2 + α , while the receding jet is dimmed by the same factor. For compact cores, α ∼ 0; thus, when γ ∼ 5–10, the jet travelling toward the observer appears (2 γ ) 4 ∼ 10 4 –10 6 times brighter than that heading away. Often, we see only the material heading toward us, as a one-sided jet; the receding half is almost invisible. We have a much better chance of detecting as bright sources those objects for which the jet points nearly in our direction, which explains why about half of observed bright radio cores show superluminal motion. Blazars always have strong radio emission from a compact core. They are generally found in ellipticals; probably they are radio galaxies where we look directly down the jet. Its relativistic motion makes the approaching half of the jet appear so bright as to outshine the accretion disk and the line-emitting regions. Blazars are strongly variable; some have doubled their optical and radio brightness over a few days. This fast variation is natural, since by Equation 9.17 the time for any change in the jet’s luminosity is shortened by the factor γ (1 − V cos θ/ c ). The visible light of most quasars is polarized at levels of a few percent, indicating that part of it may be synchrotron radiation from the jet. But in blazars, polarization can be as high as 20%; much more of the radiation comes from the jet. Only one in every thousand quasars is a blazar; but, because they are brightened by forward beaming, these objects account for a few percent of observed bright quasars. 9.2.2 Microquasars: relativistic jets in stellar binaries In the 1990s, astronomers were startled to discover radio jets emerging at close to light speed from stellar-mass black holes. In a microquasar , a massive star transfers mass onto an accretion disk around a black-hole or neutron-star companion. These systems were long known as X-ray sources, and about 10% of them are also radio- loud; so the fast jets should not have come as a surprise. The jets are quite narrow, with opening angles less than 10 ◦ , and the radio emission is synchrotron, just as in active nuclei. At least two of the dozen or so known microquasars show superluminal motion. Because the central mass is only a few M \u0005 , the accretion disk around a microquasar is hotter than that in an active nucleus, and emits most of its power as X-rays rather than ultraviolet light. To calculate its temperature, we look at the energy lost by a gas cloud of mass m in circular orbit around a mass M BH , moving from radius r to r − \b r . Its initial energy is E =− Gm M BH 2 r , so \b E =− Gm M BH 2 r 2 \b r . (9.18) This energy is transferred to the portion of the disk between r and r + \b r , which must get rid of it. If it does that by radiating as a blackbody at temperature T , its luminosity is σ SB T 4 per unit area. Remembering that a disk has two sides, when"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"9.2 Fast jets in active nuclei, microquasars, and γ -ray bursts 387 a mass ̇ M flows inward per unit time we have G ̇ MM BH 2 r 2 \b r = σ SB T 4 × 4 π r \b r , so T 4 ( r ) = G ̇ MM BH 8 π r 3 σ SB . (9.19) If the inflowing mass is converted to energy with some efficiency \u001a ≈ 10%, we can measure ̇ M in units of the mass L E / ( \u001a c 2 ) required to radiate at the Eddington luminosity of Equation 9.4. Writing r in units of the Schwarzschild radius R s = 2 G M BH / c 2 ,wehave T 4 ( r ) = 1 G M BH \u0003 r R s \u0004 − 3 \u0003 ̇ M L E / ( \u001a c 2 ) \u0004 c 5 m p 16 \u001aσ T σ SB . (9.20) So the temperature near the inner edge of a disk accreting near its Eddington limit decreases with the mass of the black hole, as M − 1 / 4 BH . These arguments are not quite right, since we have ignored the fact that matter can fall in only when angular momentum is carried outward in the disk. Since energy is transported along with it, the disk at r \u0012 R s radiates three times as much energy as is given by Equation 9.19, while the inner disk radiates less. Problem 9.7 Recall from Problem 3.20 that the last stable orbit around a non- rotating black hole is at 3 R s . Show that, when M BH = M \u0005 and ̇ M is near the Eddington limit, the inner edge of the disk is at T ≈ 3 × 10 7 K, corresponding to a photon energy of 2.6 keV. Assuming that the orbital speed of material there is given by Equation 3.20, show that the orbital period P ≈ 3 × 10 − 4 s. The material is already collimated into a narrow jet within 10 AU of the central source, and the jet travels for a few parsecs rather than megaparsecs. We can watch as bright clumps travel out from the nucleus and fade within a month or two rather than over decades or centuries, as in an active nucleus. These clumps seem to be ejected when the source enters an X-ray-bright state – perhaps as material in the accretion disk swirls rapidly inward and onto the central object. The jet may speed up, so we see bright knots of radio emission as the faster material runs into the slower plasma ahead of it. Microquasars are a remarkable demonstration that gravitational and electromagnetic forces can operate on all spatial scales. Further reading: Chapter 16 of M. S.

They are short, intense spurts of γ -rays, with peak energies"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"388 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies around 1 MeV and a low-energy tail of X-rays. They last typically 500 s or less, and appear to arrive from random directions in the sky. Since γ -ray telescopes cannot normally pinpoint a source more closely than to within ∼ 1 ◦ on the sky, none was identified with an optically-visible object until the Beppo-SAX satellite began observing in 1997. Once it detected a burst, Beppo-SAX could point immediately to take an X-ray image with 3 \u0006 resolution, good enough to tell optical astronomers where to look. ‘Long’ bursts lasting 2 s or more are typically found in star-forming galaxies. We have now identified the optical counterparts of about a hundred GRBs, at redshifts up to 6.3. A long burst lasts 50 s on average, but most are made up of many short sub- pulses that peak and fade within 1 − 100 ms. So the emitting region must be smaller than a light-millisecond or 300 km, the Schwarzschild radius for a 100 M \u0005 black hole. The bursts must be caused by objects of stellar mass, rather than the giant black holes found at galaxy centers. We never find repeated GRBs from the same spot, which suggests that they originate from some catastrophic event: a massive star exploding, or perhaps one black hole merging with another, or with a neutron star. We see roughly one GRB for every 100 000 supernovae, but this is likely to be a small fraction of the total. Like blazars, GRBs beam their luminous material in narrow jets. If they radiated equally in all directions, the energy of a typical burst would be an astounding 10 52 − 10 54 erg, or nearly M \u0005 c 2 . The radiation from a normal supernova, and the energy of motion in its ejected outer layers, amount to only ∼ 10 51 erg. The jet’s opening angle θ is typically 1 ◦ –20 ◦ , so the energy required from each burst is reduced by a factor θ 2 to only 10 50 − 10 51 erg, which is within the energy budget of a supernova. But we fail to detect most bursts because the jet is not pointing in our direction. The radiating material is expanding at close to light speed. Otherwise, the γ -rays would be so tightly packed that they could not escape, but would lose their energy in producing particle–antiparticle pairs. To avoid that fate, the ‘fireball’ must expand with Lorenz factor γ ≡ \u0017 1 − V 2 / c 2 > 100. Emission from material heading directly toward us is boosted by a factor (2 γ ) 4 , so nearly all the energy we receive is from a small cone where the outward motion is directed within an angle 1 /γ of our line of sight. As outgoing material slows and γ drops, this cone widens to include a larger fraction of the radiating volume. Equation 9.17 shows that we see the burst compressed in time by 1 / (2 γ ), compared with an observer moving with the outflowing gas. The gamma-rays are probably synchrotron radiation, produced by fast electrons accelerated by shocks in the outflowing relativistic material. Along with the X-rays, we often see an afterglow in optical and radio bands. Absorption lines at visible wavelengths let us measure the redshift of the host galaxy. The light is usually polarized, suggesting that it is synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated in shocks as the jet runs into the surrounding gas. The visible afterglow starts to dim more rapidly after 1–100 days, which may mark"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"9.2 Fast jets in active nuclei, microquasars, and γ -ray bursts 389 the time when outflowing material has slowed so that 1 /γ ∼ θ , so we receive radiation from the entire approaching jet. The jet also begins to expand sideways (since the opening angle is now comparable to the Mach number M ∼ 1 /γ ), causing its density and emissivity to drop. The radio afterglow becomes strong only a day or so after the burst, and can remain fairly bright for a year or more. During this time the outward motion slows to well below c and the expansion becomes spherical, so we can reliably estimate the total energy in the outward- moving material. Many bursts seem to have roughly the same amount of energy in the relativistic outflow, roughly 10 51 erg divided between prompt emission and the afterglow. After some long bursts, the declining curve of visible light shows a bump that rises to a maximum after ∼ 20(1 + z ) days and then fades. In some well-observed cases, broad emission lines identify the bump as the light of a Type Ic supernova that exploded at the same time as the burst. Such an explosion is thought to mark the end of life for a rotating star that had a mass of (20 − 40) M \u0005 when it was on the main sequence. As the star’s iron core collapses, enough other material may join it that the core cannot become a stable neutron star, but forms a black hole instead. The rest of the star’s material has too much angular momentum to fall directly into the black hole. Most of it is expelled in the explosion, but ∼ 0 . 1 M \u0005 is thought to form a short-lived accretion disk around the black hole, which channels twin outflowing jets as shown in Figure 9.3. Short GRBs, lasting less than 2 s, have a much fainter afterglow. The first was identified only in 2005; GRB 050724 was relatively close, in an elliptical galaxy at z = 0 . 26. The burst itself was at least ten times fainter than a typical long burst, and the afterglow at least a hundred times dimmer. This may have been a merger between two neutron stars (expected to be 10 000 times rarer than a supernova), or even between a neutron star and a black hole. These bursts would be shorter than one from a collapsing massive star because both partners are already very compact. Gamma-ray bursts may have been relatively more frequent in the early Uni- verse, since it is easier to make very massive stars when metals are absent from the gas. (If these first-generation stars were all massive, and have now ended their lives, this would explain why we see none in the Milky Way today.) Gamma-rays are neither scattered by dust nor readily absorbed by the interstellar gas, so they can help us to probe starbirth in the most distant galaxies. Some of the bursts detected by our present γ -ray telescopes are likely to be at redshifts z ∼ 10 or higher, too distant for us to see the afterglow at longer wavelengths. If a better understanding allows us to estimate redshifts from the X-ray and γ -ray emission, we could use GRBs to trace the earliest massive stars. Further reading: J. I.

Most of the lines are narrow; their widths correspond to internal motions slower than 100 km s − 1 , although their redshifts imply that the gas is travelling away from the quasar and toward us at almost light speed. In fact, this gas is nowhere near the quasar, but simply intercepts its light. Counting the baryons in galaxies and clusters today shows that their formation was not very efficient: recall Table 7.2. Most of the baryons remain in diffuse clouds, that we see only when they intercept the light of a distant source. This is the reservoir from which gas flowed into the nascent galaxies, and which continues to feed them to the present day. Absorption lines are usually identified in groups that show a simple pattern, such as the Lyman series of hydrogen, or doublets of magnesium and carbon. A small wavelength difference makes it easier, since a single measured spectrum is likely to show both lines of a pair. The Mg II lines at 2796.3 ̊ A and 2803.5 ̊ A fall into the visible window when the absorbing cloud’s redshift is 0 . 2 ∼ < z abs ∼ < 1 . 5, and the C IV lines at 1548.2 ̊ A and 1550.8 ̊ A do so for 1 . 1 ∼ < z abs ∼ < 3 . 5. The O VI lines at 1031.9 ̊ A and 1037.6 ̊ A are harder to observe, since they can be lost among the lines of the Lyman- α forest (see below). Once the absorption redshift is known, isolated lines of other elements can often be found. The intergalactic gas ranges from clouds of largely neutral material, which are as dense as present-day galactic disks, to diffuse gas where the fraction of neutral atoms is 10 − 3 or less. The number N of absorption lines with N (H I ) hydrogen atoms along the line of sight approximately follows N ∝ N (H I ) − 1 . 5 : the very diffuse clouds are the most common, but the densest of them contain almost all of the neutral gas. The absorbing material is not pristine, but already contains heavy elements produced by nuclear burning in stars. 9.3.1 Neutral gas: damped Lyman- α clouds If the column density of neutral gas exceeds N (H I ) ≈ 2 × 10 20 cm − 2 , the Lyman- α (Ly α ) line is optically thick with prominent damping wings: these are called damped Ly α clouds. This gas density corresponds to 1 . 5 M \u0005 pc − 2 , which is typical for the outer H I disks of galaxies today: see Section 5.2. A Lyman-limit cloud has N (H I ) ∼ > 2 × 10 17 cm − 2 ; it absorbs almost all photons that have enough energy to ionize a hydrogen atom, so the quasar’s measured flux drops nearly to zero at wavelengths just short of 912(1 + z abs ) ̊ A. The damped Ly α clouds are largely neutral, but most of the hydrogen in the Lyman-limit clouds is ionized. The spectrum of Figure 9.12 shows a damped Ly α line with z abs = 2 . 827; the col- umn density is close to 2 × 10 20 cm − 2 .

Show that, for neutral clouds, M ≈ σμ m H N (H I ), where σ = π r 2 is the cross-section and N (H I ) the column density of hydrogen atoms.

Taking d N / d z = 0 . 2, and an average N (H I ) = 10 21 cm − 2 at z ∼ 2, show that for the benchmark cosmology d X / d z = 3 . 0 and \u0002 g ( z = 2) ≈ 10 − 3 . We saw in Table 7.2 that the neutral atomic and molecular gas now in galaxy disks corresponds to \u0002 g ∼ 8 × 10 − 4 , while stars in the disks of galaxies now make up \u0002 ∼ 6 × 10 − 4 . So there is about enough neutral gas in the damped Ly α clouds at z ∼ 2 to make the galaxy disks that we see today. But, if the benchmark cosmology is correct, \u0002 g has remained at this level over 6 Gyr between redshifts 0 . 7 ∼ < z ∼ < 5, when half of the stars in disks like the Milky Way’s were born. So we think that the damped Ly α clouds have been replenished, as more tenuous ionized gas flowed into them and became dense enough to recombine. Are the damped Ly α clouds simply gas in the disks of galaxies? We do not really know. The H I disks of nearby galaxies are large and numerous enough to account for the absorption features at z ∼ < 1. At least half of them should be caused by less luminous galaxies with L ≤ 0 . 2 L , since these have relatively large H I disks. When z abs < 1 . 5, we can often see a bright patch of stars within an arcsecond or so of the quasar on the sky, at the same redshift as the damped Ly α cloud. These systems are a mix of star-forming disk galaxies, irregulars, and compact knots of star formation, with luminosities 0 . 02 L < L < 3 L . At higher redshifts, Problem 9.8 shows that the galaxies must be larger or more numerous than they are today, to provide enough absorption lines. Lyman break galaxies at 2 ∼ < z ∼ < 3, selected because they are bright in the ultraviolet, usually give rise to Ly α absorption if they lie within 300 kpc of the path to a quasar. Typically,"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"9.3 Intergalactic gas 393 the closer the quasar’s light passes to the galaxy, the denser is the absorbing gas. Curiously, a third of Lyman break galaxies seem to produce no Ly α absorption at all. Problem 9.10 At present, the density of L galaxies is roughly n of Equation 1.24, or 0 . 02 h 3 Mpc − 3 . Figure 1.16 shows that about half of them are disk galax- ies, so, taking h = 0 . 7, we now have n 0 ≈ 0 . 003 Mpc − 3 bright spiral galaxies. At z ∼ 3, we see d N / d z ≈ 0 . 25. If galaxies had already assembled their disks by then, we would expect the density n ( z ) ≈ n 0 (1 + z ) 3 . For the benchmark cosmology, show that d X / d z = 3 . 6, and use Equation 9.21 to show that we must have σ = 2500 kpc 2 , so that the absorbing material extends to radii ∼ 30 kpc. Figure 5.15 shows that the H I disk of a galaxy like the Milky Way with M (H I ) = 10 10 M \u0005 extends almost to this radius. 9.3.2 Metals in the intergalactic gas Damped Ly α clouds contain metals and dust, as well as hydrogen and helium: we see lines of low ions such as Mg II ,Zn II , and Cr II along with high-ionization lines such as C IV and Si IV . In Figure 9.12, there is a cluster of C IV lines at z abs = 2 . 83 near 5920 ̊ A; they come from the same gas as is producing the damped Ly α absorption. In less dense clouds with N (H I ) ∼ > 10 16 cm − 2 , the strongest metal lines are of low-ionization species such as Mg II ,Si II , and O I , which in present- day galaxies are found along with neutral hydrogen in their disks. C IV and Si IV lines, which are characteristic of the diffuse hot gas of today’s galactic halos, become more common when N (H I ) is yet lower. Such complexes of metal lines are generally 300–500 km s − 1 wide, but the widths of individual components range down to 10 km s − 1 , corresponding to T ∼ < 10 5 K. A plasma in thermal equilibrium at this temperature would contain very few C IV ions; so the absorbing gas is probably ionized by intergalactic radiation from quasars, or by hot stars born within it. All damped Ly α clouds cause absorption in Mg II , but the reverse is not true. At a given redshift, lines of Mg II are about ten times as common as damped Ly α systems, while C IV lines are yet more frequent. So the gas responsible for the Mg II absorption must cover a larger area than that producing the damped Ly α features. Strong Mg II absorption generally occurs within 40 h − 1 Mpc, and weaker absorption up to 80 h − 1 Mpc, of a galaxy. Gas causing C IV absorption usually extends 50–100 kpc, but sometimes is seen 200 kpc away. Where gravitational lensing has produced multiple images of a quasar separated by ∼ 1 arcsec on the sky, the two light paths are ∼ 10 kpc apart as they pass through the absorber. Strong lines of C IV in the two quasar spectra differ when the paths to the images are separated by more than 20 − 50 kpc, giving the rough size of these complexes of absorbing clouds."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"394 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies 01234 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.5 1 − 2 − 1.5 − 1 − 0.5 0 12 11 10 9 7 5 2 Fig. 9.13. Abundance of zinc relative to hydrogen in gas clouds causing damped Ly α absorption: circled dots show the densest clouds with N (H I ) ≥ 10 21 cm − 2 , filled dots show less dense clouds, and downward triangles show upper limits. Horizontal bars show average abundances weighted by N (H I ); lookback time refers to the benchmark model. Zinc is not readily incorporated into dust grains, so its abundance in the gas indicates the total fraction of metals – after Kulkarni et al. 2005 ApJ 618 , 68. Just as in galactic halos, O VI absorption mainly comes from a thin layer around partially ionized warm clouds that absorb in C IV and Mg II . Sometimes the O VI lines are broad, as expected when T ∼ > 3 × 10 5 K and O VI is collisionally ionized at densities n ≥ 10 − 3 cm − 3 , over 100 times the cosmic mean. This gas may have been heated by shocks in outflowing winds from star-forming galaxies. Where we can also measure the column density N H of hydrogen in an absorb- ing cloud, we can use the strength of the metal lines to estimate the fraction of heavy elements in the gas. Figure 9.13 shows that the average metal abundance in the damped Ly α clouds has slowly risen over time. But it was still less than one-tenth of the solar value 8–10 Gyr ago, when the Milky Way’s disk made many of its stars. The gas of Figure 9.13 could not have been the gas from which the Milky Way’s disk formed: Table 2.1 and Figure 4.14 show that almost all the disk stars have Z > 0 . 1 Z \u0005 . But we saw in Figure 4.15 that galaxy disks are richer in heavy elements toward their centers, while the points in Figure 9.13 are more likely to represent a quasar shining through the metal-poor periphery of one. In the Milky Way, we noted in Section 2.4 that any cloud denser than N (H I ) = 10 20 cm − 2 becomes largely molecular. Hydrogen molecules in damped Ly α clouds would easily be seen since they absorb the quasar’s ultraviolet radiation; but in fact H 2 is rare. Probably the gas contains too little dust to allow molecules to form easily. In some damped Ly α clouds elements such as iron, that are readily incorporated into dust, are rarer with respect to those like zinc and silicon that are"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"9.3 Intergalactic gas 395 not. These clouds must have begun to produce a little dust, but the ratio of dust to gas is ∼ 30 times smaller than Equation 1.22 gives for the Milky Way. Absorption lines of C II ∗ , excited C + , at 1335.7 ̊ A indicate that far-ultraviolet photons are heating the dust grains, just as they do in the Milky Way. The heat is transmitted to the surrounding gas, and carbon excited to C II ∗ re-radiates most of it away at 158 μ m (see Table 2.5). From the strength of the C II ∗ absorption we can estimate how much heat is re-radiated; it is far more than can be supplied by the intergalactic radiation field. These damped Ly α clouds must have their own source of ultraviolet photons – they are forming stars. In a few cases, we have even seen the Ly α emission of those stars. The inferred pace of starbirth is rapid enough at redshifts z ∼ 2–4 that it would use up all the gas of the damped Ly α clouds within ∼ 2 Gyr – further evidence that those clouds are replenished from the reservoir of more diffuse gas. If these metal lines indeed trace gas that now lies in galaxies or galaxy groups, their redshifts should be clumped in much the same way as for the galaxies. As expected, if a C IV absorption line is detected, it is more probable to find a second line nearby in velocity, but the effect disappears for separations beyond 500 km s − 1 . The same is true for lines of O VI that lie closer together than 750 km s − 1 . These speeds are somewhat higher than the rotation speeds of galax- ies, or the velocity dispersion within groups of galaxies. But this is roughly the thickness of the velocity peaks in Figure 8.4, which correspond to looking through a wall or filament of galaxies. 9.3.3 The Lyman- α forest At column densities below N (H I ) ∼ 2 × 10 17 cm − 2 , ultraviolet photons penetrate through a gas cloud, and most of the hydrogen is ionized. When N (H I ) ∼ < 3 × 10 14 cm − 2 , we usually detect only the Ly α lines of hydrogen, although deep spectroscopy can reveal weak C IV and O VI lines. The dense profusion of hydrogen absorption lines at wavelengths just short of the quasar’s Ly α emission is the Lyman- α forest . While we detect the forest through its neutral hydrogen, almost all the gas is ionized; H I forms only a tiny fraction, often less than 0.1% of the total. But these clouds may be the Universe’s main repository of neutrons and protons. In Figure 9.12 we see that forest clouds can remove a substantial fraction of the quasar’s light just shortward of its Ly α emission line, leaving the average intensity lower than that on the long-wavelength side of the emission line: the Gunn–Peterson effect . Between the lines of the Ly α forest in Figure 9.12, the light level is the same on both sides of the emission line. The Ly α line saturates at N (H I ) ∼ 10 14 cm − 2 , so there must be hardly any H I gas between the absorbing clouds. This is typical for quasars at redshift z ∼ < 5 . 8. But in many objects with z ∼ > 6, we see a Gunn–Peterson trough : all the light just shortward of the Ly α emission line is missing, having been absorbed by diffuse neutral gas at z ∼ > 5 . 8. The earliest quasars and star-forming galaxies shone on gas that had become neutral at the time of recombination, at z rec ≈ 1100. They formed H II regions,"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"396 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies ‘islands’ of ionized gas like those around hot massive stars in the Milky Way. As the Universe expanded the densest gas clumped together into clouds, while more stars and quasars were born to ionize the smaller amount of diffuse gas that remained. The disappearance of the Gunn–Peterson trough tells us that at z ∼ 6 those completely ionized regions linked up to surround tiny islands of denser neutral gas. Quite abruptly, over ∼ 100 Myr, the Universe became transparent to ultraviolet radiation; it was reionized . After that, the ultraviolet light of a quasar was absorbed only where it encountered a cloud of neutral gas. What is the source of the ultraviolet photons that reionized the gas? Not the luminous quasars: Figure 8.13 tells us that before z ∼ 6 these were very rare, and contribute little. Can star-forming galaxies do the job? That depends on how much of their ultraviolet light escapes to intergalactic space, and how much denser the gas around them is than the cosmic average. Problem 2.24 shows that, as the surrounding density drops, a given galaxy or quasar can ionize a larger mass of gas. Large galaxies such as the ultraviolet-luminous objects of Figure 9.17 form in dense regions (see Figure 7.11). Thus handicapped, their stars are inadequate to the task. But dim galaxies are far more common than luminous ones (recall Figure 1.16), and predominate where the galaxy density is low; so the gas around them will be less dense. If all galaxies formed stars in proportion to their dark matter, most would individually be too faint for us to see, but together they could reionize the gas. However, we argued in Section 8.5 that most small clumps of dark matter should not make stars, or else the Milky Way would have far more satellites than we observe. Another suggestion is that the X-ray and ultraviolet light of numerous faint quasars provides the energy for reionization. We can estimate the level of ionizing radiation between the galaxies by looking at how the Ly α forest thins out near the quasar’s emission redshift. Clouds with z abs ≈ z em lie close enough to be affected by the quasar’s radiation, which boosts ionization so that very little H I remains. The redshift interval where the forest lines are sparse shows where that radiation makes a significant addition to the general intergalactic background. Measuring this proximity effect shows that over the range 1 . 6 < z < 4 the photons close to 912 ̊ A that can ionize a hydrogen atom amount to ∼ 3 × 10 − 22 erg cm − 2 s − 1 Hz − 1 sr − 1 . This corresponds to ν I ν ∼ 2nWm − 2 sr − 1 , somewhat higher than today (see Figure 1.19). With so many ionizing photons, only one hydrogen atom in 10 3 or 10 4 of the diffuse gas of the Ly α forest would remain neutral. The most diffuse clouds that we observe are only a few times denser than the cosmic mean. Their gas is too rarified to radiate energy so that it could cool and become denser; it is still fairly evenly mixed with dark matter in the filaments of the cosmic web of Figure 8.16. Observations of quasars lying close to each other on the sky with absorption lines at the same redshift show that at z ∼ 2 a filament of the Ly α forest gas can stretch for ∼ > 0 . 5 h − 1 Mpc.

If many stars were formed early in small galaxies, the products of their nucleosynthesis would be spread throughout the Ly α forest. How much of the heavy elements should they make? Adding up the ultraviolet light from the galaxies of Figure 9.17, we find that by z ∼ 2 . 5 they alone would produce enough metals to give an average abundance ∼ Z \u0005 / 30 if mixed evenly through the baryons. So why do we see only 0 . 001 Z \u0005 in the Ly α forest, which contains most of the baryons? This is known as the missing metals problem. For lack of definite information, we conclude that the missing metals are hidden in highly ionized states in hot gas that is too diffuse to cool. 9.4 The first galaxies Figure 9.14 shows part of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field , a region of the sky where deep images have been taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in four colors, roughly the U , B , i , and z passbands of Tables 1.2 and 1.3. Some of the galaxies in this field are small nearby objects, but others are known to have redshifts up to z ∼ 5. These look more irregular and asymmetric than present-day systems.

Local star-forming galaxies are also apt to look ragged in the ultraviolet. Even when we observe in the infrared to map out light that was emitted at visible wavelengths, only the most luminous of the galaxies at z ∼ 1 can be classified according to Figure 1.11. By redshift z ∼ > 2, hardly any of the luminous patches in Figure 9.14 resemble the spirals and ellipticals of our nearby Universe. They have irregular shapes, very high surface brightness, and the bright blue colors of starbursts. They are much smaller than present-day galaxies, only 0 . 1 \u0006\u0006 –0 . 2 \u0006\u0006 across. These may be only protogalactic fragments that will merge to form the galaxies, or the centers of galaxies that are not yet full-grown. A galaxy’s light output changes with time as new stars are born and age, affecting both its color and luminosity. Although we cannot normally test whether an individual galaxy was brighter or fainter in the past than it is now, we can compare the average population of galaxies at the present day with that at higher redshifts. We can make a model by specifying the star-forming history, and using our knowledge of stellar evolution to calculate how its spectrum should change with time. This amounts to finding the evolutionary term e ( z ) in Equation 8.46. We then test the model by calculating how many galaxies of a given type should be found. For example, if galaxy disks have built up their stars at a steady rate, then they should always have roughly the same number of young blue stars, while the red stars build up over time. If elliptical galaxies made all their stars at redshifts z ∼ > 3, we can see from the starburst model of Figure 6.18 that their stars should have been both bluer and brighter in the past. Figure 9.15 represents a look backward over at least half of the Universe’s history, showing the numbers of galaxies at each luminosity per comoving volume. The number of red galaxies, with spectra showing only old stars, is about the same as today. We know that the population of stars that makes up each galaxy at z ∼ 1 will have faded by the present, as in Figure 6.18. So these galaxies must make new stars, or grow by eating their companions as we discussed in Section 7.1; or else new bright red galaxies have been produced. For example, a blue galaxy that ceases forming stars will become red. At z ∼ 1 the number of blue galaxies that are actively forming new stars was larger at each luminosity than it is today. Each one was about three times brighter, or else there were more blue galaxies in the past. We cannot blame stellar fading: today’s blue galaxies have formed new stars in the past gigayear, or they would now be red, not blue. The extra starbirth is not caused by starbursts in galaxy mergers; fewer than 10% of the galaxies that contribute to Figure 9.15 are merging. Instead, normal galaxies like our own must have made stars more rapidly than they do now. These systems should redden over time, as old stars make up more of their mass; and indeed the average color of a star-forming galaxy is now redder than it was at z ∼ 1. We can compare the observed rate of starbirth in a galaxy with what is needed to build up the stars that we see over the lifetime of the Universe; a starburst galaxy is one that makes stars much faster than this average rate.

Figure 6.20 shows that the biggest galaxies, with L r > 8 × 10 10 L \u0005 or twice the Milky Way’s luminosity, are now forming stars at only 1%–10% of their average rates over cosmic history. Today, < 1% of galaxies with more than 2 × 10 10 M \u0005 of stars (about a third as much as the Milky Way) have a global starburst, although bursts confined to the center are more common. But at z ∼ 0 . 7, fully 40% of such galaxies are making stars significantly faster than their average rate. The spectrum of a galaxy that forms its stars in bursts will resemble those in Figure 6.18, with the addition of some red light from the older stars. At z ∼ 0 . 7 almost half of large galaxies show ‘post-starburst’ spectra, with deep Balmer absorption lines; they must have stopped making stars quite abruptly about 0 . 5–2 Gyr earlier. This is as we expect for galaxies where starbirth took place in spurts of ∼ 100 Myr, separated by quieter periods of a gigayear or more. Today, only a few percent of large galaxies have post-starburst spectra. 9.4.1 Lyman break galaxies To study galaxies at high redshift, we must first find a good way to pick them out from our images. All gas-rich galaxies show a break in the spectrum at 912 ̊ A: neutral gas around the star and within the galaxy absorbs much of the light at shorter wavelengths. In objects at z ∼ > 4, intergalactic gas of the Ly α forest removes light below 1216 ̊ A.

Steidel. systems found by searching for these spectral signatures. At z ∼ 3, the break at 912 ̊ A shifts to wavelengths λ ≈ 3650 ̊ A, in the near-ultraviolet U band. So galaxies at this redshift will almost disappear from U -band images, while the color B − V in visible light is still blue or neutral. At redshifts z ∼ 4 − 5 a star- forming galaxy is not seen in the B band but is still bright in V .At z ∼ 6 it becomes dark in the I band at 8000 ̊ A as the break at 1216 ̊ A moves into that region. Figure 9.16 shows cB58, a Lyman break galaxy at redshift z = 2 . 7, corre- sponding to 2.4 Gyr after the Big Bang. The ultraviolet spectral lines are similar to those of the nearby starburst galaxy of Figure 5.24, but this galaxy is bluer. There is no strong Ly α emission line. Although hot stars radiate profusely here, the Ly α photons scatter repeatedly from hydrogen atoms before they leave the galaxy; during their lengthy travels they are easily absorbed by even small amounts of dust. The C IV absorption line has an abrupt edge on the red side, but blends smoothly away to the blue. This P Cygni profile is characteristic of the expanding atmospheres of massive hot stars. The metal lines tell us that the young stars have metal abundance 0 . 4 Z \u0005 ∼ < Z ∼ < Z \u0005 ; those heavy elements were made by previous generations of stars. In the gas we can measure the abundances of several elements; oxygen is at 40% of the solar level while iron reaches only ∼ 10%, although more may be hidden in dust grains. This is the same pattern as we see in old stars in the Milky Way in Figure 4.17. Oxygen is produced in Type II supernovae, the explosions of short- lived massive stars, while iron is released from Type Ia supernovae which involve"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"9.4 The first galaxies 401 low-mass long-lived stars. So oxygen is added to the gas within ∼ 10 Myr after the first significant star formation, whereas iron will be released only ∼ 1 Gyr later. Together with a low level of nitrogen, also made in low-mass stars (see Section 4.2), this ratio suggests that cB58 made most of its stars in the past 250 Myr. We see blueshifted absorption lines showing that gas is streaming outward; this is typical for Lyman break galaxies. In cB58 the wind moves outward at 250 km s − 1 , carrying off about as much mass as the galaxy turns into new stars. At least some of this metal-bearing material will escape to intergalactic space. Stars are made from dense gas, so it is not surprising to detect radio-frequency lines from molecules such as CO. In cB58 we find ∼ 10 9 M \u0005 of molecular gas, enough to form stars at its current rate for only about 50 Myr. This gas is dense enough to absorb 80% of the ultraviolet light of the young stars, re-radiating energy L FIR ∼ 10 11 L \u0005 in the far-infrared. Observing these distant galaxies in visible or near-infrared light, we receive energy emitted in the ultraviolet, which comes only from their most massive and recently born stars. To infer the pace of starbirth, we must guess at the initial mass function , giving the proportions of massive and less-massive stars. In cB58, the P Cygni profile of the C IV line and the shapes of other lines tell us that, at least among its massive stars, this galaxy has roughly the same initial mass function as the Milky Way. We can measure the ultraviolet luminosity L λ (1500 ̊ A) in the hybrid units of 3 . 86 × 10 26 W ̊ A − 1 ; recall that L \u0005 = 3 . 86 × 10 26 W is the Sun’s bolometric luminosity. Then, if the initial mass function has the Salpeter form of Equation 2.5 for M ∼ > 0 . 1 M \u0005 , stars are produced at the rate ̇ M ∼ (3–5) × 10 − 7 L λ (1500 ̊ A) M \u0005 yr − 1 . (9.24) Making M \u0005 yr − 1 in stars corresponds to L λ (1500 ̊ A) ∼ 3 × 10 6 L \u0005 ̊ A − 1 ,ora luminosity λ L λ ∼ 4 × 10 9 L \u0005 . For a more realistic mass function that includes fewer low-mass stars, ̇ M is only half as large for a given ultraviolet luminosity. The best estimate of starbirth would be to add the rate given by Equation 9.24 to that given by Equation 7.11, which measures the stellar light intercepted by dust and re-radiated in the far-infrared. Typically, the more vigorous the starbirth, the larger the fraction of the young stars’ light intercepted by dust. Most of the Lyman break galaxies studied at z ∼ 3 make (10–50) M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars; cB58 produces ∼ 40 M \u0005 yr − 1 . This is modest compared with 200 M \u0005 yr − 1 in the nearby ultraluminous merging system Arp 220 or the submillimeter galaxies (see below). Today ∼ 5 M \u0005 yr − 1 of stars are born in a large spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, while rates for typical local starbursts range up to 30 M \u0005 yr − 1 . Lyman break galaxies are very bright because of their short-lived massive stars: they are typically several times more luminous in visible light than an L galaxy defined by Figure 1.16. Figure 6.18 shows that, between roughly 50 Myr and 1 Gyr after a starburst, the Balmer jump near 4000 ̊ A increases in strength. Using it to date the current episode of starbirth, we find that the fastest"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"402 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies star-formers have typically been making stars for only 30 − 100 Myr, while the more sedate galaxies have continued for ∼ > 1 Gyr. The color of light emitted at visible wavelengths gives information on older stars, which represent most of the mass. We find that Lyman break galaxies are not massive: a few have assembled 5 × 10 10 M \u0005 of stars, roughly the same as the Milky Way today, but most are small systems like cB58 with M ∼ 10 10 M \u0005 . Because the light must be spread out in wavelength, spectroscopy of these faint galaxies is very demanding. Some of the best-observed high-redshift galaxies appear many times brighter because of gravitational lensing : their light is bent as it passes through a galaxy cluster on its way to us (see Section 7.4). Light from cB58 is amplified about 30-fold in this way. Otherwise, spectroscopy of the most distant galaxies is a task for the large 8–10 m telescopes. Very bright Lyman break galaxies are seen to z ∼ > 6; BD38 at z = 5 . 515 is an example. The spectrum looks much like that of cB58 in Figure 9.16, although we see it barely 1 Gyr after the Big Bang. It was then making 140 M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars, in an episode that had already lasted ∼ 200 Myr. These are not the galaxy’s first stars; the strength of their spectral lines shows that they already are half as metal-rich as the Sun. Observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 4.5 μ m show the red light of (1 − 6) × 10 10 M \u0005 of stars with ages of 600 − 700 Myr. These systems are quite small: BD38 is one of the largest, but is only 1 . 6 kpc in radius. In contrast to the very gas-rich objects that we discuss below, an active nucleus of any kind is rare; we see them in only a few percent of Lyman break galaxies. Problem 9.11 At optical and near-infrared wavelengths, the flux F λ from each square arcsecond of the night sky increases roughly as F λ ∝ λ 2 . 5 . To measure the energy that a galaxy emits near the Ly α line at 1216 ̊ A, we must observe near 1216(1 + z ) ̊ A. Explain why the measured flux F λ from each square arcsecond of the galaxy’s image decreases as (1 + z ) 5 , so that F λ (galaxy) / F λ (sky) ∝ (1 + z ) − 7 . 5 . Ly α emission from protogalaxies at z ∼ 5 is hard to see without an 8–10 m telescope. 9.4.2 Hidden stars: submillimeter galaxies and molecular gas Even locally, galaxies with intense star formation hide most of the blue and ultra- violet light of their young stars behind dusty gas. As we saw in Section 7.1, only a few percent of this light escapes from a starburst galaxy like M82 or Arp 220. On average, about two-thirds of the ultraviolet light escapes from local galaxies; the rest is absorbed to warm the grains of dust, and re-radiated in the infrared. At z ∼ 1, most stars were made in dusty places: the energy of starlight emerges mainly as the infrared light of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with L FIR > 10 11 L \u0005 , making ∼ > 50 M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars (see Equation 7.11). At higher redshifts, dusty starbursts become even more common.

The active nuclei are conspicuous in X-rays, which can shine out through the dusty gas, but star formation still contributes most of their energy output. We saw in Section 7.1 that galaxy mergers can trigger a starburst. These are rare today, and contribute little to the total of star formation. Locally, fewer than 1% of Milky-Way-sized galaxies are locked in close interaction and likely to merge soon with a comparably large system. Even at z ∼ 1, roughly a third of LIRGs are normal-looking spiral galaxies; a quarter are irregulars; in another quarter, the light is concentrated into a compact center. Only 20% are clearly undergoing major mergers, though these are the most powerful sources. But, at redshifts z = 2 − 3, the far-infrared light comes predominantly from ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with L FIR > 10 12 L \u0005 , forming more than 200 M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars. Many of the ULIRGs show signs of recent or ongoing merger. It is not simply that our telescopes are not powerful enough to see dimmer objects: at these wavelengths, adding up the light of the ULIRGs accounts for almost all of the background radiation shown in Figure 1.19. In observing dusty galaxies, Equation 8.46 comes to our aid: the term k ( z )isso large and negative that the measured flux of a galaxy at λ ∼ 1 mm is nearly constant over the range 1 ∼ < z ∼ < 10. Some of the most vigorously star-forming galaxies were found first by searching at 850 μ m for the redshifted emission of warm dust. In an optical image, these submillimeter galaxies are faint with irregular and complex shapes, and often seem to be merging with a neighbor. At these redshifts, lines from the 3 → 2 and 4 → 3 transitions of the CO molecule (see Table 1.8) are shifted to around 3 mm, where they can be observed from the ground. One object studied in this way, J02399 at z = 2 . 8, lies behind a galaxy cluster where gravitational lensing makes it appear 2.5 times brighter. With L FIR ∼ 10 13 L \u0005 , Equation 7.11 indicates that it is making 600 M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars. At this rate, its supply of 6 × 10 10 M \u0005 of molecular gas will last only 100 Myr. The gas lies in a ring at radius 8 kpc, rotating at 420 km s − 1 , so the mass inside is 3 × 10 11 M \u0005 . Recall from Section 2.3 and Problem 6.6 that most of the mass in the central few kiloparsecs of a galaxy is stars and gas, not dark matter. If J02399 is similar, the galaxy has built ∼ 2 × 10 11 M \u0005 of stars – too many for the current burst, unless by coincidence we see it on the point of exhausting its gas. The most luminous galaxies discovered at 850 μ m have redshifts 1 . 5 < z < 3 . 5. Like the very powerful quasars of Figure 8.13, but unlike bright star-forming galaxies (look ahead to Figure 9.17), their numbers peak at z ∼ 2. Most contain ∼ 2 × 10 10 M \u0005 of molecular gas, far more than the Lyman break galaxies, and ten times as much as the Milky Way. But this is only enough to fuel their starbirth for 20–40 Myr. The gas usually lies in a ring or disk within 2 kpc of the center rotating at 400–500 km s − 1 , enclosing a mass ∼ > 10 11 M \u0005 . They contain ∼ 3 × 10 10 M \u0005 of young stars, and possibly many more old stars. The gas and young stars alone amount to 5 × 10 10 M \u0005 , which is roughly the mass of normal (baryonic) matter in"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"404 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies the Milky Way today. But less-luminous objects also contribute much of the total submillimeter emission, and those lie mostly at z ∼ < 1 . 5, in a pattern more like that of Figure 9.17. The ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) radio telescope observing at 0 . 4 − 4 mm will make sensitive and detailed maps of dusty starbursts at 3 ∼ < z ∼ < 12. Problem 9.12 Dust grains in a starburst galaxy are heated to a temperature T ∼ 50 K. For a blackbody at temperature T , the luminosity L ν ∝ ν n ( ν ), where n ( ν ) is given by Equation 1.35. But because the grains are small, with sizes ∼ < 1 μ m, they radiate inefficiently at longer wavelengths: the dust emission follows L ν ∝ ν 3 n ( ν ). Show that, for λ \u0012 300 μ m, we have L ν ∝ ν 4 . If we observe at 100 GHz or 3 mm, the power F ν ( ν ) \bν that we receive between frequencies ν and ν + \bν was emitted between ν (1 + z ) and ( ν + \bν )(1 + z ). Equation 8.37 tells us that the redshift decreases the energy received from each square arcsecond by a factor of (1 + z ) 4 . Show that, near this frequency, the flux F ν from each square arcsecond of a starburst galaxy is almost constant for redshifts 5 ∼ < z ∼ < 20. Once we have large telescopes with sensitive detectors in this spectral region, we should be able to see extremely distant star-forming galaxies. 9.4.3 Old, red, and dead? Figure 6.20 shows that the most optically-luminous galaxies today are making hardly any new stars. When did the earliest galaxies finish building their stellar bodies? Locally, almost all red galaxies are red because they lack young blue stars; only a few, like the starburst M82, are red because dust hides those stars. Recent observations from space, where the infrared sky is dark, show that this is reversed at z = 2 − 3. In one recent sample, only 3 of 13 red galaxies at z ∼ 2 . 5 really seem to be ‘dead’: observed at 8 μ m in the infrared, they are dim while the dusty galaxies blaze brightly with re-radiated starlight. Comparing their spectra with models like Figure 6.18 shows that these are massive galaxies, with M > 3 × 10 10 M \u0005 , where hardly any stars have been born for the past ∼ 2 Gyr. They are making new stars at less than 0.1% of the average rate needed to build the galaxy in the 2.6 Gyr since the Big Bang. The earliest ‘red and dead’ galaxies yet observed are at z ∼ 6. They are too faint for us to take their spectra, but we can look at their light in broad bands. Some of them show increased light at wavelengths longer than 3 μ m. The 4000 ̊ A break of Figure 6.17 is so strong that most of the stars must be 200–600 Myr old – they were born already at z ∼ 7–13! These galaxies have M ∼ (1– 4) × 10 10 M \u0005 – they have made stars equivalent to 20% − 50% of the Milky Way. By z ∼ 1 . 5 or 4.2 Gyr after the Big Bang, red galaxies with roughly the same stellar mass as the Milky Way, M > 5 × 10 10 M \u0005 , probably contain more than half the stars in the galaxies.

The mass of stars formed in any time interval is proportional to the area under the points – E. Stanway and A. Barger. z ≈ 1 . 5. Since there is roughly six times more dark matter in the Universe than baryonic material, these objects must have dark halos of ∼ 10 12 M \u0005 . According to the cold dark matter models of Section 8.5, such massive halos should be very rare at early times. Their stars are about as metal-rich as the Sun, and have ages around 2 Gyr, so the last significant starbirth was at z ∼ 3. Forming (300–500) M \u0005 yr − 1 of new stars, it would take only 300 Myr (a typical timescale for starbursts) for the ‘hidden’ systems of the last subsection to build up these masses. The most luminous of the dusty starbursts discovered at 850 μ m might have developed first into these ‘red and dead’ galaxies, and then into today’s luminous ellipticals. 9.4.4 The star-forming history of the Universe Using variants of Equation 9.24, we can estimate how fast the ultraviolet-luminous galaxies formed their stars. According to Figure 9.17 most stars in the Universe were born at z ∼ 1, between 5 and 8 Gyr after the Big Bang. Star-forming galaxies seem to have flourished later than the luminous active nuclei of Figure 8.13, which reach their peak at z ∼ 2. It also shows less extreme variation: starbirth today is only about five times less vigorous than it was at its peak, whereas at z ∼ 4itis at roughly half the peak level. At z ∼ > 0 . 7 much of the ultraviolet radiation of young stars is absorbed by dust, and Figure 9.17 includes a correction based on the color of the ultraviolet light. But virtually no ultraviolet light escapes from the dustiest systems such as the submillimeter galaxies, so they will be missed from the plot. We have also"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"406 Active galactic nuclei and the early history of galaxies missed fainter star-forming galaxies, even if they host much of the starbirth. But the number of stars formed should not be less than that given in Figure 9.17. The rate at which those stars have produced metals is related to the ultraviolet luminosity of their massive stars. We must add up the yield of heavy elements from supernovae resulting from stars of each mass, which are known to within about a factor of two. Measuring the ultraviolet flux in the same units of L \u0005 ̊ A − 1 as for Equation 9.24, we find that elements heavier than helium are produced at the rate ̇ M Z ∼ 8 × 10 − 9 L λ (1500 ̊ A) M \u0005 yr − 1 . (9.25) We also had to assume here that high-mass stars, with M ∼ > 6 M \u0005 , are formed in the relative proportions specified by the Salpeter function of Equation 2.5. Luckily, all such stars burn roughly the same fraction of their gas into metals, so Equation 9.25 is not very sensitive to the initial mass function adopted. According to Figure 9.17, roughly a quarter of all the stars had formed by z = 2, and they should have released enough metals to give an average abundance ∼ Z \u0005 / 30 if mixed evenly throughout the baryons. At the end of the previous section we saw that this level is already higher than what we observe. If many small star-forming galaxies contributed to reionization, then even more ‘missing metals’ must be hidden in diffuse gas. Is our picture of the life of distant galaxies consistent with what we see in the Local Group, where we can take spectra of individual bright stars to reconstruct the star-forming history? About half of its stellar mass is in the bulges of M31 and the Milky Way, and in Chapter 4 we saw that most of these stars are probably old enough to predate z ∼ 1 . 5. The Milky Way’s disk has formed stars steadily over the past few gigayears. The disk of M31 is more luminous but has fewer young stars, suggesting that the pace of starbirth has slackened over that period. Averaging over the Local Group, starbirth appears to have been at its most vigorous 8–13 Gyr in the past, perhaps somewhat earlier than the peak in Figure 9.17. However, the atmospheres of the stars that we see locally all contain elements heavier than helium; very few have less than 10 − 3 of the Sun’s metal abundance. We have found no ‘fossils’ from the earliest stellar generation, formed out of hydrogen and helium alone. Thus further studies both of nearby and of distant galaxies are needed in order to tell us whether Figure 9.17 fairly represents cosmic starbirth.

Problem 1.20 The energy in the background radiation is 10 54 J Mpc − 3 . The Sun radi- ates 4 × 10 26 Wor10 43 J Gyr − 1 ; so, from Equation 1.25, galaxies emit about 2 × 10 51 J Mpc − 3 Gyr − 1 . Even though the galaxies were brighter in the past, all the starlight radiated since the Big Bang falls far short of the energy in the cosmic background radiation. Problem 2.4 If the rate of starbirth at time t is B ( t ), then, for stars that spend time τ MS <τ gal on the main sequence, the initial luminosity function \u0014 ( M V ) is related to the present-day luminosity function \u0010 MS by \u0014 ( M V ) = \u0010 MS ( M V ) × \u0002 τ gal 0 B ( t )d t \b \u0002 τ gal τ gal − τ MS B ( t )d t . The faster B ( t ) declines with time, the more of these short-lived stars must be born to yield the numbers that we see today.

Problem 2.11 Because of the Malmquist bias, the stars in your sample are brighter than the average for the whole sky. If you do not correct for the bias, and simply assume that the stars of your sample are an average selection of those in the sky, you will overestimate their distances. The average values that you infer for any other properties that are linked to the luminosity will also be wrong. Problem 2.12 Blue stars with m V = 20 must be far from the midplane, where disk stars are rare. The red stars are dim nearby dwarfs; at this apparent magnitude, a red giant would be halfway to M31! Problem 2.13 L eye = 0 . 08 L \u0005 , corresponding via Equation 1.6 to M eye ≈ 0 . 6 M \u0005 . After 3 Gyr, only stars below M u ≈ 1 . 5 M \u0005 are still on the main sequence.

There are N eye = 1 . 05 ξ 0 ≈ 4 × 10 6 main-sequence stars with M eye ∼ < M ∼ < M u . Table 1.1 shows that, for low-mass stars, the red giant phase lasts about a third as long as the main-sequence life. There are 0 . 1 ξ 0 stars that live between 2.25 and 3 Gyr on the main sequence (1 . 5 M \u0005 ∼ < M ∼ < 1 . 8 M \u0005 ); adding them makes little difference to N eye .A star with L < L eye can be seen only to r max = 3 pc( L / L eye ) 0 . 5 ≈ 3 pc( M / M eye ) 2 . 5 .

Problem 4.10 We have yet another reason to think that gas is entering the Galaxy. The Milky Way’s disk produces (3–5) M \u0005 of new stars each year (Section 2.1) which will use up our (5–10) × 10 9 M \u0005 of disk gas within 1–3 Gyr. Dying stars return ( M \u0005 to 2 M \u0005 )ofgas per year, which is not enough to avoid exhausting the supply. If gas flows into the disk from outside, we avoid the uncomfortable conclusion that we see the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies at the very end of their star-forming lives.

Why did we choose H 0 = 60 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 for this problem, rather than our usual value of 75? For nearby galaxies, those with V r ∼ < 2000 km s − 1 , peculiar motions (see Section 1.4) can be large compared with the cosmic expansion. Looking at these galaxies, we would measure a higher or lower value for the Hubble constant. Using Cepheid variable stars (see Section 4.1; Hughes et al . 1998 ApJ 501 , 32) places NGC 7331 at 15.5 Mpc; the Tully–Fisher relation (see Problem 5.11) gives a similar distance, which corresponds to an ‘effective H 0 ’ near 55 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . Section 8.4 discusses how the uneven gravitational pull of clustered galaxies induces peculiar motions. Problem 5.4 See Figure C.3. The central brightness is 140 L B , \u0005 pc − 2 , and M B =− 20 . 5 is equivalent to 2 . 5 × 10 10 L B , \u0005 . Problem 5.5 By Equation 1.35, the energy received between wavelength λ and λ + \bλ from each steradian of a blackbody at temperature T is F λ \bλ = 2 h 2 P c 2 λ 5 \bλ e h P c / ( λ k B T ) − 1 Wm − 2 . F λ peaks at 10 μ m when T = 300 K; see Equation 1.5. When λ = 10 μ m, at T = 100 K the factor e h P c /λ k B T − 1is ∼ 1 . 5 × 10 4 times larger than it is at 300 K, so F λ is reduced by the same multiple. Problem 5.6 λ/ D = 21 cm / 73 m corresponds to ∼ 10 \u0006 , but structures larger than about half this size are already significantly ‘resolved out’ of interferometric maps."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Appendix C 419 01234 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 2 − 2 4 − 4 Fig. C.4. Left, the rotation curve in the Plummer potential; V ( R ) is in units of V max , radius R is in units of a P . Right, a ‘spider diagram’ of contours of radial velocity V r − V sys in units of sin iV max , for gas in a disk tilted at i = 30 ◦ from face-on; negative contours are shown dotted. Problem 5.8 V 2 ( r ) = G M r 2 / ( r 2 + a 2 P ) 3 / 2 . Where V ( r ) starts to fall with radius, we find closed loops in the spider diagram of Figure C.4. Problem 5.11 For NGC 7331, Figure 5.20 shows that V max = 250 km s − 1 ; by Equa- tion 5.6, this corresponds to L I ≈ 10 11 L \u0005 . That would imply a distance d ≈ 16 Mpc for the galaxy. But the Tully–Fisher relation is not exact; we see in Figure 5.23 that some galaxies are more luminous than average for their rotation speed, and others are dimmer. Problem 5.13 All the frequencies fall as 1 / R . A two-armed spiral with pattern speed \u0002 p can live between radii R + and R − , where \u0002 p = \u0002 ± κ/ 2, respectively; κ = √ 2 \u0002 ,so R + / R − = ( √ 2 + 1) / ( √ 2 − 1) ≈ 5 . 8. The radii where \u0002 p = \u0002 ± κ/ 4 are in the ratio (2 √ 2 + 1) / (2 √ 2 − 1) ≈ 1 . 6. Problem 5.14 From Problem 3.2, the Plummer radius for M33’s nucleus is a P ∼ < 0 . 6 pc, about 1 / 17 of that for the globular cluster in Problem 3.13. The velocity dispersion is twice as large, so the nuclear cluster is no more than 2 . 4 2 / 16 . 6 ≈ 1 / 4 times as massive, or about 5 × 10 5 M \u0005 . Problem 7.19 Follow the method of Problem 3.2, setting s = tan φ to show that \u0007 ∞ 0 (1 + s 2 ) − 1 d s = π/ 2 .

Problem 8.7 We can write the potential \u0010 ( x ) and the fluctuation in density ̄ ρδ ( x ) in terms of their Fourier transforms as \u0010 ( x ) = 1 (2 π ) 3 \u0002 \u0010 k e − i k · x d 3 k and δ ( x ) = 1 (2 π ) 3 \u0002 δ k e − i k · x d 3 k . In the random-phase approximation, the δ k are independent random variables. Since δ is real, δ − k = δ ∗ k , the complex conjugate. Applying Poisson’s equation for each k -component in turn gives − k 2 \u0010 k = 4 π G ̄ ρδ k . Now we must link δ k to P ( k ). The correlation function ξ ( r ) is the average at all possible points x of δ ( x ) δ ( x + r ); when counting galaxies, think of δ ( x ) as being nonzero only very near the position where one is present. If the cosmos is isotropic, it will not matter in which direction we take our step r away from the initial point x . So we can write ξ ( r ) = 1 (2 π ) 3 \u0002 | δ 2 k | e − i k · r d 3 k ; On comparing this with Equation 8.3, we see that P ( k ) =| δ 2 k | . Using Parseval’s theorem, and remembering that δ k depends only on the magnitude of k , the fluctuation in density ̄ ρδ ( x ) follows δ 2 = 1 (2 π ) 3 \u0002 δ k δ ∗ k d 3 k = 1 (2 π ) 3 \u0002 | δ 2 k | 4 π k 2 d k = \u0002 k 3 P ( k ) 2 π 2 d k k . So wavenumbers near k contribute an amount \b 2 k = k 3 P ( k ) / (2 π 2 ) to the fluctuations δ 2 \u000b in the density, as stated in Equation 8.4. By similar reasoning, the same range of wavenum- bers gives rise to fluctuations in the potential \u0010 amounting to \b 2 \u0010 = k 3 | \u0010 2 k | / (2 π 2 ). Poisson’s equation tells us that k 4 | \b 2 \u0010 |∝| \b 2 k |∝ k 3 P ( k ). If P ( k ) ∝ k then | \b 2 \u0010 | does not vary with k , so we have equal fluctuations in \u0010 on all spatial scales."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Index 4000 ̊ A break: see under stellar
