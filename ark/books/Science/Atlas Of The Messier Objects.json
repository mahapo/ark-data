With Kenneth Glyn-Jones, Stephen James O’Meara, and Ken Graun, haven’t we had enough? No, I say! And especially no when the latest addition to the canon is Ronald Stoyan’s scholarly, historical, astrophysical, and superb look at the great comet hunter and the list of objects he compiled during his lifetime. This book is the fi rst scholarly look at the catalog since Glyn-Jones, and that effort is almost half a century old. Stoyan explores the latest astrophysical research concerning each of Messier’s 110 deep sky ob- jects. Stoyan could well devote his entire book to the astrophysics of Messier’s fi rst object, the Crab Nebula, and I still subscribe to the belief that I read years ago that astronomy has two parts: that of the Crab and that of everything else. From the fi rst time I looked at M 1 on September 1, 1963, I’ve been fascinated by the ghostly luminescence of the Crab, but never more so than when it seemed ablaze again not with a new supernova, but with nearby Saturn visiting at nearly the same spot from which the original star fi rst became visible on July 4, 1054. Next comes the historical view: I cannot get enough of the life of Charles Messier, who lived, observed, searched, and suffered some two hundred years ago. This observer’s life story is compelling, and Stoyan’s retelling adds new material. Although he was not the fi rst person to discover a comet with a telescope, Messier was most likely the fi rst to organize a successful survey program specifi cally devoted to the search for comets. For that accomplishment he certainly deser- ves a place with the greats like William Herschel, Kaoru Ikeya, and Leslie Peltier. In Stoyan’s biographical summary we learn a little more about Messier’s famous accident, in which he fell into a pit. Although he recovered enough to resume his work, we know for the fi rst time that he never completely got well again, and he fi nished his life with a continuing limp. A fortunate fall, to be sure, for he is lucky to have survived it in the fi rst place. What if Messier were to return to our time? He would be amazed at the ease by which visual comet hunting can be done, as well as the increased diffi culty in fi nding a comet when well-funded electronic searches compete with amateur astronomers. With a computer star chart riding with my telescope, I know instantly what my telescope is showing at any particular moment. On the morning of October 2, 2006, for example, the chart showed a rich fi eld of stars with the planet Sa- turn in the fi eld center; it did not display, however, the faint fuzzy spot that turned out to be my 22nd comet discovery, a new comet that will make a close approach to the Earth when it returns at the end of 2011. Messier obviously did not have such technology at his disposal; he used his telescope and a printed star atlas, trusted friends that remained the classic way to search the sky until just a few years ago. For all of Messier’s brilliance, his famous catalog was primarily an observing tool, and Stoyan’s writing confi rms this crucial footnote to history: by keeping a record of the objects that could be mistaken for comets, Messier provides himself and posterity an invaluable resource. The pages you are about to read delve further into what his list looks like after 200 years, and particularly the astrophysics that lies behind each of the clusters, nebulae, and remote galaxies that constitute it. Stoyan does not take a position on one of the questions of our time – should the double cluster in Perseus be added to the list? Yes, there is a need for “yet another” Messier catalog book. Stoyan has done a masterful job giving his readers a modern look at Messier’s greatest accomplishment. May this book inspire you to learn about the man and his project, and more importantly, may it encourage you to don a coat, grab a telescope, and enjoy this window into the deep sky for yourself. Foreword David H. Levy"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9 The catalog gathered by the French astronomer Charles Messier (1730–1817) has been the most popular compilation of astronomical ob- jects beyond our Solar System for more than 200 years. It contains 110 star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, among them most of the brightest and fi nest deep sky highlights that are visible from northern skies. Amateur and professional astronomers alike have turned their te- lescopes time and again to the Messier objects. Numerous books have covered them, and numerous websites attest to their unwavering popu- larity. However, a current overall picture of the catalog and its objects was missing, as much information currently disseminated is actually outdated. So, for the fi rst time since Robert Burnham’s famous Celes- tial Handbook , a thoroughly investigated new account with historical, astrophysical, and observational information on all the objects had to be conducted. Many discrete tasks were associated with this book. Historical infor- mation on Charles Messier, his observations and his catalog had to be compared to latest level of knowledge. In addition to our own research, the biography published by Jean-Paul Philbert in the French language proved especially helpful. The main task was the compilation of recent astrophysical information on all of the objects. More than 500 scienti- fi c papers were compiled and evaluated. These texts are complemented by extensive observational notes, which incorporate the visual use of large modern refl ectors. A major part of the book is the more than 150 fantastic photos by leading amateur astrophotographers from all over the world. Occasi- onally, these images are accompanied by photographs from the Hub- ble Space Telescope, where this adds value. In addition, an extensive collection of visual drawings is shown, both from the classical era of the nineteenth century, as well as modern sketches drawn by the aut- hor himself. The compilation of this book took much effort over the past fi ve years. Many of the images were prepared exclusively from such exotic spots as Greece, Chile, and Namibia. They combine more than 5000 minutes of photographical exposure and 150 hours of visual observa- tion. From the original German edition, which was released in 2006, information and photos have been updated and improved. I owe a very personal thank you to the co-authors of this book. Stefan Binnewies, the well-known German astrophotographer, con- ducted the orchestra of his colleagues. Susanne Friedrich, professional astronomer and amateur alike, ensured the quality of the astrophysical information. Finally, Prof. Klaus-Peter Schroeder, also a professional astronomer, who has worked in the United Kingdom and the United States for decades, translated and updated the texts. A deeply felt thank you goes to the astrophotographers who contri- buted so much to this book, especially to the teams of Volker Wendel and Bernd Flach-Wilken, Josef Pöpsel and Dietmar Böcker, and Robert Gendler and Jim Misti. I would also like to thank Lutz Clausnitzer, Klaus Wenzel, Arndt Latusseck, Wolfgang Steinicke and Matthias Juchert, who helped in many respects on the German edition. The fact that this book appears in an English language edition is almost a miracle. Among the many people who have helped that this dream became reality are Owen Brazell, David Eicher, Phil Harrington, Yann Pothier, and Stewart Moore. Additionally, I am greatly indebted to Sue French, who proofread the manuscripts and supported this project to a very great extent, and David Levy, who authored the foreword in his unparalleled manner. Finally, I would like to thank Vince Higgs and the team at Cambridge University Press for their support, work, and faith. May this book give you new insights into your favorite deep sky highlights.

In part, these have been translated from the original. Where not available, they had to be taken as quotes from secondary litera- ture. English quotations are given, as far as available, in their original wording. Frequently, the term “resolution” (of an object) is used in historic texts – not just for star clusters, but for galaxies and nebulae as well. In the nineteenth century, that did not necessarily mean the resolution into individual stars, as we use the term today, but rather resolution of any kind of detail. A short introduction to every historic observer quoted in this book can be found on page 28. Astrophysics Ever since the publication of the famous “Burnham’s Celestial Hand- book” in the 1970s, amateur astronomers have been waiting for a new, up-to-date compilation of astrophysical data on all Messier objects. A lot of literature, internet sources in particular, refers to outdated va- lues. For this book, the content of over 500 professional, up-to-date pu- blications was researched. This was made possible by the use of the Internet and the free NASA service known as the Astrophysical Data System (ADS), which is an on-line collection of almost all scientifi c publications in astronomy. The exact citations are given in the Ap- pendix. Where possible, no sources older than 10 years were used, but a few objects have received little attention in modern references. Other objects (M 1, M 31, M 42) catch a lot of professional attention, and the vast amount of literature dealing with them would easily permit a much more detailed treatment. However, space restrictions limited this book to the most relevant information. In many cases, the research presents surprises: modern scientifi c results often disagree completely with what is commonly believed as the result of outdated literature. This trend will continue, as there is a steady stream of new observations and their astrophysical interpretati- on. Hence, the statements made in this book must be regarded as only a momentary picture of our knowledge from the years before 2007. Many questions remain unanswered, and we expect new insight into topics such as dark matter, black holes or the age of the Universe. This may affect how some aspects of the Messier objects will be explained in the future. Another common problem is the disagreement of modern sources from one another. Different authors have different opinions, and dif- ferent methods yield different results. Generally accepted knowledge grows out of long debate and testing. This is part of the lively nature of a quickly developing science such as modern astrophysics. Observation The information and advice given for the visual observation of each object is based on the personal experience and observation of the fi rst author, using telescopes of different apertures. Each object has been observed on several occasions, some more than a dozen times. The in- strumentation used consisted of: • 3.5×15 opera glass, “Theatis” made by Carl Zeiss Jena • 8×30 binoculars, “Deltrintem” made by Zeiss Jena • 10×50 binoculars, “Dekarem” made by Carl Zeiss Jena • 20×100 binoculars, made by Miyauchi • 120/1020mm (4.7-inch) refractor “Star 12ED,” made by Astro-Phy- sics, magnifi cations from 25× to 255×, in exceptional cases 340× and more • 360/1780mm (14-inch) Newtonian on a Dobsonian mount, magni- fi cations from 45× to 593×, entirely manual operation, observing sites in the German countryside (Kreben, naked-eye limiting magni- tude 6.5, sky surface brightness 21.0 mag/arcsecond 2 ) and Austrian Alps (Tiefenbachferner, naked-eye limiting magnitude 7.0 mag, sky surface brightness 21.6 mag/arcsecond 2 ) • 500/2500mm (20-inch) Newtonian on a Dobsonian mount, magnifi - cations from 63× to 625×, Farm Tivoli, Namibia (naked-eye limiting magnitude 7.5, sky surface brightness 21.8 mag/arcsecond 2 ) Observing comments refer to a very experienced observer and excellent observing sites with a dark, moonless sky. We have purposely omitted star charts and all advice on fi nding the objects, since there is already a vast literature on these aspects, useful even to the fi rst-time observer. However, we recommend a versatile software-based approach, “Eye & Telescope.” It produces star charts and visibility information based on actual sky conditions and the instrument used."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 Selected images showcase the fantastic results of the amateur astrophotographer’s community. To document astrophysical aspects beyond the reach of amateur photos, we have complemented the ma- terial with NASA pictures of many Messier objects, obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Some Messier objects are particularly popular with amateurs, and good images are abundant. Others grab almost no attention and only a few pictures of lower quality are available. It’s virtually impossible to get photos of uniform quality for all 110 objects. For this reason, the scale and depth (i.e., limiting magnitude) of the photos vary from object to object. The photos printed in this book were taken in the years between 1995 and 2007. The most common technique is tri-color (red, green, blue) photography with a cooled CCD camera and (L)RGB fi lter wheel. With a few exceptions, traditional fi lm-based photography can no lon- ger compete, while the new era of digital cameras and DSLRs is just about to begin. For accurate technical information on each picture, re- fer to the picture credits in the appendix section. The color reproduction is neither uniform, nor should it be regar- ded as quantitatively correct. Color-balance and saturation depend on a number of factors, such as chip-characteristics, fi lter-transmission, software and personal judgment during image processing. The result is often subjective, perhaps aimed at reproducing the colors of professio- nal photos. After all, techniques of absolute color calibration are time- consuming and do not apply to some types of astronomical objects, most notably the emission nebulae. The techniques used by amateur astronomers for their image-pro- cessing work differ a lot from person to person, and there are no gene- ral standards. Some photographers would remove traces of planetoids, satellites or ghost-images by hand, on a pixel-to-pixel basis, others accept them as part of the authentic picture. Composite images made from several different exposures change the perception of the intensity range. This technique is used to accommodate large intensity varia- tions and to avoid “burnt-out” central regions. But it may make stars on bright nebulous background appear signifi cantly less brilliant than they are in reality. A good example is the Trapezium in the Orion Ne- bula. Hence, a quantitative interpretation of such a photo is impossible, but amateur astrophotographers are happy to accept that, in order to produce the most appealing image of an object. Together with the photographs, historical and modern drawings have been reproduced here. The manual sketch of an object as percei- ved through the telescope eyepiece was the only scientifi c method of recording until the late nineteenth century, after which photography fi nally took over. This book shows a large number of fi ne sketches from the pre-photographic era.

The pictures"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"13 perceptions had been a continual problem. Today, amateurs keep the tradition of astronomical drawings alive, in order to sketch their visual impression of a specifi c object. Drawings are subjective and contain erroneous perceptions. Never- theless, this method is an independent recording technique, comple- mentary to the capabilities of photography. Before criticizing historical drawings for their misconceptions, we should keep in mind that it is always easier to verify a known feature than to discover it. In that sen- se, the historic drawings must be regarded as more “honest” than their modern counterparts. Even the most critical modern observer cannot avoid the subconscious knowledge of an object by modern photogra- phy and its infl uence on his or her perception of it. Drawings differ from photographs in a number of ways. For one, the eye can not accumulate light over a long time, as a photogra- phic emulsion or chip can. Furthermore, the visual response to a large brightness range is much more logarithmic than the photographic re- sponse. And fi nally, the spectral response of the eye also differs from that of photographic emulsions or chips. With emission nebulae, in par- ticular, visual and photographic views emphasize different features. The author’s drawings were specifi cally made for this book. The ob- jects were observed several times with different apertures. Frequently, several attempts were required before an acceptable result was achie- ved. All the sketches are of a cumulative nature: each drawing sum- marizes the visual impressions of an object collected over many hours or even nights under a dark sky in the countryside, in the mountains or in the Namibian desert. The results are not to be confused with a quick sketch made by the eyepiece! The observing time involved was at least an hour, as for a simple elliptical galaxy, and up to three nights for large objects with a lot of detail. The original sketches are drawn with pencil, black on white. So are the proper drawings, using in addition an eraser and a smudging tool. For an inversion to white on black, the drawing is scanned and the tonal range adjusted, but no further digital manipulations are made. Subtle contrasts are over-pronounced by the drawings, as they would otherwise be lost in print. A drawing in its work-stages: M 42.

His home village lies near the former German–French language border in the we- stern part of the Vosges Mountains in Lorraine. In Messier’s days, that region did not belong to France but to the independent dukedom of Salm. The Messier family was one of the richest in the little state, with high-ranking positions and excellent connections, which would later be very helpful to the young Charles. He grew up in a house opposite the evangelic church of Badon- viller, by a square which today bears his name. Six of his siblings died in their early childhood. An important role in Charles’ life was played by his eldest brother Hyacinthe, who was older by 13 years. Hyacinthe started his professional career as an auctioneer and, eventually, became the highest fi nancial offi cer of the dukedom. When their father died in 1741 – Charles was only 11 years old then – Hyacinthe was already able to take care of the Messier family. He gave Charles an apprenticeship in his offi ce, mostly involving paper work. That helped develop the boy’s good writing and drawing skills, and the accuracy required for fi nance and business. His fi rst interest in astronomy was sparked by the large, six-tailed comet of 1744, discovered by the Swiss de Chéseaux, and the annular solar eclipse of 1748. The year 1751 brought important changes to the life of the Messiers. The dukedom of Salm lost its independence by becoming part of Lorraine, which later fell to France by annexation. Only the former residence of the dukes of Salm, the village Senones, a few kilometers from Badonviller, retained its independence and was to become the new home of the Mes- sier family. Now at the age of 21, it was time for Charles to seek a life of his own. With the help of a good family friend, who had contacts in important circles in Paris, an assistantship at the new Naval Observatory in Paris became available to Charles Messier. It was not really his interest in astronomy which got him the offer, but his good skills as an offi ce assistant. He left Badonviller on the 23 rd of September 1751.

Originally, the Hôtel de Cluny was the Parisian residence of the Benedictine monks from the great abbey in Burgundy. Later, it became the property of the French Navy. In 1754, the aged Delisle made a deal: he signed over the observatory to the Navy and in return, he received the custom-tailored title “Astronomer of the Navy.” Delisle’s humble observatory stood in the shadow of the established Royal Observatory of Paris, which was well known as a leading European institution for astronomers like Huy- gens, Cassini, and Maraldi. Delisle, by contrast, was not part of the French astronomy establishment. Hence, Messier entered a professional environment which allowed him to pursue his astronomical interests without any scientifi c obligations, but which also branded him from the outset as an outsider to pro- fessional astronomy. The childless Delisle couple received and hosted Messier as though he were their own son, and he lived with them in their apartment in the Collège. Delisle’s assistant Libour introduced Messier to the basics of astronomy, and the young Messier’s fi rst tasks were to make hand-drawn copies of maps and to write the observing logs. Delisle had been in personal contact with the late, famous English scientists Newton and Halley. The latter had pointed out in his famous work of 1705 that the comet apparitions of 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682 were due to the same physical co- met, which would reappear in 1758. Delisle made an indepen- dent calculation of the comet’s orbit and derived April 1759 for the perihelion passage. Based on his master’s work, Messier drew a map of the comet’s path among the stars and had orders to watch for it from the summer of 1758 onward. That comet hunt was the fi rst real astronomical task given to the 28-year- old, who so far had carried out only basic observations. Messier understood that this was the chance of a lifetime; he wanted to be the fi rst to prove Halley’s milestone work. But life took a different course. While Messier did redisco- ver the comet on the 21 st of January 1759, he soon had to learn that a farmer in Saxony had beaten him by about a month: the previously unknown amateur astronomer Johann Georg Palitzsch (1723–1788) from Prohlis near Dresden had already spotted Halley’s Comet on Christmas night 1758. Messier had confi ned his search to Delisle’s orbital path for too long. And to his great dismay, Messier could not even get his master’s permission to publish his independent discovery, since Delisle did not believe that he’d made a mistake in his calculations. He thought the comet was an unrelated object. Messier bowed to the wishes of his master and host and withheld his obser- Drawing of the Hôtel de Cluny, from the beginning of the nineteenth century. The octagonal sheltered platform of the tower is Messier’s observatory. Today, the Hôtel de Cluny is one of the most beautiful medieval buildings of central Paris. It hosts the National Medieval Museum, but there is no commemoration of the work of Charles Messier."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"17 City map of Paris from the year 1771.

However it was his achievements as a record- breaking comet discoverer that made Charles Messier the publicly best- known astronomer of his country. In fact, Messier had discovered practically all the comets of the past 15 years. He had been a member of the elite circle of the French Academy of Sciences sin- ce 1770. But now, a very special honor was awarded to him, unprecedented in the history of astronomy. Jerôme de Lalande (1732-1807), a fa- mous author, professor and colleague of Messier, created a new constellation on his freshly published stellar globe: “Cu- stos Messium” (lat.), the “Harvest Guar- dian.” Concerning his motives, Lalande wrote: “This name will remind future astronomers of the courage and dili- gence of our industrious observer Mes- sier, who since 1757 appears occupied with the sole task of patrolling the sky to discover comets.” Contemporary French star charts happily included the new con- stellation under its French name “Messier,” picturing a guardian who watched over a cornfi eld. The “Harvest Guardian” had its place north of Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Camelopardalis. Today, its space has become part of these three constellations. Messier’s constellation held only one noticeable star, 40 Cas, and no remarkable deep-sky objects. As Messier related, Lalande chose that particular part of the sky, because it once hosted the comet of 1774, discovered by Montaigne. It was the only one of 14 comets that, following the death of his wife, Messier failed to discover himself. These were two big losses, which Messier could not bear – and Lalande must have been aware of that. Lalande created two other new constella- tions: “Felis,” the cat (between Hydra and Antlia), in memory of his favorite pet, and “Globus Aerostaticus” (between Capricornus and Piscis Austrinus) to commemo- rate the invention of the hot-air bal- loon by the brothers Montgolfi er and their fi rst air-borne voyage in 1799. All three constellations were inclu- ded in J.E. Bode’s Prussian star atlases – despite, certainly, some national rivalry. But in return, Lalande would include in his atlases the “Branden- burg Scepter,” “Frederick’s Honor,” and the “Mural Quadrant,” which Bode had invented. Nevertheless, all these new constellations fell out of use only 80 years later. Joseph Jérôme le Français de Lalande, colleague and friend of Messier. Engraving by André Pujos.

However, the long-delayed publication aroused suspicion and skepticism among the royal astronomers in Paris. His independent dis- covery was not acknowledged – a disappointment that Messier would not forget for a long time. In hindsight, we know that the by-products of Messier’s diligent comet hunt were much more rewarding. In August 1758, when he was observing the comet discovered by de la Nux, Messier came across a yet unknown nebula which looked exactly like the comet. This disco- very sparked the idea for his catalog, which retains Messier’s name to this day. Hence, Messier made good use of that chance of a lifetime, after all – albeit in quite a different way than he, the comet enthusiast, had anticipated. 1759 to 1770: Comet discoveries and recognition Comet hunting became an obsession for Charles Messier. Between 1758 and 1804, he spent more than 1100 nights on this task. He became the fi rst real “comet hunter\" in history, with a prototypical character: a most diligent observer with humble equipment but much enthusiasm, who would search for new comets with systematic endurance. He ob- served 44 comets altogether, more than were known to science before him. He discovered 21 comets, 6 of which are regarded today as co- discoveries. Messier was, in fact, the fi rst observer who systematically used the telescope for comet hunting. Before him, comets were usually discovered with the naked eye. But he did not leave it with the disco- very of a comet. He would observe every comet for as much and as long as possible; his record was 71 nights over a period of 6 months. Furthermore, Messier measured comet positions to make orbit calcu- lations possible. He never did that himself, though, as he was entirely devoted to observation. None of his many publications would contain a single bit of math or theoretical work. In that respect, Messier’s close friendship with Jean Baptiste Gas- pard Borchart de Saron (1730–1794) was most benefi cial. Saron came from an established, noble family and was soon to become the royal state-attorney, and later even president of the parliament. Theoretical astronomy was one of his hobbies – a perfect match: Saron’s quick cal- culations were essential to Messier’s success, because these allowed him to fi nd a comet again, even after a long period of bad weather. For the discovery of the great comet of 1760, Messier was still a day late. But only a few days later, on the 26 th of January 1760, he disco- vered the fi rst comet named after him. In the following years, Messier nearly achieved a monopoly on comet discoveries: all eight known co- mets between 1763 and 1771 were discovered by him! Messier was active in other respects, too. Between 1752 and 1770, he observed 93 lunar occultations and 400 eclipses of Jupiter’s satel- lites, he watched 5 solar eclipses, 9 lunar eclipses, and he measured 400 stellar positions. Over the course of his lifetime, Messier followed four Mercury and two Venus transits, and he did a lot of planetary ob- serving, especially on Saturn. In 1767, he made a three-month-long sea cruise to test astronomical clocks on the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium. Recognition by the international science community was soon to follow. In 1764, he became elected a fellow of the English and Dutch scientifi c academies. Such academies were of crucial importance in the eighteenth century. Only their membership made it possible to ex- change correspondence with the leading scientists of the time and gave access to the accumulated knowledge of their libraries. Messier had to wait a long time for admission to the French academy of the sciences – in Paris, the skepticism aroused by his long withheld observations of Halley’s comet were still not forgotten. But, at least, his salary was raised in 1765, after the retirement of Delisle from active research. Messier’s breakthrough with the French astronomy establishment came with his discovery of the great comet of the year 1769. That comet was a spectacular sight, and it made its discoverer’s name so popular with the general public that the king would personally receive a map drawn for him by Messier. The king nicknamed Messier “the comet nest-rob- ber,” because for many years not a single comet “slipped out of its egg” that hadn’t already been discovered by Messier. This idea then develo- ped into the popular nickname “the comet-ferret.” Joseph Nicolas Delisle, teacher and benefactor of Messier. Engraving by Konrad Westermayr. Johann Georg Palitzsch succeeded in what Messier tried in vain: he was the fi rst to rediscover Halley’s comet on its return in 1758."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 The next year (1770), Messier discovered a comet, which was identifi ed by the Swedish observer Lexell as a periodic comet. Two weeks after that discovery, Messier was fi nally admitted to the French Academy of Sciences, followed by membership in nearly all of the remaining foreign scientifi c associations. In addition, he received another pay rise and, in 1771, he inherited the title invented for De- lisle, “Astronomer of the Navy.” 1770 to 1789: Changing private fortunes and observational successes On the 26 th of November 1779, Messier married the daughter of a noble professor, Marie-Madeleine Dordolot de Vermauchampt, who was three years his junior. For 15 years, they had lived under the same roof in the Collége Royal. But in the absolutistic France of that time, a marriage between a bourgeois and a noble lady would have been impossible. Only the recent great success of Charles Messier changed their fortunes. In 1771, they moved into an apartment of their own in the Hôtel de Cluny – it was then only a few steps from Charles’ bedroom to the observatory. 1771 must have been one of the best years in Messier’s life. Be- sides his personal good fortune, he discovered two comets and com- pleted the fi rst version of his catalog, then totalling 45 nebulous objects, although Messier considered the latter a mere by-product of his searches, as he just wanted to avoid confusion when he was comet-hunting. On the 15 th of March 1772, there was another reason for Messier to rejoice: his wife gave birth to a son, Antoine-Charles. But then his fortunes changed dramatically: a week later, Marie-Madeleine Mes- sier died of puerperal fever, and the little baby followed her on the 26 th of March. Messier’s reaction to this heavy double-blow to his private life is diffi cult to assess. The fact is, however, that he started a four-day observing campaign on comet Montaigne – the fi rst co- met in almost 10 years which had not been discovered by him – the very night his son died. In August 1772, Messier travelled to the dukedom of Salm, which in his own words he regarded as his “Fatherland.” He stayed some time with his eldest brother in Senones, following earlier visits in the years 1758, 1762, and 1770. Not surprisingly, Messier continued an intense observing schedule during that family visit. On his return to Paris, he was accompanied by his nephew Joseph-Hyacinthe and by his sister Barbe, who would take care of her brother until her de- ath in 1797. The following years were characterized by continued comet ob- servations. In 1780, Messier published the second version of his ca- talog, which contained 68 nebulous objects. The fi rst new objects were found soon after his original catalog was printed. But Messier did not keep looking systematically for new objects, he just recorded accidental fi ndings during his comet observations. Nevertheless, the third version of his catalog, with 103 objects, came out in 1781. This was mostly due to the wealth of input from his new colleague Pier- re Méchain (1744–1804). Despite more such discoveries by Méchain after 1781, there were no further catalog versions. The role-model: Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille (1713–1762) was born on the 15 th of May 1713 in Rumingy near Reims. As a son of noble parents, he began to study theology in Paris. He was 26 when he made his fi rst recorded astronomical observations. Soon, he became professor at the Collège Mazarin in Paris, where in 1746 he constructed an observatory, and fi nally in 1741 he was admitted to the French Academy of Sciences, with the support of the Duke of Bourbon. Lacaille was well known for his accurate observations and an over- eagerness to work – in fact, he died of overwork on March 21 st , 1762. Hence, in 1751, the French academy chose him for a longer stay at the Cape of Good Hope, in order to accurately measure geographic longitudes and the positions of southern stars. Meanwhile, his scholar Lalande was his counter- part in Berlin for a program of simultaneous observa- tions, which led to impro- ved distance measurements of the planets and the Moon. Lacaille arrived in South Africa in April 1751. At the foot of Table Mountain, which he honored with the constellation “Mensa,” he began the observations for a southern star catalog in August 1751. For that work, Lacaille used a mural quadrant, equipped with a very small telescope of only ½-inch (12.5mm) aperture and a magnifi cation of 8×. A year later, in July 1752, this catalog contained the positions of 9776 stars. While cataloging the heavens, Lacaille made a list of the nebulous ob- jects he came across, which he published in 1755. It was the fi rst of its kind, and it is appended to Messier’s third and fi nal catalog. Thirteen new southern constellations were created by Lacaille as a by-product of his work: Antlia, Caelum, Circinus, Fornax, Horologi- um, Mensa, Microscopium, Norma, Octans, Pictor, Reticulum, Sculptor, and Telescopium. With these, Lacaille fi lled in the coarser pattern of southern constellations created 150 years earlier by Keyzer. In additi- on, Lacaille changed the name of the constellation Abies into Musca – not to be confused with a lost northern constellation of that name – and he suggested splitting the huge constellation Argo Navis into Carina, Vela, Pyxis, and Puppis. About 100 years later, these sugge- stions became widely accepted as astronomical conventions.

At fi rst, Herschel took his new object for a possible comet and asked Charles Messier for his opinion. The same day he received Herschel’s letter, Messier observed Uranus. Messier passed his positional measurements down to de Saron to calculate the orbit. His ma- thematical friend was quick to realize that Uranus was not a comet but a new planet. After 1781, Herschel would fi nd over 2000 new nebulous objects with his much better telescopes. However it was not only this superior competition that stopped Messier working on ne- bulae, but also another blow of fate: on the 6 th of November 1781, Messier was on a walk with his family in the Park Monceaux. His curiosity led him to inspect the entrance to a basement, when he slipped and fell 8 m (24 feet) into a deep ice-storage cellar. Messier was seriously injured, and had broken his upper leg, upper arm, two ribs and the wrist of his hand. He lost a lot of blood from an open wound over his eye. It took him the better part of 1782 to recover from this bad accident. His leg had to be broken again, after the bones had healed at an angle. Messier was bed-bound for a long time, and he always limped thereafter. Herschel, who paid him a personal visit in Paris 20 years later, remarked that Messier never fully recovered from that injury. It was a full year after that accident before Messier was back in his obser- vatory, on the occasion of the Mercury transit of the 12 th of November 1782. 1789 to 1804: In the turmoil of the French Revolution The French Revolution began with the storming of the Bastille in Paris on the 14 th of July 1789. As for so many, the following years brought chaos and insecurity to Messier. The structures of the French Navy were dissolved Messier not only reinvented comet hunting, he also sparked new interest with his contemporari- es in the observation of nebulae and star clu- sters. The German astronomer Johann Elert Bode (1747–1826), who like Messier published an annual almanac, entered into a direct competiti- on with the French astronomer in 1777, by pre- senting his own catalog of nebulous objects. Bode developed an interest in astronomy at a young age. He observed the night sky from a hatch in the roof of his parents’ house in Ham- burg. By chance, a math professor saw Bode’s notes and encouraged him to write a popular astrono- my book. In 1768 at just 21 years old, Bode published the guidebook “Deutliche Anleitung zur Kenntnis des gestirnten Himmels” (“Con- cise manual to the know- ledge of the starry sky”), which was received very well and reprinted several times. A later edition was used to publish the formula for the distances of the pla- nets, which was soon known as the “Titius-Bode-Law.” Still an amateur astronomer, Bode observed the Venus transit of 1769. But in 1772, he began to work at the royal observatory of Berlin, and a few years later, in 1779, Bode discovered his fi rst comet. Much like Messier, that discovery gave him recognition. He eventually became the director of Berlin Obser- vatory in 1787 and kept that offi ce for 38 years. Bode gained some fame as the founder of the “Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch” (“Berlin Astro- nomical Almanac”) and with his book “Vorstellung der Gestirne” (“Introduction to the Constellations,” 1782) and the monumental celestial atlas “Ura- nographia” (1801). By contrast to Messier, Bode was well connected in scientifi c circles. The name “Uranus” for the new planet discovered by William Herschel was his suggestion. And as director of the Berlin Observatory, he had excellent contacts all over Europe. In 1774, three years after the pu- blication of Messier’s fi rst catalog of 45 nebulae, Bode started his own search for new nebulae and star clusters. He succeeded with some genuine discoveries (M 81, M 82, M 53, M 92) and a larger number of independent fi ndings. In 1777, he com- piled his “Complete Catalog of all Observed Nebu- lae and Star Clusters,” based on his own observa- tions as well as on all references he could fi nd in the literature. At its time the largest deep-sky ca- talog, this included 75 objects. Bode continued to observe, and he always encouraged other obser- vers to publish their data in his almanac. The 1779 volume contains a listing of objects found by Köhler from Dresden, and other editions reproduced the notes of Oriani and a translation of Messier’s catalog. An updated and enlarged list of contemporary observa- tions of nebulae, still wi- thout knowledge of Messier’s third catalog version but including the 68 objects of his second, was published by Bode in 1782 within the “Vorstellung der Gestirne.” This list not only included several new discoveries, pre- sumably made by Bode him- self, but also the objects IC 4665 (already mentioned by Al Sufi ) and h & F Persei. Despite the substantial work of Bode in this fi eld, his name is hardly known today, by contrast to popular Messier. One good reason may be that Bode did not check the posi- tions of objects contributed from other observers. That caused many errors in his list. His listing of 1782, for example, contains three different entries for M 8, because Bode did not realize that the dif- ferent positions from Messier, Le Gentil, and Köh- ler all referred to the same object. Hence, despite Bode’s strive for completeness, Messier’s fi nal ca- talog of 1781 was, at its time, second to none in terms of quality. The competitor: Johann Elert Bode Johann Elert Bode"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"23 and maintenance of the observatory ceased. Frequently, Messier had to borrow oil for his observing lamp from his good colleague Lalande. The latter was now director of the former Royal Observatory of Paris, and they knew each other well from the days when they both taught at the Collège Royal. In 1793, by decree of the revolutionary directorate, all academies were dissolved, with serious consequences for Messier. A further tragic event for Messier was to follow on the 20 th of April 1794 when his good friend and benefactor de Saron was guillotined under the reign of terror. Already in prison, he calculated his last co- met orbit for Messier. Fundamental changes were also imposed upon Lorraine. In 1793, the dukedom of Salm became part of revolutionized France by annexa- tion, with signifi cant consequences for the Messier family, which was closely involved with the local nobility. Some family members emigra- ted from France to Germany, following the dukes of Salm. In 1795, a new astronomical institute was founded in Paris: the Bu- reau des Longitudes. Its original purpose was to outstrip the superiority of the English clocks. Messier was not among its founding members, like Méchain or Cassini, but he replaced the latter in the next year. In 1798, still living in the Hôtel de Cluny, Messier was on his own again, after the death of his sister in the previous year. From Senones, his younger brother and his niece Josephine now came to live with him. Josephine would take care of Charles Messier until his death. In 1801, Messier made his last comet discovery at the age of 71. The- reafter, he just lived off his past fame, which was fi nally recognized by the new regime. Napoleon personally bestowed him with the Cross of the Legion of Honour. This led Messier to make, in 1808, a connection between his discovery of the great comet of 1769 and the simultaneous birth of “the Napoleon the Great.” This idea was so close to astrology that it did not go over well with most contemporary astronomers. Thirty of the now so-called “Messier objects’’ were, in fact, discovered by Pierre Méchain (1744–1804). He was a close collaborator of Messier and helped complete his fi nal catalog in the years 1779 to 1781. Pierre Méchain was born in Laon. He planned to become an architect, but lack of fi nances forced him to abandon his studies. Rumour has it that he even had to sell his telescope, which he had bought as an amateur astro- nomer, and that the buyer turned out to be Jérôme de Lalande, later (1794) to become the director of Paris observatory. Lalande had been astronomy professor at the Collège Royal from 1760 to 1767, as the successor of Delisle, and from 1794 to 1807 he was also editor-in-chief of the Connais- sance des Temps. In 1772, he managed to get Méchain a job at the treasury of the French Navy in Versailles. Two years later, Méchain obtained the offi cial position of a “calculator.” The connection with Messier’s friend Lalande initiated Méchain’s contribution to the Mes- sier catalog. In 1781, Méchain found two new comets – eventually, his total score grew to eight disco- veries. Unlike Messier, he was able to calcu- late his own orbits. His most famous discovery was the comet of 1786, which was proved by Encke’s orbital calculations to be the second- known periodic comet (after Comet Halley). From 1786 on, Méchain was engaged in longitude mea- surements. This work requires clocks much more accurate than those available at the time – a big problem for off- shore navigation, as well as for geodesy on land. Hence, in 1791, the French Academy of Sciences started a project to defi ne the French prime meri- dian from Dunkirk in the north to Barcelona in the south. After the project fi nished in 1795, Méchain found an error of 3\" in the calculated lati- tude of Barcelona (about 90 meters on the ground). We know now that this was due to a combination of instru- mental inaccuracies and some deviation of the globe from a perfect sphere – but Méchain expended considerable effort trying to further increase the accuracy of the calculations. In 1798, he succeeded Lalan- de as director of the Observatory of Paris. In 1804, during fi eld work in Spain to revise the measurements along the French prime meridi- an, Méchain contracted yellow fever and died on the 20 th of September 1804.

Thereafter, he suffered from failing eyesight. After 1808, he could no longer read or write. In 1812, he became paralyzed on one side, and dropsy set in around 1815. Messier fi nally died on the 11 th of April 1817 at the age of 87 years. Three days later, he was buried in the cemetery of Père Lachaise. The speech at Messier’s grave was given by Delambre, secretary of the reconstituted Royal Academy of Sciences. He commemorated the comet hunter with the words: “He did not write a single book, nor any treatise in general or in particular, but his observations will for a long time enrich the collection of the Academy. His famous colleague La- lande has created a constellation in his honor, the only one bearing the name of an astronomer. It will keep the memory of him alive, but his name will remain with science, independent of this honouring act of friendship: in terms of the catalog of comets, in which the name Messier has been recorded as often as honestly.” William Herschel continued with Messier’s work.

When he observed Comet de la Nux for that purpose in August 1758, he came across an object in Taurus, which looked very similar to the comet, but it did not move. It was the 28 th of August 1758 when Messier discovered the Crab Nebula, now known as M 1. He obtained the position of this ap- parently new nebula two weeks later (12 th of September ). Messier did not know then that M 1 had already been found by Charles Bevis in England in 1731, and so took his observation for a new discovery. That kindled an interest that would eventually lead to his famous catalog. As he described it in 1801: What made me produce this catalog was the nebula which I had seen in Taurus, September 12, 1758, while I was observing the comet of that year. The shape and brightness of that nebula reminded me so much of a comet, that I undertook to fi nd more of its kind, to save astronomers from confusing these nebulae with comets. I continued to observe with telescopes suitable for the discovery of comets, which was the purpose I had in mind when producing this catalog. Messier did not start a systematic search straight away. However, it was two years before he found M 2, with a Gregorian refl ector of 30-inch focal length and a power of 104×. Only later was he to learn, during a search for comet observations from other astronomers, that this object had already been discovered in 1746 by Jean-Dominique Maraldi (1709–1788). Again, Messier was not the original discoverer. M 3 to M 40: Systematic search for nebulae In May 1764, Messier fi nally started systematic work on the catalog of nebulae. He began with the “nebulosae” in the lists and literature known to him, in particular those from Hevelius, Huygens, Derham, Halley, de Chéseaux (of which, apparently, he had only an incomple- te knowledge), Lacaille, and Le Gentil. In addition, he discovered new objects of his own; some of these, like M 39 and M 40, while trying to verify entries from old catalogs. In only fi ve months, Messier observed and measured the positions of M 3 to M 40, including 19 genuine fi rst discoveries. Hence, the fi rst version of his catalog was more or less ac- complished within half a year of work, from spring to fall 1764. That time must be considered the most productive phase in the life of Charles Messier as a “deep-sky observer,” as we would put it today, and it laid the foundation for his lasting popularity. M 41 to M 45: Completion of the fi rst catalog Early in 1765, Messier found the open cluster M 41. For a long time, this was the last entry in his observing log. The subsequent pause of four years saw his boat journey to the Netherlands in 1767 and fur- ther comet discoveries – apparently, Messier was pondering whether to publish his list of nebulae or not. In March 1769, he fi nally made up his mind and completed the catalog with the inclusion of several well- known objects as his entries M 42, M 43, M 44, and M 45, listed under the date of the 4 th of March 1769. All of these objects are impossible to confuse with a comet, and it remains a matter of speculation why he added them. Perhaps having a catalog with 41 objects did not satisfy Messier’s sense of symmetry, and he wanted to exceed the 42 entries in the catalog of his role-model, Lacaille. In his foreword, Messier men- tioned the motivation for making a list of all nebulous patches in the sky, rather than just those which look like a comet. However, he did not include other signifi cant objects in that respect, e.g., the double cluster h & \u0003F Persei, which apparently did not bother him much. There simply were not enough such objects left to round the number up to an even better sounding total of 50 entries. The manuscript for the fi rst catalog was fi nally completed on the 16 th of February 1771. It was printed in that same year for the 1774 edition of the Mémoires de l’Académie Royale des Sciences. M 46 to M 52: Further discoveries Only three nights after the manuscript of the fi rst catalog was fi nalized (19 th of February 1771), Messier discovered four more objects: three more star clusters (M 46 to M 48) and the fi rst galaxy of the Virgo cluster, M 49. Later that same year, on the 6 th of June an object was discovered but its position not measured until 1779, which gave it a much later entry as number 62. Instead, on the 5 th of April 1772, Mes- sier fi nally found a nebula from a note of Cassini, for which he had been looking since 1764, now his M 50 – not much more than a week after his wife and newborn child had died. The Observations"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 During an observation of the Andromeda Galaxy on the 10 th of August 1773, Messier discovered the companion ga- laxy M 110. But for reasons that are not known, he did not include this object in his catalog. The observation and a dra- wing were fi nally published in 1798 – for this, M 110 was accepted as a Messier object in the twentieth century. Also in 1773, Messier came across M 51, while he was following the comet of that year which he had discovered himself. He saw only the central part of the main galaxy. The double-nature of this object was noticed later by Méchain, whom he got to know in that year (1773). M 52 in 1774 was then for some time Messier’s last discovery; he did not engage himself again with nebulous objects until 1777. M 53 to M 70: Completion of the second catalog version In February 1777, Messier found M 53 and the faint M 54, and M 55 followed on the 24 th of July 1778, while he was looking again for an object described by Lacaille (M 55), which he had failed to fi nd in the night of the 29 th of July 1764. Meanwhile, in 1777, Bode had entered into a direct competition with Messier with his catalog of 75 nebulous objects. Then in 1779, the 6 th of January, the German chal- lenged Messier in his very domain: Bode discovered his fi rst comet. Messier saw it only 13 nights later. The comet then happened to pass near M 56, which Messier happily added to his list. Further nebulous objects were soon found along the path of Bode’s comet by different observers: M 57 on the 31 st of January 1779 by Darquier, the Virgo galaxies M 59 and M 60 on the 11 th of April by Köhler (four days later in- dependently discovered by Messier, together with M 58), and M 61 by Oriani, on the 5 th of May. The latter galaxy was seen by Messier the same night, but confused with the comet; he noticed his mistake six nights later. The other galaxies of the Virgo cluster had not yet been observed. June 1779 saw the fi rst contribution to the Messier ca- talog by a discovery of Méchain: M 63. In March and April 1780, Messier had a very productive phase again: he disco- vered M 64, M 65, M 66, M 67, and M 68. The much grown number now motivated him to publish a second version of his catalog. It was printed in the 1783 edition of the French Almanac, the Connaissance des Temps. Two more objects (M 69 and M 70) found by Messier on the 31 st of August 1780, and making a pleasantly round number, were added on in the annex of the same edition. M 71 to M 103: Méchain’s discoveries and the fi nal catalog version Again, new discoveries were made immediately after the pu- blication of the catalog. More than 32 new objects were ob- served between October 1780 and March 1781. The personal discoveries achieved by Messier were M 73 (when he was loo- king for M 72 of Méchain), M 84, M 86, and M 87 to M 93 For the earliest astronomers, non- stellar (fi xed) objects had little impor- tance and hardly any attention was paid to them. The only exception was the easily resolved and bright star cluster of the Pleiades, which played an important role in astronomical ca- lendars and mythology. For example, the tradition of All Saints Day and Halloween is based on the culminati- on time of the Pleiades. Nebulae were not noticed by the ancient Greek scholars, only Hipparchus mentioned, apart from the Pleiades, the other two cloud-like objects, M 44 and h & F Persei. The great star catalog of the second century AD, the Almagest produced by Ptolemy (83–161), already con- tained seven objects characterized as “cloud-like” or “nebulous.” But apart from M 7, M 44, and h & F Persei, they are not real but rather chance alignments of stars that remain unre- solved and therefore appear nebulous to the naked eye. Not even the two most obvious of the real nebulae, M 31 and M 42, are mentioned in the Almagest, nor elsewhere in antiquity. This demonstrates the lack of interest in such objects. The fi rst note on M 31 came from the Persian scholar Al Sufi in the tenth century, when he worked on a revision of the Alma- gest. And the discovery of M 42 had to wait until the fi rst telescopic ob- servations in the early seventeenth century. In 1611, several astronomers discovered the Orion Nebula almost at the same time – the very fi rst of them was Nicholas Peiresc. The fi rst telescopes were also used for several other non-stellar objects. Galileo found that M 44 was not a nebula but a cluster of faint stars. About the same time, Simon Mari- us discovered M 31, which was still unknown in Europe. After him, Gio- vanni Batista Hodierna (1597–1660) made a series of discoveries. His list of 19 observed objects contains nine genuine discoveries (including M 6, M 36, M 37, M 38, M 41, M 47, and perhaps M 33, and M 34), but his notes were lost and remained entirely unknown until their rediscovery in the twentieth century. For quite some time not much pro- gress was made; nebulae were still objects of little interest. In 1647, Johannes Hevelius published one of the last large star catalogs achie- ved without the use of a telescope, he therein mentioned 14 “nebulous” objects, mostly taken from Ptolemy. As in the Almagest, these “nebulae” are mostly accidental stellar patterns, which are not resolved by the naked eye. However, with the advent of this widely known publication, nebulous objects gained a bit more attention for the next hundred years. In 1733, Hevelius’ original listing of 14 objects was translated from Latin into En- glish by William Derham and supple- mented with M 7 and NGC 6231. In this form, it came to Charles Messier, who tried to verify these 16 objects in 1764. Since most of them were not real, they could not be identifi ed as a nebula through the telescope. Only Hevelius No. 14 survived as M 40, as Messier included it in his catalog, alt- hough he only saw a faint double star and no nebulous object. Not long after the work of Hevelius, M 22 (Ihle, 1665) and M 11 (Kirch, 1681) were found by telescopic ob- servation, the fi rst discoveries made from Germany. In England, meanwhi- le, Edmond Halley was quite active. Best known for his long-period co- met, he had already discovered Z Cen in the southern sky in 1677. From Observations of nebulae before Messier"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"27 home, he found M 13 in 1714. In a 1715 publication, he also described M 42, M 31, M 22, and M 11. But it wasn’t until Messier’s time, when the quality of te- lescopes had improved suf- fi ciently, that more progress could be made. In 1746, the Swiss aristocrat de Chéseaux (1718–1751) listed 21 observed nebulae, which include eight genuine discoveries. But as in the case of Hodierna, his notes were not published, because de Chéseaux was not a mem- ber of any important scientifi c society, so he was not accepted by the scientifi c establishment. This was different with Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713–1762), who presented a list of 42 ne- bulous objects in 1755 as a by- product of his star survey of the southern sky. Despite the very small aperture he had used, this fi rst real nebula catalog con- tained a signifi cant number of genuine discoveries and was of very good quality, especially in terms of positional information. Certainly, it was the best exa- mple for Messier, who reprinted Lacaille’s list as an annex to his 1771 catalog. Hence, many southern objects were known before Messier’s work, while the northern sky was still almost untouched. Con- currently with Messier, Guillau- me Le Gentil (1725–1792) made a few discoveries. Like Messier, he once was a student of Delisle in the Collège de France. In his publication, submitted in 1749 but not printed until 1755, Le Gentil mentioned M 32, M 8, M 41, M 36, and M 38.

The observers would produce drawings and descriptions, which were then reproduced in professional publications. It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that emerging photogra- phic techniques evidently became the more accurate and less subjective form of recording positions and intensities than visual observa- tion. Nevertheless, descriptions from the great hi- storic visual observers are still most valuable for the modern amateur for comparison with his or her own visual observations. We have to keep in mind that those historic observers could not “cheat” and look at a photograph to get some help; they depended entirely on the capabilities of their eyesight. Frederick William Herschel (1738–1822) William Herschel was a musi- cian, born in the German town of Hanover, who had emigrated to England. He became the fi rst observer to un- dertake a systematic search for nebulae for their own sake. Most likely, he was inspired by Messier’s catalog. Within 20 years, he com- piled a huge catalog of 2500 nebulae and star clusters. Herschel had produced home-made telescopes and mirrors since 1774, for himself as well as for other astronomers. For his nebula obser- vations, which he started in 1782, he used a very large, modifi ed Newtonian telescope with 18 inches (475mm) of aperture and 20-feet (6m) focal length. His standard magnifi cation was 157× with a fi eld of view of 15', with which he was systematically scanning the sky. He combed through a zone of 4 minutes to 5 minutes in right ascension with a length of 12° to 14° in declination and noted all newly found objects for a later, accurate position measurement. This procedure was then repea- ted in a band of right ascension adjacent to the preceding fi eld. Wanting a larger objective for this project, Herschel fi nished building the then largest telescope in the world in 1789, with a huge 47-inch (1.2m) metal mirror of 40-feet (12m) focal length, but it proved too bulky for scanning purposes, so he would in- stead use it for detailed observations of indi- vidual objects. Herschel’s fi rst discovery, on the 7 th of Sep- tember 1782, was the Saturn Nebula NGC 7009. By 1785, he had found about 1000 more nebulous objects, another 1000 by 1789, and a fi nal 500 by 1802. Hence, his 20 ye- ars of work increased the number of known nebulae by a factor of more than 20 – an immense achievement. William Herschel is probably the most industrious deep-sky obser- ver of all time. John Herschel (1792–1871) John diligent- ly continued the work of his fa- ther. He shipped the venerable 18-inch tele- scope to South Africa, where he systematically searched the southern sky for nebulae. In the years 1834 to 1838, he discovered 1689 new objects. In 1864, he fi nally combined his own and the revised observations of his father into the General Catalogue (GC) of Nebulae and Star Clusters. It became the basis for the fa- mous New General Catalogue (NGC) of 7840 entries. The latter, created by Johann Dreyer in 1888, included all the objects then known and is still in widespread use today. William Smyth (1788–1865) The retired English admiral discovered astro- nomy as his hobby and built his own private observatory with a 6-inch refractor. In close contact with John Herschel, he observed nu- merous deep-sky objects. In 1844, he publis- hed the “Bedford Catalogue,” the “grandmo- ther” of all deep-sky observing guides, which included descriptions of 98 nebulae and 72 star clusters. His work offers rich insights into the practice of amateur astronomy 160 years ago. William Lassell (1799–1880) This wealthy bre- wer and amateur astronomer from Liverpool, Eng- land, was able to spend con- siderably more money for his astronomical desires than his contemporaries. In 1845, he built a 24-inch Newtonian on a fork-mount, which he used to do numerous observations and drawings of nebulae. In 1858 in Liverpool, he had a refl ec- Visual observers after Messier"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"29 tor with a 48-inch mirror made, one of the largest telescopes of its time. He shipped it to Malta in 1861, to take advantage of the far superior observing conditions there. William Parsons, Lord Rosse (1800–1867) The third Earl of Rosse was a rich Irish nobleman who developed an enthusiasm for observing due to his contact with John Herschel. In April 1845, after considerable experimentation with the techniques needed to build very large refl ec- tors, he constructed his huge telescope, “Le- viathan,” which had a 72-inch (1.8m) mirror. Then the largest telescope in the world, it was set up in the gardens of his Irish estate at Birr castle and was so cumbersome that several people were required to operate it. Never- theless, the Lord himself and several assi- stants made a large number of observations and drawings of nebulae in the decades to follow. One of his most important discove- ries was the spiral structure of some galaxies. However, this success later tricked him into seeing spiral patterns even in star clusters. The assistants of Lord Rosse were: J. Rambaut (1848), B. Stoney (1850–1852), R. Mitchell (1853–1858), S. Hunter (1860–1864), S. Ball (1866–1867), C.E. Burton (1868–1869), R. Copeland (1871–1874), J. Dreyer (1874–1878). Heinrich d’Arrest (1822–1875) D’Arrest, a descen- dent of Huguenot immigrants to Ger- many, was director of the Copenhagen Observatory near the Danish capital. His published notes, “Siderosum Nebulorosum,” which contain observations of 1942 objects and include 321 discoveries, prove that he was a very diligent observer. For most of his work, he used the 11-inch refractor at the Copenhagen observatory. Léopold Trouvelot (1827–1895) This French painter received considerable re- cognition for his precise drawings of plants and animals. His sketches of the aurora bo- realis fi nally caught the attention of Harvard astronomers in Cambridge (USA), who invited him to hone his talents with telescopic obser- vation. In 1875, he was hired by the US Naval Observatory in Washington (DC), where he subsequently produced more than 7000 dra- wings of astronomical objects – still the fi nest of their kind. However, after his death, Trou- velot acquired a bad reputation in the USA because he introduced the European gypsy moth, whose caterpillars have caused a lot of damage to US agriculture ever since. Wilhelm Tempel (1821–1889) With a very hum- ble, provincial fa- mily background in the east of Germany, he re- ceived his fi rst recognition from abroad. His breakthrough came in 1859 when he discovered a comet and the nebula in the Pleiades that surrounds Merope – both feats were achieved with his small 4-inch refractor. In 1874, Tempel started work at the Arcetri Observatory near Florence (Italy), where he carried out numerous observations of nebulae and made 146 discoveries of new objects. Leo Brenner (1855–1936) Spiridon Gop þ evi ü is one of the most debated observers of all time. In 1894, he started to ap- proach the public under his pseudo- nym Leo Brenner. On the Mediterra- nean island of Lussin, which then belonged to Austria (today the Croatian island Lošinj), he built a private observatory with a 7-inch refractor and published many incredibly de- tailed, but often fi ctitious, reports. In 1909, after he had lost almost all his credibility with professional astronomers, he simply vanished from the astronomical scene. His descriptions are relevant for the German-speaking com- munity, though, because in 1902 he published the fi rst ever observing guide on the deep-sky in the German language. Edward Emerson Barnard (1857– 1923) This Ameri- can is regar- ded as perhaps the best visual observer of all times. He had the combined gift of a keen eye and a well-trained, accurate perception. Coming from a very poor fami- ly background, Barnard started his career as a laboratory assistant in a photography shop and observed the night sky as an amateur astronomer. He soon became known as the discoverer of several comets. In 1887, he was hired by the Lick Observatory, where he made some spectacular discoveries with the 36-inch refractor, then the largest refractor in the world. Apart from his skills as a visual obser- ver, he was also a very successful pioneer of deep-sky astrophotography."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"30 – all other new objects were contributed by Méchain, but verifi ed by Messier through observation and positional measurement. The last version of the catalog was supposed to have the round number of 100 entries. However, Méchain was discovering new objects in such quick succession, that Messier could not verify them all in time for the submission deadline of the manuscript. Hence, he added M 101, M 102, and M 103 to the fi nalized list with the remark: “From M. Méchain, have not yet been observed by M. Messier.” The objects M 108 and M 109 had been mentioned only in the note on M 97. Apparently, this third version of the catalog was prepared under considerable time pressure. It was printed already in spring 1781, for the 1784 edition of the Connaissance des Temps. M 104 to M 109: After press Shortly after he received his personal copy of the third catalog from the printer, Messier made a hand-written note in it about a further discove- ry of Méchain's from the 11 th of May 1781: M 104. Messier also added positions for the now-measured objects M 102 and M 103, as well as for M 108 and M 109 (in the note on M 97). Hence, initially, there was no indication that this would be the last version of Messier’s catalog. Also, Méchain remained active. Not only did he discover his fi rst two bright comets on the 28 th of June and the 9 th of October of 1781, in July he also discovered the nebula now known as M 106. In addition, a discovery made by Méchain in March that year, M 105, had simply been overlooked in those fi nal hectic days of work on the catalog. The next year (April 1782), M 107 was found by Méchain. Nevertheless, a new, updated version of the Messier catalog would never come. That may well be “blamed” on William Herschel.

Using a 2-foot (focal length) Gregorian refl ector, he drew up a list of 21 star clusters and nebulae in 1746.

He sent his list to his grandfather Reaumur, who was a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and who presented the list at an Acade- my meeting on the 6 th of August, 1746. However, no printed publica- tion followed, and de Chéseaux’s work was forgotten until its redis- covery in 1884.

NGC 884 Two clusters of stars in the hilt of Perseus’ sword, earlier observed by M. Flamsteed. 8. M 8 Another [star cluster] in the bow of Sagittarius, observed by the same. 9. NGC 6231 10. M 7 The last two [objects] of the catalogs of Messieurs Derham and Maupertuis. 11. M 44 That in Cancer, ordinarily called Praesepe, the position of which is known. 12. M 35 13. M 71 Two others of which I have not yet determined the positions, one above the northern feet of Gemini, and the other belo w and very close to Sagitta. 14. M 11 Lastly, a prodigious cluster of small stars, near one of the feet of Antinous of which RA is 279° 21' 10\" and southern decl. is 6° 32' 20\"; it has about 4 1/8' in diameter. These 14 nebulae contain among them almost as many stars visible in telescopes of 25 feet as the greater part of the sky contai ns as visible to the naked eye. Here now are the rightly styled nebulae which, when seen in the largest telescopes, never appear as a nything but white clouds: 17. M 22 A third, discovered by Abraham Ihle, between the head and the bow of Sagittarius, of which I found the RA of 275° 14' 10\" and southern dec. 24° 5' 30\". It is 5' in diameter, it is round, of a reddish color, whereas the Andromeda Nebula is yellowish and that of Orion, transparent. 18. NGC 5139 That in Centaurus, discovered by Mr. Halley; it is invisible in Europe. 19. M 4 One which is close to Antares, of which I have found for this year, RA 242° 1' 45\" and southern dec. 25° 23' 30\". It is white, round and smaller than the preceding ones; I do not think it has been found before. 20. M 17 Lastly, one other nebula, which has never been observed. It has a shape quite different from the others: it has the pe rfect form of a ray, or of the tail of a comet, 7' long and 2' wide; its sides are exactly parallel and quite well terminated, the same for the two ends. The center is whiter than the edges. I found its RA for this year as 271° 32' 35\" and its southern declination as 16° 15' 6\". It makes an angle of 30° with the meridian. 21. M 13 I have not yet found that in Hercules, discovered by M. Halley. I very much hope that the Messieurs astronomers of Par is will be willing to indicate its position for me."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"32 Lacaille’s catalog of nebulae It seems astounding that the very fi rst catalog of deep- sky objects, presented in 1755 by Abbé Nicholas-Louis de Lacaille – 14 years before Messier’s fi rst catalog of 45 objects – was actually devoted to the southern sky. In any case, Lacaille’s catalog was the fi rst signifi cant work of its kind, which also became widely known and accepted. Earlier object lists either had been very short (like the one by Halley), or had not reached the wider scientifi c com- munity (like those of Hodierna in 1654, or de Chéseaux in 1746). Lacaille’s catalog of 42 objects was published in 1755 in the Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences, and again in 1784 as an annex to Messier’s work.

At fi rst, Herschel took his new ob- ject for a comet, and so he asked Messier, the famous expert on comets, for his opinion. Messier observed the new object, measured its position over several nights, and had his friend de Saron calculate the or- bit. The result was sensational: Herschel had found a new planet, Uranus. With the fame of this discovery, Herschel re- ceived a royal salary, which fi nally allowed him to concentrate fully on astronomical work. In 1782, he began an extensive search for new nebulous objects and, due to both his superior Newtonian telescopes and his dedication, made about 1000 new discove- ries by 1786. By the end of that project in 1802, Herschel had compiled a huge list of about 2500 nebulae. It was the Messier catalog (he received his copy on the 7 th of December 1781) that almost cer- tainly gave him the idea. At the same time, the unlucky Messier had to abandon all his work after his serious accident (6 th of November 1781). After a long, painful recovery, he did not resume his search for new nebulae – in 1802 he described why: After me, the famous Herschel published a catalog of 2000 [nebulae] which he had ob- served. Unveiling the sky in his way, with instruments of large aperture, is not useful for comet seeking. Hence, my objective is dif- ferent from his: I only need the nebulae that are visible in a telescope of 2 ft [focal length]. I have observed more, meanwhile. I will pu- blish them in the future, organized by right ascension, for the sake of fi nding them more easily, and so that those who are looking for comets have less uncertainty. But such a fi nal publication never came to be. list has three sections: “Nebulae without Stars,” “Star Clusters,” and “Stars with Nebulosity.” Inciden- tally, each of the sections contains exactly 14 objects. This equipartition already puzzled Kenneth Glyn Jones in the 1960s. Perhaps it sa- tisfi ed a baroque desire for symmetry. Lacaille himself remarked on his list as fol- lows: “I have found a large number of nebulae of these three types in the southern sky, but I would not believe that I have noticed all of them; in particular of the fi rst and third type, because these are visible only after dusk and in the absence of the Moon. Nevertheless, I hope that this list is more or less complete for the most remarkable objects of the three types.” For his task, Lacaille had only very humble optical equipment. He wrote: “I have wished dearly to present a more detailed and informative work. But the simple re- fractors available to me at the Cape of Good Hope, of 15 and 18 inches [focal length], were neither ade- quate nor suffi cient for this kind of observation.” Since his telescopes were probably non-achromatic with focal ratios of around f/10, their apertures cannot have ex- ceeded 40mm (1½ inches). The fact that Lacaille could not resolve Z\u0003 Centauri (NGC 5139) into individual stars, or open clusters like NGC 6124, reveals the poor qua- lity of his instruments.

For this observation, Messier used an achromatic Dollond- refractor with an aperture of 40 lines (90mm), a focal length of 3.5 feet (1.14m), and a magnifi cation of 68×, on the nights of the 25 th and 26 th of February, and the 19 th , 23 rd , 25 th , and 26 th of March 1771.

For each object, Messier took the position relative to a bright neighbor star. Furthermore, a large number of objects was observed more than once, especially for the third version of the catalog. Nevertheless, Messier could not entirely avoid making mistakes. Consequently, there are a few objects for which the identifi cation re- mained ambiguous and matter of debate. Glyn Jones called these the “missing Messier objects,” which has become the adopted choice of words. There is now broad consensus about most identities, except the case of M 102. M 47 Messier’s position lies in a fi eld without any recognizable star clusters. Hence, astronomers after Messier long believed that M 47 did not exist. However, in 1959, T.F. Morris was able to prove an assumption that Oswald Thomas made in 1934: Messier made a sign-related mistake in his calculation of the position. As a curious result, M 47 has two NGC entries: a false one, NGC 2478, in its wrong position, and the true one, NGC 2422, with the correct coordinates from Herschel. M 48 The same night he recorded M 47, Messier made another simple cal- culation mistake with M 48, putting it exactly 5° too far south. Again, Oswald Thomas and T.F. Morris found the right identity: NGC 2548 has now been commonly accepted as M 48. M 91 With this galaxy, a positional error is also the most likely explanation. There is no suffi ciently bright galaxy at the position given by Messier, only a lot of faint galaxies of the Virgo Cluster. Owen Gingerich sug- gested that M 91 may just be an accidentally repeated observation of M 58, a galaxy only 2.7° south of Messier’s position. But in 1969, W.C. Williams showed that Messier used a galaxy as his reference point for M 91 (there are hardly any bright stars in this fi eld) and that he sim- Examples of Messier’s observing results: a drawing of Saturn, the occultation of Saturn by the Moon on the 18 th of February 1775, and the sunspots of the 17 th of July 1777."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"35 The catalog of Johann Elert Bode Bode’s No. Present designation Original source 1 ? own observation 2 M 32 Messier 3 M 31 Messier 4 Muster 1° W O Cas own observation 5 M 33 Messier 6 55 And Flamsteed 7 M 34 own observation 8 M 45 – 9 M 38 Messier 10 M 42 Messier 11 M 1 Messier 12 M 36 Messier 13 M 37 Messier 14 M 35 Messier 15 M 41 Messier 16 M 50 own observation 17 M 81 own observation 18 M 82 own observation 19 Cr 140 Lacaille 20 M 44 – 21 NGC 2477 Lacaille 22 NGC 2546 Lacaille 23 M 40 Messier 24 M 40 Hevelius 25 M 51 own observation 26 M 53 own observation 27 M 83 own observation 28 [ 1 , [ 2 , 17, 18 Lib Hevelius 29 M 5 Messier 30 M 13 Messier 31 M 4 Lacaille 32 M 12 own observation 33 M 10 own observation 34 32, 33, 34 Oph Hevelius 35 M 19 Messier 36 M 9 Messier 37 M 14 Messier 38 88 Her Hevelius The catalog of Johann Elert Bode Bode’s No. Present designation Original source 39 M 6 Lacaille 40 90 Her Hevelius 41 M 7 Lacaille 42 M 23 Messier 43 4 Sgr Flamsteed 44 5 Sgr Flamsteed 45 M 8 Le Gentil 46 M 69 Lacaille 47 M 20 Messier 48 7 Sgr Flamsteed 49 M 8 Messier 50 M 21 Messier 51 M 24 Messier 52 M 16 Messier 53 M 18 Messier 54 M 17 Messier 55 J Sct Hevelius 56 M 25 Messier 57 M 22 Lacaille 58 M 28 Messier 59 M 26 Messier 60 Q 1 Sgr Flamsteed 61 Q 2 Sgr Flamsteed 62 M 11 Messier 63 M 55 Lacaille 64 V Cap Hevelius 65 S Cap Hevelius 66 R Cap Hevelius 67 M 27 Messier 68 M 30 Messier 69 M 29 Messier 70 M 2 Messier 71 M 15 Messier 72 Z 1+2 Cyg Hevelius 73 34, 35, 37 Peg Hevelius 74 ? Hevelius 75 M 39 Messier In 1777, three years after Mes- sier presented his fi rst catalog, the Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode undertook the same endea- vor. In his publication “On seve- ral newly discovered nebulous stars and a complete listing of all known so far” he wrote: “I wanted to search for nebulous stars [ob- jects] with diligence. Since I had the pleasure to discover a number of new ones, which until then, at least, I had not found with any other astronomer, I herewith wish to communicate them.” With the use of several different sources, including Messier’s fi rst catalog, Bode managed to collect 75 ob- jects north of –35° declination. However, the diverse origin of the data was also the problem with Bode’s catalog. We only know with certainty of eleven objects that Bode observed himself. Of these, M 53, M 81, and M 82 were his own discoveries. All of the other objects had been copied from the literature without any verifi ca- tion, as Bode admits: “I have to add that I myself have not yet had the opportunity to observe all of the nebulae discovered by other astronomers.” As an example, this explains why M 8 has been listed three times – with different posi- tions. The problem of non-verifi ed entries was the death-sentence for Bode’s list, despite his good reputati- on as an astronomer. He printed it once again in 1782 in his star atlas “Vorstellung der Gestirne,” expanded with some new discove- ries (including M 92, IC 4665, and the star pattern near F Dra known as the “little Cassiopeia”), but the catalog never achieved widespread international use. Bode’s catalog of nebulae"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"36 ply confused M 89 with M 58. This yields the real identity of M 91 as NGC 4548. M 102 The identity of this object has remained a matter of debate to the pre- sent day. Many modern US publications regard this object as “missing,” while most European sources identify it with the galaxy NGC 5866. This discussion has its origin in a letter, which Pierre Méchain wrote two years after the third version of the Messier catalog was completed, on the 6 th of March 1783. He sent it to Bernoulli in Berlin, because Messier’s list of nebulae was also published in the Berlin Astronomical Almanac. Méchains letter was printed in the 1786 edition of the same almanac. In it, a passage reads: I would only like to add that Nr. 101 & 102 on p. 267 of the Connaissances des Temps for 1784 are nothing else than one and the same nebula, which was taken for two because of an error in the charts. In other words, Méchain said that M 102 was his accidentally repea- ted observation of M 101. Hartmut Frommert, however, came up with some serious doubts. Firstly, the descriptions of M 101 and M 102 given in the catalog differ from each other. And then, like M 103, M 102 had actually been observed and measured by Messier himself, as we know from his handwritten positions in his personal copy of the printed cata- log. For M 103, there is an error of 1°, while there is no object near the position he noted for M 102. However, if he had made a simple mistake with the calculation, again by 5° as with M 48, but this time in right ascension, then there would be an object in the right place, which also matches the description of M 102: NGC 5866. Hence, it is quite possible that Méchain accidentally observed M 101 twice, indeed, but that Mes- sier then, while looking for the acclaimed object, found a real nebula – M 102 alias NGC 5866 was probably his last nebula discovery. The supplementary Messier objects The original Messier catalog of 1784 contains 103 explicit entries. Ne- vertheless, today’s commonly accepted number of Messier objects is 110. The supplements have been added on in the twentieth century, according to evidence for objects observed by Messier but not (or not explicitly) included in his catalog. An important role is played by the above-mentioned letter of Méchain to Bernoulli, because it contains comments on further observed objects. The other important source is Messier’s personal copy of the catalog, which contains his handwritten notes. In 1924, Camille Flammarion discovered and bought that very copy, and he found Messier’s notes in it.

It is not tabulated in the Connoissance des Temps. M 105 M. Messier thereat reports [in the catalog of 1774] p. 264 and 265, two nebulous stars, which I found in the Lion. I could not fi nd fault with the noted positions, which were obtained by com- paring them to Regulus. But there is a third a bit to the north, which is more vivid than the two preceding. I discovered it on March 24 th , 1781, 4 or 5 days after I found the two others. On April 10 th , I compared its position with J , obtaining a right as- cension 159° 3' 45\" and its southern declination 13° 43' 58\". M 106 In July 1781 I found another nebulous patch near the Great Bear next to the star No. 3 of the Hunting Dogs and 1° farther south, I estimated its right ascension 181° 40' and the northern declination approximately 49°. I will shortly try to determine the exact position of the same. M 107 In April 1782 I discovered a small nebulous patch on the left shank of Ophiuchus between the stars ] and T , whose position I have not yet observed closely. In 1947 Helen Sawyer Hogg, who rediscovered the reprint of Méchains letter, suggested adding these four objects to the offi cial Messier list in the order in which they are described. The printed catalog already mentioned M 108 and M 109 implicitly, in the note on M 97. These discoveries are also mentioned in the letter of Méchain, see below. This led Owen Gingerich to suggest, in 1953, adding them to the offi cial Messier list, too. M 108, M 109 Page 265 No. 97. A nebulous patch near E in the Great Bear. M. Messier remarks on two others, while noting its position, which I discovered as well and of which one is close to it, the other lies near J in the Great Bear, I have not been able to determine their positions yet. The last supplemental object (M 110), the second companion galaxy of M 31, was made an offi cial Messier object by Kenneth Glyn Jones. As a matter of fact, Messier had already observed and sketched that dwarf galaxy in 1773. But for unknown reasons, he did not include it in his catalog, and his observing notes were published only in 1798, in the 1801 edition of the Connaissance des Temps. Did Messier and Méchain fi nd any other objects? Apart from the above-cited hints given by Messier, there is also supporting evidence in Méchain’s letter to Bernoulli: On page 262 and 263 [of his last catalog version], M. Messier mentions several nebulous patches in the Virgin which I have indicated to him. But, there are more of them in the said area, which he did not see, and of which I will determine the positions, as soon as I have a convenient observing place, which will not be delayed too much. However, like Messier, Méchain did not continue with his nebula search. Apparently, he never found “a more convenient observing place,” and he was soon to become involved in other demanding work."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"39 Messier’s catalog exists in three versions: 1.

For each object, Messier also gives the date of his observation (which also is the equinox for the position), the right ascension in hours as well as in degrees, the declination in degrees, and (for most but not all objects) the angular diameter. Positive declinations are indicated by an “A,” negative by a “B.” For many objects discovered by Méchain, Messier lists both positional mea- surements, his and Méchain’s. The translation tries to maintain the cha- racter of the old-fashioned language, as well as Messier’s very individualistic use of a “:” for a “;.” Messier also indicates his other publica- tions, referring to himself as “M.[onsieur] Mes- sier.” The telescopes are characterized by their focal length.

The descriptions stem from the use of different telescopes (see box) and are, consequently, of varying quality. The object brightness, which Messier would still see or describe as faint, varies accordingly. The faintest object of the fi rst catalog version is also its fi rst, M 1 with magnitude 8.4. Almost all other entries are brighter than 8 th magnitude, most fall even into the range of 5 th to 7 th magni- tude. Apart from M 31, M 32, and M 33, no galaxies are listed in the fi rst catalog version; they were too faint for Messier’s in- strumentation at that time. Hence, most of the fi rst 45 entries are open clusters, some globular clusters and a few galactic nebulae, plus one single planetary nebula. For his second catalog, Messier was able to use better optical instruments. By 1773 he had received one of the fi rst achromatic refractors from the collection of his friend de Saron. This tele- scope is mentioned in detail in the description of Messier’s dra- wing of M 42. From then on, Messier’s discoveries reach nearly down to magnitude 10, including many galaxies. This trend con- tinues with the third part, which includes objects at the percep- tion limit of a modern 2-inch telescope under a dark sky. Many of these were contributed by Méchain, who worked at the Royal Observatory – we may safely assume that his instruments were better than Messier’s. Messier’s fi rst catalog (M 1 to M 45) contains exact descrip- tions of the telescopes and magnifi cations he used. The telescope mentioned in almost every more detailed description is a Gregori- an refl ector of 30 inches (French) focal length, 6 inches aperture and a (probably fi xed) magnifi cation of 104×. Modern notation would have it as a 6.4-inch f/5 system (162mm aperture, 810mm focal length) with an eyepiece focal length of 7.8mm. With an apparent fi eld of view of 30°, it covered 17' in the sky. This tele- scope is mentioned in the descriptions of M 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 15, 19, 22, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 35, 42, and 43, while for M 13 and M 31, a Newtonian telescope of 4.5-feet focal length and a power of 65× is noted. It is most likely that Messier made his discoveries with smaller telescopes, which he used for comet hunting. The purpose of the larger optics was to make detailed descriptions and to measure the positions of the new objects. In the third catalog, Messier ranks his telescopes according to their focal length in fi ve cate- gories. These were also used by him to characterize the diffi culty of an object: 1 foot observed objects: M 3, M 5, M 13, M 33, M 41, M 92 The faintest of these targets is M 92 at magnitude 6.4. M 41 was not reco- gnized by Messier as a star cluster but taken for a nebula. Since its brightest stars reach magnitude 6.9, the limiting magnitude of this telescope under the Parisian night sky must have been between magnitudes 6.5 and 7.0. 2 foot observed objects: M 2 The optical performance of this telescope cannot have been much better than that of the 1-foot telescope. A page from Messier’s observing logbook. In his entry made on the 7 th of July 1758, Messier describes the refl ector with which he observed the moons of Jupiter and stellar occultations. As shown here, the telescope is set up for measurements of the exact eyepiece focal length."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"49 3 foot observed objects: M 8, M 10, M 11, M 25, M 26, M 30, M 34, M 35 The faintest of these objects is M 26 with magnitude 8.0. However, M 10 at ma- gnitude 6.6 was already characterized as “diffi cult” by Messier, and resolving the stars of M 25 beginning at magnitude 6.7 was not easy for him, either. He barely resolved M 34 (brightest stars magnitude 7.3), but not M 11 (brightest stars magni- tude 8) which he described as a nebula when seen with this instrument, likewise with M 35, which Messier could resolve only with the Gregorian telescope. Hence, the limiting magnitude of the 3-foot refractor must have been between magnitu- des 7.5 and 8.0. 3.5 foot observed objects: M 14, M 17, M 18, M 19, M 22, M 23, M 26, M 27, M 28, M 29, M 30, M 32, M 36, M 37, M 39, M 49, M 51, M 81 The faintest of these objects is the Virgo cluster galaxy M 49 at magnitude 8.4. Like M 28, M 30, and M 51, it appeared “very faint” to Messier. Some star clusters remained unresolved: M 18 (brightest stars magnitude 8.7), M 29 (brightest stars 8.6), M 36 (brightest stars 8.7), and M 37 (brightest stars 9.2). This indicates a li- miting magnitude of 8.5. 6 foot The only time Messier mentions this focal length is in connection with M 40. He described this stellar pair of magnitudes 9.0 and 9.3 as nebulous, and we may infer a limiting magnitude of around 10.0 from that. For the remaining objects, Messier did not specify which telescopes were used. These include many of the entries in the third version of the catalog. However, it is likely that Messier chiefl y employed the 3.5-inch f/12 achromatic refractor (89mm aperture, 1067mm focal length), which he had received from de Saron and described as his favorite instrument. This telescope was mentioned without full details several times, for example in the descriptions for M 54 (observed 1778) and M 76. One criterion Messier used to describe an object as faint was its inability to be seen even when the micrometer’s illumination was set at its lowest level. In this category we fi nd M 58, 59, 63, 69, 71, 76, 83, 88, 89, 90, 91, 97, 98, 99, and M 100, all observed after 1779. The faintest of these are M 76, M 98, and M 91 at magni- tude 10.1. Messier could resolve the brightest stars in the clusters M 4 (magnitude 10.8), M 46 (brightest stars 8.7), M 52 (brightest stars 8.2), and M 67 (brightest stars 9.7). But M 71 (brightest stars magnitude 12.1) and other globular clusters remained a “nebula without stars.” Hence, the telescopic limiting magnitude must have been about 11.0 for the 6.4-inch Gregorian he used in the fi rst edition, as well as for the 3.5-inch Dollond he prefered later. Modern visual observers are puzzled by the lack of observed detail reported by Messier. The only globular cluster in which he was able to see the brightest stars was M 4 – the rest remained a “nebula without stars” to him. By contrast, a modern 3.5-inch refractor under dark skies would resolve the brightest stars in at least half a dozen of Messier’s globular clusters. Furthermore, it appears that Messier had not seen any of the true nebulosity of M 20, and he probably mistook M 76 and M 78 for star clusters. He even believed that he saw stars in M 57, which had been de- scribed correctly as a nebulous disk by its discoverer Darquier already. Méchain, in particular, seems to have carried out better observations than Mes- sier in that respect. Good examples are their different descriptions of the four ob- jects M 75 to M 78, in which Messier disagrees with Méchain’s notes: Why were some showpieces left out by Messier? The Messier catalog includes most of the fi nest show- pieces in the night sky, but a few were left out. Sin- ce these missing objects were easily within reach of Messier’s telescopes, many deep-sky observers have been puzzled about their omission. The reason is sim- ple: Messier was not interested in deep-sky objects for their own sake. Instead, he did not want to confuse them with comets. He did not look for them in a syste- matic way, not even during those few months of inten- sive searching. That separates him from William Her- schel, who started to work on his impressive catalog in 1782. But considering the often accidental fi ndings of Messier, his catalog is rather surprisingly complete. The puzzling question in this context is: why then did Messier add four well-known spectacular objects, M 42 to M 45, to his initial list of 41? Certainly, these were not to be confused with a comet. Probably, in this one instance, Messier was tempted to round up his list to a number larger than the 42 objects of his role-model Lacaille. But at the same time, there were not enough showpieces to make it to the next round number, 50 – so he left some out. The most prominent example is the double cluster h & F\u0003 in Messier’s days known as F Per. Messier must have known it, and his contemporary Bode described its fi eld as “to the north of the star F a lot of small stars, looks nice in telescopes.” The fact that this object al- ready had a proper designation and was shown by all star-charts may have been the very reason why Mes- sier did not include it in his list. Several other bright objects were just too large for the fi eld of view of Messier’s telescopes. Good examp- les are the widely spread star clusters IC 4665 or the “coat-hanger,” Collinder 399, which would not have been obvious through Messier’s eyepiece. Messier also knew of some objects in the southern sky, but he wan- ted a catalog of objects that are all observable from Paris, and which he had observed in person. And it is this last of his principles that made his catalog stand out in quality from the lists of his contemporaries. The resulting low number of errors in Messier’s list also made his catalog successful."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"50 Which telescopes did Messier use to discover and to observe his 110 objects? The answer is not easy to give, for three reasons: fi rstly, hardly any sources have survived which would describe the contemporary instrumentation of the observatory at the Hôtel de Cluny. Se- condly, Messier used a variety of telescopes of fi ve different categories, as we know from his descriptions. And thirdly, with the gradual availability of achromatic lenses, there was a tremendous change in optical telescope qua- lity around the time the catalog was accom- plished. In the seventeenth century, telescopes with chromatic lenses (i.e., refractors without color- correction) were the standard. They had a sin- gle objective lens and an eyepiece made of two lenses. The construction principles had been optimized by Christian Huygens. In order to keep the chromatic aberration of the objective lens within limits, these refractors had to have extremely long focal lengths: an aperture of 70mm required a length of 8m! Therefore, the telescopes were made of two movable parts, both riding on a long rod. With the longest te- lescopes, they were connected only by a rope under tension. The objective lens was at the far upper end, mounted on a high pole or steplad- der by means of a simple ball-head. The eyepi- ece at the lower end by the observer resided on a small stepladder. Equatorial mounts were not yet known, and a tube would have been too heavy for these long telescopes. The long focal lengths imposed magnifi cations of over 100× and very small fi elds of view. In our time, it is hard to imagine how cum- bersome any telescopic observation must have been in those days. First, the object had to be carefully aimed at with the rod. Then, with a most gentle touch, the remote ball-head, sup- porting the objective lens at the far end, had to be fi xed. Tracking the object with this clum- sy construction and a magnifi cation of over 100× must have required a lot of training and patience. Despite such disadvantages, all major astronomical discoveries between 1650 and 1730 had been achieved with this kind of chro- matic refractor, and even whole maps of the moon had been drawn! We can be pretty certain that Messier’s “ordinary refractors” of 1, 2, 3, 3.5, and 6-foot focal length were exactly that kind of clum- sy, chromatic telescope. He favored the smaller telescopes with focal lengths of 1 meter or less, becau- se these had a tube which reduced stray light and greatly facilitated their use. But even Messier’s 6-foot refractor was a dwarf compared to the longest contemporary refractors with focal lengths of over 30m. Around the mid-eighteenth centu- ry, coinciding with Messier’s active period, the time of these mons- trous telescopes fi nally came to an end as the result of two new developments: fi rst, James Short (1710–1768), a London-based opti- cian, developed a method to produ- ce telescope primary mirrors from shiny metal-alloys (front-silvered glass-mirrors would come only la- ter). From 1743 to 1768, Short was the fi rst to produce telescopes in large numbers. 1400 Short-refl ec- tors were made by his little compa- ny, mostly employing the Gregori- an design and mounted on a short table-top stand or ordinary tripod. For quite some time, Short’s refl ectors were regarded as the best telescopes worldwide. His largest mirrors would reach 22 inches diame- ter! The second important invention was made only a little later, also in London: the achro- matic (color-corrected) refractor. The idea of combining lenses from two different types of glass to minimize the color aberration already existed, but it was the optician John Dollond (1706–1761), who secured the patent rights and started large-scale production of achro- matic refractors in 1758. After his death, his son took over and expanded the company. In the beginning, Dollond’s refractors were very expensive, due to extraordinary de- mand. Hence, working in an observatory with humble fi nancial means, Messier had to wait many years before he could lay his hand on one of these fi ne telescopes – which was not until his rich friend de Saron gave him one. In 1772, Dollond’s patent rights expired, and in the face of new competition, the prices for his telescopes dropped considerably. Still, for many years Dollond’s company remained the most important producer of achromatic re- fractors – a technical term, by the way, which was coined by John Bevis, the discoverer of M 1. In the 1807 edition of the Connaissance des Temps, Messier published a list of telescopes he had used in the years 1765 to 1769, in his work on the fi rst catalog of 45 objects. However, their specifi cations almost exclu- sively refer to the focal lengths, given in the French foot (slightly larger than the respec- tive English units: 1 French foot = 0.3248 m Messier’s telescopes Contemporary impression of a tubeless chromatic refractor in the seventeenth century. The objective (i) is mounted and counterbalanced (k–l) on a ball-head (m). It is connected with the eyepiece (o) by a rope under tension. This cumbersome construction was dictated by the long focal length of the single objective lens, required to keep the chromatic aberration as small as possible."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"51 = 12 French inch, 1 French inch = 2.7cm), rarely to the aperture. However, from that source, and from a few more remarks in the literature, we know at least some of the telescopes available to Mes- sier: 1) Chromatic refractors of short focal length (“lunettes ordinaires” or “ordinary refractors”) and, possib- ly, draw-tube telescopes with erect images. The focal lengths were between 1 foot and 3.5 feet, none of the apertures were more than 3.5 inches (80mm), and their optical performance scarce- ly reached that of modern binoculars. 2) Chromatic refractors of long focal length (25 to 30 feet or 8.1m to 9.7m), with magnifi cations of 102× to 138×. These were built ac- cording to the principles developed by Huygens, with an f-ratio of over 1:100 to keep color aberration under control. Hence, the respective telescopes at hand for Messier would have been between 70/8100 mm and 80/9740 mm. It was already pointed out how cumbersome their use was in night- ly practice, providing only a very small fi eld of view, and this is why Messier as a comet hunter hardly ever used them. In addition, a Campani refractor is mentioned, with a ma- gnifi cation of 64× and coming from a seven- teenth - century optical workshop. It, too, had a chromatic lens with very long focal length. 3) Achromatic Dollond-refractor with 3¼ French-foot (1.07 m) focal length and a ma- gnifi cation of 120×. This telescope appears to be the one which Messier had described as his favorite instrument, given to him by de Saron. It was specifi ed (in English measurements) as having a 42-inch focal length and 3.5-inch aperture (89/1067mm) and had the same magnifi cation of 120×. It is mentioned in the descriptions of M 54 and M 76. We have to consider, however, that the late - eighteenth - century optics had no coating and, because of their inferior transmission, had a smaller ef- fective aperture by today’s standards. In 1771, Messier used a low-power (27×) 3.5-feet achromatic refractor for comet observation, also given to him by his friend de Saron. For his stay in Lorraine in 1772, he took another achromatic refractor from de Saron with him. It had a focal length of 5 feet, magnifi ed 60×, and was made by the optician Lestang. He also took an “ordinary [chromatic] refractor” of 3.5 feet and a possibly achromatic refractor of 2 feet (“lunette de nuit”). In the publica- tion of a solar observation in 1777, Messier reported use of a 3.5-feet achromat with a triplet-lens objective. And in 1781, he menti- oned a small achromatic refractor of 405mm focal length, as well as a “large achromatic refractor on an equatorial machine” – equa- torial mounts would become more common observatory equipment only in the nineteenth century, after Joseph Fraunhofer invented what is known today as the German equato- rial. 4) Gregorian refl ector made by Short with 6-feet (1.95m) focal length and a magnifi - cation of 110×. The optical specifi cations of Short’s telescopes are known very well from his price lists. A telescope of such a focal length had the remarkable aperture of 12 in- ches. In addition, Messier mentioned a Short refl ector of only 1 foot focal length with 44× magnifi cation, which must have had 3 inches of aperture as a Gregorian. The Gregorian- refl ector he initially used, for the fi rst catalog version, had an 810mm (32-inch) focal length and an aperture of 162mm (6.4 inches). 5) Newtonian refl ector of 4.5-feet (1.46m) focal length and a magnifi cation of 60×, with 8 inches of aperture. This telescope belonged to the Royal Observatory, but Messier was allowed to use it occasionally, as for detailed observations of M 42 and Comet Halley. Dollond refractors, the fi rst achromatic refractors produced in large numbers, arrived on the optical market in 1758. Messier used such a telescope with 90mm (3.5 inches) of aperture for many of his deep-sky observations. Gregorian refl ectors made by Short were in widespread use at the end of the eighteenth century. Apart from a large telescope with a 310mm aperture, Messier used a smaller model similar to the one pictured here."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"52 • M 75: Messier believed that he saw individual stars, Méchain re- ported just a nebula. And indeed, at magnitude 14.6, even the brigh- test individual stars are far below the perception limit of Messier’s and Méchain’s telescopes. • M 76: as above, Messier reported individual stars, Méchain just a nebula, but the object does not contain any stars brighter than 13 th magnitude. Messier could not have seen them. • M 77: as above, Messier took it for a star cluster, while Méchain saw a nebula. In fact, it is a galaxy with a star-like core. • M 78: Messier saw a star cluster with nebulosity, Méchain a nebula with two bright cores. In reality, this is a refl ection nebula with two embedded 9 th -magnitude stars. For some other objects, Messier’s observational impressions are obvi- ously so vague that he was misled in determining the type of object. Some discrepancies are so large that several modern astronomers have started to doubt whether Messier saw the respective objects at all. One is the Trifi d Nebula M 20, which was classifi ed by Messier as a star clus- ter. Another example is the aforementioned M 57, where Messier belie- ved the Ring Nebula consisted of stars. A different case is M 16. Here, Messier correctly reported a star cluster with nebulous background, but the real nebula is too faint to have been seen by him. It was discovered photographically in the early twentieth century and received a separate designation as IC 4703. However, this may well be a misjudgment of Messier’s visual ta- lents. We may simply be underestimating the light pollution of noc- turnal Paris in the eighteenth century. In fact, at that time, Paris was the largest city in the world with a population of 800,000. There are contemporary descriptions of how chaotic the situation was in the lar- ge city. Smoke from oven-heated houses, numerous factories and open fi res must have created air pollution considerably worse than today’s, scattering and absorbing more starlight. In addition, all public streets and squares were fl oodlit by oil-burning lamps every winter (October to March) from 1667 until their gradual destruction after the French revolution in 1789. Not surprisingly, the Royal Observatory (founded in 1667) was given a location outside the city, but the Observatory of the Navy was quite central. Hence, Messier’s night sky may have been much worse than we imagine. Messier’s notes themselves give an impression of the severity of light pollution in his day. Assuming a loss of transmission due to un- coated optics of 30% in his 3.5-inch Dollond refractor would lead to an equivalent aperture of 3 inches or 75mm. Such an instrument has a limiting magnitude of about 12 under dark rural skies (naked-eye limit 6.5). As analyzed above, the faintest stars Messier could actually see with this instrument were around 11.0, which leads to a naked eye limit of about 5.5 – similar to a severely polluted suburban sky today. Messier’s telescopic limit with the 6.4-inch Gregorian was at about 11 th magnitude, as he could see individual stars in M 4 at 10.8, but not resolve any other globular cluster. We know that the metal mirrors of Messier’s time had a very poor refl ectance and losses totalled up to 50%, effectively downsizing the 6.4-inch to a mere 4.5-inch. This in- strument would have a limiting magnitude of about 11, if the naked eye limit was only 4.5 – which is equivalent to observing conditions frequently occurring today in large cities. Another point to consider is the illumination used by Messier for his star-charts, his notes and his reticle. He had no electric light at his disposal; everything was lit with oil lamps and torches – the thought of which would invoke horror in any visual observer today. So, compared to many modern deep-sky observers, Messier was seriously disadvantaged in terms of instrumentation, and yet he also had to deal with the light pollution many of us experience. With this in mind, we can understand Messier’s mistakes and award him the cre- dit he deserves."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"53 When Charles Messier observed the objects that eventually made up his famous catalog, his visual impressions only allowed him to distinguish between “amas d’étoiles” (star clusters) and “nebuleuse” (nebulae). By our modern methods of astrophysics, we can fi nally classify Messier’s objects according to their physical categories. His catalog contains: • 6 Galactic nebulae • 28 Open clusters • 4 Planetary nebulae • 29 Globular clusters • 40 Galaxies • 3 other objects In this list, M 8 has been counted as an open (star) cluster, because Mes- sier noted the star cluster as the main object. M 16, of which Messier could not see the surrounding nebulosity, is registered as a star cluster, while the nebula has its separate catalog designation (IC 4703). M 20, regarded by Messier as a star cluster like the other two objects, is clas- sifi ed as a galactic nebula today. But in reality, modern classifi cation is still a bit ad hoc. For example, the galactic nebulae M 17, M 20, and M 42 are best known for their dust-enshrouded, young star clusters in the process of formation, only hidden in visual light. M 45, the Pleiades, is the brightest Messier object with a total ma- gnitude of 1.2. This bright star cluster is visible to the naked eye even under a light-polluted sky. The status of the faintest Messier object is shared by M 76, M 91, and M 98, all at a total magnitude of only 10.1. The largest in angular size of all Messier objects is undoubtedly the Andromeda Galaxy (M 31) at 4° × 1°. Under a very dark, transparent sky, a visual size of as much as 5° has been reported. However, in ab- solute terms, the galaxy M 101 is the physically largest object of the Messier catalog. With a diameter of 184,000 light-years, it reaches 1½ times the size of our neighbor galaxy M 31 and almost twice the size of our own galaxy. M 31 just happens to be the nearest large spiral galaxy, at only 2.5 million light-years distance, which is what makes it look so large. By contrast, the object with the smallest angular diameter is M 40, a pair of stars separated by only 49\", followed by M 73 and M 76 at just 1' in diameter. Planetary nebula M 76 appears to be, if its supposed distance of 2550 light-years is correct, the physically smallest Messier object with a diameter of 0.7 light-years, while both M 40 and M 73 are not physical objects at all. 69 objects in Messier’s list are members of our own Milky Way and thus relatively near: only 430 light-years separate us from the Pleiades, but we are 78,000 light-years from globular cluster M 75, the farthest galactic Messier object. The 41 extragalactic objects are all galaxies, with one exception: M 54 is a globular cluster of the near dwarf gala- xy SagDEG. The most distant Messier object is the galaxy M 109 with considerable 67.5 million light-years – that is 157,000× more distant than M 45! On an age scale, the Messier objects cover an even larger range than their distances do. The youngest object, M 1, was created less than 1000 years ago by a supernova, recorded by historic civilizations in the year 1054. The globular clusters M 69 and M 92 have, by contrast, an age of 12 to 13 thousand million years, almost as old as the whole Universe. The galactic nebulae Galactic nebulae make up a most diverse category, which includes all of the diverse gaseous and dusty nebulae in our galaxy. The Messier catalog contains several star-forming HII regions, a refl ection nebula, and a supernova remnant. HII regions contain mostly hydrogen gas that has a very low density by laboratory standards and is ionized by the ultraviolet (UV) light of nearby hot stars. While cool, neutral hydrogen (HI) remains unobser- vable in visual light, ionized hydrogen (HII) recombines and emits in the Balmer lines of H D at 656nm, and H E at 486nm. From the traces of heavier elements in these gaseous nebulae, we also receive line emis- sion in visual light from doubly ionized oxygen ([OIII], at 501nm and 496nm) and of singly ionized nitrogen ([NII], at 658nm and 655nm). In order to get any nearby or surrounding hydrogen gas to glow, a star must have a suffi ciently energetic ultraviolet radiation fi eld. Hence, HII regions are created only by very hot stars of spectral type O and early B. These short-lived, luminous, and massive stars are found only in young star clusters and star-forming regions, which are surrounded by an HII region – gas that was not consumed by the star formation Statistics of the Messier objects"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"54 process, often found to survive in the dense, dusty and opaque interior of the cloud. Here, globules are found: dense, round dark nebulae that contain a proto-star. M 42 is a good example of how the energetic ioni- zing radiation of the luminous hot stars forms an opening in the inner cloud of dust and gas by radiation-driven erosion, while the youngest part of the star cluster still remains hidden inside. M 20, by contrast, appears more spherical, as there is only one dominating hot star in its center, which creates an HII region equally distributed around it. Stars with cooler photospheres may be very luminous, but their weak ultraviolet radiation may not be suffi cient to ionize the surroun- ding gas. Instead, if dust is present, their light can be refl ected off the dust particles and scattered. This is what we see as a refl ection nebula. Since the scattering process is more effi cient in blue light, these nebulae appear bluish – like the part of M 20, which contrasts with the ionized, red H-emitting part. The only pure refl ection nebula in the Messier ca- talog is M 78. Well known but faint are the refl ection nebulae around the Pleiades. They do not represent leftover material from the formati- on of the stars, but rather an unrelated interstellar cloud accidentally passed by the cluster. A rare case consists of the orange nebulae that refl ect the light of red supergiant Antares, near M 4 and M 80. A very different type of object is M 1: it is the remnant of a very massive star that was destroyed by a supernova explosion nearly 1000 years ago. Such a catastrophic event is caused by the gravitational collapse of a massive stellar core, following the exhaustion of its nu- clear fuel. It leaves behind a chaotically structured shell of material expanding at up to 20,000 km/s, the nebulous supernova remnant, and a super-dense stellar remnant, a neutron star. It is so dense because, during the gravitational collapse, electrons and protons have merged to neutrons, which are now packed as densely as in an atomic nucle- us. The enormous reduction in size, in combination with conservation of angular momentum, has, for the M 1 neutron star, led to a super-fast rotation of 33 times per second. The magne- tic fi eld has been compressed by a factor of 10 million. Its axis is inclined with respect to the rotation axis, and as the intense fi eld lines move rapidly through the surroun- ding electron gas, a bluish glimmer of synchrotron ra- diation is created. This is the same process as observed by physicists in large electron accelerator rings. The neutron star in M 1 is also known as a pulsar from radio observa- tions. M 1 lies at a distance of 6200 light-years, which is al- most fi ve times further than to the star-forming nebulae M 42, M 43, and M 78, all part of the Orion cloud, and grea- ter still than the distances to M 8 and M 17. The open clusters Open (star) clusters, loose ac- cumulations of a few dozen to several thousand stars, are the result of a star formation process that once consumed a dense cloud of interstellar material.

Depending on its total mass and on the gravitational inter- actions with its environment, a star cluster can hold together for several million to even a few thousand million years. But with time, the cluster stars are lost to the galactic disk. Large molecular clouds can create a number of neighboring star clu- sters of similar age that form an association. M 36 and M 37, for example, belong to the Auriga-OB-association. OB indicates that the hottest spectral types are still present in this young formation. These luminous stars burn faster and the most massive members very soon explode as supernovae. The other massive stars evolve to become red giants. M 37, M 50, and M 103 are examples of open clusters that already contain their fi rst red giants. Hence, the youngest star clusters can be recognized by the very hot and massive stars among their members. A good example is 2-million-year-old M 8 with 9 Sgr. Even younger are the clusters still in the process of forma- tion in M 42, M 20, and M 17. At the other extreme is M 67 with an age of 3.7 thousand million years. To a large extent, it owes its long survival to its sparsely populated galactic environment. The poorest Messier clusters are M 18 and M 39 with only 40 and 60 confi rmed member stars each. They are also the smallest clusters of the Messier catalog at only about 10 light-years in diameter. The richest open cluster in the Messier catalog is probably M 52 (about 6000 stars), followed by M 11 (2900) and M 35 (2700). M 11, together with M 37, is also among the largest open clusters in general. With a diameter of 50 light-years, each is the size of a small globular cluster. Plotting the open clusters in the galactic plane around the Sun at their proper distances, we obtain a pattern that coincides with the spiral arms of our galaxy. Most of the nearer open clusters, beginning with the Plei- ades at a distance of only 430 light-years, are in the Orion arm. The Sun itself lies in the inner edge of that same arm. Towards the galactic center, a number of clusters mark the Sagittarius arm. It hosts, for example, M 11, M 16, and M 8. In the opposite direction lies the Perseus arm with M 103 (at a distance of 7200 light-years) and h & F Persei. Even further away (12,000 light-years) towards the galactic edge is NGC 2158, which in the sky appears to be a close neighbor of M 35. The planetary nebulae Messier’s catalog contains only four planetary nebulae. These objects are a by-product of the creation of white dwarfs. This is the evolutionary fate of most stars, except the most massive ones which will undergo a supernova explosion. A planetary nebula, by contrast, is formed by a gradual process: in the fi nal, very cool supergiant stages with a highly compressed stellar core, the star’s surface gravity becomes extremely low. Under these condi- tions, a cool, slow, and relatively dense wind or “superwind” removes all of the remaining outer stellar layers in the fi nal twenty- to fi fty-thousand years. With the exposure of a now “naked” hot core, a much thinner, hot and very fast wind starts. As it pushes outwards, accompanied by ionizing ultraviolet radiation, an ionized shell is formed inside the cool, still slowly expanding circumstellar gas and dust – a glowing nebula with emission lines, not unlike an HII region, but for very different physical reasons. The higher densities in the shells of planetary nebulae favor [OIII] line emis- sion over the hydrogen Balmer lines (i.e., H D , H E – the intensity ratio can Trümpler classifi cation of open clusters This classifi cation scheme was introduced in 1930 by Robert J. Trümpler. Born in Switzerland, he emigrated to the USA early in the twentieth century. He thought that clusters of similar ap- pearance (same Trümpler class) would be physically alike (e.g., have the same size). If so, the distances to open clusters could be estimated, and they could be used to trace galactic struc- ture. The Trümpler classifi cation has four parameters, which describe: Appearance I with strong central concentration, standing out well. II cluster with weak central concentration, standing out well. III cluster without any noticeable concentration, stars distri- buted thinly but evenly, standing out well. IV cluster, which does not stand out well from the back- ground but appears like a concentration in the star fi eld. Brightness distribution of cluster stars 1 most cluster stars have nearly the same brightness. 2 moderate brightness distribution of the stars. 3 cluster composed of bright and faint stars, typically a few very bright and several moderately bright stars standing out from a large group of faint stars.

Today the Trümpler classifi ca- tion system is hardly ever used, since it is very subjective and depends on the observing method.

The ionizing power of the hot wind and ultraviolet radiation fades on a timescale of about 10,000 years. At the same time, the now aged planetary nebula begins to disperse, just like the last breath of a “dying” star. Planetary nebulae reach sizes of only a few light-years. In the Messier catalog, they span about the range of 0.7 (M 76) to 3.5 (M 97) light-years. Exact sizes and di- stances, however, are notoriously diffi cult to assess for these objects. The globular clusters Globular clusters are dynamically stable objects, due to their large total mass. Their name relates to their mostly spherical form. About 150 of these objects are known in the Galaxy, which they surround in a wi- despread halo. However, that number is dwarfed by the quantity of globular clusters surrounding other galaxies, e.g., 16,000 around the giant galaxy M 87. Looking at the distribution of our globular clusters in the sky, there is a remarkable concentration towards the galactic center – the inner halo. These globular clusters are frequently found in, or crossing, our galactic disk while orbi- ting the galactic center. The nearest globular clusters have di- stances comparable to those of open clu- sters. M 4 at about 5600 light-years, for example, is nearer to us than M 11. Towards the galactic center, however, we not only see globular clusters in front of it (like M 22), but also next to it (like M 28) or on its far side (M 72). Towards M 75 at a distance of 78,000 light-years, our view crosses two-thirds of the galactic diameter. A special case among the globular clusters is M 54. It is not a ga- lactic object but belongs to the small dwarf galaxy SagDEG. Hence, at a distance of 85,000 light-years, this is the most distant globular clu- ster of the Messier catalog. The physical size and the mass of globular clusters differ greatly. The smallest example is M 71: with 40,000 solar masses and fewer than 100,000 stars, it is not much larger than the largest open clusters. At the other extreme are M 19 and M 54, each with several million stars and a mass of 1.5 million solar masses, approximately that of a dwarf galaxy. Photographs, in particular, give the impression of very high star densities in globular clusters. In reality, however, there are between 10 and 1000 stars per cubic light-year at their centers – which means that the average distance between stars is still 0.1 to 0.5 light-years. Only when a globular cluster has undergone a core collapse (by dynamical instability and transfer of kinetic energy out of the core region) are super-densities of up to 100,000 stars per cubic light-year reached. A visual measure of the degree of concentration is the classifi cation of globular clusters into class I (extremely compact) to XII (very loose), analogous to the “Trümpler classes” for open clusters. While this scheme has no relevance to astrophysical research any more, it is a very useful one for the visual amateur observer. The most concentrated globular cluster in the Messier catalog is M 2 (II), the loosest examples are M 55 and M 71 (XI). Galactic globular clusters have ages of about 10 to 13 thousand million years – about 100 times older than most open clusters. Having lost their interstellar matter, globular clusters cannot form new stars. Hence, all their member stars are very old, which is why they show the elemental composition of earlier stages of the Universe. Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium can form only by the central nucle- ar processes of stars and supernova explosions, and they are dispersed The distribution of open clusters and galactic nebulae of the Messier catalog on the galactic plane, within a radius of 10,000 light-years around the Sun.

Hence, globular clusters give testimony of the early Uni- verse when heavy elements were much less abun- dant, and that distinguishes them from all other stellar clusters. Low abundance of heavy elements and low stellar mass bring about a special group of vari- ables, typical for globular clusters: the pulsating RR Lyrae stars. Lacking a static equilibrium bet- ween radiation pressure and gravity, these stars oscillate over the course of a few hours and show brightness variations of about 0.5 to 2 magnitu- des. In addition, there are other types of variables in globular clusters. The record holder is M 3 with 274 known variable stars, while in M 10 only four variables have been discovered so far. Luminous stars of spectral type O and B are not found in globular clusters, because these stars “die” very young. Oddly enough, a few blue stars are found in globular clusters: “blue stragglers.” Hence, these must have been formed recently – supposedly by the merging of close, old binary stars. Some globular clusters even host pulsars. The record holder in the Messier catalog is M 62 with six of them. The galaxies An older technical term for galaxies was “extra- galactic nebulae.” However, that does not refl ect their true nature as distant milky ways in their own right, with many thousand millions of stars, thousands of open clusters, globular clusters, and HII regions. In the nearest galaxies, the mem- bers of our Local Group, we are able to observe such individual objects. The Andromeda Galaxy (M 31) in particular is a nice example of a large spiral galaxy. It has a diameter of about 160,000 light-years and 300 to 400 thousand million solar masses. By contrast our other neighbor, M33, has only about one tenth of the mass of M 31. With increasing distance from us, groups and clusters of galaxies become more obvious in the sky. M 81 and M 82 are 12 million light-years away, M 51 is 27 million light-years. These form two small, widely scattered galaxy groups with other, smaller galaxies, mostly dwarfs. A large and dense gathering of galaxies, by contrast, is the center of the Virgo galaxy cluster at a distance of 45 to 62 million light-years. About 2500 galaxies are packed within a diameter of 10 to 15 milli- on light-years, 14 of them are found in the Messier catalog. The most distant example of all Messier galaxies is M 109 at about 67.5 million light-years. It is 26 times farther away than M 31, 770 times more di- stant than M 54, and 150,000 times farther than M 45. Dwarf galaxies like M 32, which is tied by gravity to its mother ga- laxy M 31, may have diameters of only a few thousand light-years. At the other extreme, M 101 measures about 185,000 light-years, almost twice as much as our own Milky Way.

The core is surrounded by outer layers that provide the right conditions to transport the energy outside, by radiation or by convection. Depending on mass, however, stars can have very different temperatures (from 3000K to 100,000K) and den- sities in their photospheres. The conditions in these outermost layers can be determined by a detailed spectral analysis of the star’s light. Although developed 120 years ago, the spectral classifi cation scheme below is still used today by professional astronomers, because it imme- diately gives an approximate temperature value. The spectral types of stars are characterized by specifi c absorption lines from different elements and ions in the photosphere – correspon- ding to a specifi c temperature range: O >30,000K very hot, blue stars, lines of ionized helium B 11,000-30,000K hot, blue stars, lines of neutral but excited he- lium and hydrogen A 7500-11,000K white stars, lines of excited hydrogen F 6000-7500K nearly white stars, lines of ionized calcium G 5000-6000K yellow stars, lines of ionized iron and other metals K 3800-5000K cool, orange stars, lines of neutral metals M <3800K very cool, red stars, lines of titanium-oxide and neutral metals Every spectral class is divided into 10 subclasses from 0 to 9. For very cool, red stars, there are two additional, special classes: S <3800K very cool stars, additional lines of rare-earth elements (i.e., Zr) C <3800K very cool stars, very strong carbon lines In addition, there are luminosity classes, as the more luminous stars display better defi ned lines due to much lower gravity and density in their photospheres: I supergiant II bright giant III giant IV subgiant V dwarf (main-sequence star) VI subdwarf Each luminosity class could be divided into two or three subclasses: a, ab, and b. Together with the spectral type, a complete characterization of the star results. The Sun is a G2V star, a yellow dwarf. If the stars are plotted on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram by luminosity class versus spectral type, a characteristic pattern emerges: the ma- jority of the stars form the so-called main sequence, on which a star spends most of its life. In their cores, main sequence stars burn hydro- gen – by far the longest-lasting stellar source of nuclear energy. Mas- sive stars are hotter and blue, by contrast to low-mass stars (red, low luminosity), but they burn their energy so fast that they have much briefer lives than, for example, the Sun. Because of this, stellar masses and even ages can be estimated from spectral class. The giants and supergiants are very evolved stars, with very compact cores that burn helium or (in massive stars) even carbon. A highly evol- ved core is enveloped in an outer shell of burning hydrogen and an inner shell of burning helium. The surrounding layers of the giant star The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

As a result, the giant’s photosphere has very low gravity and density, and is relatively cool. Low-mass helium-burning stars with low abundances of heavy ele- ments, as found in globular clu- sters, can be quite hot by compari- son to normal helium-burning stars. Hence, instead of being K-giants, they form the horizontal branch in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A special group of these stars are the RR Lyrae variables. After the stellar core of an RR Lyrae variable has consumed its helium, the star becomes a red giant again. Heavier elements then processed in the core can reach the surface by means of convection, and the very evolved star could become class C or S.

The highly advanced age is revealed by the very low turn-off point on the main sequence at spectral type F. The evolved, helium-burning stars here form a “horizontal branch,” on which we also fi nd RR Lyrae variables. In the color-magnitude diagram of a globular cluster, the position of the relatively bright horizontal branch is a good distance indicator. In a color-magnitude diagram, apparent visual brightness is plotted against the B–V color index (brightness in blue light minus brightness in visual light) for all the stars of a specifi c cluster. By contrast to a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, no absolute physical properties are used. Nevertheless, a color-magnitude diagram of an open cluster yields the relative distance and age, as shown here by three examples: M 36 is only 20–40 million years old; all stars are on the main sequence. M 23 is 190 million years old; the most massive stars have already left the main sequence and are now cool giants. M 93 is 400 million years old; all brighter main sequence stars have reached or passed their red giant stages. 22 \u001b\u001c\u001c\u001c\u001c \u001b\u001c\u001c \u001b \u001c3\u001c\u001b \u0003 \u001f !\f\"\u0016 \u000e)\u0015\u0018\b\u0004\t*\u0002\b+)\u0015 ))\t\u0004\u0015\b (\t\u0006\u0005\b\u000f\u0011\u0015 \u001c3\u001c\u001c\u001c\u001b 1-*-\u0004\u0002\u0005\u0011\u00154 2\u001c \u001b' \u001b& \u001b% \u0016\t\u0005\u0002\u000b\u0015\u0017\u000f\u0015\u0018\u0015 /\u0015\u0011\u0002\u0006\u0005\t\b\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 5-\u0004\u00056-\b\t*\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 \u000b+()\b-\b\u0005\u0018 \u0006\u0005\t\b\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 \u0010*\u000f\u0015 \u000b\b\u0004\t\u0006\u0006*\u0015\u0004 \u0014\u0007\u0005\b\u0015\u0002\u0011\u0012\t\u0004\u0013\u000b /\u0015\u0011\u0002\u0006\u0005\t\b\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 5-\u0004\u00056-\b\t*\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 7\u000f\u0004\u001d-\u0013\u0013\u0002)-\u0005\b \u000b+()\b-\b\u0005\u0018\u0002\u0006\u0005\t\b\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 \u0016\t\u0005\u0002\u000b\u0015\u0017\u000f\u0015\u0018\u0015 7\u000f\u0004\u001d-\u0013\u0013\u0002)-\u0005\b ,\u000f(\u0005-\u000b\u0005\b+ \u001c3\u001c \u001c3\u001a \u001b3\u001c \u001b3\u001a 23\u001c 5/0 1\u00160 \u001b3\u001c \u001b2 1-*-\u0004\u0002\u0005\u0011\u00154 \u0003\u00028\u0002\r \u001b& /\u0015\u0011\u0002\u0006\u0005\t\b\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 7\u000f\u0004\u001d-\u0013\u0013\u0002)-\u0005\b \u0016\t\u0005\u0002\u000b\u0015\u0017\u000f\u0015\u0018\u0015 \u001b\u001c ' \u001b2 ))\t\u0004\u0015\b (\t\u0006\u0005\b\u000f\u0011\u0015 \u001b& \u001b\u001c \u001b' \u001b% \u001b2 \u001b\u001b \u001b\u001c 9 \u001b# /\u0015\u0011\u0002\u0006\u0005\t\b\u0002\u0010\u0004\t\u0018\u0007 7\u000f\u0004\u001d-\u0013\u0013\u0002)-\u0005\b \u0016\t\u0005\u0002\u000b\u0015\u0017\u000f\u0015\u0018\u0015 \u0016\t\u0005\u0002\u000b\u0015\u0017\u000f\u0015\u0018\u0015 \u0016\u0002#% \u0016\u00022# \u0016\u00029# 23\u001c \u001c3\u001c \u001b3\u001c 23\u001c \u001b3\u001c \u001c3\u001c \u001c3\u001c"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"60 Spiral galaxies are quite fl at. Compared to elliptical or nearly sphe- rical galaxies of the same diameter, they cover much less volume and possess signifi cantly less mass. Hence, the most massive galaxy of the Messier catalog is the giant elliptical galaxy M 87 in the center of the Virgo cluster with 2700 thousand million solar masses. At the other extreme is the dwarf galaxy M 32 with only 3 thousand million solar masses – a feather-weight by comparison. One focus of the extragalactic research of the last decade has been on galactic nuclei. In many of these, we fi nd physical processes at work that release enormous quantities of energy. In LINER-type gala- xies, emission-line spectra show the ionization of the gas surrounding the galactic nuclei. Seyfert galaxies show signifi cantly more intense emission, in addition to synchrotron radiation and radio emission from the core region. Such “activity” (these nuclei are often called AGN, for “active galaxy nuclei”) is powered by a super-massive central object. This can be a central super star cluster, but in many cases it appears to be a black hole. The masses involved here vary from a modest 10,000 solar masses in the nucleus of M 33 – less than a globular cluster – to an incredible 2 or 3 thousand million solar masses at the center of M 87 – as much as a whole dwarf galaxy. Star formation activity, too, can vary a lot from galaxy to galaxy. Elliptical galaxies contain very little interstellar gas, and there are no star-forming regions at all. Hence, most of the stars are quite old. In contrast, spiral galaxies are rich in gas and contain numerous HII re- gions and young star associations, even star-burst regions which cre- ate a very large number of stars simultaneously, including some very massive ones. It is in such places that we may observe a supernova. In 17 of the 40 Messier galaxies, supernovae have indeed been observed. The record holder is M 83 (6 supernovae), followed by M 61 and M 100 (4 supernovae), and M 99, M 51, and M 84 (3 supernovae). The non-physical objects Three of the 110 Messier objects are not physical objects but only give the impression of being so as seen from our perspective. M 40 is an optical stellar pair – not a physical binary of two stars orbiting a common center of gravity, but a chance alignment of two stars of very different distances, about 490 and 1860 light-years away. That would make star A the second-closest (after M 45) Messier object, although it is only “half” the object. A similar case is M 73, which is a chance alignment of four stars at distances between 900 and 2600 light-years. Such accidental star patterns are found elsewhere in the sky, but the probability of fi nding four stars brighter than 12 th magnitude within 1', away from the dense star fi elds of the Milky Way, is quite low. M 24, fi nally, presents a special case of a 1.5° portion of the Milky Way. Unlike a physical star cloud such as NGC 206 in M 31, however, this apparent cloud is actually a “window” in the opaque interstellar clouds of our galactic plane. Its stars are not in the same place but spread out over distances of 12,000 to 16,000 light-years – the full width of a galactic spiral arm. ally leads to the gradual loss of the outer layers of every red gi- ant star, and the exposure of its hot core, as well as to the relatively brief (10,000–20,000 years) phenomenon of a planetary nebula. The emerging white dwarf does not produce energy, it just cools down very slowly. Evolved massive stars are more luminous and warmer (“blue loop” stage) during their core helium-burning phase than the Sun will be. Some become pulsating Cepheid variables, whose period-luminosity relation is of great consequence for the determination of astronomic- al distances. Only the most massive stars (over 10 solar masses) do not end up as white dwarfs but instead fi nish their lives with a catastro- phic core collapse, visible as a type II supernova. The resulting stellar remnant will then become a neutron star or black hole."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"61 Edwin Hubble developed a morphological classifi cation scheme for ga- laxies, which was later improved by Sandage and de Vaucouleurs.

The choice of instrumentation depends on the respective observing site. Messier himself did not have the benefi t of good obser- ving conditions, and he used telescopes with limited optical capability – comparable to modern binoculars or small telescopes. His favorite telescope was an uncoated but achromatic 3.5-inch refractor. Under similar conditions today, a 3-inch refractor is suffi cient for an experienced observer, even though some objects remain diffi cult to observe. With the exception of M 91, all objects are visible even in 10×50 binoculars under dark skies, even though many of them are quite diffi cult to observe. Less experienced observers should be able to see all 110 objects with a 4-inch telescope.

M 45 can be spotted with the naked eye even from a large city. However, with just a little light pollution, M 91, M 74, or M 76 can be a challenge even to an experienced observer, when tried with a small telescope. The most diffi cult Messier objects to observe are considered to be M 76, M 98, and M 108. M 91 and M 98 are among the 16 Mes- sier galaxies of the Virgo cluster, which is a challenging but rewarding terrain for visual observers. In their vicinity, there are a number of other galaxies beyond Messier’s catalog which are not much fainter. M 91 is probably the most diffi cult to observe of all Messier objects, as it is not visible in 10×50 binoculars even by experienced observers and poses an observing challenge to a 2-inch refractor in a dark sky. The faintest Messier objects Object Type Brightness M 76 PN 10.1 M 91 Gx 10.1 M 98 Gx 10.1 M 108 Gx 10.0 The total brightness is not the only criterion for how diffi cult an ob- servation is. More important, especially with light-polluted skies and direct interference of artifi cial lighting, is the surface brightness of an object. For example, the spiral galaxy M 33 has a low average surface brightness of 23.1 mag/arcsecond 2 , but a total magnitude of 5.7. To be visible, it must meet or exceed a certain contrast value with respect to the background sky. This can be computed from the combined surface brightness of the desired object and the sky background, divided by the surface brightness of the sky background. The result must be suf- fi ciently higher than the threshold of detection of the human eye. The remaining difference, the contrast above threshold, will give a direct measure of how easily a certain object can be perceived. Software such as “Eye & Telescope” can compute this ratio. The results show that, under polluted skies, only the small, relatively bright core of M 33 can be made out even in a large telescope. Hence, in the city, M 33 is one of the most diffi cult Messier objects to observe, while it is a naked-eye object in a clear, dark mountain sky.

At the same magnifi cation, a larger telescope provides a brighter image of an object than a smaller telescope does. However, it also brightens the sky background by the same amount. Hence, for many objects, the choice of the observing site and the quality of the night is more important than the telescope.

Broadband fi lters are sometimes used for observing galaxies and refl ec- tion nebulae, but they help relatively little. While cutting out common wavelengths of light pollution, they also cut these same bands from the continuum emission of stars. Narrowband fi lters, also referred to as UHC fi lters (ultra-high con- trast), have a narrower bandwidth of about 30nm, but are suitable for emission and planetary nebulae only. Line fi lters with a bandwidth of about 10nm allow us to distinguish between the two most important emission lines visible to the eye, [OIII] and H E . [OIII]-fi lters are ideal for planetary nebulae and many other emission nebulae, while H E -fi lters are best for some HII regions only. Stellar objects are less affected by light pollution, including the star clusters. Best seen under very polluted skies are open clusters with many bright stars, i.e., M 44, M 45, and M 41, and concentrated glo- bular clusters, i.e. M 3, M 5, and M 92. In general, and for globular clusters in particular, it is true that higher magnifi cations (15× to 25× per inch of aperture) bring out more faint stars. The background then is darker, but the stars as point sources remain the same, if the seeing is good. It takes most amateurs many years or even decades to see all Mes- sier objects. It is, in fact, not at all diffi cult to do them all in the course of one year. Sometimes, it is even possible to see all of the objects in one night (see “Messier Marathon”), but that requires good preparation. Objects at higher northern declinations are visible for a longer period of time. M 82 and M 81 at +70° declination can be observed at any time throughout the year, as they are circumpolar at observing sites as far south as 25° to 20°N latitude. At 50°N latitude, M 103, M 76, M 34, M 108, M 97, M 109, M 106, M 94, M 63, M 51, M 101, M 92, M 39, and M 52 never set. Even M 31 with its companions M 32 and M 110 does so, but actually can barely be observed on spring nights. For observers at mid-northern latitudes, the southern Messier ob- jects cause more of a problem, because they are affected by inferior observing conditions near the horizon. The southernmost object M 7 is all but impossible to see from latitudes north of 55°N; the northernmost sightings have been reported from 53° 11'. Fortunately, it is also one of the brightest Messier objects (magnitude 3.3) and can be spotted very low above the horizon. Much more critical in that respect are the loose globular cluster M 55 and the galaxy M 83.

That leaves observers only very few very clear nights between March and May to detect M 83. The distribution of Messier objects over the sky is uneven. All ob- jects are north of –35° declination, and there are fewer in the fall sky. In fact, it is the gap between M 30 and M 74 (while M 52 is circumpolar to about 35°N latitude) which enables us to do a complete Messier Ma- rathon on a spring night. The highest concentration of Messier objects is in the Virgo galaxy cluster, which hosts 15 of them in a fi eld of 10° × 10°. In addition, there are a number of attractive pairs or groups of Messier objects. Many are pairs of same object type, but M 20 / M 21, M 72 / M 73, and M 97 / M 108 contain two very different objects.

In the 1970s, some ob- servers realized that there are no Messier objects between ecliptic longitude 320° and 30°, a gap of 70°. Hence, a new-moon night in March, used from dusk to dawn, provides the chance to see all 110 Messier objects in one run. A second opportunity is provided by an October night. Still, on any other night of the year, northern observers can see at least 95 of the Messier objects. The goal to see all of the 110 objects is not quite achievable for observers based in northern Europe or the northern US. M 30 and M 55 are invisible in March, while M 83, M 104, and M 6 cannot be observed in October. They remain too close to the ho- rizon at dusk or dawn. Obser- vers from latitudes further south are better off: between +10° and +35°, all 110 objects can be done, because the duration of dusk and dawn is shorter, and the critical objects are higher above the horizon. In the whole southern hemisphere, the Mes- sier Marathon is impossible, be- cause many objects are far north of the celestial equator. In a Messier Marathon, success depends on the hours of dusk and dawn. In March, M 74 and M 33 have to be observed as early as possible; they set before the end of twilight in most of the US and Europe. The situati- on is even more critical in the morning: while M 30 is usual- ly out of reach, there are M 69, M 70, M 54, M 72, M 73, M 2, M 75, and M 55 all to be obser- ved as soon as they have risen above the western horizon. At that time, it is a race against the advancing dawn. In general, the situation becomes more critical in the evening sky for nights later in March. The available time is reduced by six minutes every day. At the same time, only two minutes per day are won in the mor- ning, because the nights get shorter. Hence, good preparation for fi nding the objects quickly is required most for the mor- ning and evening hours of a Messier Marathon. The mid- night hours leave much more time for each object visible then. On average, reckoning a night of 10 hours, there are about 6 minutes, time per object. This can easily be beaten with some practice, es- pecially with observing expe- rience and by smartly combi- ning neighboring objects.

This is certainly due to the large differences from ob- ject to object in location, brightness, and, in particular, size. The dis- parity in size demands the use of different focal lengths to record each object well. By far the largest Messier object at 4 × 1°, M 31 requires a focal length of at most 500mm (for the 36mm × 24mm format) or equivalent (depending on the chip size). On the other hand, the plane- tary nebula M 76 has a size of only 1', and the stellar pair of M 40 is separated by only 49\". Resolving these objects requires a focal length of at least 1000mm, and a detailed image may even need 5000mm. The optimal exposure times differ from each other as much as the required focal lengths. Star clusters with bright stars and nebulae with high surface brightness may be recorded in just a few seconds. This includes M 44, M 45, the central region of M 42, and a few small ga- laxies of high surface brightness, such as M 94. By contrast, objects with low surface brightness, especially if their total brightness is low as well (e.g., M 74 and M 76), need the longest exposures – at least several minutes. Man-made light pollution hampers astrophotographers as much as visual observers. A brighter background forces a reduction of exposure time and the faintest objects are lost. Photographic images capture nebulous detail and stellar colors more easily than visual observations. Most objects, however, do not show a large variety of hues, with just a few colorful exceptions. A nice set of photos of all 110 objects makes an impressive album or poster. However, there are only a few examples. In the 1970s, the US amateur Evered Kreimer published his photos in a book (“Messier Album”), together with the visual observations of John Mallas. At about the same time, Hans Vehrenberg collected a series of very deep exposures in his volume “Deep Sky Splendours” – both books were an important inspiration to many amateurs. In recent years, members of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) have created an impressive collection of professional photos, available on the Internet. The NOAO photos include images from very different instruments and photographers. By contrast, the German amateur Thomas Jäger presen- ted a nice Messier poster in the magazine “interstellarum” – he took all the photos himself with a home-made CCD camera and a small te- lescope. A complete set of Messier object drawings is even rarer than a pho- tographic collection. The only example known to us is the book “The Messier Objects” by Stephen James O’Meara, for which he sketched all of the objects using a 4-inch refractor – with the exception of M 102, which he does not accept as a separate Messier object.

The unusual object appeared with a magnitude between –4 and –7.5 and was visible to the naked eye, even in the daytime sky. Apparently, maximum bright- ness coincided with the solar conjunction. Chinese astronomers ob- served the star in daylight until the 27 th of July 1054, and they were able to see it in the night sky until the 17 th of April 1056, before it faded from naked-eye visibility. In Europe, sightings of the supernova were probably censored, since the catholic church saw this celestial event as a bad omen in connection with the split from the orthodox church in the same year. In 1731, the English physician and self-taught astronomer John Bevis, without any knowledge of the related historic observations, discovered a nebula at the position of the supernova. Independently, Charles Messier found the nebula on the 28 th of August 1758, whi- le following a comet for the fi rst time. In fact, at fi rst he took M 1 for the comet. Messier wrote: “Nebula, contains no star; it is a whi- tish light, elongated in the shape of a candle’s light.” Only later did Messier learn of Bevis’ observation and recognized the Englishman’s priority on the discovery. William Herschel described the object as “very bright, of irregular fi gure, full 5' in longest direction,” and he speculated that “it consists of stars.” His son John described M 1 as a “fi ne object, very large, ex- tended, very gradually brightening a little toward the middle, mottled, 4' long, 3' broad.” Admiral Smith spoke of a “pearly-white nebula” and added: “It is of oval form, with a major axis from northwest to southeast, and the brightest portion toward the south.” In 1844, Lord Rosse devoted an extended study to the “Crab Ne- bula,” so called after an earlier observing report by him. Because of its fi ne-structure, he mistook it for a star cluster: “We see resolvable fi laments singularly disposed, springing principally from its southern extremity, and not, as is usual in clusters, irregularly in all directions. Probably greater power would bring out other fi laments, and it would then assume the ordinary form of a cluster. It is studded with stars, mixed however with a nebulosity probably consisting of stars too minute to be recognized.” A few years later, William Lassall, too, mentioned the fi laments, after his observations from Malta: “Long fi laments run out from all sides, there appears to be a number of very minute and faint stars scattered over it. The brightest parts are 2' long, while its extensions reach 6'.” On the eve of the 19 th century, Leo Brenner wrote about the po- pular name of the nebula: “So called, because Rosse pictured it in his fantastic drawing like a crab, with which it shows no resemblance, however. It rather likens a sponge. A broad, deep bulge, not contai- ning any nebular masses, is located on its north-eastern side; a smal- ler bay is partially fi lled with nebulosity.” A fi rst photo of M 1 was obtained in 1892, and Slipher’s spectro- scopic work of 1913–1915 showed split spectral lines in the vicinity of the outer fi laments. Later, this was explained by means of the Doppler effect in combination with a fast expansion of the nebula. Not without some doubt, Curtis characterized the Crab Nebula in 1918 as a planetary nebula – a contemporary assumption, but a mistake, which reappeared in some catalogs until the 1960s. On this occasion, however, the central star got mentioned for the fi rst time: “Two stars of mag 16 are close together near the center but it is not certain that either of them is a central star. This very complex and interesting object is nearly 6'×4' in P.A. about 125°. It is not a typi- cal planetary in form and it is doubtful whether it is properly to be included as a member of the class.” Lampland, in 1921, found displacements of fi lamentary detail when comparing photos of different age. The same year, Duncan found an expansion rate of 0.2'' per year from such a comparison, and dated the possible creation of the nebula to 900 years back. Lundmark, also in 1921, then suggested the historic supernova of 1054 as the cause of the nebula, which nowadays is a commonly ac- 71 messier2.indb 71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"cepted fact. In 1968, the central pulsar was discovered by the radio telescope in Arecibo. Astrophysics The Crab Nebula is the only su- pernova remnant in the Messier catalog. Because of its proximity, its young age, and the interesting astrophysics related to it, M 1 is regarded as the most-studied deep- sky object in the Galaxy. M 1 measures about 10 light-years in diameter. The nebula con- sists of about fi ve solar masses, and its absolute magnitude is –3, corresponding to about a thousand solar luminosities. In visual light, two components of nebular emission can be distinguished by spec- troscopy. One shines in the green and red light of the [OIII] and H D emission lines of the fi laments. It represents the former outer layers of the progenitor star, which have been expelled at high speed in the supernova event of 1054 and are now colliding with the sur- rounding interstellar medium. The gas is heated in shock fronts and forms today’s fi lamentary emission nebula. The other, blue compo- nent shows a continuous spectrum and is highly polarized. Here we have synchrotron radiation, found on Earth only when generated by large particle accelerators. It is caused by accelerated electrons in a strong magnetic fi eld. Hence, M 1 can be regarded as the best extraterrestrial laboratory for the observation of this type of emis- sion, which is detectable from the radio to the X-ray range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This was fi rst recognized by Shklovsky in 1953. M 1. The only supernova remnant in the Messier catalog is also the youngest Messier object, with an age of only 950 years.

CM Tau"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"73 M 1 can be studied throughout the electromagnetic spectrum: in 1948, strong radio emission was found, and X-rays were detected in 1964. Hence, the Crab Nebula has additional designations as the Tau- rus A or 3C 144 radio source and as Tau X-1. Its radiated X-ray fl ux exceeds its optical fl ux by more than a hundredfold, and the total energy output has been quoted as 5×10 11 joules per second. The collapsed core of the star that caused the supernova is still present in the center of the nebula. In its intense magnetic fi eld, charged particles get accelerated near the fi eld poles and emit col- limated radiation along the magnetic fi eld axis, which is tilted with respect to the rotation axis of the rapidly spinning neutron star. As Earth happens to be in the right direction to be hit by one of these sweeping radiation beams, a sharp pulse is observed every revolution, and hence this type of neutron star is called a “pulsar.” The M 1 pulsar measures only 10 km in diameter but has an ab- solute magnitude of +4.5, slightly brighter than the Sun. A cubic centimeter of its matter would weigh a thousand million tons – so much has it been compressed in the gravitational collapse of the su- pernova! The pulsar in M 1 was the fi rst of its kind for which an optical counterpart was found. This 16 th -magnitude star, registered as CM Tauri, sends pulses of light with the same period as the radio pulses, 33.085 milliseconds. This makes it a valuable object for scientifi c stu- dy, as very few other optical pulsars are yet known. M 1. The red and green, fi lamentary structure is the debris of the supernova progenitor star. Bluish, by contrast, is the haze of synchrotron emitting nebulosity. Philipp Keller."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"74 Modern X-ray observations and high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope show rings of highly energetic particles around the pulsar of M 1, at distances of 0.1 to 1 light-year, and jets emerging perpendicular to the ring plane. Fine structure resolved by Hubble in 1995 includes a knot of emission only 1500 AU from the pulsar, which has been interpreted as a shock in the jet – a region where material piles up as the jet meets the surrounding nebula. Image sequences revealed its outward velocity as half the speed of light! The jets stop at a halo of blue light with 80'' radius, which shows delayed brightness fl uctuations, refl ecting the arrival of bright knots. The supernova’s progenitor star has been estimated to have had 8–13 solar masses. The supernova event released 400 thousand mil- lion solar luminosities, leaving the debris of the star expanding with velocities of up to 2500 km/s, while the blue halo expands with 1160 km/s. This expansion and the energy losses of the pulsar lead to a decrease of the synchrotron radiation by 0.5% per year, as shown by Smith (2003). At the same time, the expansion velocity seems to increase: present expansion rates would suggest an explosion time of 1130, more recent by 76 years. This effect is caused by the hot stellar wind that pumps additional kinetic energy into the expanding nebula. Observation M 1 is relatively faint and by far the most diffi cult object to obser- ve among the 45 entries of the fi rst version of the Messier catalog. 10×50 binoculars show just a little smudge. With a telescope of 2\" aperture, hardly any shape is recognized, but M 1 already appears as noncircular. A 4.7-inch refractor shows an irregular nebula of about 5'×4' size, with an S-shaped main body in a northwest to southeast orientation. The southeastern side is fainter and ends in an extension, which is separated from the nebula in the north by a vague dark zone. Even with large apertures, it is diffi cult to make out detail in M 1. 14 inches show an irregular, longish nebula. The northeastern border is straight, three 12 th -magnitude stars line up along it. The northwe- stern tip is fainter but clearly visible, while the southwestern border is irregular. A dark bay reaches into the southeast and divides it into a brighter southern and a fainter northern branch. These were inter- preted by Rosse as the claws of his “crab.” In the middle of the ne- bula, a darker area can be made out. In it, two 16 th -magnitude stars are visible under best observing conditions. The somewhat fainter, southern star is the pulsar. Four other stars are found elsewhere in the nebula. With an [OIII] fi lter, the visual appearance of M 1 changes signifi - cantly: the shape is rather round, and both the northwestern tip and southeastern bay have disappeared. Instead, a bright, curved fi lament dominates the view. Originating in the west near an 11 th -magnitude star, it stretches all across the nebula to the east. Beginning in the west, other, fainter fi laments become visible, reaching into the rest of the nebula. Since their synchrotron radiation is strongly polarized, interesting changes of shape and structure appear when a variable polarizing fi lter is used in different PAs. The bright double star Σ 742 is found 26' east of M 1. It consists of components of magnitudes 7.2 and 7.8, separated by 3.9\" in PA 14°. M 1.

The French- man described this object as “round, well defi ned and brighter to- wards the center, about 4' to 5' in size, without any star around it to quite some distance in the whole fi eld of the telescope. I fi nd this most singular, because most so-called nebulous objects are surroun- ded by faint stars, too small to be seen in the largest telescopes, which suggest that the nebula is an effect of the light of a mass of stars. At fi rst, I took this nebula for the comet.” Charles Messier made an independent discovery of M 2 exactly 14 years later, to the day, in 1760, when he was out to observe the co- met of 1759. Later, however, he pointed out the priority of Maraldi’s observation. That night, he noted: “Nebula without star, the center of it is brilliant, and the light which surrounds it is round; it resembles the beautiful Nebula [M 22] which is found between the head and the bow of the Archer. 4' diameter.” However, by 1779, William Her- schel recognized M 2 as a “cluster of very compressed, exceedingly small stars.” John Herschel compared M 2 with a “heap of fi ne sand” and noted “with 9 inches aperture I can just see the stars; with 6 inches it is re- solvable. A most superb cluster; round; stars 12, 13, 14 th magnitude; they are evidently globularly arranged, and not internally condensed towards the center more than the spherical form would make them appear to be; but in the middle they blend into a blaze of light.” Smyth refl ected the visual appearance in the eyepiece with his characteristic enthusiasm: “This magnifi cent ball of stars condenses to the center, and presents so fi ne a spherical form, that imagination cannot but picture the inconceivable brilliance of their visible hea- vens, to its animated myriads.” Lord Rosse stated, less emotionally: “streams of stars branch out, taking the direction of tangents.” In 1918, a fi rst photographic dia- meter of only 7' was found by Curtis. Astrophysics Its distance of 40,850 light-years places M 2 beyond the galac- tic center. It consists of about 1,500,000 stars with a total mass of 900,000 Suns, and it has a true diameter of 190 light-years. The class II rating, indicative of the degree of concentration, shows M 2 as the most concentrated of all Messier globular clusters. It has been assi- gned a small degree of ellipticity (0.11 in PA 135°). The brightest stars of M 2 reach magnitude 13.1, while Sawyer- Hogg found that the 25 brightest stars have an average brightness of 14.6p. The horizontal branch stars start at magnitude 16.1. M 2 contains 30 known variable stars, the fi rst of which was dis- covered in 1895 by Bailey. These comprise types RR Lyrae and W Virginis, typical variables for globular clusters, plus an RV Tauri star near the eastern cluster border. It was discovered by the French ama- teur Chevremont in 1897, and it changes brightness from magnitude 12.5 to 14.0 and back in 67 days. M 2 has a relatively bluish central region, taking on slightly warmer hues further out, while the outskirts appear bluish, again. M 2, historical drawing.

Chevremont’s variable lies about 2' east of the cluster’s center. With its changing brightness, the face of M 2 also changes. A 14-inch telescope vaguely suggests dark spots near the eas- tern border of the core region, while the cluster itself appears a little elongated in the north-south direction. This impression is fostered by yet another vaguely darker region between the 10 th -magnitude fore- ground star and the cluster’s center. The phantom object NGC 7088, better known as “Baxendell’s Un- photographable Nebula,” was supposed to lie 25' north of M 2. A cen- tury ago, a British amateur believed that he'd found in this position an extended, round nebula with a distinct southern edge only 7' north of M 2, which no contemporary photograph would show. Despite later claims of visual sightings, it is an established fact today that Baxen- dell must have been deceived by a refl ection in his eyepiece.

He saw a “Nebula; it does not contain any star, its center is brilliant & its light fades insensibly, it is round, 3' diameter.” This was Messier’s fi rst true discovery, and it certainly boo- sted his motivation to create a list of nebulous objects, as the next entries followed swiftly. William Herschel recognized the true nature of M 3 when he saw a “beautiful cluster of stars about 5' or 6' diameter.” John Herschel remarked: “A most superb object. Not less than 1000 stars 11 th ma- gnitude and under. They run into a blaze at the center, and form as it were radiating lines and pointed projections from the mass, with many stragglers.” Admiral Smyth commented: “It blazes splendidly towards the center, and has outliers in all directions, except the south following, where it is so compressed that, with its stragglers, it has something of the fi gure of the luminous oceanic creature called Medusa pellucens.” This comparison with a jellyfi sh refl ects more the enthusiasm of the Englishman than an accurate observation. Lord Rosse reported: “Rays running out on every side from a central mass in which there are several small, dark holes.” Today we know that those dark structures, as observed in globular clusters in the early days, do not represent any real dark clouds of interstellar dust. An even better example is M 13. Curtis estimated the photographic size of “the main portion of this very beautiful cluster” as “about 8' diameter.” Astrophysics M 3 is a rich globular cluster with over half a million stars and an estimated total mass of 800,000 Suns. The present distance of M 3 is 34,170 light-years. But its galactic orbit is highly elliptic (0.4) and its distance from the galactic center varies between 15,000 and 50,000 light-years during its orbital pe- riod of 300 million years. Still, M 3 always stays within the inner galactic halo. The brightest stars of M 3 reach magnitude 12.7. The average ma- gnitude of the 25 brightest stars is 14.2p, according to Sawyer-Hogg. The horizontal branch stars start at magnitude 15.7. In 1889, Pickering discovered the fi rst variable star in M 3. Cur- rently, at least 274 variables are known, including 222 RR Lyrae stars. Because of the large number of these variables, typical for globular clusters, M 3 has been the object of a number of studies aiming at a further classifi cation of RR Lyrae stars. Those of the most common subclass, the type RRab, show a steep increase and a slow decline, pulsating in their principal mode. By contrast, the RRc stars exhibit a faster, more sinusoidal light curve, oscillating in their fi rst over- tone. RRd variables show a combination of these two types of pul- sation, and RRe stars oscillate in their second overtone. Some stars were even found to switch between two oscillation modes within just a few weeks. A number of apparently young blue stars are found in this cluster, which should not exist in a globular cluster many thousand million years old. Such stars are called “blue stragglers” and must have been created in more recent mergers of old low mass stars in tight binary systems. However, in 2001 Meusinger and colleagues found out that some of the acclaimed blue stragglers of M 3 are, in fact, background quasars! Indeed, the fi eld around this globular cluster is very rich in quasars: 175 of these objects have been detected within the 10 square- degrees around M 3, down to magnitude 19.7b. Observation M 3 can be seen as a nearly star-like object with small 15mm glasses. O’Meara and Skiff even claim naked-eye visibility, but a 5 th -magni- tude star 30' southwest of the cluster can only be distinguished from M 3 with much diffi culty. Resolving individual stars is more diffi cult with M 3 than with M 5 or M 13. It requires an aperture of at least 4 inches, but resolution then sets in all over the cluster. Some observers report their impres- sion of an asymmetrically west-shifted cluster center. The total visual cluster diameter of M 3 grows from 7' with 4-inch telescopes to over 15' with 14 inches of aperture, which places it between the sizes of M 5 and M 13. The bright and dense central region of M 3 measures about 4' and is between the cores of M 13 and M 92 in brightness.

In 1752, from Cape Town, he saw a “Nebula without stars, resembles the small core of a faint comet.” Messier observed M 4 on the 8 th of May 1764 and noted: “Cluster of very small stars; with a weak refractor it is seen in the form of a nebula; 2.5' diameter.” In fact, M 4 is the only globular cluster that Messier was able to resolve into individual stars. In 1783, William Herschel also resolved M 13 and noted “a rich cluster of considerably compressed small stars surrounded by many straggling ones. It contains a ridge of stars running through the middle from south preceding to north following. The ridge contains 8 or 10 pretty bright stars.” Admiral Smyth found M 4 elongated in a north-south direction, as Herschel did, with respect to the distribu- tion of the brightest stars. Astrophysics With a distance of 5600 light-ye- ars (Richter et al. 2004), M 4 is the closest of all globular clusters. NGC 6397 in the southern sky takes a clear second place at 7500 light-years. M 4 is even closer than some open clusters, for example M 103. Physically, it is a relatively small globular cluster. M 4 suffers signifi cantly from interstellar absorption, because it is only 2000 light-years above the galactic plane. Its stellar content has been estimated as at least 100,000 stars, of which more than 10,000 are brighter than 19 th magnitude. The mean magnitude of the 25 brightest stars is 13.1p, but the brightest star reaches as much as magnitude 10.8. In its concentration class IX, M 4 is considered one of the loosest globular clusters in the Messier catalog. The age of M 4 has been stated as 12.7 thousand million years, with a safe lower limit of 9 to 10 thousand million years; a typical age for globular clusters. Since M 4 is situated in front of the nort- hern part of the galactic bulge, it has been used as a calibration tool to measure the distance to the galactic center; recent sources put it at 25,900 light-years. At least 65 variable stars are known in M 4, among them is the millisecond-pulsar (PSR B1620-26), discovered in 1987 at a visual magnitude 21.3. This rare object with about 1.4 solar masses is part of a triple system with a white dwarf and a planet-like object of 0.01 solar masses. The latter could have been “stolen” from a different system. It has an orbital period of about 100 years and, presently, a separation from the pulsar of 35 AU. The period of the pulsar is 11ms, three times faster than that of the pulsar in M 1. In 1997, the Hubble Space Telescope photographed 258 white dwarfs in M 4. Altogether, there should be about 40,000 of them. In 2001, deep HST-exposures of M 4, the “Globular Deep Field” led to recorded member stars down to magnitude 30. Observation Only 1.5º west of brilliant Antares, M 4 is hard to see with the unaided eye. But 10×50 binoculars provide pretty views of a round nebula.

This observation was not published at the time and had to be rediscovered in the notebook of Kirch’s wife. For this reason, Charles Messier is rightfully considered an indepen- dent discoverer of M 5. On the 23 rd of May 1764, he wrote: “Beau- tiful Nebula; it does not contain any star; is round, & one can see it very well, in a good sky, with a simple refractor of one foot [focal length], 3' diameter.” In 1791, William Herschel reported that M 5 is actually a star clus- ter and counted about 200 stars “but the middle of it is so compressed that it is impossible to distinguish the stars.” His son John referred to M 5 as a “most magnifi cent, excessively compressed cluster of a globular character. Stars 11 th to 15 th magnitude; the more condensed part projected on a loose irregular ground of stars. The condensation is progressive up to the center, where the stars run into a blaze, or like a snowball; the scattered stars occupy nearly the whole fi eld.” In the words of Smyth, a few years later, we recognize the passi- onate observer: “This superb object is a noble mass, refreshing to the senses after searching for faint objects; with outliers in all directions, and a bright central blaze, which even exceeds M 3 in concentrati- on.” Lord Rosse gave M 5 a “more than 7' or 8' diameter, with a very compact central part of about 1' diameter.” Edward Emerson Barnard wrote: “Much more beautiful than M 13, which is more suitable for smaller apertures. In good seeing, a number of ink-black patches or holes are visible, not in the densest part, but nearby to the southwest and southeast. Under best conditions, they almost look like black, obscuring masses. Apparently near the cluster center is a group of six or seven small bright stars, which in small telescopes give the impression of a core of M 5.“ In 1918, after the inspection of deep exposures of M 5, Curtis wrote: “A beautiful bright globular cluster: the main portion is about 12' diameter.” In 1890, Common found the fi rst variable stars in M 5, and by 1899, Bailey discovered a total of 85 variables. By 1959, this number had risen to 97. Astrophysics At its distance of 26,620 light-ye- ars, M 5 has a physical size of 150 light-years, if we take its angular diameter as 20'. Its shape is slightly elliptical towards PA 50°. An eccentric orbit around the galactic cen- ter with a period of a thousand million years leads M 5 to a maximal distance of 150,000 light-years; presently, however, its distance from the galactic center is 20,000 light-years. M 5 comprises about 800,000 solar masses. Among its many mem- ber stars, the brightest of which reach magnitude 12.2, there are 120 known RR Lyrae stars, variables typical for globular clusters. Another variable in M 5 is a rare dwarf nova with a period of 5.8 hours and brightness fl uctuations between magnitudes 19.8 and 22.5. In additi- on, some variable “blue stragglers” (see M 3) of the SX Phoenicis type and half a dozen eclipsing binaries have been found. Hence, M 5 has at least 143 variable member stars. The age of globular clusters is regarded as a lower limit to the age of the Universe. Earlier determinations were in confl ict with con- temporary cosmological models. New cosmological models, based on evidence for an accelerated expansion of the Universe, now suggest an older cosmos. At the same time, recent distance measurements of globular clusters, using the Hipparcos satellite, suggest larger di- stances, which result in younger cluster ages. For M 5, Chaboyer et al. (1998) found an age of 8.9 thousand million years; Jimenez and Padoan soon after gave 10.6 thousand million years – in any case, M 5 is one of the youngest objects of its kind in the Milky Way.

The fi rst sighting has been attributed to Giovanni Batista Hodierna on or be- fore 1654. The Sicilian observer counted 18 stars. Later, independent discoveries were made by the Swiss observer de Chéseaux in 1745 or 1746, and by Louis de Lacaille from the Cape of Good Hope in 1752. The latter described M 6 as a “singular cluster of small stars, placed in three parallel bands, forming a lozenge of 20' to 25' diameter and fi lled with nebulosity.” He registered it under his number III.12. Messier knew of Lacaille’s observation. He studied M 6, together with M 7, on the 23 rd of May 1764, and wrote: “With the naked eye, this cluster seems to form a nebula; but with the smallest instrument which is employed to examine it, one sees a cluster of small stars; 15' diameter.” A century later, John Herschel commented: “a fi ne, large, discrete cluster of stars of 10 th to 11 th magnitude; one star is 7 th magnitude, one 7 th to 8 th . Fills fi eld.“ Astrophysics The open star cluster M 6 consists almost entirely of blue stars with spectral types A and B. Near the eastern end, we fi nd an orange star of spectral type K3. This is the variable BM Sco with a period of 850 days. It can reach the status of brightest cluster star with its maxi- mum magnitude of 5.8, equivalent to 1900 solar luminosities. At its minimum, however, it is only magnitude 8.0. There are at least a do- zen more variables in M 6. In 1972, Antalová claimed membership for 120 stars, while Schneider confi rmed 64 members brighter than magnitude 11.8 in 1985. These include several Ap stars, which have strong magnetic fi elds tilted with respect to their rotation axes and which show extra strong absorption lines of ionized metals and rare earth elements. M 6 has an age of only 80 to 100 million years and a diameter of only 10 light-years. At its distance of 1590 light-years, almost twice as far away as M 7, it is located only 20 light-years below the galac- tic plane, in the region between the Orion and the Sagittarius spiral arms, not far from M 23 and M 25 in Sagittarius. Observation M 6 is one of the brightest open clusters in the sky. With magnitu- de 4.2, it is not much fainter than its larger neighbor, M 7; and not suffering from a bright background, M 6 can be seen as easily with the naked eye as M 7. 10×50 binoculars show about 20 stars in an elongated layout 25'×20' in size. It was Burnham who likened it to a butterfl y with outspread wings – which led to the popular name for M 6. In a tele- scope, this perception requires a low power of under 40×.

Because of its very southerly position, M 7 remained unnoticed by many European observers. Hodierna counted 30 stars in 1654, and he was probably the fi rst to recognize M 7’s true nature as a star cluster. Lacaille observed it in 1752 from South Africa and wrote: “Group of 15 to 20 stars, very close to each other, in the form of a square.” He registered M 7 as his number 14 in the category of star clusters. Charles Messier made his observation of M 7 on the 23 rd of May 1764, and noted: “Cluster of stars more considerable than the pre- vious [M 6]; this cluster appears to the naked eye like a nebula; 30' diameter.” Of the later observers, John Herschel gave M 7 some at- tention and characterized it as “cluster; very bright; pretty rich; little compressed; stars from 7 th to 12 th magnitude.” Astrophysics With a total magnitude of 3.3, M 7 is one of the very brightest Mes- sier objects; it takes third place closely behind M 44. At just under 1000 light-years distance, this open cluster gains much of its apparent brightness from its proximity. It still belongs to the local spiral arm, located on its inner side with respect to the galactic center. The rich star fi elds in the background, however, are made by the galactic bulge, almost 30,000 light-years away. The main body of M 7 consists of 24 stars with a magnitude bet- ween 5.6 and 9.3, distributed over a diameter of 80'. However, of the about 100 stars brighter than 10 th magnitude in this fi eld, only 50% really belong to the star cluster. The others are fi eld stars in the back- ground or foreground. The brightest star of a total of 750 cluster mem- bers is magnitude 5.6 and spectral type G8. Some of the other brightest member stars, however, have “blue spectral types. Two of them, V957 Sco (magnitude 5.9, B6) and HD162586 (magnitude 6.1, B8) are blue stragglers,” which are better known to occur in globular clusters (see M 3). By contrast, V906 Sco Sgr is an eclipsing binary (magnitude 6.0 to 6.2, period: 2.78 days) with a third, distant component, separated by 0.2\" in PA 286°. On the whole, the binary content of M 7 is above average. With a diameter of 23 light-years, M 7 is an average, if not even smallish star cluster. Since stars of spectral types A to F are among the brightest members still fusing hydrogen in their cores, the cluster’s es- timated age is about 200 million years. Observation With a declination of –35°, M 7 is the southernmost Messier object. Hence, despite its brightness, it effectively cannot be seen from latitu- des much north of 50°. In terms of apparent diameter, total brightness and number of clus- ter stars, M 7 competes with the Praesepe. Nevertheless, M 7 does not come across as impressive as M 44, not even from suffi ciently southern sites. The reason for this is its set-up against a bright Milky Way back- ground in the direction of the galactic center. M 7 rather appears as the bright core of a large, rich region of our galaxy. For most of the USA, as well as for southern and central Europe, it forms the southernmost conclusion of our beautiful summer Milky Way. M 7 is a classic binocular target. 10×50s show 30 stars with a cen- tral, nebulous concentration, in front of an unparalleled, rich starry background. The dark nebula B 287 at the southern edge of M 7 forms an appealing contrast with the cluster, when observed from southern sites such as Namibia. The dark cloud is elongated in the east-west di- rection and has an extension, which reaches southward from its eas- tern end. The impact of the view through binoculars is lost with the use of a telescope. The brightest cluster stars are arranged in the form of a “K.” A bright, yellowish star to the southwest turns out to be a nice pair of stars with magnitudes 6.4 and 7.2. There are a lot of deep sky objects in and around M 7. NGC 6453 at its western edge is a distant globular cluster with a total magnitu- de of only 10.2. Even with large apertures, it remains an unresolved, nebulous ball 2' in diameter. NGC 6444 is an open cluster, 50' west of M 7.

De Chéseaux, in 1746, also observed the cluster. The nebula itself (NGC 6523) was fi rst noticed by Guillaume le Gentil in 1749. He wrote: “west of a star cluster; this nebula has the exact shape of a slightly elongated, equilateral triangle, tip pointing south-west. I have observed it with a refractor of 18 to 20 foot, and it always appeared to me nebulous and transparent; its base touches a rather beautiful star, seen in the refractor, which is the brightest of all those which form the star cluster I have mentioned.” Three years later, and with a much smaller telescope, Lacaille described M 8 as “three stars, engulfed in a band of nebulosity parallel to the equator.” On the 23 rd of May 1764, Charles Messier pointed his telescope to M 8 and noted: “Cluster of stars which appears in the form of a ne- bula when it is viewed with a simple refractor of three feet; but with an excellent instrument one does not notice but a great number of small stars; near this cluster is a quite brilliant star, surrounded by a very faint light; this cluster appears in an elongated shape, which ex- tends from North-east to South-west, 30' diameter.” Hence, for Mes- sier, the star cluster mainly makes up his object No. 8; the nebula is mentioned only in passing. William Herschel registered the nebula as an object of its own, but skipped the cluster in consideration of the priority of Messier’s published catalog. In 1785 he wrote: “An extensive milky nebulosity divided into two parts; the most north being the strongest. Its extent exceeds 15'; the southern part is followed by a parcel of stars which I suppose to be the 8 th [object] of the Connoissance des Temps.” In 1830, John Herschel described M 8 in some detail: “A collection of nebulous folds and matter surrounding and including a number of dark, oval vacancies and, in one place, coming to so great degree of brightness as to offer the appearance of an elongated nucleus. Super- imposed upon this nebula and extending in one direction beyond its area, is a fi ne and rich cluster of scattered stars which seems to have no connection with it as the nebula does not, as in the region of Ori- on, show any tendency to congregate about the stars.” With this latter opinion, however, this experienced observer was wrong – as distance measurements would demonstrate nearly 100 years later. M 8 acquired its popular name from an 1890 description by Agnes Clerke, who likened its appearance to that of a dark lagoon surroun- ded by bright fog. Curtis noted, after the inspection of deep photo- graphs: “very bright, and of wonderfully intricate structure; covering an area of at least 50'×36'.” Astrophysics M 8 is a magnifi cent example of a young stellar cluster that is part of an active star forming-region. On the facing side of a gigantic molecular cloud (see also M 42), a number of recently born stars are emerging from the surrounding excited nebula. In the background, active star formation continues and more stars emerge from the mo- lecular cloud. The ionization of the nebula is due to several very luminous stars, dominated by the magnitude 6.0 star 9 Sagittarii of spectral type O4. With an absolute magnitude of –10.7, 9 Sagittarii is one of the most powerful stars of all. Recently, though, it was discovered spectrosco- pically to be a double star. It is located 2.5' northeast of the brigh- test region of the nebula. HD 164816 (magnitude 7.1, O9) with about 8000 solar luminosities, 3' north, and HD 164740 (magnitude 7.7, O8), 12' northeast, also contribute to the excitation of the gas. The most apparent bright star of the southeast part of the cluster, HD 165052 (magnitude 6.9, O6), is involved, too, and so is HD 165246 (magni- tude 7.2, O8) in the eastern part of the nebula. However, 7 Sagittarii, 15' west, is only a foreground star. The star cluster NGC 6530 has a distance of about 4310 light- years and a diameter of 9 light-years. It contains numerous young stars down to a magnitude of 17, among them at least 80 of the same typical nebular variables known from the Orion Nebula (see M 42). The brightest stars, of magnitude 6.9 and several around 7.5, together make the star cluster shine at magnitude 5.8 and, in fact, form the brightest cluster in the constellation of Sagittarius. By far the brightest part of the nebula, southwest of 9 Sagittarii, is the Hourglass Nebula right next to a magnitude 9.5 star (Herschel 36, O7). It has been created by the interaction of the hot radiation of that star with the relatively dense gas around it. Photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 show that the hourglass shape has been carved out of thick dust clouds by the energetic radiation"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"89 M 8 consists of the bright star cluster NGC 6530 and the emission nebula NGC 6523.

The temperature difference between the still cold interior of the clouds and their hot, UV-excited surfaces leads to tornado-like shapes. The Hourglass Nebula must be very young; it is supposed to have an age of about 10,000 years. It is located at the far side of the visible nebular complex, near the front of the background molecular cloud. Not far from the Hourglass Nebula, Stecklum et al. (1998) believe they have found a protostellar cloud, similar to the “proplyds” in M 42, which contains a star in the making. Dark globules stand out in several regions of the nebula. Three of them have been listed as dark nebulae in the catalog of Barnard (B 88, 89, 296). Deep exposures of high resolution also show some very small, black dots. These objects are protostellar clouds of just a few tens of thousands AU in diameter, which withstand the ionizing radiation of the surrounding hot stars only by virtue of their high densities. Inside are new stars in their fi nal stages of formation. In deep fi eld photos, the nebula NGC 6523 can be traced to a ma- ximum size of 90'×40'. At a distance of 4310 light-years away, this corresponds to a physical size of 115×50 light-years. This is several times the size of the Orion nebula, which would be dwarfed by M 8, if seen from the same distance. M 8 is part of the larger association of young stars Sagittarius OB1 in the Sagittarius spiral arm of the Gala- xy, which also includes the Messier object M 21, while M 20 is closer to us. The apparently brightest star of this association is μ Sagittarii (magnitude 3.9, B8), about 5° northeast of M 8. Observation M 8 is an impressive sight for the naked eye, as a longish nebulous spot southwest of μ Sagittarii. 10×50 binoculars offer fascinating views: the open cluster NGC 6530 with about a dozen stars of 7 th to 10 th magnitude is seen against a nebulous background, which partly comes from unresolved and partly from true nebulosity. The bright stellar pair of 9 Sagittarii (south) and HD 164816 (north), separated by 3', lies 10' south of the cluster – conspicuously surrounded by ne- bulosity. The bright star 7 Sagittarii and its stellar company, 15' west, adds further glamour to this fi eld. A nebula fi lter shows the whole area in a diffuse glow – certainly the most spectacular nebulous fi eld of the whole summer sky!

The star cluster in the east shows about 30 members. The richness of detail is boosted drama- tically by the use of 14 inches of aperture. The dark canal is decorated with stars and bordered by bright nebulous structures at both sides. Just before exiting via a dark bay in the southwest, it is crossed by a faint bridge of nebulosity, 5' south of 9 Sagittarii. A bright region with structures aligned nor- theast-southwest joins in the east. It splits towards the northeast: one branch forms the bright background of NGC 6530, the other one turns east to a bright star 10' east of the cluster. A 6'×3' size dark nebula (B 89) stands out distinctly, on the northwest side of that star. The nebulous region in the west offers details on the smallest scales – especially around the Hourglass Nebula, which is by far the brightest feature of the whole nebula. The northern and southern extensions of the hourglass lead into an 8'×5' nebulous arc, concave towards the south. It encircles fi ve stars on a dark background. The northern part of the region consists of a 15'-long, nearly straight nebulous bar, ori- entated east-west. Several small dark nebulae are visible at its eastern end, 8' north of the star cluster. A few weaker ones can be perceived right by the cluster’s northern edge and in the fainter nebulosity east of it. Observed with a 20-inch telescope, the hourglass itself is seen in the company of a ragged dark nebula, 20\" west of it. Excellent seeing reveals a small dark dot in the southern half of the hourglass. The apparent visual size of M 8 reaches 46'×32', when measured with 14 inches of aperture and maximum exit pupil (i.e., low power). With the use of an [OIII] fi lter, the nebula spreads from a nebulous patch near 7 Sagittarii to some very faint wisps and bands 20' east of the star cluster. The third dark nebula in this fi eld, B 296, becomes visible as a dark bay in the nebula, 10' south of the star cluster. Two double stars can be found in M 8. Burnham 1126 has compo- nents of magnitude 8.8 and 9.6. Its separation of only 0.6\" (PA 55°) is a challenge for large telescopes. By contrast, h 5010, with a 3.6\" separation (PA 94°) and two stars of magnitudes 9.6 and 10.0, is re- solved by smaller telescopes. In addition, there are a lot of variables in M 8, many with as yet unknown properties. IC 4678 is a small nebula about 35' northeast of NGC 6530, around an 8 th magnitude star. It appears blue in color photos, and slightly elongated in northeast-southwest direction when seen with a 14-inch telescope – a nice example of a refl ection nebula. M 8.

In the 1830s, Admiral Smyth observed M 9 in more detail and noted: “This fi ne object is composed of a myriad of minute stars, clustering into a blaze in the center, and wonderfully aggregated, with numerous outliers seen by glimpses.” Lord Rosse remarked: “The outline not round; on south side is an outlying portion separated from the chief portion by a dark passage.” The German observer Heinrich d’Arrest, by contrast, believed he saw an “almost double-core cluster” and no- ted an elongation in the north-south direction. In 1918, Curtis remarked that M 9 maintained the relatively small diameter of 3' on photographic plates. But modern studies, based on much deeper exposures, have almost quadrupled this number. Astrophysics M 9 has a distance of about 14,000 light-years from the galactic cen- ter, situated on its far side, just beyond the galactic bulge. The di- stance to us is 46,000 light-years, and its diameter of 150 light-years is quite average, as is its total mass of about 300,000 solar masses. Because of its position behind the fi elds of dusty interstellar clouds in Ophiuchus, M 9 suffers from about one magnitude of interstellar ab- sorption, in particular in its northern and western parts. Also, according to Shapley, M 9 did not appear exactly spherical, he rather regarded it as slightly elliptical (0.9). The brightest individual star of M 9 reaches magnitude 13.5, the mean magnitude of the 25 brightest cluster members is 15.5. 16 RR Lyrae stars have been cataloged for M 9, and two other variables, one of which is a type II cepheid. Observation M 9 is seen as a distinct but very small spot with 10×50 binoculars. A small telescope also shows a small nebulous ball of only 3', which has an almost star-like center. Individual cluster stars are not resol- ved, until an aperture of at least 6 inches is used. Worth mentioning is a pair of 10 th magnitude stars just south of M 9. Larger apertures show M 9 as a compact but well-resolved glo- bular cluster. The central region measures about 2', outskirts can be traced to a size of 4'. An asymmetry can be noticed in terms of an elongated (in northeast-southwest direction) region in the northwe- stern part of the cluster, separated from its core by a dark band. Ho- wever, no trace is seen of a general elongation in PA 110°, as reported by Skiff and Luginbuhl. There are two smaller globular clusters in the immediate neighbor- hood of M 9: NGC 6356, 1° northeast, and NGC 6342, 1° southeast. Both objects are visible as small round nebulae even with a 2.5-inch refractor. The beginning of resolution into individual stars, however, requires an aperture of 14 inches. The dark cloud B 64 lies directly west of M 9, its outskirts partially covering the globular cluster. B 64 can be well seen with 10×50 binoculars: it is a 25'×15', peanut-shaped object with a dark “head” northwest."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"94 M 10.

He obser- ved “a nebula without star” and added: “This nebula is beautiful & round; one can see it only with diffi culty in a simple refractor of 3 ft. 4' diameter.” 20 years later, William Herschel’s telescope showed “A very beau- tiful, and extremely compressed, cluster of stars” and no trace of ne- bulosity. Herschel compared M 10 with M 53. His son John wrote in 1831: “A superb cluster of very compressed stars, gradually brighter toward the middle. The stars are of 10 th to 15 th magnitude, and run up to a blaze in the center, but I see no nucleus. Diameter about 6'; a noble object.” Admiral Smyth used a 5.9-inch refractor and saw a “rich globular cluster of compressed stars. This noble phenomenon is of a lucid white tint, somewhat attenuated at the margin, and clustering to a blaze in the center. Easily resolved with medium magnifi cation.” Lord Rosse reported, after his observation with his giant telescope: “A dark lane above the center quite across, or rather the upper one-sixth of cluster is much fainter than the rest.” The description of Curtis, based on his photographs, says: “Fine bright globular cluster, diameter about 8'. Central brighter part about 2'.” Astrophysics With a distance of 24,750 light- years, M 10 is a little farther away than its close neighbor M 12, and its true diameter of 140 light-years is larger than the latter’s. With about 250,000 solar masses, M 10 is a rather average globu- lar cluster. Its stars are metal-poor, which distinguishes them from the surrounding, younger stars of the Milky Way, with which the cluster seems to move on a similar orbit that keeps it within the inner halo. The mean magnitude of the 25 brightest stars is magnitude 14.1. Among these, a hot, blue star of 13 th magnitude stands out, which seems to have just fi nished its evolution as a cool, bright giant and is now starting to expose its hot core. Currently, only four variables are confi rmed in M 10, two of which are type II cepheids. Detailed dynamic models for M 10 predict a “core collapse” within the next 10 thousand million years, which will create an extremely high star density in its very center, as much as some hundred thousand stars per cubic light-year. This has already happenend to a few globular clu- sters (see M 15). After such a collapse, the cluster dynamics must fi nd a new equilibrium, and many models predict an expansion that would include the outer core regions. Observation Contrary to its apparent ‘twin’ M 12, M 10 can be seen by unaided eyes under pristine mountain skies. It is easily visible as a nebulous spot in modest 30mm binoculars. The fi rst individual stars are resolved with a 3-inch refractor. With 4.7 inches of aperture, the globular cluster appears fully resolved, but a nebulous background remains. It is perfectly spherical, has a dense center and an apparent diameter of 10', and it looks more compact than M 12. Larger telescopes show an extended halo 15' in size around a denser central region of 4'. In the outskirts, some cluster stars form chains that have a tangential rather than radial orientation. This may give a subtle visual impression of spiral structure. However, the dark zone south of the center of M 10, as reported by Lord Rosse, remains doubtful. M 12 lies about 3° northwest of M 10.

He described his fi nd as “a ne- bulous star” and likened it to the core of a comet. Subsequent observers referred to this object as “Kirch’s Nebula.” So did Halley in 1715, who saw M 11 as “a small obscure spot, but has a star that shines through it, which makes it the more luminous.” In 1733, William Derham was the fi rst person to resolve M 11 into individual stars, using a refl ector with an eight-foot focal length. A few years later, de Chéseaux independently came to the same result; he noted a diameter of 4.1'. On the 10 th of October 1749, le Gentil pointed his telescope towards M 11 and mainly confi rmed the above observations. In addition, he observed “a remarkable cluster of very small stars, a whitish cloud which apparently is just a star cluster. The northern part contains a real nebula, which, I presume, is that of Mr. Kirch. It is poorly cons- trained on its western side, which creates a certain similarity with the tail of a comet.” Charles Messier targeted this well-observed object on the 30 th of May 1764, and he noted: “Cluster of a great number of small stars, that one can only see with good instruments; with a simple refractor of three feet it resembles a Comet: this cluster is mingled with a faint light; in this cluster there is a star of 8 th magnitude, 4' diameter.” Fi- nally, using a fi ne telescope of 5.5 inches aperture, William Herschel recognized that M 11, in fact, did not contain any nebulosity at all. He wrote: “11 th magnitude stars divided into fi ve or six groups noted inde- pendently.” Furthermore, he was the fi rst to recognize that this cluster can be seen with the naked eye. John Herschel commented around 1830: “A beautiful irregularly round cluster 10' or 12' in diameter. The stars are all of 11 th ma- gnitude except one which is of 9 th magnitude. Examined with high magnifi ers; it is broken into fi ve or six distinct groups with rifts or cracks between them.” The description given by his contemporary Admiral Smyth became somewhat famous, as his expressed enthusi- asm led to the now popular name for this cluster: “This object, which somewhat resembles a fl ight of wild ducks in shape, is a gathering of minute stars, with a prominent 8 th -magnitude in the middle, and two following; but by all analogy these are decidedly between us and the cluster.” D’Arrest’s description better resembles William Herschel’s note. Observing from Copenhagen, the German astronomer saw a “won- derful cluster, which consists of uncountable stars. It does not have a regular shape, and in the telescope it appears as if it was compo- sed of several groups.” And fi nally, in 1918, after studying photo- graphs of this cluster, Curtis correctly commented: “bright, rather open cluster, 6' in diameter. Not globular.” Astrophysics M 11 is consi dered one of the richest and most compact galactic clusters. As seen from its center, the night sky would be fi lled with several hundred stars as bright as 1 st magnitude, which would all have distances of about a light-year or less. The mean density of 2.4 stars per cubic light-year resembles that of a globular cluster of class X. A total of 2900 member stars have been attributed to M 11, of which 870 are brighter than magnitude 16.5, and 500 brighter than With over 2900 member stars, this is one of the richest open clusters in the Messier catalog.

The brightest star by far stands out from the rest of the cluster, as its magnitude 8.0 contrasts with the magnitude of 10 of the next- brightest stars. According to Brian Skiff, it does not belong to the 30 or so red giants in M 11. However it remains unclear whether the blue variable BS Scuti (magnitude 11.0–12.4), 15' to the east, is actually a physical cluster member. The age of M 11 is, according to Sung et al., about 250 million years. The distance, quoted as 6120 light-years, places M 11 in the Sa- gittarius spiral arm of the Milky Way, much like M 16 and M 17 further south. The physical diameter of the visible cluster, seen as 13' in the sky, is 23 light-years. Including the extensions observed by Sung et al. spanning 32', M 11 reaches a total size of 60 light- years. Observation M 11 is quit e hard to spot with the naked eye. This is due to its position in the Milky Way, on the northern edge of the prominent Scutum star cloud, which creates a bright background. Binoculars show a nebulous patch with one star, just like Halley’s description from 300 years ago. This view changes dramatically when a 2-inch refractor is used. From a magnifi cation of 90× upward, it begins to resolve the nebula into nu- merous stars. 2.5 inches of aperture show about 100 of them, plus a pro- minent pair of 9 th -magnitude stars outside (southeast) of the cluster. A 4.7-inch refractor reveals about 400 cluster stars, vividly packed into a diameter of only 7'. The general cluster shape is a little triangu- lar, pointed towards the northwest. Much more imagination is required to see Smyth’s V-shaped formation of fl ying ducks. The outstandingly bright star appears of orange color to some observers, but it actually has spectral type A. Larger apertures show more and more stars, as well as the less star- rich extensions of M 11. This brings the total visual cluster diameter to about 15', but the triangular impression gets more and more lost. The variable star R Scuti lies 1° northwest of M 11. Its brightness changes semi-regularly with a period of 143 days, between magnitu- des 4.8 and 6.0. Nearby is the southwest edge of the large dark cloud B 111, which defi nes the northern border of the Scutum star cloud. It misses the northwestern edge of M 11 by only a few arcminutes. B 111, as well as B 112 located south of M 11, are both nice objects for large binoculars. More diffi cult to observe is the elongated dark cloud B 318, south of M 11; a 14-inch telescope gives only a partial view of it. M 11 lies on the northern edge of the Scutum star cloud, one of the richest Milky Way regions.

Comes almost up to a blaze in the middle, has a star of 10 th or 11 th magnitude in the center.” Retired Admiral Smyth saw “several very bright spots near the center” and noticed “a cortège of bright stars, and many minute straggling outliers.” Lord Rosse even thought he could see some spi- ral structure in M 12. The photographic description given by Curtis (1918) says: “Fine globular cluster; central part about 2'; outer about 8' in diameter. Ap- parently somewhat less compact than most globular clusters.” Astrophysics M 12 appears almost as a twin of its close neighbor M 10, only a little smaller and fainter. Its class IX designates the small degree of concentration of this globular cluster. The distance of 20,760 light-years is somewhat nearer than that of M 10. Hence, the true diameter of M 12, about 85 light-years, is even smaller than M 10, smaller than the relative appearance in the sky would suggest. The total mass of M 12 is estimated to be 200,000 times the Sun’s. M 12 is a globular cluster of the inner galactic halo. On its 130-million-year orbit, it never exceeds a distance of 20,000 light- years from the galactic center. Its current location is 2000 light-years above the galactic plane. For comparison: the Sun never deviates from the galactic plane by more than 250 light-years, and is currently placed only 50 light-years above it. The very brightest stars in M 12 reach magnitude 12.0, the mean magnitude of the 25 brightest is 14.0p, and the horizontal branch starts at magnitude 14.9. Only fi ve variables have been cataloged for M 12: two eclipsing binaries, two RR Lyrae stars, and one type II Cepheid. Lehmann and Scholz measured the outermost diameter of M 12 including stars down to 20 th magnitude and arrived at an impressive 30'. Buonanno (1976) suggested, based on structural and other simi- larities between M 12 and M 10, that both globular clusters might have been formed together and may still infl uence each other. Their current separation is about 5000 light-years. Observation M 12 cannot be seen with the naked eye, but even small binoculars show it as a nebulous spot. A 2.5-inch refractor at high magnifi cation gi- ves the round nebula a grainy appearance, and a 4.7-inch telescope resolves individual stars all over the nebulous background of the 5' cluster. A foreground star lies on the cluster’s southeastern edge, ano- ther one only a cluster diameter northwest. Larger apertures give the impression of a relatively open globular cluster with little concentration, and with a central region about 2.5' across. Including chains of stars and other extensions, M 12 reaches a total visual diameter of 10'.

A year later, he wrote up a list of the six nebulae then known to him (M 42, M 31, M 22, Z Cen, M 11, and M 13) and com- mented about the latter: “This is but a little patch, but it shows itself to the naked eye, when the sky is serene and the moon absent.” Charles Messier observed M 13 on the 1 st of June 1764, and noted: “Nebula without star, discovered in the girdle of Hercules; it is round & brilli- ant, the center brighter than the borders; it is near two stars, both of 8 th magnitude, one of them above & the other below; 6' diameter.” It was left to William Herschel to recognize the true nature of this star cluster in 1784: “A most beautiful cluster of stars. It is excee- dingly compressed in the middle and very rich. About 14,000 stars can be counted.” 40 years later, John Herschel commented: “Very rich cluster; irregular fi gure; very large; very gradually much brighter to- ward the middle; stars from 10 th to 15 th magnitude, of which there must be thousands; does not come up to a nucleus; has hairy-looking curvilinear branches.” This impression was shared by Lord Rosse, who pointed his large 72-inch mirror towards M 13: “singularly fringed appendages to the globular fi gure out into the surrounding space.” His drawing shows a Y-shaped dark structure over the whole central region of the cluster. D’Arrest, too, saw “arm-shaped outliers” with a magnifi cation of 95×. 100 years ago, Palmer counted, one-by-one, 5482 stars in M 13. Not much later, this number was radically revised upwards to 100,000 by Shapley, and Otto Struve taxed it to at least half a million. This corresponds to about half the number of cluster members estimated today. Astrophysics With its diameter of 160 light- years, the famous globular cluster M 13 is one of the largest examples of its kind, but at least M 15 and M 53 are, in fact, larger. M 13 probably does not exceed one mil- lion stars with a total of 600,000 solar masses. On its 500-million- year, eccentric orbit around the galactic center, it can get as far out as 80,000 light-years from the galactic center. Presently, M 13 has a distance from Earth of just 26,000 light-years. The diameter of the cluster appears to be only a bit more than 10' when based solely on the distribution of stars brighter than ma- gnitude 15, i.e., those which most amateur telescopes would show. However, studying automated star counts down to 20 th magnitude, Lehmann and Schulz (1997) found a much larger diameter of 47.6' and a tidal tail of stars ripped away from M 13 by the galactic gra- vitational fi eld. The very brightest stars of M 13 reach a respectable magnitude of 11.9, which is, however, not as bright as those in M 22 or M 4. Furthermore, only 40 variables are known so far in M 13 – less than in most other globular clusters. At least nine of these are of the RR Lyrae type. In 1989, a pulsar with a period of only 10 milliseconds was discovered, which is not bound in a binary system. In 1960, Roberts studied the probability of a chance formation of the areas in M 13 with an apparent defi cit of stars. He favored, however, an explanation involving absorption by dark clouds. Their properties, would have to be much different from other, well-known dark clouds, as pointed out by Dickman et al. These authors conclu- ded that there are real local stellar density defi cits in M 13, especially in the numbers of red giants, which dominate the visual impression. Observation As mentioned by Halley, it is possi- ble to spot M13 with the naked eye on a suffi ciently clear, dark and moonless night. The visual limiting magnitude required to see the magnitude-5.7 cluster (other sources give it between 5.3 and 5.9) is 6.0. Binoculars show a nebulous patch, fl anked by two 7 th -magnitude stars to the east and southwest. Resolution of the cluster into indivi- dual stars starts with 2.5 inches of aperture, which makes the outer zones appear grainy. Slightly larger telescopes deliver a fi rm percep- tion of individual stars. A 4.7-inch refractor shows a large, round and very bright nebula with an extended, bright central region. Many individual stars are now resolved. In the outskirts of the globular cluster, they appear grouped into irregular extensions. The visual extent of M 13 reaches 8'.

Messier wrote: “Ne- bula without star; the nebula is not large, its light is faint, it is round. Near it is a small star of the 9 th magnitude; 7' diameter.” By contrast, 19 years later, William Herschel found M 14 “extremely bright, easily resolvable” and wrote: “With 300× I can see the stars. The cluster is considerably behind the scattered stars, as some of them are projected upon it.” For John Herschel, too, M 14 was “a striking object.” In 1833 he noted: “Very large; 8' or 10' diameter; the stars so excessively mi- nute as to be scarcely discernible.” Admiral Smyth described a “lucid white color.” Heinrich d’Arrest saw M 14 as “elegant, comet-like, al- most round, irregularly terminated, resolved with 226×.” Astrophysics While M 14 appears over a ma- gnitude fainter than its neighbors M 10 and M 12, and is on a par with M 9, it is in fact the most lumi- nous of these four globular clusters in Ophiuchus, in absolute terms. M 14 suffers as much as two magnitudes of extinction due to its much greater distance and interstellar absorption by dust in the Milky Way. This puts its brightest stars at magnitude 14 instead of 12, as with M 10 and M 12. With an estimated 1.2 million solar masses, M 14 exceeds its neighbors by a considerable factor. The distance of M 14 is still debated. Until recently, it was given as about 25,000 light-years, much like its two brighter neighbors. But the Recio-Blanco catalog (2005) now puts it at over 55,000 light- years. That distance implies a large physical diameter of 180 light- years. The stars of this cluster are metal-poor. Among the 68 known variables, there are 55 RR Lyrae stars, which are typical for globular clusters, and 5 of them are type II cepheids. In 1938, a nova appeared in M 14. However, it escaped discove- ry until 1964, when a collection of photographic plates covering the period from 1932 to 1963 was studied. The nova appeared on eight plates, between the 21 st and 28 th of June, as a star of 16 th magnitu- de. It is only the second classical nova in a globular cluster caught on photographic plates (see M 80). No unambiguous identifi cation of the present-day star has been achieved, not even with the Hubble Space Telescope. Observation Although shown as a nebulous spot even by small binoculars, M 14 re- mains just an unresolved, but perhaps grainy, 3' nebula when obser- ved through a small telescope. From 8 inches of aperture upwards, and beginning with the outer zones, resolution of individual stars is achieved. M 14 appears slightly elongated in the east-west direction. The number of individually vi- sible cluster stars stays fairly low even in large telescopes. Irregular chains of stars reach northeast and southwest, while the central region appears grainy or mottled, but unresolved.

He described the object as “a quite bright, nebulous star, which is composed of many stars.” Although Maraldi had already re- solved individual stars, Messier’s observing report of the 3 rd of June 1764 reads: “Nebula without star; it is round, the center of it is brilli- ant, 3' diameter.” It appears that Messier’s telescope was considerably inferior to the one Maraldi was using 20 years before. In 1783, William Herschel also resolved individual stars in M 15, which he considered a good test object. His son John commented: “A magnifi cent globular cluster; comes up to a perfect blaze in the cen- ter, like a protuberance or nipple; not the condensation of a homo- geneous globe; it has straggling streams of stars, as it were, drawing to a center. It is not round.” D’Arrest, too, saw an asymmetry and wrote: “Most magnifi cent cluster, very bright, with beautiful arm-like extensions apparent. The nucleus is eccentric, being displaced to the east.” Buffham reported a dark patch near the center and two dark, weak lanes. In 1918, Curtis summarized the photographic appearance of M 15 with the words: “A bright and unusually beautiful globular cluster, 8' diameter.” Astrophysics M 15 is a large globular cluster in the intermediate galactic halo. Its orbit, which is inclined to the galactic plane by 40°, takes 250 million years to complete. Presently, M 15 is 39,000 light-years away from us, from which a physical diameter of 200 light-years can be deduced. M 15 has at least 450,000 solar masses. Its brightest red giants reach magnitude 12.6, corresponding to 1000 solar luminosities. This globular is populated by a large number of variable stars. Among the at least 180 registered cases, there is one type II cepheid, and eight pulsars – remnants of past supernovae. Presumably, PSR 2127+11C is part of a neutron star binary and it shows effects of relativistic kinematics in a strong gravitational fi eld: perihelion motion, defl ec- tion of light, and energy losses by gravitational radiation. The sup- posed optical counterpart is a blue variable of about 15 th magnitu- de. At its position, White and Angelini (2001) discovered two bright X-ray sources with only 2.7\" separation, which are interpreted as a massive binary. In very high resolution images, M 15 shows an extraordinarily dense center with more than 30 stars per square arcsecond! This in- dicates that the core region of the globular has already suffered a dy- namical collapse (a “core-collapse”). In this rapid process, ever closer stellar encounters gather more and more stars in the very center, and the mutual distances are reduced to solar system size, i.e. they can be as small as the distance between the Sun and Pluto! Some authors have even been suggesting a black hole of up to 1000 solar masses in the center of M 15. But Hubble Space Telescope images support the core-collapse scenario instead, according to which the rest of the globular cluster is now in an expanding phase (see M 10). However, theoretical studies and the observed stellar kinematics can not enti- rely rule out the black hole hypothesis. M 15 has become famous for its planetary nebula, which was ca- taloged by Küstner in 1921 as a magnitude 13.8 star. Undertaking spectroscopic observations at the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1928, Pease fi nally recognized the true nature of this object, which is the M 15.

But recent Hubble Space Telescope pictures yield a larger size. The very hot and young central star of magnitude 15.0 has a temperature of 40,000 K and about 0.6 solar masses. Pease 1 is only about 4200 years old and reaches a physical diameter of 0.6 light-years. In total, the HST-image from 1994 covers 28 light-years at the distance of M 15.

M15 and its equally bright stellar neighbor now show nicely contrasting extended and point sources of light, respectively. Resolution of individual cluster stars near the edge of M 15 begins with a 2.5-inch refractor, and full resolution of the globular cluster is achieved with 4.7 inches of aperture, since the brightest stars reach magnitude 12.6. The visual extent of the cluster appears to be 6'. M 15 remains nebulous in the bright compact center that makes it one of the most attractive globular clusters for visual observation. A 14-inch telescope doubles the visual extent to 12'. The nebulous, irregular central region has a size of 1'. Any perception of its asym- metry, as reported by historic observers, remains ambiguous. Pease 1 is found near the edge of the core region, 1.5' north of the center. At 14 th magnitude, it appears quite bright in a 14-inch telescope, but high magnifi cation, good seeing, and knowledge of its exact location are required to spot the planetary nebula among the densely packed stars of similar brightness around it.

Charles Messier independently discovered this object on the 3 rd of June 1764, since he had no concrete knowledge of Chéseaux’s observation. Messier saw a “Cluster of small stars, mingled with a faint glow. In a weak telescope this cluster appears in a nebular form. 8' diameter.” However, what he saw was not the nebula around the cluster, but the diffuse light of unresolved cluster stars. Later visual observers did not notice the nebula either, despite considerably lar- ger telescopes. Its discovery was left to Barnard (1895) and Roberts (1897), who independently found it on their photographs. The nebula received the separate identifi cation IC 4703. John Herschel, in the mid-ninetheenth century, saw “at least 100 large and small stars” in M 16. Admiral Smyth described this object as “a scattered but fi ne large stellar cluster. As the stars are dispo- sed in numerous pairs among the evanescent points of more minute components, it forms a very pretty object in a telescope of tolerable capacity.” Astrophysics M 16 is one of the most luminous and youngest open clusters in the Messier catalog. 376 member stars are tightly packed into a 15' patch. The brightest of these has magnitude 8.2, and an additional 13 stars are brighter than 10 th magnitude. M 16 has more hot stars of spectral type O than any other Messier cluster. The oldest M 16 stars are only 6 million years of age, most are as young as 1 to 2 million years old. In fact, M 16 would be a lot more impressive if it did not suffer from a signifi cant interstellar absorption of 3.1 magnitudes, caused by the dark dust clouds of the “Great Rift,” which obstruct it, only a few hundred light-years from us. This absorption hampers large parts of the Serpens OB1 association of young stars further north, to which M 16 belongs. Duchene et al. (2001) studied the 60 brightest O stars of M 16 and found that 18% of them belong to close binary systems. Furthermo- re, they found over 50 stars in a circular region around the cluster which are variable, most of them weak T Tauri stars of 17 th magni- tude or fainter. Star formation continues in dark “elephant trunks” in M 16. These have been formed by the interaction of the massive, UV-bright stars and their nebulous environment, carved out by “photo-evaporation.” A 1995 Hubble Space Telescope photo of three of these “pillars of creation” in the very core of the Eagle nebula may have become one of the most popular astronomical photos of all, due to their majestic appearance.

The surrounding nebula IC 4703 can photographically be detected to a size of up to 35'×28', which corresponds to a physical size of 60×45 light-years. Observation The star clus- ter of M 16 is quite recognizable to the naked eye, since it is near the edge of the dark, central band of the Milky Way. Binoculars resolve the brightest stars, about a dozen or so on an unresolved milky background of fainter cluster members. A nebula fi lter, held between the eyepiece and the eye, even reveals some of the emission nebula as a glow in the outskirts of M 16. A 3-inch telescope shows about 25 stars, which include a bright pair of magnitude 8.2 and 8.8 components separated by 27\" (PA 350°) near the western edge of the 5' star cluster. The emission nebula becomes quite distinct, when a narrow-band fi lter is used. Its outskirts are poorly defi ned, but they may reach a visual size of 15'×7'. The brightest nebulosity is inside the star cluster and south of it. Despite its fairly low surface brightness, the nebula becomes the most interesting part when observing with a 14-inch telescope. The eagle shape is now distinctly visible, with the head (7'×4') facing northwest and the body (35'×10') oriented northeast-southwest. A triangular dark nebula of 5'×4' above the northeastern shoulder em- phasizes this fi gure, while the outer wings of the eagle remain faint even with the use of a nebula fi lter.

He described his discovery: “It has perfectly the shape of a ray, or of a comet tail, of 7' length and 2' width, its sides are exactly parallel and quite well defi ned, much like its ends. The middle is whiter than the edges.” Charles Messier did not know of de Chéseaux’s note, because it was not published in print. Hence, his fi rst observation of M 17 on the 3 rd of June 1764 was an independent discovery. He noted: “Train of light wi- thout stars, of 5’ to 6’ in size, in the shape of a spindle, & a little bit like that one in the girdle of Andromeda [M 31], but of a very faint light; there are two telescopic stars near & placed parallel to the Equator.” William Herschel saw much more, when he enthusiastically wrote in 1783: “A wonderful nebula. Very much extended, with a hook on the preceding side; the nebulosity of the milky kind; several stars visible in it, but they seem to have no connection with the nebula, which is far more distant. I saw it only through short intervals of fl ying clouds and haziness; but the extent of the light including the hook is above 10'.” To Herschel, too, there was some resemblance to M 31. It took 100 years for it to become clear that M 17 is, in fact, an object within our Galaxy. John Herschel studied M 17 in more detail. Two of his descriptions have been documented; in the fi rst, he makes a remarkably accurate connection with M 42 and comments: “A most curious object, not un- like the nebula in Orion. There is in it a resolvable portion or knot di- stinctly separated from and insulated in the rest as if it had absorbed the nebula near it.” His second description is the source of today’s popular name, the Omega Nebula: “A large extended nebula. Its form is that of a Greek Omega with the left base-line turned upwards. The curved part is very faint, and has many stars in it. The preceding base-line hardly visible. The following, which is the principal branch, occupies nearly half the fi eld. Its light is not equable, but blotty.” Smyth noted: “A magnifi cent, arched, and irresolvable luminosity occupies more than one third of the area, in a splendid group of stars.” Chambers likened the shape to a “swan fl oating on the water,” which led to the other popular name for M 17, the Swan Nebula. Curtis' note of 1918 says: “The ‘Horse Shoe’ or ‘Omega Nebula.’ Very bright, very large nebulosity, showing a wealth of detail, fi lling an area about 26'×20'.” Astrophysics M 17, the Omega nebula, is – much like M 42 – an active star-forming region. In a small 5'×5' area west of the swan’s neck, a young cluster hardly one million years old with more than 8000 to 10,000 member stars lies mostly hidden inside the nebula. The core alone (2'×2') con- tains 750 stars. These very young objects have between 5 and 20 solar masses each, and nine very luminous cluster members of spectral type O must weigh about 60 solar masses. However their light has been extinguished by 30 magnitudes of absorption by the dust within the nebula, in addition to 1.8 magnitudes of interstellar extinction. Only fi ve of these stars are visible at all. They are brighter than magnitude 14.2, two of them even brighter than 10 th magnitude in visible light. The rest of this cluster can only be studied in infrared light, where the absorption by dust is less severe. The large molecular cloud around and to the southwest of M 17 contains suffi cient interstellar matter for another 10,000 stars of solar mass. M 17 is, according to Harper et al., one of the most luminous HII regions of all, with 560,000 solar luminosities. The nebula remains in part obscured, where dense, cold dust clouds prevail, but it is ionized and excited by the emerging young stars in other parts, which radiate strongly in H α and other emission lines. The Hubble Space Telescope took images of part of the central region of M 17 in high resolution. A small inky black cloud stands out, only ten times the size of our Solar System. Here, star formation is ongoing. With a distance of 5900 light-years, M 17 is located in the Sagit- tarius spiral arm of the Milky Way, much like its neighbor M 16. The pair may be separated in space by only about 300 light-years, if we can trust the distances to that precision. The bright and longish main body of M 17 measures 20 light-years, and counting the fainter extensions of up to 40' by 30', M 17 has a physical size of 70×50 light-years. Observation M 17 resembles a swan much more than the uppercase Greek letter ome- ga ( Ω ). Nevertheless, the ‘Omega Nebula’ has prevailed as the popular nickname. Estimates of the total visual brightness range widely from magnitude 7.0 to 5.0. Considering the naked-eye visibility of M 17, the brighter end seems to be nearer to the truth. 10×50 binoculars show a nebulous band, which reminds us of the historic description by Messier. In a 2-inch telescope, this main part reaches a visual size of 6'×2'. Furthermore, a bunch of 8 th - to 10 th -ma- gnitude stars north of the western end is noticed.

John Herschel wrote around 1840: “A poor and coarse cluster. Contains about a dozen stars 10 th magnitude and 15 or 20 more 12 th to 15 th magnitude.” Astrophysics At a distance of 4200 light-years, the little open star cluster M 18 is located on the near side of the Sagittarius spiral arm. Hence, it is closer to us than its neighbors in the sky, M 17 (5900 light-years) and M 16 (5600 light-years), which are on the far side of the same spiral arm, or NGC 6603 in M 24, much more distant at 10,000 light- years, which lies even further towards the galactic core in the Norma spiral arm. M 18 is dimmed by about 1.4 magnitudes of interstellar absorption. Only about 40 stars are attributed to M 18. The brightest of them is a blue B2 star with magnitude 8.6. As the next brightest stars are also blue and hot, a relatively young cluster age of 50 million years has been deduced. Observation In binoculars, M 18 appears as a small, nebulous knot of stars. A 2.5-inch refractor shows about a dozen stars within a radius of 8'. The brightest cluster members are arranged in a triangular shape, that gives some observers the impression of a letter “S.” Larger telescopes show many fainter stars belonging to both the cluster and to the rich Milky Way background. Consequently, the out- line of M 18 becomes ill defi ned. Also, it appears poorly concentrated and loses its charm with higher magnifi cation.

His son John Herschel described M 19 with the words: “A fi ne globular cluster, stars very small, of 12 th to 18 th magnitude, with one of 10 th magnitude, and one of 10 th to 11 th magnitude; nearly round; very gradually pretty much brighter toward the middle, but does not come up to a blaze. Insulated; 3' diameter.” Admiral Smyth saw M 19 as having a “creamy white tinge” and de- scribed it as “slightly lustrous in the center.” Astrophysics M 19 can be considered the second most luminous globular cluster of the Galaxy – second only to Omega Centauri, if M 54 is discounted for being a member of the SagDEG dwarf galaxy. M 19 has a distance of 45,000 light-years, which is well beyond the galactic center. It is the most elliptical globular cluster in the sky: Shapley rated it as E3–E4 in a PA of 15°. The rich and compact visual impression of the cluster refl ects its large mass of 1.5 million solar masses. Despite being close to the ga- lactic bulge, where enrichment with heavy elements fi rst started in the Galaxy, M 19 is a metal-poor globular cluster. Only eight variables have been confi rmed so far, which comprise three RR Lyrae stars, and four type II cepheids. The best-known variable is FK Ophiuchi, which was discovered in 1928 just 1.8' north of the cluster’s center, and which varies between magnitude 13.5b and 15.6b. The very brightest stars of M 19 reach magnitude 14.0, and the mean magnitude of the 25 brightest stars, according to Sawyer-Hogg, is magnitude 14.8. Observation 10×50 binoculars show M 19 as a bright, round nebula. In a small te- lescope, it measures 2.5'×3' with a noticeable north-south elongation. For successful resolution into individual stars, apertures of 5 to 6 inches are required. An 11 th -magnitude star in the northeastern part of the cluster stands out. The asymmetrical shape becomes even more pronounced with larger apertures, and the total visual size reaches 7.5'×5'. More globular clusters can be found in close proximity to M 19: NGC 6293 is 2° east, NGC 6284 1.6° north.

The discovery of M 20 has sometimes been attributed to Le Gen- til. This is based on a misidentifi cation in the nineteenth century by Bigourdan, who mistook Le Gentil’s description of M 8 for one of M 20, based on erroneous coordinates. William Herschel was, despite his northerly location in England, the fi rst to unambiguously recognize the nebula. He catalogued M 20 in three different portions and reported: “Three nebulae, faintly joined, form a triangle. In the middle is a double star.” On the 26 th of May 1786, he added a note on the separate northern part. The popular name of M 20, the Trifi d Nebula, goes back to John Herschel, when he noted: “trifi d, three nebulae with a vacuity in the midst, in which is centrally situated the double star.” This central, dark cavity was later registered by Barnard as entry No. 85 in his catalog of dark nebulae. Curtis, in 1918, fi nally determined the total angular size of M 20 from deep exposures as 24' by 20'. M 20.

The idea of tripartition, however, refers to the visual impression of the central part only. It is cut into three, or on closer inspection four, parts of different size, by long dark clouds. The star HD 164492, spectral type O7, sits near the center of the nebula right next to the confl uence of these dark lanes. It is the brightest component of a very young multiple stellar system, similar to the Trapezium in M 42, and it provides the powerful radiation that makes the surrounding nebula glow. M 20 is a very young star-forming region in an earlier evolutio- nary stage than that of the Orion Nebula. The shape of the HII region still appears round and regular, and most of the stars are still hidden inside the dark, dense part of the nebula. Hence, the age of this star cluster (HN 40 or ADS 10991) is under 400,000 years. The total size of the M 20 nebula is 15 light-years, and its distance of 2660 light- years makes it a foreground object to its neighbors in the sky, M 20 and M 21. Consequently, it does not belong to the Sagittarius OB1 association. In 1997, photos taken with the Hubble Space Telescope show a dense cloud of gas and dust near the center of M 20. On its tip, facing the hot radiation of the central star, several “evaporating gaseous glo- bules” (EGGs) were found. These very compact and small clouds have so far withstood evaporation and each of them contains a star in the fi nal stages of formation. Furthermore, a jet-like fi nger of gas, about half a light-year long, emerges from the dark cloud, originating from a very young star. All these structures are due to be destroyed by the radiation from the hot central star within the next 10,000 years. The magnitude 7.5 star (HD 164514) north of the red emission nebula is bright, but not hot enough to ionize its surrounding gas. Hence, its blue light is scattered by the dust component of the outer nebula of M 20. Deep photographs reveal that this refl ection nebula, one of the largest of its kind, entirely surrounds the central part like a veil. Hence, the central star’s light may also contribute to it. The fi eld of M 20 contains numerous variables of 14 th magnitude and fainter, including 85 T Tauri stars, which are typical for young nebulae. The components of the central star are not, however, vari- able. Observation M 20 looks spectacular on photo- graphs, but it is not a bright object for visual observers. Estimates of its total brightness range from ma- gnitude 6.3 to 9.0, which underlines the uncertainty of assessment by visual observers. In binoculars, M 20 is a diffi cult object to observe – just a faint smudge around a bright magnitude 6.9 central star. This impression does not change much with small telescopes. The surface brightness of the nebula is quite low. However in a dark sky, even the faint northern part of M 20 is visible with large binoculars. It surrounds a 7 th -magnitude star 8' north of the central star. The tripartition of the brighter southern part of M 20 can be seen with giant binoculars (20×100) or telescopes from 4 inches up, if the object is high enough in the sky. The dark lanes meet next to the central star HD 164492 (HN 40, ADS 10991), which itself is in the brightest part of the nebula. Small telescopes can resolve this multi- ple star into two components of magnitude 7.5 (A) and 10.0 (B), se- parated by 6.3\" in PA 20°, plus a third component C with magnitude 8.7 lying 11\" south. The latter has a magnitude-10.5 companion (D) at 2.3\" in PA 281°, which requires larger apertures. A much fainter component E lies 6\" south of C, and A is an extremely close binary with a separation of only 0.04\" – which makes a multiple system of 6 stars in total.

The Frenchman noted: “Cluster of stars, near the previous. The stars of these two clusters are of 8 th to 9 th magnitude, surrounded by nebulosity.” Apparently, Messier’s telescope was not good enough to show either object correctly: neither is M 20 a star cluster, nor does any nebulosity exist around M 21. John Herschel and Admiral William Smyth both called this clus- ter scattered and coarse. M 21 did not receive much attention from later observers, either. Astrophysics At its distance of 3930 light-years, this open cluster is located in the Sagittarius spiral arm of the Galaxy, like M 8 but a bit closer to us. M 21 is also part of the Sagittarius OB1 association and, like all its members, it is a very young object. There may be evidence for two separate phases of cluster formation, as Park and colleagues found several stars in M 21 with an age of only 4 million years, while for the majority of the cluster members they derived an age of 7.5 to 8 million years. In 1996 Forbes identifi ed about 105 cluster members among all stars brighter than magnitude 15.5 in a fi eld of 18' diameter. The brightest cluster star, HD 164863 of spectral type B0, is magnitude 7.3. Most authors regard M 21 as a rather concentrated cluster and give it the Trümpler class I3r or I3p. Observation Considering its brightness of magni- tude 5.9, and the fact that its brigh- test star reaches a respectable magnitude 6.7, M 21 should be within reach of the naked eye. However, with several 6 th -magnitude stars and the Trifi d Nebula M 20 directly south of it, this object is diffi cult to distinguish from its close neighbors. In binoculars, M 21 appears as a small knot of stars. A small telescope resolves about a dozen cluster members on a nebulous background. The center is occupied by a very compact group of three stars. With larger apertures, the number of cluster stars rises to 40 or 50 and the unresol- ved background disappears. The cluster’s borders are not well defi ned against the rich background, so it is diffi cult to judge the shape of M 21. Its approximate size is 7' in smaller and 15' in larger telescopes.

Abraham Ihle found it in 1665 at Leipzig, Germany, while observing Saturn. The subsequent observers Halley, de Chéseaux, and Messier all mention Ihle as the discoverer, even though not much else is known about him. In 1747, Le Gentil de- scribed M 22 as a nebula “spreading some kind of rays of light all around.” Hence, he may have come close but still failed to resolve this cluster into individual stars – like Lacaille in 1757, who spoke of a “small core of a comet,” and Messier in 1764, who noted on the 5 th of June: “This nebula is round, does not contain any star, & it is seen very well with a simple telescope of 3½ ft; 6' diameter.” It was left to William Herschel to recognize the true nature of M 22 towards the end of the eighteenth century. His son John commented later: “A superb, very much compressed, round cluster. Stars of 11 th to 15 th magnitude; not very well defi ned. Rather more compressed to the north following [northeastern] side than at the center.” His con- temporary, retired Admiral Smyth, agreed that this is a “fi ne globular cluster” and wrote: “it consists of very minute and thickly condensed particles of light.” Astrophysics The impressive appearance of M 22 comes mostly from its re- latively close distance of 10,400 light-years. Of the globular clusters in the Messier catalog, only M 4 is closer. In absolute terms, M 22 is a very average globular cluster: it has a diameter of 100 light-years and half a million solar masses. On its 200-million-year-long orbit around the galactic center, M 22 never exceeds 5000 light-years from the galactic plane, and it never moves farther than 30,000 light-years from the galactic cen- ter. Half a century ago, Shapley and Pease counted 70,000 stars in M 22. Today, however, a single photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows 83,000 stars in only a small fi eld 3.3 light-years in diameter at the distance of M22. The brightest stars in the cluster re- ach magnitude 10.7, which makes M 22 the globular cluster with the brightest apparent individual stars. At least 78 member stars are va- riables – a formerly counted Mira variable has recently been excluded from cluster membership. In 1999, the Hubble Space Telescope observed a possible gravitati- onal micro-lensing event in M 22. For 18 days, a star in the galactic bulge in the background of the cluster’s dense center appeared brigh- ter than usual. Such an event occurs when a faint, low-mass cluster star crosses the line-of-sight to the background star. Its gravity then bends and temporarily focuses the light of the background star for us. Anderson and colleagues (2003), however, thought that the back- ground star was a dwarf nova undergoing an outburst. Since then, other authors have shared doubts about the micro-lensing event. In 1989, the planetary nebula GJJC 1 (or PK 9-7.1) was discove- red in M 22 and identifi ed as the optical counterpart of the infrared source IRAS 18333-2357. This was, after Pease 1 in M 15, only the second planetary nebula found in a globular cluster. The nebula has an apparent brightness of magnitude 15.0, a size of 10\" by 7\", and surrounds a central star of magnitude 14.3. Together with M 22, the nebula moves through the interstellar medium with a relative speed of 200 km/s. This compresses the planetary nebula’s shell and sweeps its material out of the cluster. M 22.

Messier wrote about this cluster: “The stars of the cluster are very near each other, 15' diameter.” 70 years later, John Herschel reported: “A star 10 th magnitude in the center of a beautiful discrete cluster of 60 or 70 stars of 10 th and 11 th magnitude and one of 9 th or 10 th . They run in lines and arches. It is loose and straggling, and the sky around it has a dotted appea- rance.” Admiral Smyth was even more enthusiastic about the appea- rance of M 23 and wrote: “This is an elegant sprinkling of telescopic stars over the whole fi eld, under a moderate magnifying power; the most clustering portion is oblique, in the direction south preceding [southwestern] to north following [northeastern], with a 7 th -magni- tude star in the latter portion.” Astrophysics M 23 is only 2050 light-years away, which puts this open cluster halfway between us and the Sagittarius arm, the nearest spiral arm towards the galactic center. The true diameter of the cluster is about 20 light-years. The brightest cluster star is only magnitude 9.2 and is of spectral type B9. Most of the cluster stars are 9 th to 11 th magnitude and fall into the spectral classes A, F, and G. This suggests an advanced clus- ter age of 300 million years. Sanders and Schroeder listed a total of 177 stars as probable clus- ter members, covering a fi eld of 34' in angular diameter. The Trümpler class has been given, by a variety of authors, as I2r, II2r, or III1m. Observation From most of Europe and the nort- hern US, M 23 is not visible to the naked eye, but it can be spotted from southern locations. Binoculars reveal a loose cluster southeast of a 6 th -magnitude star. About 40 stars of 9 th to 12 th magnitude distributed over a diameter of 25' are shown by a small telescope.

Stars 14 th and 15 th magnitude.” The last remark clearly refers to NGC 6603, which appears to lie inside M 24. Smyth gave a similar descrip- tion: “A beautiful fi eld of stars, and in a richly clustering portion of the Milky Way, has a peaking spot with a lot of stardust.” In 1905, Agnes Clerke commented: “Visible to the naked eye as a dim cloudlet near μ Sagittarii and named by Secchi as ‘Delle Cau- stiche’ from the peculiar arrangement of its stars in rays, arches, cau- stic curves and intertwined spirals.” When he inspected photographic plates in 1918, Curtis described the neighboring dark nebulae, which were discovered by Barnard in 1913: “Two dark nebulae, the larger western object is about 14'×8', and the contrast between the dense Milky Way region and the vacant spots is very striking.” Astrophysics The designation M 24 has been given to the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, which should be distinguished from the Large Sagittarius Cloud south of M 8. M 24 does not hold any other catalog names, as it does not have any physical identity. In reality, this is just a large number of stars at a considerable range of distances from 12,000 to 16,000 light-years, seen through a 1.5° by 0.5° window of reduced absorption in the curtain of interstellar dust, making them appear as a star cloud in projection along our line of sight. The window to M 24 is remarkable, because it opens up a view through both our local spiral arm and the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm – in which we fi nd quite a number of the neighboring Messier objects – deep into the next spiral arm inward, the Norma arm, to- wards the galactic center. Usually, our views near the galactic plane are limited to just a few thousand light-years, because the average interstellar absorption in the Milky Way is around 1 magnitude per 1000 light-years. But the actual extinction varies greatly due to the uneven distribution of interstellar dust clouds, and in the direction of M 24 we can see more than halfway to the galactic center. An even more transparent region further south near the star μ Sgr [Sagittarii] which is known as Baade’s Window gives us a view of the inner ga- lactic bulge at a distance of 30,000 light-years. It even shows globular clusters behind the galactic center, which is only 4° away. Within M 24, we fi nd the open cluster NGC 6603 at a distance of 12,000 light-years and with a diameter of 18 light-years. This very compact object is reminiscent of M 11, but it lies more than 2.5 times further away in the Norma spiral arm. Its light suffers from an in- terstellar extinction of only 1.5 magnitudes. The age of this distant open cluster is an estimated 200 million years. The depth of view within M 24 is demonstrated by two other ob- jects nearby. The double star Burnham 639, 10' south of NGC 6603, lies in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm, at a distance of 7800 light- years. The magnitude-6.4 primary star is gravitationally bound to a magnitude-7.9 companion, 18\" away (PA 52°). Even closer to us are the two small, but compact, dark clouds B 92 and B 93 at the nort- hern edge of M 24. They belong to our local spiral arm and mark, so to speak, the entrance of the viewing-tunnel at only a few hundred light-years away. Another foreground object, at a distance of 4100 light-years, is the tiny planetary nebula NGC 6567 just east of the star cloud M 24, as well as the G Cephei variable WY Sagittarii to the south, with a period of 21.85 days and a brightness variation between magnitude 7.5 and 8.6. Additional objects in M 24 include the open clusters Collinder 469 at 4700 light-years, with 32 certain and 14 possible member stars, and Markarian 38 (= Biurakan 5) at a similar distance, with 12 probable member stars. Observation M 24 is easily recognized by the na- ked eye as a small, bright and elon- gated star cloud.

Only B 92 features even a single star in its dark region. Not far from the northern edge of M 24, two dark bands run across the star cloud, fragmenting it into long islands. They have their origin near B 92 and spread southwest from there. M 24 itself is resolved into myriads of stars, the brightest of which reach 8 th ma- gnitude.

However, this was not known to Messier: while at the time de Chéseaux did send a letter to the Paris Academy of Sciences to report his discoveries, it was only read to a meeting and was not published in print. Hence, Messier made a truly independent discovery of this “cluster of small stars” on the 20 th of June 1764, and wrote: “The stars of this cluster are diffi cult to observe with a simple refractor of 3 feet, no perceiva- ble nebulosity. 10' diameter.” Later, Admiral Smyth noted: “A loose cluster of large and small stars in the Galaxy. The gathering portion of the group assumes an arched form, and is thickly strewn in the south, on the upper part, where a pretty knot of minute glimmerers occupies the center, with much star-dust around.” The Herschels did not observe M 25. Hence, despite the observa- tions of Smyth and others, it did not receive an NGC designation. In 1866, Julius Schmidt rediscovered this cluster, observing from Athens, but it was not until 1908 that M 25 was included in the second In- dex Catalog as its entry No. 4725, after a positional measurement by Bailey. Astrophysics The characteristic appearance of the open cluster M 25 is shaped by its brightest star, U Sgr [Sagittarii], a variable of the classical G Cephei type. Its brightness varies regularly between magnitudes 6.3 and 7.1 with a period of 6.75 days (Irwin, 1956). This star yields a relatively certain cluster distance of 2020 light-years, from which a physical diameter of 17 light-years can be derived. This places M 25 in the gap between our local spiral arm (Orion-Cygnus arm) and the next, inner Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm, and about 150 light-years below the galactic plane. M 25 has about 220 known member stars, which suffer from up to 1.6 magnitudes of extinction and signifi cant reddening by interstellar dust. The total cluster mass has been estimated to 2000 solar masses, and values between 30 and 100 million years have been given for its age. The second brightest star in the cluster, to the northeast, has ma- gnitude 6.8 and is a very suitable comparison red for photometry on U Sagittarii. M 25 contains another variable, V3508 Sagittarii (magni- tude 7.7–8.0), which is of the J Cassiopeiae type, as well as fi ve hot Be stars with emission lines. The cluster’s classifi cation varies from author to author; especially astonishing are their different interpretations of its richness. Trümpler classes I2p, I3m, and IV3r have been suggested for M 25. Observation M 25 can be located with the naked eye 5° east of M 24. Binoculars are a good choice for observing this open cluster; they resolve about a dozen stars. With a small telescope, low power is best. It resolves the 30' cluster into about 50 stars; a denser group occupies the center. Two curved star chains run through the cluster from east to west. Larger apertures show the yellow color of the bright dominating star near the center, the variable U Sagittarii. It is also a double star (Burnham 966): a magnitude 9.6 companion is 66.5\" away in PA 253°. M 25 is dominated by the cepheid U Sagittarii. Dietmar Böcker.

This cluster does not contain any nebulosity; 2' di- ameter.” Occasionally, the discovery of M 26 has been attributed to le Gentil, in 1749, but that is not correct. While the Frenchman gave a position near M 26, he in fact reported an observation of “Kirch’s Nebula,” M 11. M 26 was not very popular with later observers. John Herschel characterized it as “considerably large; pretty rich; pretty compressed; stars from 12 th to 15 th magnitude,” while Smyth reported: “A small and coarse, but bright, cluster of stars. The principal members of this group lie nearly in a vertical position with the equatorial line.” Astrophysics M 26 is quite an ordinary open cluster and one of the least-well- studied Messier objects. At a distance of about 5200 light-years, it has a physical diameter of about 12 light-years. The brightest cluster star is only magnitude 10.3 and has the spectral type B8. It suffers an extinction of 1.8 magnitudes by the rich interstellar dust in its line- of-sight. With an age of about 90 million years, M 26 is moderately young to average. According to Grubissich, at least 69 stars can be attributed to the cluster. In a 1940 study, Cuffey noticed that within 3' from the center there are apparently fewer cluster stars, which may fi nd an explanation in a small, interstellar dark cloud in front of the clus- ter. Different Trümpler classifi cations have been given to M 26: II2r, I1m, or II3m. An interesting cluster member is the R Coronae-Borealis star FH Scuti. Its brightness can drop on a short time scale, without any kind of warning, from the normal value of magnitude 13.4 to as faint as 16.8. These events are caused by the sporadic formation of clouds of circumstellar dust in the outer atmosphere of this very cool supergiant star. Whenever this happens on its facing side, only a small fraction of the normal luminosity remains visible. Observation M 26 appears as a faint, small ne- bula in a star-rich fi eld, near the southern edge of the Scutum cloud, when observed with binoculars. It takes higher powers to resolve this cluster into individual stars. In a 2-inch refractor, M 26 gives a poor impression; only fi ve stars are seen next to the brightest cluster member. A better view is given by an aperture of 4.7 inches; it shows 15 to 20 stars on a ne- bulous backdrop. Telescopes of 12 to 14 inches show 30 to 40 cluster stars. Higher magnifi cations are required to make the by far brightest star of 10th magnitude stand out from the others. A starless void, north of the center, is now noticeable – the brighter stars appear to be grouped around it. The cluster’s visual size is 8'.

He described his fi nd with the words: “Nebula without star; it is well seen with a simple refractor of 3½ feet; it appears in an oval shape & does not contain any star, 4' diameter.” William Herschel was the fi rst to recognize the peculiar dumbbell shape but believed it was a “double stratum of stars of a very great extent, one end of which is facing us.” Later, his son John gave the nebula its now popular name: “a nebula shaped like a dumbbell.” He continues his description: “with the elliptic outline completed by a feeble nebulous light. Position of the axis of symmetry through the centers of the two chief masses 30° to 60°. The diameter of the ellip- tic light fi lls a space nearly equal to that between the wires (7' or 8'). Not resolvable, but I see on it four distinct stars: 1 st 12 th magnitude at the south following edge; 2 nd 12 th magnitude to 13 th magnitude, almost diametrically opposite; 3 rd 13 th magnitude in the north pre- ceding quarter, and 4 th 14 th to 15 th magnitude near the center.” In a later description, John Herschel called M 27 “shaped something like an hourglass, fi lled into an oval outline with a much less dense ne- bulosity. The central mass may be compared to a vertebra or a dumb- bell. The southern head is denser than the northern.” Admiral Smyth enthusiastically spoke of a “magnifi cent and sin- gular object, it is one of those splendid enigmas which are proposed by God.” Lord Rosse devoted a detailed study to M 27 using his huge tele- scope. The Irish nobleman wrote: “It requires an extremely fi ne night and a tolerably high power; it is then seen to consist of innumerable stars, mixed with nebulosity; and when we turn the eye from the te- lescope to the Milky Way, the similarity is so striking that it is im- possible not to feel a pretty strong conviction that the nebulosity in both proceeds from the same cause.” Of course, he could not know how wrong he was with this impression. Heinrich d’Arrest described M 27 as “very large and luminous, two objects with a transition between each other. In the brighter, southern part, an eccentrically positioned spot can be recognized, the northern part is not quite so bright.” It took over 100 years after the discovery until William Huggins was able to explain the nature of this nebula by using the then new method of spectroscopy: “The light of this nebula, after passing through the prisms, remained concentrated in a bright line. This line appeared nebulous at the edges. No trace of the other lines was perceived, nor was a faint continuous spectrum detected.” This observation made clear that M 27 was not composed of faint un- resolved stars, but of luminous gas. In 1918, Curtis commented on M27 with the words: “The ‘Dumb- bell’ Nebula in Vulpecula. One of the ‘giants’ of the planetary class and of great importance in theories of planetary structure because of the easy visibility of intrinsic details.” Astrophysics In terms of total apparent bright- ness of planetary nebulae, M 27 holds second place at magnitude 7.4, right after the much closer Helix Nebula NGC 7293 at 7.3 – but with a much higher surface brightness. As a textbook example of its object class, the Dumbbell Nebula has become the best-studied planetary nebula except for M 57, the Ring Nebula. The small central star that causes the ionization of the surrounding nebula has a magnitude of only 13.5 but a very hot spectral type (O7, 85,000K). There is a 17 th -magnitude companion to the central star at 6.5\" distance in PA 214°, found in the early 1970s by Cudworth. The stars are only about 2500 AU away from each other. The morphology of the nebula is complex. The innermost elliptical shell that surrounds the central star measures 1.2' by 0.8' and is elon- gated in PA 130°. Perpendicular to this, the luminous hourglass-shaped part of the nebula spans 4.5' by 2.5'. The hourglass component is then embedded in the fainter ellipse (8.4' by 6.1' in PA 125º), which was documented by John Herschel. Kwitter and colleagues (1991) discovered a faint, 15.5' by 13.3' halo with the same orientation as the bright central part. Papamastorakis later reported an extension of up to 17'. The surface brightness of the outer halo is about 1000 times lower than that of the main component of the nebula, and it is deformed in PA 60° as a result of the proper motion of M 27 through the interstellar medium. When comparing the H D /H E images of M 27 with the image in the [OIII] emission line, both appearance and size differ. The H D image shows a lot of mottled sub-structure, while in [OIII] light, the inner nebula appears quite homogeneous.

This would make M 27 a very large planetary nebula. The inner region of the Dumbbell Nebula appears very ragged and full of knots, when imaged at high resolution, as by the Hubble Space telescope in 2001. These substructures have sizes of 20 to 60 million kilometres (i.e., fractions of an AU) and contain about three Earth masses each. They lie near the chaotic boundary between the hot and io- nized gas pushing from inside, and the cool, neutral outer envelope in the shape of a to- rus (i.e. a donut). The expanding ionization exposes the more resistant cool clumps, which have an origin in the earlier dust- driven wind of the former supergiant. The strongest ionization in the inner nebula is found in two structures, which emerge from the central star in PA 70° and 240°, and which may indicate the rotati- on axis of the central star. These structures have suffi cient density to be opaque and they cast “shadows,” ionisation gaps, onto the outer regions of the nebula. The outer nebula expands at a rate of 2.3\" per century. This represents the remains of the cool wind of the former cool super- giant, built up over a few tens of thousands of years. The inner regions are faster at 6.8\" per century and push into the slower, cool envelope. Counting from the emergence of the hot central star, recent estimates sug- gest that M 27 is about 9000 years old. That would make the Dumbbell Nebula younger than the more distant Ring Nebula, M 57.

In larger telescopes, the “ears” are so apparent that the brighter hourglass now defi nes only the minor axis, while the ears form the major axis in PA 120°. A 14-inch telescope shows a total of 14 stars in the nebula. These include the bright 10 th -magnitude star in the southwestern corner, which is now visibly inside M 27.

It was discovered by Leos Ondra in 1991, simply from a com- parison of different pictures of the nebula on the cover pages of va- rious astronomical magazines. It is a background Mira star with a suspected period of 213 days and a brightness variation between at least magnitudes 14.3 and 15.1.

He noted that night: “It does not contain any star, it is round, it cannot be observed without diffi culty with a simple refractor of 3½ ft, 2' diameter.” A few years later, William Herschel succeeded in resolving M 28 into individual stars and had to disagree with Messier’s characteriza- tion. His son John described it as an “excessively compressed globular cluster, not very bright; but very rich, stars of 14 th to 15 th magnitude.” Smyth agreed with the cluster stars being “very small.” Astrophysics M 28 and M 22 each have a phy- sical diameter of 100 light-years, but M 28 is more than three times farther away at 34,500 light-years. Its total mass is estimated to be 500,000 solar masses. M 28 is one of the globular clusters of the galactic bulge. Despite its proximity to the galactic center, where heavy elements were fi rst formed in the galaxy, M 28 shows the same low metallicity as the globular clusters further out in the galactic halo. Perhaps changes in its galactic orbit brought M 28 from the halo to its present place. Shapley noticed the elliptical shape of this cluster and gave an axis-ratio of 9:10. Hogg determined the average magnitude of the 25 brightest cluster stars to be of magnitude 14.7. In 1949, Joy discovered a variable cluster star with a period of 19 days, belonging to the W Virginis type. Another variable in M 28 is V2342 Sagittarii of the RV Tauri class with a period of 92 days. This star, 1' southeast of the cluster’s center, changes its brightness between magnitudes 13.1 and 13.8. In addition, 13 RR Lyrae varia- bles, very typical for globular clusters, are known in M 28, as well as four red irregular variables. A special fi nd is the millisecond pul- sar (see M 4) with a period of 3ms, discovered in 1987. Only recent- ly, ten pulsars have been found in M 28 with the Green Bank Radio Telescope. M 28 now has the largest known pulsar population of any Messier cluster. Observation Its apparent proximity to the popu- lar M 22 dooms M 28 to be a rarely visited Messier object, even though its brightest individual stars reach a respectable magnitude of 12.0. Resolution of its member stars can even be achieved with an aperture of 4 inches – not, however, in the 2' central region. The irregular visual impression is resolved into chains of stars with larger apertures. The most noticeable chain aims northward, starting near the core. In combination with a second curved chain farther west, this almost gives the impression of a pair of scissors that ends with a 12 th -magnitude star 1.7' north of the cluster center. The total visual size of M 28 reaches 5' in a 14-inch telescope. The signifi cantly smaller and fainter globular cluster NGC 6638 (magnitude 9.1) lies 1.5° southeast of M 28.

John Herschel, already using large refl ectors, later characterized M 29 as “A coarse cluster of 8 large stars (10 th magnitude), and a do- zen or 20 smaller in a roundish form.” Admiral Smyth found it more attractive with a smaller aperture and noted: “a neat but small cluster of stars.” Curtis’ description (1918) of the photographic appearance is, by contrast, very dry: “Cluster, poor, little compressed, large and small stars.” Astrophysics M 29 is not a particularly obvious open cluster. However, were it not lying right in the Milky Way and suffering from 3.5 magnitudes of extinction by the interstellar dust in the line of sight (Hiltner, 1954) – which lets only 5% of its light pass – we would instead see a brilliant 3 rd -magnitude cluster in our sky. The foreground extinction actually shows small-scale structure, so much that some stars to the north and south of the cluster center are dimmed by as much as 5 magnitudes! Together with the neighboring clusters IC 4996 and Be 86, M 29 be- longs to the same OB1 association of young and hot stars that give the Cygnus star cloud much of its brightness. Additional members of this association include the variables P Cygni, 44 Cygni, and the Crescent Nebula NGC 6888, which is a rare Wolf–Rayet stellar-wind envelope. The fi ve brightest stars of M 29 are blue supergiants with spectral types B0 and B1 and luminosities of 160,000 Suns. At least two of these are variables: HD 194378 (V2031 Cygni) is an eclipsing binary with brightness changes between magnitudes 8.5 and 8.7. However, Boeche et al. have argued that it is not actually a physical member of the cluster. HD 229221 (V1322 Cygni) is a J Cassiopeiae type varia- ble which changes its brightness between magnitudes 8.8 and 9.7. HD 229239, the third-brightest star in M 29, may also be a variable. These hot luminous stars strongly suggest a very young cluster age. Massey et al. have put it at 4 to 6 million years. Gerts counted 229 stars with probable cluster membership, which form a 5' core region and a 32' “corona.” On the Trümpler classifi cation, several authors differ signifi cantly from each other. In the literature, we fi nd assignments of III3pn, II3m, and I2mn. The ‘n’ refers to the extensions of the nebula around J Cygni, notably the branch of DWB 51 just 20' west of M 29. Observation M 29 can be glimpsed with the na- ked eye as a faint “star,” but a defi - nite sighting requires binoculars. The compact cluster then appears as a knot of stars, while resolution into individual stars is achieved with a small telescope at 50×. A small telescope shows the characteristic pattern of M 29, which looks like a smaller version of the Pleiades – an appealing view despite a certain lack of luster. The number of cluster stars rises from only a dozen in a 4-inch telescope to about twice as many with a 14-inch. Worth mentioning are the faint stars inside the bright box pattern, which seem to form a chain in the north-south direction. The nebula DWB 51, part of the J Cyg [Cygni] complex, lies 50' northwest of M 29 and can be seen with a 14-inch telescope and narrowband fi lter.

He noted: “Towards the north are two rows of bright stars, four or fi ve in a line.” Almost 50 years later, his son John commented in more detail: “Fine cluster; irregularly round, with two projections at its northern side. One is di- rected from the central brightness and consists of three or four bright stars of 12 th magnitude; its position taken with micrometer is 350.4°; the other originates in the preceding side of the center, and is directed in a position 331.7° in a line not passing the center; diameter 6', stars of 12 th magnitude; has a star of 9 th magnitude preceding it.” Smyth, observing with a signifi cantly smaller aperture (5.9 inches) than John Herschel, described: “A fi ne pale white cluster. This object is bright, and from the straggling streams of stars on its northern verge, has an elliptical aspect, with a central blaze; and there are but few other stars, or outliers, in the fi eld.” Astrophysics The globular cluster M 30 lies at a distance of 30,000 light-years from us, below the galactic plane. Its orbit around the galactic center is inclined at 50º to the galactic disk and it takes 160 million years to complete. This incline makes the distance of M 30 from the galactic center vary between about 10,000 and 25,000 light-years. The true diameter of M 30 measures about 100 light-years, and its total mass has been estimated to be 300,000 solar masses. The stars in the core of M 30 are very densely packed, since this globular cluster has already suffered a core collapse (see M 15), a dynamical process in which the central star density of the cluster grows dramatically. At least 13 variable stars are known in M 30, including a dwarf nova. Only two other globular clusters, M 5 and NGC 6712, have a variable of this rare type, but the radial velocity and the color now give reason to doubt the cluster membership of this object. Further- more, two pulsars (see M 28) were discovered in M 30 in 2004, with periods of 11 and 13 milliseconds. There is an unusually large number of “blue stragglers” in M 30. In its 20\"central region, they constitute 25% of the stars, more than in any other cluster, the central region giving an unusually blue color. These stars appear to be younger and more massive than the normal cluster stars, although all the stars of the globular cluster are supposed to have formed at the same time. It is generally assumed, therefore, that “blue stragglers” developed more recently, by the merging of two stars or by mass-transfer in a close binary system. The more frequent occurrence of such stars in the dense core regions of globular clusters, especially in the super-dense core of M 30, seems to support at least the merger hypothesis. Observation Even though M 30 can be seen with binoculars as a small nebu- lous ball, it remains a tough object to observe in small telescopes. Resolution into individual stars is unsuccessful, unless at least 6 to 8 inches of aperture are available. The strongly concentrated center remains nebulous even then. There is an 8 th -magnitude star 7' west of M 30. The lines of stars mentioned by Herschel are well visible: one leaves the cluster center to the north, the other runs in parallel to it, northwest of M 30, and misses the cluster center. In a 14-inch telescope, the cluster’s total visual size is 4', while its unresolved core has 1' diameter."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"143 M 30.

However, this nebula may well have been known to Persian astronomers by 905 AD or earlier. These early medieval observations were long forgotten, when in 1612, just after the invention of the telescope, Simon Marius tried out his small refractor in Gunzenhausen, Germany. His rediscovery of M 31 may well be considered as an independent discovery of the ne- arest spiral galaxy. He wrote: “looks like a candle fl ame seen through transparent horn. No stars can be seen, only glimmering rays which are brighter closer to the center.” Since Marius’ observation was not known to later observers either, we may also consider Hodierna (1654) and Bullialdus (1661) as independent discoverers. From today’s perspective, it is not obvious why a telescope should have been necessary to discover M 31. But before the invention of the telescope, naked-eye nebulae were virtually unknown (except for M 44, the prototypical “nebulosa”), and there was simply no interest in this kind of phenomenon. Hence, M 31 may well have been seen by other pre-telescopic astronomers, but it was plainly ignored as not being important to them. Charles Messier observed M 31 several times and also produced a drawing. His note from the 3 rd of August 1764, reads: “The beau- tiful nebula in the girdle of Andromeda, in the shape of a spindle; it resembles two cones or pyramids of light, facing each other at their bases, with an axis directed from northwest to southeast; the two points M 31.

In 1785, William Herschel prophetically supposed M 31 to be a “sister of the Milky Way,” but his distance estimate of 2000 times that of Sirius was far too small. He described M 31 as “undoubtedly the nearest of all the great nebulae. Its extent is more than a degree and a half in length, and in even one of the narrowest places, not less than 16' in breadth.” Smyth very appropriately spoke of a “milky irresolvable nebulosity.” while Lord Rosse thought he recognized individual stars. Leo Brenner had the same impression at the beginning of the 20 th century, after ob- servations with his 6-inch refractor: “With magnifi cation 660× uncoun- table tiny stars 13 th to 15 th magnitude distributed all over the fi eld of view, like fi ne sand over a grey marble plate. Although I have observed this nebula many times before and afterwards, only that one time did I achieve this resolution, from which can be concluded that it is possi- ble only under exceptionally good seeing conditions and a telescope of especially fi ne quality.” The true distance and nature of the “nebula” M 31 became clear only in the following years. In 1912, Slipher measured an approaching radial velocity of 300 km/s, which made it obvious that this was an extraga- lactic object. But the fi rst distance measurement had to wait until 1923, when Edwin Hubble discovered the fi rst cepheids in M 31. Then it was fi nally clear that the Andromeda Nebula and many other similar spiral nebulae represent milky ways of their own. Curtis wrote in 1918, based on the fi rst set of photographs: “This wonderful object, the largest of the spiral nebulae, is too well known to need description. Exposures of 1min to 3min show an almost stel- lar nucleus, with traces of spiral structure in the surrounding nebular matter.” Astrophysics M 31 is regarded as the best-studied galaxy of all. Its proximity and in- clination allow consistent studies of various classes of objects, which in our own galaxy are hidden behind the dense interstellar dust in the galactic disk. With a diameter of about 160,000 light-years, the spiral galaxy M 31 is signifi cantly larger than our Milky Way, but it seems to be less massive. A recent study by Evans et al. (2000), who included the halo of M 31, gives it some 700 thousand million solar masses, but this im- pressive fi gure is still less than the estimated mass of our own galaxy, some 1000 thousand million solar masses. There are at least 337 gravitationally bound globular clusters around M 31, and a further 688 have been listed as candidates. G 1 (Mayall II), the brightest of the M 31 globular clusters, was closely studied with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994. An estimated number of stars, magni- tude 22.5 and brighter, is 300,000, and a mass of as much as 14 to 17 million Suns has been derived. This makes G 1 a giant compared to the globular clusters in our Milky Way. It has a distance from the center of its parent galaxy of 170,000 light-years and a strong ellipticity of 0.2. Consequently, some authors suspect that G 1 is actually the remnant- core of a dwarf galaxy that was cannibalized by M 31. M 31 possesses an extended system of companion galaxies. Their brightest, M 32 and M 110, are even fellow members of the Messier catalog. Arp discovered a faint light bridge between M 31 and M 32; therefore, this pair has been included in his catalog of interacting gala- xies. A past close encounter with M 32 has led to a deformation of the spiral arms in M 31. Apart from these two Messier objects, NGC 147 and 185 are nota- ble companion galaxies of M 31, and there is a whole family of faint Andromeda dwarf galaxies (And I to IX) – altogether at least 12 com- panions surround their parent galaxy. And IV has, meanwhile, been discounted as a background object, while And VIII and IX have been found in more recent years. And VIII appears to be located in front of M 31 and near M 32 – it is being destroyed by tidal forces. This case resembles a near companion of the Milky Way, the SagDEG dwarf ga- laxy (see M 54). It is about 30,000 light-years across and still contains up to 3 globular clusters and 12 planetary nebulae. And IX, on the other hand, is a small and extremely faint dwarf galaxy about 150,000 light- years behind M 31. In 2004, a very faint object with a surface brightness of only 20mag/ arcmin 2 was found 3° northeast of M 31. It is possible that this is a di- stant extension of M 31 that became detached during a close encounter with a companion galaxy, or that it is the remnant of another canni- balized companion. In 1991, the core of M 31 was studied with the Hubble Space Te- lescope. This led to the discovery of a double structure with only 0.5\" separation, of which the physical core of M 31 forms the fainter com- ponent. Here, a black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses has been suggested. So far, only one supernova has been observed in M 31: on the 20 th of August 1888, Ernst Hartwig found a 6 th -magnitude new star, using the famous Fraunhofer-refractor in Dorpat. This star, today known as S Andromedae, dimmed to magnitude 16 by February 1890 and was the fi rst supernova observed in another galaxy. In 1989, the 4m Mayall Tele- scope was able to identify the supernova remnant of that star. However, novae are quite common, with several objects recorded each year. Of the approximately 35,000 known variables in M 31, the classical cepheids deserve special interest, because their period-luminosity re- M 31, historical drawing of the core region. R.

Since the fi rst studies of Hubble 1921, this value has changed several times. The currently assumed distance of 2.5 million light-years is signifi - cantly larger than early distance estimates for M 31, which were based on an incorrect calibration of the cepheid relation. Observation M 31 is the only extragalactic ob- ject in the northern sky that is visible to the naked eye without any diffi culty. It is fascinating to imagine its vastly larger distance of 2.5 million light-years in comparison to the “only” few hundred light-years of its foreground stars in our Milky Way. The central regi- ons of M 31 can be seen as a nebulous star even under mediocre skies with a limiting magnitude of at least 5.0; only badly light-polluted urban sites do not show it. In a dark, clear mountain sky, M 31 becomes a truly impressive, 3.5°×1°, large oval nebula. A faint star of magnitude 6.9 southeast of the southern galaxy’s edge is a good marker when estimating the visible length of the Andromeda Galaxy. In good binoculars and rich-fi eld telescopes, the visible length of M 31 can reach even 4° or more. In 1953, Robert Jonckheere noted the impressive total extent of 5.2°×1.1°, perceived with his 50mm bino- culars. The most obvious feature of M 31 is the bright star-like nucleus, which is visible in small telescopes – especially with higher magnifi cation. Around it, suburban skies show only a 1º-long, oval nebula without any further detail. A dark sky, however, re- veals that this is only the well-defi ned central regi- on of a galaxy that’s three times as large. Its edge is particularly distinct towards M 110. With 3 inches of aperture or more, the inner dust lane becomes vaguely visible there. With prolonged observation, faint structure can be perceived in the outer regions of the galaxy. The most distinct detail there is the star cloud NGC 206 (A 78), which was fi rst noticed by William Herschel in 1786. Using an aperture of 6 inches and observing patiently over hours, M 31 reveals more structure. NGC 206 turns out to be only the most obvious of many brighter spots, which are separated from each other by dark lanes, that follow the spiral pattern of the galaxy. The most prominent absorption features are the two dark lanes in the northwest side of M 31 and a curved section in its southern half. A 6-inch telescope is also capable of showing the fi rst globular clusters of M 31, i.e. G 213, 272, 280, 78, 76, and 1. G 1 is by far the brightest of these with a magnitude of 13.7, and sightings with only 4 inches of aperture have been reported. A 14-inch telescope offers so much visible detail in M 31 that several nights are required to record it all. The very bright nucleus remains stellar in appearance. It is surrounded by an elliptical nebula of 10' length with a strong brightness gradient but no other visible detail. 5' and 10' west of the core are two dark lanes, each is 3' wide.

Finally, C 202/3 is a fairly well visible pair of open clusters, 20' south of the galaxy’s nucleus. A lot of detail is present on the northeastern side of the Andro- meda Galaxy.

The Frenchman describes the discovery: “While observing the Andromeda Nebula with a fi ne telescope of 18 feet [focal length], I saw another, small nebula, about 1' diameter, which appeared to throw out two small rays, one to the right, one to the left.” Charles Messier had already observed M 32 in 1757, but the description in his catalog is dated the 3 rd of August 1764: “Small nebula without stars, round, 2' diameter.” Much later, working with much larger apertures, John Herschel characterized this galaxy, by contrast: “Extremely bright; pretty large; there is a brighter middle to a star of 10 th magnitude; 40\" diameter; a small star follows it [east] 11.5s.” Heinrich d’Arrest found M 32 “almost circular, brighter toward center, core resembles a star of 10 th magnitude.” Evaluating M 32’s appearance on his photographic plates, Curtis commented: “Exceedingly bright. In the long exposures it appears as a ‘burnt-out’ oval of 2.6'×1.8', with no trace of spiral character in the outer portions. The shortest exposures show a nucleus which is nebu- lous, surrounded by bright nebular matter far brighter than the brigh- test parts of the nebula in Andromeda.” Astrophysics Like M 110, M 32 is a physical com- panion of the Andromeda Galaxy – apparently close to it, just 22' south of the core of M 31. The real sepa- ration in space, however, is not known, but it is certainly larger than the visual impression suggests. Unfortunately, it is not unambiguously clear, whether M 32 stands in front of or behind M 31, from our perspective. The latest studies seem to suggest a location behind the parent galaxy. M 32 is an elliptical dwarf galaxy of only 6500 light-years diameter and about 3 thousand million solar masses. Its minor axis is shorter by 20% than the major axis (in PA 163°). This small galaxy probably owes its survival in the gravitational fi eld of M 31 to its very compact core region. A super-massive object of 2.5 million solar masses has been suspected in the core of M 32, from which X-ray emission was confi r- med only recently. Bekki et al. (2001) have proclaimed that M 32 was once a spiral galaxy, of which only the central bulge survived the last encounter with M 31. The stars of M32 have ages of 4 to 8 thousand million years, which is quite old, but their range of metallicities includes larger values, by con- trast to that of globular clusters. There is very little dust and gas left in this dwarf galaxy, which explains the stalled star formation, and it has lost its globular clusters. Only a few planetary nebulae are known. The central star density reaches a remarkable 1500 stars per cubic light-year. An observer on the edge of M32 would enjoy a marvellous night sky, half of which would be richly populated with the stars of M 32, and the other half fi lled with the Andromeda Galaxy in all its splendor. The astrophysical characteristics of M 32 are those of the core of an elliptical galaxy. This supports the idea that this galaxy was much larger originally, but has since lost much of its mass in a close encoun- ter with M 31. This is consistent with the observed deformations of the spiral arms of M 31. On the 31 st of August 1998, the Lick Observatory survey program discovered a nova of magnitude 16.5, only 35.7\" southwest of the core of M 32. Another two were found recently – on the 5 th of January 2004, by J.D. Neill, at magnitude 17.2 and 1.5' northeast of the galaxy core, and by F. Manzini on the 27 th of July 2006, at magnutide 17.2, located about 1' northwest of the nucleus. At the time of writing, no supernova has yet been observed in M 32. Observation Of all the companion galaxies of the Andromeda Nebula, M 32 is the one easiest to see – even in 8×30 binoculars. However its visual impression remains that of a fuzzy star of magnitude 8.1, even in small telescopes at low power. An aperture of 14 inches shows an oval nebula, elongated 4'×3' in north-south direction with a core of stellar appearance. M 32 is entirely emerged in the bright background of M 31, which makes it diffi cult to determine a total visual diameter. A faint globular cluster of the M 31 system, G 156, lies 6.3' nor- thwest of M 32. With a magnitude of 15.6, it takes a 20-inch telescope to show it as an apparent star. M 32.

We know with cer- tainty about the observation of Charles Messier on the 25 th of August 1764, with a 3-inch refl ector at 44×: “The nebula has a whitish light of nearly even density, however a little brighter for two-thirds of its diameter, does not contain any star. Seen with diffi culty in a simple refractor of 1 foot. 15' diameter.” William Herschel studied M 33 at length and discovered NGC 604, the bright emission nebula in the northern spiral arm. His son John characterized M 33 as “enormously large. The diffused nebula extends 15' south and as much nearly to the north. It has irregularities of light, and even feeble subordinate nuclei and many small stars.” He also recognized a 12 th -magnitude star northeast of the core. Smyth was using 5.9 inches of aperture and saw “a large and distinct, but faint pale white nebula with a bright star a little north preceding [northwest], and fi ve others following [east] at the same distance, between which and the object, there is an indistinct gleam of mere nebulous matter.” In 1850, Lord Rosse studied M 33 intensively by means of detailed drawings. He explained: “This fi gure represents the central portion of a very large nebula. The nebula itself has not been suffi ciently exa- mined, but as yet no other portion appears to have a spiral, or indeed any regular arrangement. The sketch is not very accurate, but repre- sents suffi ciently well the character of the central portion.” Heinrich d’Arrest, too, studied M 33 in detail, and he found the brighter knots NGC 588, 592, and 595. The discovery of NGC 603 is attributed to Lord Rosse, but this object has since been classifi ed as a foreground double star and it is not a physical part of M 33. Curtis had his fi rst deep exposures of M 33 at his disposal when he wrote in 1918: “A close rival to the Nebula of Andromeda as the most beautiful spiral known. With its faintest extensions it covers an area at least 55'×40'. 588, 592, 595, and 604 are simply brighter por- tions of 598. It is uncertain whether there is an actual stellar nucleus. A multitude of stellar condensations in the whorls; the spiral which furnishes the best known example of ‘resolution’ into stars.” Astrophysics M 33 is one of the nearest galaxies to us and a member of the Local Group of galaxies. Its mass of 10 to 40 thousand million solar masses appears small by comparison with M 31 and the Milky Way, but M 33 is still the third largest in the Local Group of galaxies. It even has a companion of its own, the dwarf galaxy LGS 3. A study of classical cepheids in M 33 with the Hubble Space Tele- scope in 1991 has confi rmed that this galaxy is slightly more distant M 33, historical drawing. R.

While the latter is about 2.5 million light-years away from us, the values derived for M 33 lie between 2.6 and 3.1 million light-years. Conside- ring the respective uncertain- ties, a best distance measure of 2.74 million light-years is obtained. M 33 has a main diame- ter of 50,000 light-years, up to 60,000 light-years inclu- ding extensions. As seen from our vantage point, this galaxy is spinning clockwise, taking about 200 million years for one revolution. The Hubble Space Telescope was able to resolve the central region of M 33. There is no super-mas- sive object at its center, as seen in other galaxies. Rather, the core was resolved into several massive luminous star clusters with an apparent brightness of 14 th magnitude and a mass of about 10,000 solar masses. Two different generations of stars are found here: a young one with an age of 40 million years, and a relatively old one, of one thousand million years. Furthermore, the central regi- on of M 33 hosts a binary with a black hole, which represents the strongest continuous X- ray emitter in the Local Group, as well as a luminous blue su- pergiant just 1\" north of the galaxy core. The integrated light of the galaxy M 33 appears blue, due to numerous star-forming regions with young stars, mingled with nebulous HII regions. The most prominent object of this kind is NGC 604 in the northern spi- ral arm of M 33. It is one of the largest HII regions known. Its true diameter of 1500 light-years would make it reach from the Earth to the Orion Nebula, which would be dwarfed beside this huge gas cloud. The Hubble Space Telescope has discovered more than 200 massive stars within that have just formed, with 15 to 120 solar masses each. They form a massive, very young star cluster that has already started to erode the nebula. Cavities have been formed in less than 3 million years. Sarajedini and Mancone cataloged 451 star cluster candidates in M 33, of which 255 are confi rmed clusters. Until the present day, no supernovae have been observed in M 33. We know about 350 cepheids and several novae. By 2007, more than 37,000 stars in the fi eld of the galaxy had been checked for variability with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and 2923 variable stars attributed to M 33 were found. About 70 individual stars of M 33 exceed an apparent brightness of magnitude 17.7. These include about a dozen irregular, luminous blue variables (LBVs) with very large masses and a maximum brightness of 14.5.

By comparison, the brightest of the 20 or so globular clusters of M 33 reaches an appa- rent brightness of magnitude 15.9. Observation M 33 can be regar- ded as the most distant object visible to the unaided human eye, if exceptional sightings of M 81 and M 83 by a very few individu- als are not counted. A total visual bright- ness of magnitude 5.7 together with a total visual extent of 20' to 30' result in a very low surface brightness for M 33. Most of the disk has only 23.1 mag/arcsec 2 . This is com- parable to the surface brightness of a very good night sky with limiting magnitude 6.8. Therefore, the naked-eye visibility of M 33 depends on a very clear, very dark sky, and even then it is just a spooky nebulous patch that requires indirect vision. In binoculars, M 33 becomes a distinct large nebulous patch with a hint of an exten- sion to the northeast, the brightest spiral arm. Under a dark sky, its real spiral structure is re- vealed even by telescopes with 3 to 6 inches used at low power. Under mediocre skies, ho- wever, M 33 remains a diffuse nebula without contrast even in large telescopes. A 4.7-inch refractor shows M 33 with enough detail to keep the observer busy for a long time. At least two diffuse spiral arms start from a small but extended core. The most distinct arm runs 7' north, and then turns east. It reaches out to the 1'-wide, bright spot of NGC 604, located 13' northeast of the galaxy’s core. A narrowband fi lter en- hances the emission nebula, and it can then be seen with only 2.5 inches of aperture. The southern spiral arm appears more diffuse and more mottled. It has a width of about 5', and its brightest part is 10' southwest of the core, where a star marks its southern edge. With 4.7 inches of aperture, there is a hint of other spiral arms between these two main arms, but it takes 14 inches to see them clearly. The visual extent of M 33 rises from 30' with 4.7 inches of aperture to 45' with 14 inches. A 14-inch telescope reveals fantastic fi ne structure within M 33.

This cluster was seen with certainty by Charles Messier on the 25 th of August 1764, as a “cluster of small stars; with a simple refractor of three foot the stars can be distinguished, 15' diameter.” John Herschel called M 34 a “fi ne cluster, fi lls fi eld,” and he coun- ted “about 20 stars of 9 th , 10 th ...11 th magnitude, and as many fainter.” Brenner gave the rather large number of 117 stars down to magnitude 9 and said M 34 would be “best seen with weak magnifi cation, nice object even for a 2-inch telescope.” Astrophysics M 34 is one of the looser Messier clusters with a total of about 100 stars down to magnitude 16. Its core region measures only 8 light- years, about twice the distance from the Sun to D Centauri. In total, the cluster has a diameter of 17 light-years, at a distance of 1600 light-years. The brightest member star is magnitude 7.3, has a spec- tral type of B8, and is 275 times the luminosity of the Sun. In 1957, van Hoerner gave the cluster an age of 110 million years, but con- temporary studies put it at 225 million years. M 34 has a few close double stars. In 2003, 17 out of 94 mem- ber stars were resolved as close pairs with separations between 0.09\" and 6.4\". However, it remains unclear which of these double stars are, indeed, physical binaries. Two variables of the J Doradus type have also been found, which have brightness changes caused by non- radial pulsations.

He called this kinematic group a “local association of star clusters.” Observation To the naked eye, M 34 is visible as a distinct nebulosity, although it has the same total brightness as the diffi cult to observe M 33. This difference is due to the low surface brightness of M 33, while the brightest stars of M 34 reach almost 7 th magnitude.

However, the observations of this Swiss observer were not published. The En- glishman John Bevis made an independent discovery of this cluster before 1750. That observation was known to Charles Messier, when he noted on the 30 th of August 1764: “Cluster of very small stars, near the left foot of Castor, at little distance from the stars P & K of this constellation.” Smyth calls M 35 a “gorgeous fi eld of stars from the 9 th to the 16 th magnitudes” and remarks: “the small stars being inclined to form curves of three or four, and often with a large one at the root of the curve.” John Herschel, using a much larger aperture and a smaller fi eld of view, was a little less impressed with the view: “A large, coar- se, pretty rich cluster of stars of 9 th to 16 th magnitude, which fi lls 2 or 3 fi elds, but chiefl y one in which are about 100 stars.” Lassell, observing with an aperture of 24 inches, commented: “fi eld of view is perfectly fi lled with brilliant stars, of exquisite beau- ty.” Lord Rosse counted about 300 stars in a fi eld of 26'. A century ago, Leo Brenner remarked: “Splendid object, in particular in larger scopes. The entire fi eld of view of 20' is littered with stars of 8 th to 12 th magnitude, all very close to each other.” Astrophysics M 35 has 20 member stars down to an apparent brightness of 10 th magnitude, and 120 to 13 th magnitude. To the 21 st magnitude, there are about 2700 stars that might physically belong to M35. The most luminous of all, and with magnitude 7.5 the brightest cluster star, has 700 times the solar luminosity and is a blue-white giant of spec- tral type B3. The same hot spectral type is found with the second- brightest star, which is magnitude 8.2. The earliest spectral types of the genuine main-sequence stars in M 35 are B6 and B7, with ma- gnitudes 8.8 and 9.2. In addition, there are some yellow and orange giants, spectral classes G and K, which have already left the main sequence. Instead of hydrogen, they are now burning helium in their cores. The brightest example is a K0 giant with magnitude 8.6 and 250 solar luminosities. Matching stellar evolution models suggest a young cluster age of about 100 to 150 million years, rather than the sometimes quoted 200 million years. In 2002, von Hippel and colleagues discovered a faint, 21.4-ma- gnitude white dwarf in M 35, which should be unusually massive, not so far from the Chandrasekhar stability limit of 1.44 solar masses, if it has the same young age as the cluster. In 2004, Korean astrono- mers found two variables in M35: one eclipsing binary with a normal brightness of magnitude 16.4, and one G Scu [Scuti] type variable with a brightness variation between magnitude 16.8 and 17.2. According to the most recent publications, M 35 should have a di- stance of 2700 light-years but, not long ago, in 2004, 3600 light-years was derived. The former value results in a physical cluster diameter of 22 light-years, and in a mean star density of three stars per cubic light-year. The interstellar absorption is a moderate 0.5 magnitudes. Directly southwest of M 35, we fi nd the very compact open cluster NGC 2158, which was discovered by William Herschel. At its much larger distance of 12,000 light-years, it is already at two thirds of the distance to the edge of the Galaxy and one of the most distant galactic objects which we can observe. The total brightness of NGC 2158 is magnitude 8.6 over an angular diameter of 5'. The brightest of its approximately 1000 stars reach magnitude 12.5 and suffer from a still moderate extinction of 1.5 magnitudes. A very great age of 2 thousand million years is attributed to NGC 2158 – it owes its long survival to its richness and compactness, and it is one of the oldest known open clusters in the Milky Way (see M 67). Arp even regarded NGC 2158 as an intermediate type of cluster, in between the globular clusters and the open clusters. Recent studies have identifi ed 57 variables in the fi eld of NGC 2158, including a ca- taclysmic star with an amplitude of 2.5 magnitudes, which, however, is probably not a physical member of this cluster. Observation On dark winter nights, M 35 is easi- ly visible to the naked eye as a full- moon-size patch of nebulosity. 3.5×15 opera glasses begin to resolve the cluster into 20 to 30 stars.

For this reason, le Gentil must be considered a true independent discoverer of this cluster, which he found in 1749. Messier made his observation on the 2 nd of September 1764, and wrote: “Cluster of stars in the Charioteer, with a simple re- fractor of 3½ foot the stars are barely discerned, the cluster does not contain any nebulosity. 9' diameter.” John Herschel called M 36 a “very pretty object which fi lls the fi eld.” Smyth described it as “the device of a star whose rays are for- med by very small stars.” D’Arrest must have had a similar impression when he wrote: “extremely rich and pretty cluster. Originating from the center, many stars are arranged in three thin spirals.” Leo Brenner recommended the observation of M 36 to his fellow amateur observers, about 100 years ago, with the words: “very lar- ge, rich and bright, consisting of somewhat scattered stars of 8 th to 10 th magnitude, which include the double star 6 737 of 8 th and 9 th magnitude stars, separated 10.6\". A rewarding object even for 3-inch telescopes and low magnifi cations.” Astrophysics M 36 is the least rich of the three Messier clusters in Auriga. Only 178 stars are regarded as physical cluster members. The brightest star (magnitude 8.8) is a blue giant with the early spectral type B2 and 360 times the solar luminosity. All of the other bright stars are also spectral type B, and there are no red giants in M 36. Therefore, the cluster’s age is thought to be as young as 20 to 40 million years. At its distance of 4300 light-years, M 36 is located at the outer edge of our local spiral arm. At the same distance, not far away, we fi nd the Auriga OB-association of young, jointly formed stars, span- ning a space of 560 by 260 light-years. The brightest member of that association is F Aur with magnitude 4.7. However, it remains unclear whether the formation history of M 36 is connected in any way with the Auriga OB-association. Some of the stars in M 36 are very fast rotators, much like the Be stars in the cluster of the Pleiades (see M 45), the best-known young cluster. M 36 is even younger, and it seems to share some morphologi- cal aspects with the Pleiades – but it lies at ten times the distance. A noteworthy object only 25' southwest of M 36 is the very red carbon star OW Aurigae with an apparent visual magnitude that va- ries between 12.3 and 13.6. Observation M 36 can be spotted with the naked eye as a faint star, but only from sites high in the mountains. Small binoculars show a little nebula, which is resolved into individual stars with 10×50 glasses. Small telescopes show about 30 stars in M 36, and twice as many are seen in a 4.7-inch refractor. A tight stellar pair in the cluster’s center is the double 6 737 with components of magnitude 9.1 and 9.4, separated by 11\". It is well resolved with a 2-inch refractor. Two north-south star chains, east and west of the cluster, appear to fra- me M 36. The small, 1' emission nebula NGC 1931 lies 1° west of M 36.

It fi lls 1½ fi elds, but the straggling stars extend very far. There may be 500 stars.” Hein- rich d’Arrest even believed he saw “wonderful loops and curved star patterns,” while Mädler remarked: “no particular compression can be noticed toward the middle.” Leo Brenner described M 37 in detail in his observing guide for amateur astronomers, about 100 years ago: “A splendid object for small scopes. Visible already in small fi nder scopes as a nebulous star, 24' diameter. The larger the telescope, the more splendid the view. With a 27-inch telescope, I estimated the number of visible stars 10 th to 14 th magnitude to about 600, but also in a 7-inch we see about 550, and a 4-inch at 120× magnifi cation still shows nearly 500. Stars are more crowded towards the middle.” Astrophysics With over 2000 member stars, of which 150 are brighter than ma- gnitude 12.5, and 500 brighter than magnitude 15, M 37 is one of the very richest galactic Messier clusters. Color images reveal 35 red giants in M 37, which include the brightest cluster star at magnitude 9.2. The upper end of the main sequence is marked by a moderately young B9 star, which suggests that M 37 is more evolved than M 36 and M 38. This explains the signifi cant population of white dwarfs in this cluster, for which an age of 500 million years has been sug- gested. 24 variables in M 37 have been cataloged recently by Korean as- tronomers among 12,000 fi eld stars down to 22 nd magnitude, inclu- ding seven eclipsing binaries and nine G Scuti variables (see M 44). However the latter may be background objects. The distance from us is at least 4500 light-years; some recent stu- dies suggest even 6700 light-years. If the latter were true, M 37 would be much further away than M 36, which, however, is commonly be- lieved to be a true, close neighbor in space. Based on a 4500 light- year distance, M 37 still has a very respectable physical diameter of 33 light-years. Observation Naked-eye visibility of M 37 re- quires very good observing condi- tions. In 10×50 binoculars, the visual impression remains that of a nebula, only the two brightest stars can be glimpsed. It takes 70mm binoculars or a 2-inch telescope with a power of 30× to resolve the cluster into individual stars. 2 to 4 inches of aperture show 40 to 50 stars, arranged in small groups of two or three. M 37 gives a noticeably more concentrated impression than M 36 or M 38. A 4.7-inch telescope shows the brigh- test cluster star distinctly orange, against a background of about 100 stars. Larger telescopes bring out the triangular shape of the central cluster region, which has a size of about 16', its tip pointing east. A dark lane appears to separate this tip from the rest of the cluster. A 25' spherical halo of fainter stars surrounds the bright central region."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"165 M 37 is one of the richest star clusters in the Messier catalog.

On the 25 th of September 1764, Messier noted: “Cluster of faint stars, at small distance from the two previous clusters [M 36 and M 37], this one is of a squared shape and does not contain nebulosity, if examined with care in a good instru- ment. Its extent is about 15'. Admiral Smyth saw “an oblique cross, with a pair of large stars in each arm, and a conspicuous single one at the center,” while John Herschel noticed the “irregular fi gure” and wrote: “large and small stars, very rich.” Leo Brenner’s description comes astonishingly close to that of Messier: “In one fi eld of view with NGC 1907, 15' diameter, of irregular, rather squared shape, with bright central star, very large and rich, consists of many bright and fainter stars.” Astrophysics Until recently, it was assumed that M 38 would have a distance of 4200 light-years, like M 36, and be its close neighbor in space, only 150 light-years away. While the interstellar extinction for both clu- sters is indeed about the same, around 1 magnitude, recent studies have nevertheless corrected the distance of M 38 downwards to 3500 light-years. The true diameter then becomes 15 light-years. The brightest cluster star (magnitude 7.9) is a G0 giant with 900 times the solar luminosity. If the Sun was placed next to this giant in M 38, it would be seen only as a faint 14 th -magnitude star. The G0 giant already burned all the hydrogen in its core into helium, while it was a main sequence star, and it is now burning the helium to carbon. From this, a cluster age of 150 to 200 million years can be derived. The very compact and small open cluster NGC 1907 is only 30' southwest of M 38. Most sources have suggested a distance similar to that of M 38, which would make these two clusters close neighbors, with perhaps as little as a 30-light-year separation in space. Some authors have also suggested similar ages for these two clusters. But according to the most recent studies, NGC 1907 seems to lie 1000 light-years further away than M 38, closer to M 36 and M 37. Fur- thermore, this little cluster is about twice as old as M 38. At a 4300 light-year distance, its physical size is only 5 light-years, and its brightest star is magnitude 10.5. Observation Like the other Messier clusters in Au- riga, M 39 requires the ideal condi- tions of a clear mountain night to be spotted with the naked eye. 10×50 binoculars show a nebulous patch with glimpses of the fi rst individual stars. Full resolution of this open cluster is achieved with a 2.5-inch refractor. A 4.7-inch telescope shows a beautiful, rich cluster. Its brightest stars are arranged in the shape of a Greek Y , but they may also give the impression of Smyth’s cross. To perceive the yellowish color of the brightest star at the northeastern edge of the cluster and of seve- ral other cluster stars, larger apertures are required. Nearby NGC 1907 appears as a little nebulous but granulated cloud with a 4.7-inch telescope; a few stars can be glimpsed. An aperture of 14 inches resolves this cluster into a dense swarm of 11 th - to 13 th - magnitude stars at high magnifi cation, while low power still shows a nebula. There are two bright stars immediately south of it. NGC 1907 is only 5' across and has a total brightness of magnitude 8.2, but it may well be the most beautiful cluster of its constellation."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"167 M 38 (above) is accompanied by NGC 1907 – it remains unclear whether these star clusters form a physical pair.

However, without an exact position and with the rich Milky Way all around M 39, we may seriously doubt that he referred speci- fi cally to this cluster. Nor was M 39 discovered, as often stated, by le Gentil. In his own words, he wrote about his observation: “At the tip of the tail of Cygnus. It appears to be of a nature different from all nebulae observed so far and to the Milky Way, across which it lies, making a right angle with it. It is a large cloud, wider on one end than the other, the smaller end facing southeast. The cloud is about 6° away from the tail of the Swan, it appears opaque and very dark; it can be seen without a telescope.” This may be the fi rst mentio- ning of the longish dark nebula directly beside M 39, the “Dark Ci- gar” B 168, one of the most obvious dark nebulae of the Milky Way. Consequently, it was Charles Messier who fi nally discovered M 39 on the 24 th of October 1764. He wrote: “Cluster of stars near the tail of the Swan, 1° diameter.” Later observers weren’t very impressed with Messier’s fi nd: John Herschel called it “very coarsely scattered,” Smyth noted “rather splashy fi eld of stars” and Lord Rosse observed “little concentration.” Astrophysics According to McNamara and San- ders, the galactic open cluster M 39 has only 30 real member stars in the brightness range of 6.8 to 10.0 magnitude, which stand in front of a rich Milky Way back- ground. Hence, 10% to 20% of the stars in the fi eld of M 39 and brighter than 10 th magnitude do not physically belong to the cluster. To about 11 th magnitude, non-member stars make 80% of the total, and to 12 th magnitude this fi gure becomes 90%. In 1987, Zelwanowa identifi ed 37 additional cluster members in an extended fi eld around M 39 of 5° diameter. In a fi eld of 2° by 2°, Platais found 60 stars down to magnitude 16 with a suggested cluster membership proba- bility of more than 50%. In 2006, 228 stars in the fi eld were studied photometrically to determine variability, which was suspected for 10 stars in the sample. With its distance of 1000 light-years and diameter of 9 light-years, M 39 is one of the closest and smallest Messier clusters. Hence, the loose character of its visual impression and the large angular diameter are caused by the relative proximity of this cluster. All bright member stars are still on the main sequence, burning hydrogen in their cores. The star with the earliest spectral type is B9; it is the group’s brightest star at magnitude 6.6. Without exception, the rest of the bright stars are of the later spectral type A. This leads to an age estimate for M 39 of 240 to 280 million years. In the older literature, values for the total cluster brightness bet- ween magnitude 5.2 (Glyn Jones) and 6.0 (Gray) can be found. The commonly accepted value at present is 4.6. Only 40' northwest of M 39 is the faint open cluster Platais 1 with about 40 stars all fainter than 12 th magnitude in a fi eld with a 10' diameter. Among its members is the cepheid V1726 Cyg [Cygni], which has a period of 4.2 days and a rather small brightness change between magnitudes 8.87 and 9.06. Observation To the naked eye, M 39 appears as a brighter spot within the rich and structured Milky Way around it. The smallest optical instrument re- solves individual stars in this open cluster. The outline of the cluster is triangular in shape. With a small tele- scope, a very uneven stellar pair in the center and a curved star chain south of it are noticeable. A nice view of M 39 requires more than 1° of fi eld, which makes large telescopes unsuitable. Two double stars in M 39 are suitable objects for amateur telescopes: Double stars in M 39 Designation Magnitudes Separation P.A. h 1657 9.4/12.5 21.6\" 18° A 770 8.8/11.3 7.0\" 40° Obvious to the naked eye, but a splendid object for large binocu- lars, is the dark nebula Barnard 168, 3° east of M 39.

The Frenchman came across it on the 24 th of October 1764, while searching for one of the “nebulous” objects, which the brewer and astronomer Hevelius had reported to have seen with his very long, tubeless telescopes from Danzig (Gdansk, Poland). Although Messier was not sure he really found Hevelius’ object, and despite not seeing any nebulosity, either, he nevertheless added that stellar pair to his list. He wrote: “Two stars very near each other and very faint, they are barely distinguished with a simple refractor of 6 feet [focal length].” For a long time, M 40 was believed to be lost, until in 1966 John Mallas came up with the correct identifi cation as the double star Winnecke 4. The German astronomer Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke cataloged it in 1863 in Pulkova as his No. 4 in a list of se- ven newly discovered double stars, without knowing its identity coin- cided with M 40. He measured its separation as 49.16\", PA 88.02°. Today, we also know that M 40 it is not identical to Hevelius’ ob- ject, now known to be single star 74 UMa, which is over a 1° away: Hevelius: 12h 30min, +58° 27' Messier: 12h 22min, +58° 5' Neither of these two purely stellar objects has any nebulosity and there are no suffi ciently bright galaxies in their neighborhood. It remains a mystery as to why Hevelius should have seen a nebula there. Astrophysics M 40, or Winnecke 4, is a chance alignment of two stars which form a close, optical pair, as stated by Richard Nugent in 2002. In fact, the Hipparcos parallax measurement gives the pair of a K0 star and a G0 star a distance of 510 light-years, from which follows a spatial sepa- ration of at least 5000 AU, too much for a physical binary. Additio- nally, the observed quite large change of the position angle suggests, given this large distance, an optical pair of stars. It is well known, meanwhile, that the standard procedure of Hip- parcos parallax measurements leads to systematic errors with binari- es and other objects close to each other in the sky. This may well be the case with M 40 (see M 73): according to the spectroscopic study undertaken by Nugent, the two stars have very different distances, i.e., 1860 and 490 light-years, which clearly rules out any physical connection between them. According to more recent (1991) measurements, the position an- gle has decreased to 77°, and the separation increased to 53\", since Winnecke’s measurement. Star A (magnitude 9.0) has been cataloged as HD 238107, star B (magnitude 9.3) as HD 238108. A noteworthy object 12' west of M 40 is the 12.5-magnitude ga- laxy NGC 4290. Photos reveal a small barred spiral, whose distance to us is about 125 million light-years. Observation M 40 is well resolved in 10×50 bi- noculars, without giving any im- pression of a nebulous character. Worth mentioning for telescopes over 8 inches aperture are two background galaxies: NGC 4290, 12' west, and even fainter NGC 4284, 17' west. M 40 is not a real object but a coincidental alignment of two stars at very different distances. Dietmar Böcker.

A.A. Barnett suggested that the Milky Way near G CMa could have been referred to instead. There is proper evidence, however, for the discovery observation by Hodierna in 1654, and for the independent discoveries by Flamsteed in 1702, and by Le Gentil in 1749. Messier observed M 41 on the 16 th of January 1765, and commented: “Star cluster below Sirius, this clus- ter appears nebulous in a refractor of 1 foot, but it is only a cluster of faint stars.” This remark indicates that Messier’s refractor of 1-foot fo- cal length must have been a very simple chromatic spyglass telescope of poor quality. Much later, Webb noticed the reddish star in the cluster’s center. Otherwise, however, very little attention was given to this cluster. This also refl ects in the description given by Curtis, based on his photo- graphic images: “A large, very coarse and sparse cluster, about 25' in diameter.” Astrophysics The open cluster M 41 is dominated by several red giants of spectral types G and K, with apparent brightnesses in the magnitude range of 6.9 to 8.0. The brightest of these is a K3 giant (HD 49091) with 700 times the solar luminosity. By contrast, the brightest main sequence star in M 41 (HD 49126) has a spectral type of B8 and a slightly variable brightness of magnitude 7.2 to 7.3. Age estimates of the cluster based on this upper end of the main sequence yield 190 million years. In terms of total life span, cluster properties and dynamics suggest a life expectancy of 500 million years for M 41, before it will have disintegrated. Among the stars brighter than 12 th magnitude in the fi eld of M 41, cluster membership was confi rmed for 70 stars, leaving an equal number of fi eld stars. The bright star 12 CMa nearby, southeast of M 41, is not a cluster member. This blue giant of spectral type B 7 has a di- stance of only 670 light-years and is clearly a foreground star. Up to 80% of the cluster stars may be bound in binaries, a remar- kably large fraction. The interstellar extinction towards M 41 is only about 0.2 magnitudes, which is very low for a distance of 2300 light- years. Based on that distance and an angular size of 40', the physical diameter of the cluster is 26 light-years. An alleged physical connec- tion with Collinder 121, 4.6° southeast of M 41, does not exist, since Collinder 121, in fact, lies much further away, at a distance of 3500 light-years. Observation On dark nights, M 41 can be seen with the naked eye without diffi culty as a nebulous patch, 4° due south of Sirius. Even 3.5×15 opera glasses show the brightest stars in it, and 10×50 binoculars fully resolve this open cluster. With a telescope, the bright orange giant star in the center stands out. Closer inspection yields several more reddish stars. The strong visual impression of M 41 is lost at higher magnifi cation, which shows just a rich star fi eld.

Neither do we fi nd hints in the documents of antiquity that would suggest sightings of this nebula with the naked eye. Rather, both Ptolemy and Tycho ca- taloged, at the position of M 42, a star: T Orionis. The Frenchman Nicholas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc was the fi rst to mention this nebula in 1611. By 1609, Galileo Galilei had made a sketch of that star fi eld with his telescope. He counted 80 stars but, mysteriously, did not recognize M 42. However, an independent dis- covery was made in 1611 by Johann Baptist Cysatus. The fi rst of a large number of historic drawings of this nebula was made by Giovanni Batista Hodierna in 1654. Two years later, Christian Huygens observed M 42 and described the view with the words: “In the sword of Orion, three stars are rather close to each other. In 1656, when I observed the one of them in the middle with my telescope, twelve stars appeared. Three of them nearly touched each other [the Trapezium] and, together with four other, were shi- ning through a nebula, so that the space around them was brighter than the rest of the sky, which was perfectly clear and dark; it formed the effect of an opening in the sky, through which a brighter region became visible.” Following this fi rst mention of the Trapezium, the fourth Trape- zium star was discovered in 1673 by Picard, and confi rmed by Huy- gens in 1684. Le Gentil made a drawing in 1758 and gave the fi rst description of the nebula region named after him and the “wings” of the nebula: “It appears to have the shape of an open claw of an animal. To the west, I observed an extension of light, forming a rec- tangle: this light is very diffuse. The three stars in a straight line in the ‘lower claw’ appear entirely detached from the nebula. The four stars in the center appear extraordinarily brilliant.” Charles Messier added the already well-known Orion Nebula to his catalog with an observation made on the 4 th of March 1769. Ap- parently, his motivation was to reach an even number of objects, and to match or perhaps surpass the catalog of 42 objects of Lacaille from the year 1755. His drawing shows, apart from the four Trapezium stars and the three T 2 stars, further faint stars. In 1774, studying M 42 was the fi rst observing object for William Herschel with a home-made 6-inch refl ector. Later, in 1789, he descri- bed it as “an unformed fi ery mist, the chaotic material of future Suns” – hardly could this great observer have found better words! Johann Hieronymus Schröter studied the Orion Nebula for many years, using a large mirror made for him by Herschel, and he believed that he saw changes. In 1797 he found a “new, bright but very dull band of light” across the dark bay in the central region of the nebula, which would later receive his name. John Herschel, too, devoted a lot of attention to M 42. He made drawings of it in 1826 and 1837, to see if he could fi nd any variabi- lity. With 18 inches of aperture, he described the appearance of the central nebular masses as “a curdling liquid or surface strewn with fl ocks of wool – or like the breaking up of a mackerel sky. Not very unlike the mottling of the Sun’s disk, only coarser and the fl occuli not round but wisps.” Lassell formulated his impressions in a similar way: “large heaps of cotton-wool packed one behind another, the edges pulled out so as to be a bit transparent.” With a 48-inch telescope on the Mediterranean island of Malta he cataloged many stars in the central region and characterized the nebula as “of pea-green color.” Otto Struve, despite observing from Pulkovo near St. Petersburg, where M 42 never gets higher than 25° above the southern horizon, found numerous variable stars in it. D’Arrest, too, made accurate dra- wings of the Orion Nebula and was the fi rst to discover the wisps of nebulosity which reach from the three T 2 stars southward. The most impressive drawing, however, was the work of George P. Bond in the years 1857 to 1865. With an enormous effort and using a 15-inch re- fractor, he sketched the nebula and measured 1100 stars. Later, Holden tried visual photometry with 26-inch aperture and used an eyepiece- micrometer in order to fi nd variability in the nebular structure – in vain. These efforts became pointless, when Draper presented his fi rst good photograph of the Orion Nebula in 1882. Visual observers had also turned their attention to the Trapezium. In 1826, Wilhelm Struve found its E-component with the 9-inch re- fractor of Dorpat, John Herschel the F-component in 1830 with 12 inches. Earlier observers had made the mistake of using magnifi ca- tions that were too low and so missed out on these faint stars of only 11 th magnitude. Some later observers, i.e., Porro, Secchi, and South, even believed they saw up to six more stars, but Burnham proved them wrong in 1888. In that year, the powerful 36-inch Lick refrac- tor allowed new, faint stars to be discovered in the Trapezium: com- ponent G by the telescope builder A.G.

Using spectroscopy in 1865, Huggins could show that M 42 was made of glowing gas. In 1880, he further demonstrated that the Trapezium did indeed have a physical connection with the gas masses. Finally, in 1931 Trümpler found the large, hidden cluster of young stars around the Trapezium on deep infrared photographs. Astrophysics M 42 is the prototype of a galactic nebula and continues to fascinate as- tronomers – regardless of whether it is observed with a pair of binoculars or with the Hubble Space Telescope. It offers us a view into the glow- ing cavity of a large molecular cloud, in which stars have just been formed and have started to rid themselves of their surrounding cocoon of dust. Since this is happening at a distance of only 1300 light-years, we have an excellent op- portunity to study all aspects of star formation in detail. M 42 is only the brightest part of the facing side of a much larger (10°), dark cloud: OMC-1, which consists of mostly cool dust and gas. It comprises M 78, NGC 1973/75/77 and the famous Horsehead Nebula. In contrast to those objects, an extremely young (only 10,000 to 100,000 ye- ars) star cluster is emerging from M 42. Most of these cluster stars are still enshrouded in the sur- rounding dust and gas masses of their birthplace.

The Trapezium cluster, mostly consisting of stars with a half to two solar masses, has a spectacular star density of 6000 stars per cu- bic light-year, which makes it the richest open cluster we know. Ho- wever, in visual light, an extinction of about 10 magnitudes makes most of these stars invisible. Only 300 cluster members brighter than 17 th magnitude can be found within a radius of 3'. Many of these very young stars have not yet reached the main sequence but are still in the process of contraction and mass accreti- on. Hubble images have shown that their planetary systems are still forming: many stars are surrounded by proto-planetary disks (“pro- plyds”). Many of these proplyds around low-mass stars will however be destroyed by the intense radiation of the more massive and faster- forming stars around them. Northwest of the Trapezium, several young stars have been de- tected in the Becklin-Neugebauer and Kleinman-Low cloud complex, which are fully hidden in the molecular cloud in the background. Most recent studies indicate that one star in the Becklin-Neugebauer cloud has actually been ejected from a close binary in the Trapezium and could be the youngest known “runaway star.” Its former primary appears to be the brightest Trapezium star ( T 1 Orionis C).

UV Ceti variables are fl are stars, which can undergo brightness changes of several magnitudes within minutes. The most extreme of its kind is AF Orionis, a rather faint star found by Otto Struve in John Herschel’s notes. It has, for this reason, been named “Herschel’s variable.” At maximum light, AF Orionis is one of the brightest stars in the central region of M 42, but at minimum it cannot be visually sighted in even the lar- gest telescopes. Some of the Trapezium stars are variable themselves. T 1 Orionis C, the brightest of them at magnitude 5.1 and about 45 solar masses, largely powers the ionization of the surroun- ding gas by its intense radiation and varies irregularly by about 0.3 magnitudes. By con- trast, T 1 Orionis A (V 1016) is an eclipsing va- riable with a long period of 65.43 days and an eclipse duration of less than a day. These two variables were discovered only in 1975 by the Hamburg Observatory (Germany) astronomer Eckmar Lohsen. Another eclipsing variable, known longer, is the faintest (magnitude 7.95) of the four Trapezium stars, T 1 Orionis B, or BM Orionis. It has a period of 6.47 days and an eclipse am- plitude of 0.6 magnitudes. Its eclipses last 18 hours, of which totality lasts 6 hours. Only T 1 Orionis D has no proven variability, yet. The projected distances between the Trape- zium stars are only 0.3 light-years, while the bright inner region of the nebula measures about 2 light-years. That size is more compara- ble to a planetary nebula than an open cluster. But the entire nebulous complex of M 42, 66' by 60' size, has a more respectable physical diameter of 35 light-years. Observation The Orion Nebula is re- garded as synonymous with cosmic beauty. It offers a variety of shape, color and intensity beyond description – as Heinrich d’Arrest no- ted: “Circumsitae nebulae descriptio res deo improba.” Consequently, the following lines cannot give a complete description of this wonderful region of the night sky, but are me- ant to select some of its highlights. To the naked eye, M 42 appears as an in- distinct spot in the middle of Orion’s sword. The unaided eye cannot distinguish the nebula from the multiple star T Ori, but already opera glasses achieve that with ease. The magnitude 2.8 star T Ori, not far south, adds further gla- mor to this region. 10×50 binoculars resolve T Ori into four stars: component T 1 in the center of the nebula, and three stars in one line (magnitudes 5.1, 6.4, 8.2) forming T 2 Orionis. In 10×70 glasses, the “wings” of the Orion Nebula and the full splen- dour of the nebula can be grasped. Furthermore, there is a dark bay entering the central region of M 42 from the northeast, the “Sinus M 42, drawing, total view. 4.7-inch refractor. Ronald Stoyan."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"180 Magnus.” The total visual extent of the nebula in binoculars reaches 45'×30'. The Trapezium can be resolved into four stars by a 2-inch refrac- tor. Its visual impression can be noticeably different when one or both of its variable components A and B are at their minimum. The two additional components E and F of 11 th magnitude are within reach of a 4-inch refractor, but require magnifi cations over 150×. An extreme challenge for visual observers, even with very large telescopes, are the innermost components G and X, and the pair H. No sightings have been reported since Barnard’s time. The bright and sharply defi ned central nebula around the Trape- zium is called the “Huygens region,” seen well even with 2 inches of aperture. Its southeastern edge is formed by the 3.7'-long “Frons” (PA 50°), and the shorter southwest edge by the “Occiput” (PA 130°). These edges meet to form a well-defi ned right angle, 2' south of the Trapezium. A 4.7-inch telescope resolves the Frons into small, bright islands, and in the southern part of the Huygens region, it shows two dark channels that cross each other. The brightest part of the nebula lies 40\" southwest of the Trapezium, along the western side of the northbound canal. A 14-inch telescope resolves a snail-like struc- ture here. Another bright part of the nebula lies 50\" northeast of the Trapezium, near the edge of Sinus Magnus. Some small dark patches appear here – vaguely seen with 4.7 inches of aperture, better with 14 inches. The largest of these, near the northern edge of the Huygens region, has been named “Lacus Secchii.” The dark bay of Sinus Magnus is about 3' long in PA 80° and 1' wide. There is a fi ne bridge of nebulosity (“Pons Schröteri”) crossing perpendicularly, 42\" before the end of the bay. There, a 4.7-inch te- lescope begins to show faint “islands,” better seen with a 14-inch. Some nebulosity intrudes down from the north, near the tip of Sinus Magnus, much like a cape on a coastline. The three stars of T 2 Orionis line up side-by-side with Sinus Magnus, south of it. Of the three wisps of nebulosity here, found by d’Arrest, only the westernmost can be seen with certainty in a 4.7-inch refractor; the other two remain uncertain even with 14 in- ches of aperture. The eastern outskirts of M 42 are dominated by a long, thin wing that aims southeast and originates near Sinus Magnus. It can even be made out in a 2-inch refractor, and it is a well-defi ned feature with a 4.7-inch telescope. Its width varies from only 50\" in the bright nort- hern part to 70\" in the fainter southern extension. The brightest part of that wing ends after 15' near a 7 th magnitude star. A faint fi lament starts here and aims at a faint stellar pair inside the nebula. 15' south of the Trapezium, next to a small group of stars, an isolated nebulous spot is found even through a 4.7-inch refractor. Another nebulous spot west of it surrounds the brighter star V372 Ori. This is a small but distinct refl ection nebula within M 42. The darker region southwest of the central nebula was described by Le Gentil over 200 years ago. Consequently, it is called “Regio Gentilii.” To the west, it is joined by brighter nebulosity, which has a lot of substructure and consists of several arms, even shown by a 4.7-inch refractor with moderate power. Numerous faint stars lie in front of this part of the nebula. With a large exit pupil (i.e., with low magnifi cation) under a dark sky, the eastern wing is seen to continue in a large loop until it merges with the southwestern part of M 42, about 30' southwest of the Trapezium. This southern loop is faintest north of the star L Ori- onis, but it can be seen in full even with a 4.7-inch refractor. If the loop, M 43 and some nebulous islands north of it are included, then the total visual extent of M 42 reaches 48'×45'. Different stuctures within the nebula can be emphasized by the use of narrowband H E and [OIII] line fi lters, depending on the particular physical conditions that favor either the one or the other type of line emission. For example, the main strand of the eastern wing appears even brighter in [OIII], while H E brings out a faint strand parallel to it. The complex structure of the western part of the nebula gains in H E\u000f too, while low power and an [OIII] fi lter show more of the bubble character of the outermost regions of M 42. The Great Orion Nebula is bright enough to offer real color percep- tion to the visual observer. A moderate telescope may already show the Huygens region as greenish, caused by its [OIII] emission. With larger apertures, any color perception becomes more distinct but, de- pending on the observer, it may vary from plain green over turquoise to even a pale blue. From 12 inches upward, the edge of the Frons has a red glow, or – by mixture with green – bright orange. A 20-inch M 42, historical drawing.

In fact, the perception of H D light depends on both the large exit pupil and suf- fi cient magnifi cation that only a large aperture can provide. With 14 inches, only the brightest parts of M 42 are visible in H D . Small telescopes do not show any stars in the central part of M 42, with the obvious exception of the Trapezium. The diffi culty in observing stars in the Orion Nebula comes from the bright back- ground light. Hence, a 14-inch telescope with a limiting magnitude of normally 16.5 reaches only magnitude 13.5 in the Huygens region. An orange fi lter helps, because its absorption properties cut out the strong emission of [OIII] and H E lines. CCD detectors have the advan- tage of an extended infrared sensitivity and they see less extinction in the nebula. Therefore, moderately deep CCD exposures may give more of a star-cluster impression. The easiest stellar targets are cataloged as variables. Fainter stars are listed by their numbers in the G.P. Bond catalog. MR Orionis, for example, is a borderline object for a 4-inch telescope, followed by MT Orionis and Bond 671 for 6 to 8 inches of aperture. With an orange fi lter, a 14-inch telescope, and a lot of patience, Andreas Alzner was able to detect 15 stars in the Huygens region, the Trapezium exclu- ded. A peculiar visual effect allows faint stars to be glimpsed at 80×, yet they remain invisible at higher magnifi cations, until really high powers of 300× to 500× are reached.

In 1733, Jean-Jaques Dortous de Mairan was the fi rst to notice the apparently separate nebula. He wrote: “Brightness around a star, similar to the atmosphere of our Sun, if it was dense and extended enough to be visible in telescopes from such a distance.” The French- man was wrong about this comparison, but his thoughts refl ected the ideas of his time concerning the formation of the Solar System. Messier added M 43 to his catalog on the 4 th of March 1769, the same day as the Orion Nebula. He characterized M 43 as “a small star, which is surrounded by nebulosity.” Later, in 1771, Messier included it in his drawing of the Orion Nebula. In 1783, William Herschel de- scribed M 43 as a “circular glory of whitish nebulosity, faintly joined to the great nebula.” From later observations, however, he believed that the central star in M 43 was instead located behind the nebula, shining though it like the moon through thin clouds. His son John was the fi rst to recognize the “tail” of the nebula towards the north, and he also saw a dark division cutting into the nebula. Lord Rosse believed that he saw a nebula with spiral structure around the star. Secchi agreed to that and likened the general shape to a mirror-image of a comma. In the 1870s, Holden observed small dark dots to both sides of the “central star.” By that time, de Mairan’s nebula was long considered an integral part of the M 42 complex. Astrophysics M 43 is physically a part of the Great Orion Nebula, M 42. This nebula appears to be a separate object only by virtue of the dark dust clouds in front of the complex. It is illuminated and ionized by the hot and young variable NU Orionis, which has not yet reached the main sequence and has a spectral type of O7. It varies irregularly between magnitudes 6.5 and 7.6. In 2001, O'Dell discovered two “proplyds,” proto-planetary disks, in M 43. These are dusty disks around young stars in which planetary systems can form. In the whole of the Orion region, about 50 of these objects have been found. Deep infrared images reveal that the Trapezium Cluster in the cen- ter of M 42 reaches to the southwestern side of M 43. The physical size of M 43 is 3 by 2 light-years, if the extensions to the north and west are discounted. Observation M 43 can be seen with 10×50 bino- culars as a pale patch around its 7 th - magnitude “central star.” It is separated from M 42 by a stretch of dar- kness, about 3' wide. The comma-shape described by Secchi appears even in small telescopes. With a 4.7-inch refractor, dark markings that cut in from the east become vaguely visible. A 14-inch telescope shows M 43 as a bright nebula with at least three noticeable, dark bays in its eastern side. The comma-shaped northern part is separated from the main nebula by a darker region west of the central star, lea- ding south. There are three faint stars, one in that darker region, one at the northern tip of the “comma,” and one at the southern edge of M 43. Color photographs show the visually bright regions as green, indicating [OIII] emission, and the fainter areas as red H E\u0003 emission. The use of an H E line fi lter noticeably reduces the contrast between the dark bays and the “comma.” East of M 43 is a dark canal, beyond which distinct nebulosity can be seen in a narrowband fi lter. The total visual extent of M 43 reaches 6'×3.5' in a 14-inch telescope. Closer inspection at low power reveals extensions reaching 6' further north and 3.5' east. Seventeen variables can be found in and around M 43. These include the bright “central star” NU Orionis (magnitude 6.8 to 6.9); the much fainter but strongly variable MS Orionis (magnitude 13.8 to16.6) and MU Orionis (magnitude 13.8 to15.8), both directly west of M 43; and NQ Orionis (magnitude 12.1- 14.1), 1.5' northwest of NU Orionis."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"184 M 44 The Beehive Cluster or Praesepe Degree of diffi culty 1 (of 5) Minimum aperture Naked eye Designation  NGC 2632 Type  Open  cluster Class  II2r Distance 610 ly (K2005) 610 ly (proper motion, 2002), 560 ly (proper motion, 2000) Size  15  ly Constellation Cancer R.A. 8 h 40.1 min Decl.  +19°  59' Magnitude  3.1 Surface brightness – Apparent diameter 1.2° Discoverer – History The open cluster M 44 has been known since clas- sical times.

It refers to the crib of the two donkeys, which are represented by the stars Asellus Borealis and Asellus Australis (northern and southern donkey) to either side of Praesepe. These donkeys belonged to the Greek gods Dionysus and Silenus, who were riding on them while going into battle against the giants. The animals frightened the giants so much that, against all odds, the two gods were able to win. The fi rst mentioning of the Praesepe dates back to Aratus in the year 260 BC. He characterized this patch of light in the constellation Cancer as a “small nebula.” In 130 BC, Hipparcos spoke of the “small cloud.” Furthermore, the Praesepe is one of the nebulous objects in the Almagest. In general, in antiquity, “nebulosa” meant M 44 as the only known object of its kind, from which the word \"nebula\" was coined, as used by Messier and others. The true nature of M 44, ho- wever, remained unknown to ancient scholars. This nebula was fi rst resolved by Galileo in 1609 during his initial telescopic observation of M 44: “The so-called nebula Praesepe is not a single star but consists of a mass of more than 40 stars.” Most later astronomers, however, gave little attention to this star cluster, and so we fi nd only a few historic descriptions of it. Webb noticed “two triangles” near the center, and remarked “full of fi ne combinations.” Brenner, about 100 years ago, summarized his observations nicely: “Already the naked eye recognizes this object as a star cluster, while a telescope cannot grasp the whole object even in its weakest magni- fi cation. As the stars lie far from each other, this group looks like an ordinary rich star fi eld with colored stars.” Astrophysics With a distance of only 610 light- years, the Beehive Cluster is one of the nearest open clusters, as seen from Earth. The brightest cluster star is H Cancri (magnitude 6.3), which shows in its spectrum unusu- ally strong lines of heavy elements. More than 200 stars have been attributed to M 44, of which 24 are brighter than magnitude 8.0. A study of 280,000 stars in a fi eld around M 44 of 10° by 10°, publis- hed in 2001, revealed about 1000 possible cluster members, which would span a total cluster size of 100 light-years. Altogether, 630 solar masses are attributed to M 44. The bright central region of M 44, however, measures only 6 light- years. If the outer regions of the visible cluster are included, which cover about 1.2° in the sky, then the physical diameter is 15 light- years. Hence, M 44 compares well with the Pleiades in physical size. Various authors have given somewhat different Trümpler classifi ca- tions for the Beehive Cluster as I2r, II2m, or II2r. There is an unusually large number of variables in M 44; about 100 are known. Among these are G Scuti stars of spectral type A, which have very recently left the main sequence in the HR diagram. They are now on their way to the giant branch. Three of the brightest cluster stars have already made it to giants and stand out in color photos for their reddish tint. TX Cancri, fi nally, is a fast eclipsing va- riable with a period of only 0.38 days and brightness changes between magnitudes 10.0 and 10.4. Matching stellar evolution models for the brighter cluster stars suggests an age of 500 to 700 million years. This is very much the same as the age of the even closer Hyades (Melotte 25) in Taurus.

Both are remnants of a long-disinte- grated OB-association, which has by now made three orbits around the galactic center. Today, the separation between M 44 and the Hyades has grown to 500 light-years. In 2000, Holland et al. presented evidence from a spectro- scopic study that M 44 is merging with a small sub-cluster of 30 stars, which they discovered only 10 light-years away from the center of M 44. The mixed cluster dynamics, which result from the present merging process, may trigger the dis- integration of M 44 in the ‘astronomically’ near future. Observation Under normal circum- stances, the Beehive is ea- sily seen with the naked eye as a full-moon-sized nebula. A popular saying goes that not seeing M 44 would be a sign of bad weather approaching. Indeed, it takes signifi cant cir- rus cloud cover, as within half a day before an approaching warm front, not to see M 44. It is, in fact, easier to see than the central part of the Andromeda Galaxy. Hence, to miss Praesepe, the limiting magnitude must drop below 5 th ma- gnitude, such as under a very polluted city sky or in a night lit by the full moon. Several keen observers have reported naked-eye visibility of individual stars in M 44. This does not seem impossible, given a dark sky, since the three brightest cluster stars are brighter than magnitude 6.5. O’Meara has claimed to have spotted even a dozen Praesepe stars in a clear, dark moun- tain sky. In any case, the brightest 20 stars, which are organized in a peculiar pattern, are even visible through opera glasses. However, the most beautiful impression of the cluster is given by large binoculars, through which the brightest stars sparkle against a backdrop of fainter suns. However, it only takes smaller binoculars to see a number of double stars in M 44, as well as the brighter cluster stars form several triangles. In large telescopes, about 10 faint background galaxies can be observed between the bright stars of M 44. The fi ve NGC objects 2624, 2625, 2637, 2643, and 2647 were disco- vered by Albert Marth on the 19 th of October 1864, using a 48-inch refl ector. However, a quarter of that aperture would be suffi cient to see them. Furthermore, CGCG 89-56 is a tiny double galaxy which may be in reach of a 20-inch telescope. UGC 4526 is a nice edge-on galaxy apparent on deep pho- tographs of the cluster. The brightest stars in M 44 Designation R.A. Decl. Mag.

Obviously, he wanted to publish a longer list than the 42 objects of his predecessor Lacaille, and the number 45 suited Messier’s baroque sense of symmetry. He undertook an obser- vation of the Pleiades on the 4 th of March 1769, without any further description – the same night in which he added M 42, M 43, and M 44 to his list of nebulous objects for its fi rst publication. This open cluster, which appears to the naked eye as a brilliant object, is part of the folklore and myths of many cultures. The name Pleiades is of Greek origin and means the daughters of Atlas and Plei- one: Alcyone, Asterope, Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta, and Celaeno. While this list makes 9 altogether, only 6 to 8 stars are easily visible. For a long time, that promoted the idea of a “lost Pleiad.” In the end, the “Seven Sisters” or “Seven Stars” prevailed. The names coming from other cultures ring a bell, too: the Japanese name “Subaru” is used by a car company, which even shows the Pleiades in their emblem; and the Persian Queen Soraya bears their name. In large parts of medieval Europe, the image of a hen with its chicks was quite common. Early descriptions date back to Mesopotamian mythology of about 2500 BC. Only recently discovered was the now very famous ancient image of the Pleiades on the Nebra skydisk from Germany, which is believed to have been made about 1600 BC. About 4000 years ago, the Pleiades marked the intersection between the ecliptic and the celestial equator, and thus served as a very important benchmark for calibrating ancient calendars. In particular, conjunctions with the young moon were observed to recalculate annual lunar and solar cycles. Homer mentions the Pleiades in his Odyssey, and it features in the Bible in three places in the Old Testament. The Greeks Eudoxus and Aratus regarded the prominent cluster as a small constellation of its own. More than the well-known six or seven stars were fi rst mentioned by the keen-eyed Mästlin, teacher to Kepler, who sketched 11 stars in 1579. With the invention of the telescope, this number jumped upwards: Galileo counted 36 stars, Hooke saw 78, and Wolf, about hundred years ago, fi nally found about 500 on photographs down to 14 th magnitude. The Sicilian observer Giovanni Batista Hodierna supplied the fi rst astronomical description of the cluster in 1654: “the fi rst and most bril- liant of all star groupings; six or seven stars stand out from the rest,” and he counted 37 stars. In 1767, John Mitchell calculated the proba- bility of any purely chance alignment of such a group of stars as 1 in 496,000. This strongly supported the understanding that star clusters are real, physical entities. In 1846, Heinrich Mädler interpreted precise positional measure- ments and proper motions in support of the physical nature of this star cluster, but he also came up with the bizarre idea that Alcyone would be the center of gravity of the universe. Wilhelm Tempel turned more attention towards M 45 when, on the 19 th of October 1859, he disco- vered a nebula (NGC 1435) around Merope with just 4 inches of aper- ture. Appropriately, he described it “like the breath on a mirror.” A long M 45. IC 349, Barnard’s Merope Nebula, is only 30\" from the bright star.

This was fi nally ended by the photographs of the brot- hers Henry, who also found the nebula around Maia (NGC 1432). With further, deeper photos, the Henrys could later, in 1888, show the full complexity of the Pleiades nebulosity. In 1890, using the 36-inch Lick observatory refractor visually, Edward Emerson Barnard recognized an additional, very small nebula very close to Merope (IC 349). Astrophysics With a distance of only 425 light- years, the Pleiades is one of the very nearest open clusters, considerably nearer than the Beehive Clus- ter. This is why M 45 can be observed so well from Earth. In a fi eld of 2° by 2°, 500 stars have been counted, of which 197 are regarded to be true cluster members. In addition, there are 135 possible cluster stars in a fi eld of 9° by 9°, which would bring the cluster diameter from 15 to 70 light-years. The innermost region, as covered by the 6 to 8 Pleiades stars visible to most naked eye observers, measures only 7 light-years. M 45 is regarded as the “Rosetta Stone” for a calibration of the astronomical distance scale, in which open clusters play a very im- portant role. Earlier, indirect methods suggested a distance to the Pleiades of 500 light-years, until the Hipparcos satellite provided di- rect parallax measurements, from which a mean cluster distance of 390 light-years was derived. Most recently, several independent stu- dies have suggested corrections, and the presently accepted value is a Pleiades distance of 425 light-years. Those 6 to 8 bright blue cluster stars visible to the naked eye are young main-sequence stars with several solar masses. The mass of the entire Pleiades cluster has been quoted as 800 solar masses. In 1993, a cluster age of 100 million years was derived by fi tting the group to stellar evolution models. Glyn Jones gave the Pleiades a further life span of 250 million years, before it would disintegrate under the external gravitational strain. The small number of white dwarfs in M 45 comes as a bit of a surprise; only one of the few found in this fi eld really belongs to the cluster, while evolution models predict a larger number.

Indeed, binaries make up about 70% of the cluster stars. Popular with modern studies are brown dwarfs: star-like, cool objects with a mass too low to ever start hydrogen burning (i.e., under 0.08 solar masses). In M 45, brown dwarfs with only 0.028 so- lar masses have been found. The- se objects gain the little energy required for their faint red glow by slow contraction, which con- verts potential energy into heat and radiation. With 1000 times the solar lu- minosity, by contrast, Alcyone is the brightest star of the Pleiades. To its west, it is accompanied by three stars and is regarded as a multiple system. Maia is the third brightest star and was suspected by Otto Struve of some small-am- plitude variability on a time scale of hours. He even suggested that Maia could be the prototype of a new class of variables – however, modern observations have not shown any variability at all. Pleione is certainly variable, with brightness changes between magnitudes 4.77 and 5.50. Like a number of other Pleiades stars, it is rotating very quickly. Three times since 1888, Pleione under- went phases during which it for- med a thin circumstellar shell, as spectroscopic observations re- vealed. Between 1938 and 1952, as well as between 1972 and 1987, the star’s brightness fi rst rose above and then later fell below the normal level. It is still unclear whether at the end of those phases the shells were lost or rather fell back into the star. Pleione may have an unresolved companion with an orbital period of 35 years. 22 Tau 21 Tau 19 Tau Ced 19e Ced 19c 16 Tau 17 Tau vdB 20 23 Tau NGC 1435 6 450 0 Ce d NGC 1432 20 Tau u Ced 19h vdB 23 K Tau 27 Tau 28 Tau 26 Tau 2 20 Tau HD 23629 HD E 536 18 Tau 22 Tau 21 Tau 19 Tau 20 Tau NGC 1432 16 Tau 17 Tau E 536 23 Tau NGC 1435 6 450 HD 23629 629 K Tau 28 Tau 27 Tau 26 Tau HD 23923 HD 23753 O 6 64 6 449 vdB 23 1 vdB 20 IC 349 9 essier2.indb 190 messier2.indb 190"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"191 Furthermore, the Pleiades host a large number of faint fl are stars, which can change their brightness within mi- nutes.

In 2003, the magnitude 6.9 star HD 23642 was found to be an eclipsing variable, and HD 23628 is a recently discovered G\u0003 Scuti variable. The dusty refl ection nebulae around the Pleiades are not, as often quoted earlier, the remnants of the cloud in which this cluster formed.

Small grains are blown away; larger ones are only defl ected in their motion. The large-scale linear structure of the nebulous veil, however, is sculpted by magnetic fi elds. Observation The Pleiades are the most impressive star cluster for naked eye observations. Generally, six bright stars are seen. Under good conditions, three more stars can be perceived: Pleione, Celaeno, and Asterope – raising the total number to nine. Under superb alpine skies, the author has seen 10 stars with certainty, and some observers have reported a naked-eye visibility of up to even 18 stars! The main diffi culty is not the brightness of the cluster stars, but the ability to distinguish them from each other. Some observers have used some simple means to cover Alcyone or other bright stars. With this, even a naked-eye visibility of the Merope Nebula has been claimed, but there is hardly any credible confi rmation. A pair of binoculars is the ideal optical instrument to ob- serve the Pleiades, which are shown with an impressive brilli- ance. Atlas and his wife Pleione follow their seven blue-white daughters at a little distance, 30 fainter stars make a nice background. Under a dark, clear sky, the Merope Nebula (NGC 1435, south of Merope) and the stars 3' northwest of Alcyone are visible with 10×50 binoculars. A telescope resolves a number of interesting double stars; some of them require high magnifi cations. The easy pair Burnham 536 in the cluster center is of special interest: north of the northwestern compo- nent is a faint (12 th -magnitude) companion star.

NGC 1435 appears triangular in shape, pointing southwest from Merope, and is about 20' long. Directly east of the star, close inspection reveals a brighter edge with a hint of fringed structure. However, NGC 1432 near Maia remains a very diffi cult object to observe. With a 14-inch telescope, use of modest magnifi cation under a clear, dark sky transforms the Pleiades into a fi ne-structured region of nebulosity. Patient observers may even fi nd the various streaks not too diffi cult to perceive – this is particularly true for NGC 1435 (Ced 19j-k), south of Merope. The triangular nebula has a visual extent of 12'×15'×17'. Its northeastern edge is brightest and sharply defi ned, hinting at the fi lamentary structure revealed by deep photographic exposures. 3' northeast of Merope, a 7'-long but merely 30\"-thin fi la- ment is seen as the easiest part of the Pleiades nebula; it crosses two 12 th -magnitude stars. A diffuse, nearly round nebula lies 10' west of Alcyone (vdB 23, Ced 19l). There are some very diffi cult, diffuse wisps of nebulosity, west and north of it. Impressive, though very faint, is a 15'-long, about 1'-wide stretch of nebulosity (vdB 20, Ced 19d), which reaches from the center of the Pleiades to Electra, aiming slightly to the south of that star. There is a hint of an even fainter wisp parallel to Ced 19d, 3' south of it. Bright by comparison is the Maia Nebula NGC 1432 (Ced 19f). Its most distinct part is a triangle 1.5' west of Maia. From it, six nebulous extensions stretch to all sides. The two aiming west (Ced 19c and 19e) merge to form a diffuse curtain near Taygeta and Celaeno. To the north, Astero- pe is reached by faint Ced 19h. Pleione and Atlas, by contrast, appear to be clear of nebulosity. The most challenging nebulous object in the Pleiades is Barnard’s IC 349 only 36\" south of Merope. It takes magnifi cations of over 400× and excellent seeing to distinguish this small object from the bright star. If Merope is covered by a thin wire or thread, mounted in the focal plane of the eyepiece, IC 349 may even be visible with a 12-inch telescope. M 45, historical drawing.

He described this ob- ject as “cluster of very small stars, the stars are not visible except in a good refractor, the cluster contains a bit of nebulosity.” In 1786, William Herschel found the planetary nebula NGC 2438 in this cluster. His son John later described the view: “A very fi ne rich cluster which fi lls the fi eld. Within the cluster at its northern edge is a fi ne plane- tary nebula.” He characterized the latter as “exactly round, of a faint equable light. Has a very minute star north of center. It is not brighter to the middle nor fading away, but a little velvety at the edges.” Leo Brenner recommended M 46 to amateur observers, about 100 years ago, with the words: “Splendid object, even for smaller tele- scopes. 30' diameter, very rich and bright. Stars of 10m and lower. The cluster contains a planetary or ring-shaped nebula of 3.75' diameter and of considerable brightness.” Curtis, based on the photographic images, gave a characteriza- tion of M 46 which does not quite agree with its visual appearance: “a very large, bright, sparse cluster about 25' in diameter, in which is involved the planetary nebula 2438.” Astrophysics M 46 and M 47 form a very ap- pealing cluster pair in the winter sky. In real space, though, they are by no means close. Rather, M 46 is supposed to be two to three times farther away than M 47. M 46 has a position 400 light-years above the galactic plane and is among the richest Messier clusters. There are 186 stars brighter than 13 th ma- gnitude, and in total probably even 500 member stars. The brightest star in M 46 has magnitude 8.7 and spectral type A2. In addition, the cluster contains a few red giants, which help us estimate the cluster age as about 500 million years. Much younger is the planetary nebula NGC 2438, only about 45,000 years old, which is seen in the northern region of M 46. Many authors have argued that NGC 2438 is a chance-aligned foreground object, but a study from 1996 shows that it has the same radial ve- locity, about 60 km/s, as the cluster – as measured with four brighter stars – a very strong indication that the planetary nebula is a physical member of M 46, after all. The physical diameter of NGC 2438, which measures 66\" in the sky, is estimated to be one light-year. On a deep exposure, David Malin demonstrated the existence of a faint halo four times larger – a typical feature of many planetary nebulae. Apparently, the faint central star (magnitude 17.5) has already lost its radiation power and no longer ionizes the nebula. Since the visible light is generated by ongoing recombination processes, this nebula will probably become invisible in a few thousand years, after the reservoir of ionized gas has been consumed. Observation In 10×50 binoculars, M 46 appears as a full-moon-sized patch of nebu- losity, a little east of M 47. A single star in the western part can be glimpsed. The view changes a lot with a small refractor, which shows a swarm of more than 50 stars. The nice impression of the cluster is lost with larger apertures and higher powers, since the stars of M 46 are grouped loosely, wi- thout any condensation. Larger telescopes show a bright orange star just west of the brightest cluster star. From the many stellar pairs in M 46, two double stars have been cataloged: Barton 1889 (magnitu- des 11.1/11.8, PA 203°) and Barton 1891 (magnitudes 11.9/12.2, PA 2°), both with the same separation of 4.5\". The planetary nebula NGC 2438 in the northeastern part of the cluster has a magnitude of 10.8 and is visible as a diffuse ring with an 11 th magnitude star almost right in its middle in a 4.7-inch refractor. A 14-inch telescope shows the asymmetry of the ring: its fainter part points west, while the brightest bits are on its northern edge. Faint stars are visible in the dark interior of the ring and on its southeast edge. But there are no reports from visual observers of a halo, nor of the true central star.

He descri- bed his fi nd plainly as “a nebulosa between the two dogs.” Hodierna’s observations were forgotten until the booklet with his observing notes was rediscovered in 1984. Hence, Charles Messier made an independent discovery of M 47 on the 19 th of February 1771. He noted that night: “Star cluster, not far from previous [M 46]. The stars are larger; the cluster does not contain nebulosity.” In the calculation of the position, however, Mes- sier made a sign-related mistake and, consequently, M 47 became a missing object for many observers after him. Oswald Thomas fi nally identifi ed M 47 with NGC 2422 in the year 1934 – quite possibly, by some good luck. It was left to T.F. Morris in 1959 to fully resolve this case by going through Messier’s calculations and fi nding his mistake. An interesting catch is that the missing M 47, the “ghost object,” re- ceived an NGC number of its own: 2478. William Herschel did not know of all this, when he independently discovered M 47 on the 4 th of February 1785. His son John later com- mented on this cluster: “a large, pretty rich, straggling cluster.” Smyth saw “a very splendid fi eld of large and small stars, disposed somewhat in lozenge shape,” and he also noticed the brightest (7 th magnitude) cluster star with a companion at about 20\" distance. Reverend Webb commented on M 47: “grand broad group visible to naked eye, too large even for 64×.” Astrophysics The open clus ter M 47 has a visual appearance which differs strikingly from M46, its apparent neighbor in the sky, which is actually three times as distant. Hence, these two clusters are not a physical pair. M 47 hosts at least about 50 stars within an angular diameter of 30'; some sources suggest 117 members. The true diameter is rather humble, 12 to 15 light-years. The Trümpler class of M 47 differs, like those of other clusters, from author to author. II3m, I3m, and III2m have all been suggested. Wallenquist stated a mean star density of 0.2 stars per cubic light- year, which would reach 3.5 in the very center. However the cluster does not look that rich, because a large number of faint members are dominated by a few bright cluster stars, all blue giants. In this, M 47 resembles the Pleiades. The brightest star of M 47 is magnitude 5.7, which corresponds to a total luminosity of 1250 times that of the Sun. The extinction of 0.2 magnitudes, caused by interstellar dust in the line of sight towards M 47, is quite small – about 0.5 magnitudes would be normal for that distance. It remains unclear whether the two red giants in the fi eld of M 47, with about 200 solar luminosities each, are true cluster members or not. With this uncertainty, age estimates for this cluster are divided over two alternatives: around 100 million or about 30 million years, respectively. The brightest of several Be emission line stars in M 47 is HD 60856, southwest of the cluster’s center, at magnitude 8.0. Another noteworthy cluster member is KQ Puppis with a very large amplitude of about 5 th magnitude! Photos nicely reveal that this star is a very red giant. Finally, there is the double star 6 1121, a pair of two 7.9-magni- tude stars with a separation of 7.4\", right in the cluster’s center. Observation M 47 can be perceived as a knot of stars with just the naked eye, since the cluster’s brightest stars are noticeably above the limiting magni- tude of a very dark night sky. The most impressive views are provi- ded by binoculars; the blue cluster stars give the fi eld splendor. When observed with telescopes at magnifi cations over 50×, the cluster loses that character. Instead, the voids between the few bright stars are em- phasized. Only a few short, curved star chains are noticeable. Even small telescopes resolve the double star in the cluster’s cen- ter. The brightest cluster star in the west of M 47 is a double, too, with a 9.5 magnitude companion ( 6 1120) 19\" away – the one men- tioned by Smyth. Three more double stars are in reach of amateur telescopes: Double stars in M 47 Designation Magnitude Separation PA South 555 7.9/9.1 95.8\" 228° h 5470 9.0/10.0 0.6\" 230° Aitken 3092 5.6/12.2 5.2\" 176° The faint open cluster NGC 2423 lies 40' north of the center of M 47.

He describes this object as a “cluster of very faint stars without nebulosity.” As with M 47 that same night, he made a mistake in his calculation of the coordinates and ended up 5° north of the true position. Hence, M 48 was consi- dered one of the lost Messier objects, and the cluster was known only as NGC 2548 – until in 1959 T.F. Morris pointed out its identity as Messier’s missing object. Hence, Johann Elert Bode made an independent discovery of this star cluster in 1782. In his small star atlas, we fi nd this object in its true place, as well as “Messier 48” in its wrong position, 5° north. Another independent discovery of M 48 was made by William Herschel’s sister Caroline in 1783. She saw “a beautiful cluster of very compressed stars, pretty rich, 10' or 12' diameter.” 50 years later, Smyth wrote about M 48: “A splendid group, in a rich splashy region of stragglers, which fi lls the fi eld of view, and has several small pairs, chiefl y of the 9 th magnitude.” Around the same time, John Herschel praised a “a superb cluster which fi lls the whole fi eld; stars of 9 th and 10 th to the 13 th magnitude – and none below, but the whole ground of the sky on which it stands is singularly dotted over with infi nitely minute points.” Lord Rosse believed the cluster been “riddled with dark lanes and openings,” while Mädler counted about 100 stars and wrote: “wi- thout distinct boundaries, so that some stars lie far out. In the denser part there is a nice double star.” Brenner, too, called M 48 a “very beautiful object” and mentions the double star “near the middle, 7\" separation.” Astrophysics M 48 lies 500 light-years away from the galactic disk and has a distance of 2500 light-years from us. This is about six times the di- stance of the Pleiades. Stragglers extend M 48 to an angular diameter of 54', but the major, central part measures 30', which corresponds to a physical diameter of 22 light-years. M 48 consists of at least 80 members, and recent studies suggest 323 cluster stars with a membership probability of 30%, and 165 of over 70%. Among these are three orange giants of spectral types G and K. In their cores, these evolved stars are already burning helium. The brightest of these is magnitude 8.2; it is the most luminous clus- ter star. By contrast, the brightest main sequence star has the spectral type A1 and a magnitude of 8.8. This puts the cluster age at about 300 million years. Here, too, we fi nd disagreement over the issue of the Trümpler class. Classifi cations of I2m, I2r, and I3r can all be found in the li- terature. Observation M 48 is located in the western part of the lengthy constellation Hydra, not far from the Winter Milky Way. Under good conditions, this large open cluster can be seen quite easily with the naked eye. The cluster character is already hinted at in the view through 10×50 binoculars: a central knot of stars is surrounded by a halo of fainter suns. A small telescope gives an even clearer impression of this bipar- tition: the central region of 20' by 10', elongated in PA 30°, consists of brighter pairs of stars and short chains. It is embedded in a loose scattering of fainter stars, which span almost 1° in diameter. The outskirts of M 48 appear to be elongated in PA 120°, at a right angle to the central region. There is a remarkable number of pairings in the cluster’s center, and it’s impossible to determine which double star Mädler and Bren- ner were referring to: h 2435 (magnitudes 9.6/9.7, 6.9\" separation, PA 207°) or Burnham 904 (magnitudes 9.2/10.8, 3.3\" separation, PA 183°).

Charles Messier discovered it on the 19 th of February 1771, and characterized it plainly as “ne- bula.” In 1779, a comet passed through the Virgo cluster, which had a brightness that compared well to that of M 49. On that occasion, the Italian observer Oriani made an independent discovery of M 49 – Messier had not yet made public his fi nd of this galaxy. Admiral Smyth, in his Bedford Catalog, later confused the dates of these two discovery observations, which has led to frequent false citations of Oriani as the primary discoverer of M 49. Smyth noted on his own observation of M 49: “A bright, round, and well-defi ned nebula. With an eyepiece magnifying 93 times, there are only two telescopic stars in the fi eld, and the nebula has a very pearly aspect.” His countryman and contemporary John Herschel found M 49 “extremely bright.” A few years later, d’Arrest believed that he saw “countless groups of stars; at 147×, the nebula periphery can be resolved into stars of the 13 th and 14 th magnitude.” Obviously, not knowing of the true nature of M 49, d’Arrest thought he saw a globular cluster. Such a misinter- pretation was not uncommon in the early days of visual observation, when astronomers were not yet swayed by photographic images. Curtis looked carefully at the photographic appearance of M 49 and wrote: “The very bright nucleus is not stellar; shown well in a 3min exposure. Nearly round, 2' in diameter, fading out rapidly to- ward the edges. No structure discernible, though spiral character is suspected near the center in the short exposures.” Astrophysics M 49 is the second-brightest ga- laxy of the Virgo cluster, and it forms its secondary center. It is only a little less distant than M 87 and has a radial velocity of 1000 km/s towards the principal Vir- go cluster center. The outermost diameter of M 49 is about 160,000 light-years, within which the brighter central region takes up about 85,000 light-years. M 49 is of a more yellow color than most galaxies in the Virgo cluster, which indicates a larger average age of for its stars and a lack of gas and dust to form new stars.

He regarded the faint galaxy UGC 7636 to the southeast as an interacting companion. In 1998, several blue objects – young, massive stars only 100 million years old – were found in UGC 7636, and in 1994, a tail of 5' was discovered. Both fi ndings are substantial evidence for an interaction – in the future, UGC 7637 will probably be torn apart by the tidal forces imposed on it by M 49. Earlier estimates saw M 49 as the most massive object of the Virgo cluster but, by today’s consensus, M 87 is now regarded as the principal galaxy. Nevertheless, the visible (i.e., luminous) matter of M 49 alone represents about 200 thousand million solar masses, and this is probably only the “tip of the iceberg.” Including invisible “dark matter,” M 49 may have up to ten times as much mass. In its cen- ter, there is a massive black hole of about 500 million so- lar masses. In addition, Chandra and ROSAT X-ray images have revealed a hot gas tail pointing from M 49 into our line-of-sight, which refl ects the proper motion of this gala- xy relative to the inter-galaxy gas of the Virgo cluster. The system of globular clusters surrounding M 49 is estimated at an impressive 5700 objects, found within an angular distance from the galaxy core of 23'. There is a noteworthy peculiarity: it seems to comprise two different age groups. Some authors have, accordingly, been spe- culating about a galaxy merger in the distant past, from which M 49 could have inherited globular clusters of two different formation ages. Other authors rather see this simply as a matter of two different metallicities, instead of different ages. One supernova has been found so far in M 49; 1969Q reached magnitude 13.0 in June that year and became only a little fainter than the foreground star east of the galaxy core. In front of the northwestern part of M 49, there is an RR Lyrae variable in our galactic halo, IL Vir. It reaches a maximum brightness of magnitude 19.0 and has the coor- dinates 12h 29min 41s, +8° 0' 55\". Observation M 49 is bright and can be seen easily with 10×50 binoculars.

Charles Messier must have looked for that “nebula” in 1771, but not until the 5 th of April 1772 did he fi nd a “cluster of small stars, more or less bright” – by good luck, since he happened upon it while ob- serving the comet of that year. Bode – uninformed of Messier’s fi nd – was looking for Cassini’s cluster in 1774 and found “a small star cluster under the belly of the Unicorn, on a nebulous background, with four small stars to the west.” Sixty years later, John Herschel commented on M 50: “Superb cluster; fi lls whole fi eld; irregularly round; stars of 11 th to 15 th ma- gnitude; not compressed in the middle; straggling stars extend over a circle 30' in diameter.” By contrast, d’Arrest considered M 50 a “clus- ter of small stars” and saw a “red star close to one edge.” Admiral Smyth noted: “an irregularly round and very rich mass, occupying with its numerous outliers more than the fi eld, and composed of stars from the 8 th to the 16 th magnitudes.” Leo Brenner recommended M 50 as a ”splendid object for small scopes” and gave its diameter as 30'. Astrophysics The open cluster M 50 has a di- stance of about 2900 light-years from us and lies only 70 light-years beneath the galactic plane. Its apparent size of 15' by 20' corresponds to a true diameter of about 13 light-years, while the dense inner region of 10' measures only 8 light-years. The Trümpler classifi cations disagree with each other, and assignments of I2m, II3m, to II3r have been made for M 50. Claria et al. identifi ed 109 probable cluster members among 175 stars in the fi eld of M 50, while Wallenquist fi nds only 50 probable cluster stars. Recent studies, however, going down to a much fainter limiting magnitude of 23, suggest 2050 member stars. The brightest cluster star is a red giant of spectral type K3 with a brightness of magnitude 7.8, located 7' south of the cluster’s center. By contrast, the second-brightest star (magnitude 8.3) is blue and can be found in the northeastern part of the cluster. Contrary to earlier belief, M 50 does not belong to the very young CMa-OB1 association, which is physically linked with the nebula IC 2177 and the star cluster NGC 2353. Early age estimates placed M 50 at about 78 million years, but these have recently been revised up- wards, to an older 100 million years. Observation Under the best of conditions, M 50 is visible even to the naked eye. 10×50 binoculars show a bright cluster with glimpses of about 10 stars in front of a nebulous background. M 50 appears slightly elon- gated in P.A. 45°; its brightest star lies a little outside, to the south. In small telescopes, 50 stars of 8 th magnitude and fainter are irre- gularly clumped. In larger telescopes, up to 150 stars can be counted. The outer cluster members appear to be arranged in groups and loops. Voids without stars diminish the brightness of the cluster. Modest apertures show an orange star south of the cluster’s cen- ter. A 14-inch telescope reveals another one near the cluster’s eastern border. Furthermore, two double stars suitable for small telescopes are worth mentioning: h 748 consists of two stars of magnitudes 8.5 and 10.6, separated by 6.8\" in PA 173°; Barton 392 is fainter with magni- tudes of 11.5 and 11.6, and a separation of 4.2\" (PA 217°).

However he evidently saw only the brighter of the two cores (NGC 5194), since his original note, reproduced in his second catalog version, reads: “very faint nebula without stars.” A later, hand-written note of Messier gives credit to Pierre Méchain as the discoverer of the second core (NGC 5195) on the night of the 21 st of March 1781. Accordingly, his third catalog edition says: “it is double, each one with a brilliant center, separated from each other 4' 35.” The two atmospheres touch each other. The one is fainter than the other.” Johann Elert Bode made an independent discovery of M 51 on the night of the 5 th of January 1775. He described the galaxy as “a small, weakly luminous nebula, probably of elongated shape,” which is pre- tty much the visual appearance in a small, modern telescope. Hence, while he did not specify NGC 5195 as a separate object, he was the fi rst to see light from the companion galaxy. In 1833, John Herschel saw “a very bright round nucleus surroun- ded at a distance by a nebulous ring.” Today, this observation is con- sidered the fi rst hint of the spiral nature of a galaxy. Herschel himself thought of M 51 as a distant Milky Way. The really famous obser- vations of M 51, however, were made by the 3 rd Earl of Rosse from Birr Castle in Ireland. In September 1843, with a smaller telescope, he could not yet see Herschel’s “ring.” But in 1845, Lord Rosse aimed M 51.

Core B is large and becomes brighter to its center.” The fi rst photos to show the full beauty of this galaxy and its spiral structure were made in 1889. Curtis produced a detailed description of M 51 in 1918, as seen on deep exposures: “The beautiful spiral M 51 in Canes Venatici. Including very faint matter to the north of NGC 5194, scar- cely visible in any of the very numerous published reproductions, it covers an area about 12'×6' in PA approximately 30°.

The smaller galaxy NGC 5195 orbits the large spiral NGC 5194 with an incli- nation to the spiral’s galactic plane of 73°. Presently, the companion is located about 500,000 light-years behind the northern spiral arm of the main galaxy, and the last close encounter was about 400 million years ago. That event was not without consequences for these two galaxies. NGC 5194 shows pronounced spiral arms, after tidal interaction with NGC 5195 triggered wave after wave of enhanced star formation in the spiral. Some of the over 1000 cataloged star-forming regions and young star clusters, visible as red and blue knots, are no older than 10 million years. A striking feature is the spiral arms that are asymmetrically bent and streched towards the companion. In deep exposures, NGC 5195 itself shows tidal tails, in which stars have been accelerated into highly eccentric orbits that lead them far out- side the galaxy.

The 120 light-year central region is known as a UV and radio source, as well as a Seyfert-2 object (see M 77), and features an “X”-shaped absorption structure. It contains an object only 5 light-years wide, but with about a mil- lion times the solar luminosity, which could be the accretion disk of a black hole. Observations with the Planetary Camera of the HST have, however, given evidence for a galaxy core hidden in dust, with a massive, central star cluster. From the inner 45 light-years diameter, the equivalent of 23 million solar luminosities are emit- ted. Radio obser vations have shown a bipolar core structure with a northern arc and a southern gas cloud, which could be heated by a jet from the core. The extended, oval region of 11\"×16\" (1500×2100 light-years) around the center has a luminosity of 100 million Suns and a mass of 40 million solar masses. Red giants stand out here; they have an age of 5 to 8 million years. On HST images, Lamers and colleagues (2002) also found 30 blue point sources, which are placed along the spiral arms, between magnitude 21.4 and 24.3 within 1000 light-years of the core.

Accor- ding to Lamers and colleagues, the presently available gas suffi ces for another 200 to 400 million years of further star formation. The main galaxy, NGC 5194, has a total diameter of 87,000 light-years, which makes it just a bit smaller than our Milky Way, but it contains only 10% of the Milky Way’s mass. The companion, NGC 5195, was fi rst classifi ed as an irregular galaxy of the M 82 type (I0). Recent stu- dies, however, indicate that it is a barred spiral (SB0psc or SB0a(r)). The last encounter led to a large starburst, which consumed most of the gas and dense molecular clouds in this galaxy. Hence, there are few stars younger than spec- tral type B5 now in NGC 5195. Its central core region, 120 light-years in diameter, is covered by the spiral arm of NGC 5194, and suffers an extinction of 1.3 to 2.0 magnitudes. M 51, or Arp 85 in the catalog of interacting galaxies, forms the center of gravity of a galaxy group at about 27 million light-years distance. Apart from M 63, other mem- bers are NGC 5023 and 5229, as well as UGC 8313, 8331, and 8683. Three supernovae have been observed in M 51, so far. SN 1945A went off in the companion, NGC 5195, and reached 14 th magnitude on the 8 th of April 1945. The US amateur astronomers Armstrong and Puckett discovered a supernova on the 2 nd of April 1994, only 2000 light-years from the core of NGC 5194. Very recently, on the 27 th of June 2005, the German amateur Wolfgang Kloehr was the lucky discoverer of yet another supernova in this galaxy (2005cs), this time 40\" south of the core, magnitude 14.0. Observation The two cores of M 51 can be spotted faintly in 10×50 binoculars. With a small telescope, both galaxies appear as small nebulae, separated by 6'. In a 4.7-inch refractor, M 51 is bright and quite impressive for its double-structure but otherwise remains featureless. The main galaxy, NGC 5194, shows a bright, extended core surrounded by a halo of diffuse light of 3' in size, without any hint of spiral structure. NGC 5195 measures only 1'; it is seen as a nebula with a star-like center, slightly elongated in the north-south direction. It takes an aperture of 8 inches at medium power to see the fi rst signs of the spiral structure of M 51. With a 14-inch telescope, it be- comes truly impressive and well defi ned. Through both the symmetry and asymmetry of its spiral arms, the double galaxy gains a unique appeal. Featuring some bright, diffuse spots, one arm starts in the south and bends northeast. It then aims straight towards NGC 5195, only to abruptly bend westward just 2' south of its core. Here, the arm appears brightest and can be followed a further 3' to the southwest, before it disappears in the diffuse background glow. The other spiral arm starts 1.5' west of the core, clearly detached from it. Leading south, it fi rst passes a foreground star and then de- scribes a semicircle around the core, keeping a distance of 3'. It is well separated from the other spiral arm by darkness, until it fi nally ends 2.2' east of the galaxy’s center. A faint fan, reaching southward, is seen at the southwest edge of the galaxy. In the core of NGC 5194, three brightness levels can be distin- guished in a 14-inch telescope, with diameters of 20\", 1', and 2', slightly elongated in PA 10°. By contrast, the core of the companion galaxy NGC 5195 remains almost stellar in appearance. It is embe- dded in a bright, cigar-shaped bar of 1.7' length in PA 175°. In the west, the bar is joined by a semicircular halo, which appears a bit brighter at the outer edge and in the middle. East of the bar, there is only a faint structure, which aims at NGC 5194 but does not appear to meet its approaching spiral arm. This “bridge,” as well as the tidal tails around NGC 5195, requires larger apertures or deep photogra- phic exposures. Of the numerous faint foreground stars, a 14-inch telescope would show only one with certainty, 2' southwest of the core of NGC 5194. Two faint galaxies lie in the background of M 51, which require a larger aperture for visual observation than 14 inches. The delicate needle of IC 4277 is 4' northeast of the core of NGC 5195; IC 4278 can be found 5' south of it. M 51, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

The French observer noted, on the 7 th of September 1774: “Cluster of very small stars, which cannot be seen except in an achromatic refractor, mingled with nebulosity.” 50 years later, John Herschel described this cluster and saw “a ruddy star of 9 th magnitude in the preceding [western] part of a pretty rich irre- gular cluster of stars of 13 th magnitude, all separate, 6' diameter; a very little more compressed in the south following [southeastern] part.” His countryman Admiral Smyth commented on M 52: “This ob- ject assumes somewhat of a triangular form, with an orange-tinted 8 th magnitude star at its vertex, giving it the resemblance of a bird with outspread wings. It is preceded by [east of] two stars of 7 th and 8 th ma- gnitudes, and followed by [west of] another of similar brightness; and the fi eld is one of singular beauty under a moderate magnifying po- wer.” With his large telescope, Lord Rosse estimated that there were 200 cluster stars. Curtis referred to the photographic appearance of the cluster when he wrote: “A very sparse, open cluster 16' in diameter, of stars 12 th –16 th magnitude.” Astrophysics After M 11, M 52 is one of the ri- chest open clusters in the Messier list. In 1959, Wallenquist counted 193 cluster members within a radius of 9'. More recent sources state 130 cluster stars and 30 fi eld stars down to 14 th magnitude, plus more than 6000 cluster stars and about as many fi eld stars down to magnitude 19.5. The star density in the cluster’s center is about one star of 15 th magnitude (or brighter) per square ar- csecond or, in absolute terms, 1.5 stars per cubic light-year. A yellowish giant star of spectral type G8 is the brightest star of the cluster at magnitude 8.2. The brightest blue main sequence star (B7) is magnitude 11.0. M 52 contains fi ve known variables and a hot Of-star with an emission line spectrum. The extinction varies on small scales and diminishes the cluster stars by up to 1 magnitude, which complicates precise assessments. The literature gives quite a range of age estimates, between 25 million and 165 million years. It seems possible that M 52 was formed in, not one, but two consecutive phases star forming. Distance values between 3000 and 7000 light-years have been suggested. With the more recent measurements of 4500 light-years (Pandey et al., 2001) or 4600 light-years (Kharchenko et al., 2005), we obtain a physical cluster diameter of 22 light-years. Observation M 52 can be spotted as a small round nebula even with very small binoculars. A small 2-inch refractor begins to resolve the brightest cluster stars. 4.7 inches aperture reveals about 60 stars, nearly equally faint (between 12 th and 14 th magnitude), distributed over an area of 10' di- ameter. This gives the open cluster a homogeneous and rich appea- rance. At higher magnifi cation, the orange tint of the brightest star in the western part of the cluster becomes noticeable. Another yellowish star lies 10' southeast of M 52. A 14-inch telescope shows about 100 cluster stars, many quite densely packed. Only the western region of the cluster is less rich. The visual extent of the cluster reaches 15'. There is another, much poorer galactic cluster only 20' southeast of M 52: Czernik 43. Larger telescopes show about 10 stars against a nebulous background. A galactic emission nebula, the “Bubble Nebula” around the star BD+60°2522, lies 35' southwest of M 52. It is quite popular with pho- tographers; visual observers need a narrowband fi lter to see a hint of it with telescopes of 4 inches and more. Observed in a 14-inch telescope, this nebula is impressive: its brightest part is attached to a bright star and gives way to a sharply defi ned bubble, open towards the south, with a diameter of just under 1'.

Bode described it as “lively and round.” Charles Messier had no knowledge of Bode’s observation and discovered M 53 independently on the 26 th of February 1777 as a “nebula wi- thout stars.” He later likened it to M 79 and commented: “round and conspicious.” Only a few years later, William Herschel succeeded with his fi ne, home-made refl ectors in resolving this globular cluster into indivi- dual stars. He likened M 53 to M 10 and wrote enthusiastically: “One of the most beautiful objects I remember to have seen in the heavens. The cluster appears under the form of a solid ball, consisting of small stars, quite compressed into one blaze of light, with a great number of loose ones surrounding it, and distinctly visible in the general mass.” On the 14 th of March 1783, he discovered the neighboring, but much fainter, globular cluster NGC 5053. “A most beautiful, highly compressed cluster” was the comment on M 53 made later by John Herschel. He stated the brightness of its in- dividual stars as magnitudes 12 to 20 and said that the visual appea- rance would be “indicating a round mass of pretty equable density.” Lord Rosse was under the impression that M 53 was “not com- pressed to one point but apparently to four or fi ve different points within a small area,” and he gave a diameter of only 3'. Photographic images, however, instead suggest 10', according to Curtis. Astrophysics M 53 has the quite large distance of about 63,000 light-years from us, as well as from the galactic center. In absolute terms, it is much larger than the nearer M 13: M 53 has a diameter of 230 light-years and about 750,000 solar masses. Its wide orbit leads M 53 through the outer galactic halo and takes about a thousand million years to complete. It reaches a maximal di- stance from the galactic center of 100,000 light-years but, at present, M 53 is approaching us at 70 km/s. According to Shapley, M 53 has the concentration class V. The brightest stars reach magnitude 13.8; Sawyer-Hogg calculated an average magnitude of 15.1 for the 25 brightest cluster stars, and the horizontal branch starts at 16.9. The stars of M 53 have the very low metal abundances typical for globular clusters of the galactic halo, which formed from almost primordial gas. There are 59 known RR Lyrae and 8 SX Phe [Phoenicis] variables. The latter belong to the 151 recorded blue stragglers of M 53 (see M 30). In 1989, a pulsar with a period of 33 milliseconds was found in M 53 by the Arecibo Radio Telescope. Signal shifts show that it is orbiting another star over a 256-day period. After its formation in a type Ia supernova, this millisecond-pulsar must have received extra angular momentum by interaction with its partner star in a close bi- nary. In globular clusters, such a partner may later be lost in close encounters with other stars (see M 13). The rather slow rotation of the M 53 pulsar suggests an age of one thousand million years. 1° to the east of M 53 is the very faint globular cluster NGC 5053. It is unusual for its very low star density, very low metallicity, and the absence of a dense core. With its smaller distance of 53,500 light- years, NGC 5053 is not a real neighbor of M 53 in space, but it truly is much smaller in absolute terms, with a diameter of 160,000 light- years and only 40,000 solar luminosities. Its brightest stars are, like those of M 53, magnitude 13.8; the horizontal branch stars reach ma- gnitude 16.7, but the total brightness of this cluster is a mere 9.5. Observation M 53 appears as a small nebulous ball in 10×50 binoculars, and the same impression is maintained when a small refractor is used. With an aperture of 4.7 inches, a round nebula with an extended core is seen. Some observers call the central region triangular. To re- solve individual stars, larger apertures of 6 to 8 inches are required. A 14-inch telescope fully resolves M 53 into individual stars; a nebulous background remains present only in the bright and compact central region. Towards the outskirts of the globular cluster, its stellar distribution becomes irregular and assumes a wispy character. There is a magnitude-11.5 foreground star northeast of the cluster center. The fainter globular cluster NGC 5053, 1° southeast, may already be seen as a faint nebulous glow in 20×100 giant binoculars under good observing conditions. In a 14-inch telescope, a large, diffuse mass appears. It has fi ne speckles; a central condensation is not no- ticeable. The bright star D Comae 1° southwest of M 53 is a binary ( 6 1728) with two equal components of magnitude 5.2, which orbit each other in 25.8 years. We look at the orbit from nearly edge-on. Hence, whi- le the separation was only 0.3\" in 2003, it will increase to 0.65\" in 2010. Likewise, the position angle changes rapidly after periastron, from 12° to 192°.

He characterized M 54 as a “very faint nebula, the center is bright, does not contain any star.” John Herschel, by contrast, found it easy to resolve M 54, even with his weaker left eye, but he was observing with a much larger telescope and from South Africa. He noted: “resolved into stars of 15 th magni- tude, with a few outliers of magnitude 14.” Other historic observers had very little interest in this very southern Messier object, which is diffi cult to observe from northern latitudes. Curtis characterized M 54 in 1918 as a “remarkably condensed glo- bular cluster 2' in diameter,” based on its photographic appearance. Astrophysics M 54 is exceptional among the globular clusters in the Messier ca- talog, since it is the only one which is gravitationally bound not to the Milky Way, but to the elliptical dwarf galaxy SagDEG. The Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy was discovered as recen- tly as 1994, during the course of a study of the star density in the Milky Way. It has the coordinates 18h 55.1min and –30° 29', and covers an area of 3.2° by 8.2°. It is our nearest companion galaxy, even closer than the Magellanic Clouds, but it lies right behind the densest parts of the Milky Way. Its proximity will determine its de- stiny: strong tidal forces are leading to its disintegration. Its orbit around our galactic center has led it into ten close encounters, the last one about 200 million years ago. It will probably not survive the next one, which is due in only a few tens of millions of years. In fact, it is surprising that SagDEG survived this long at all – it has been suggested that it may contain extra mass in the form of dark matter. Apart from M 54, the globular clusters Arp 2, Terzan 7, and 8, as well as Palomar 12 all belong to SagDEG, but the latter may have been lost already to the Milky Way, stripped off the dwarf galaxy by tidal forces. The location of M 54 coincides with one of the two concentrations in SagDEG. With its large distance of 85,000 light- years, M 54 is roughly three times farther away than its apparent neighbors M 69 and M 70, and its physical size is an impressive 300 light-years; only Omega Centauri is larger! Furthermore, with about 1.5 million solar masses, M 54 already contains 1/40 of the mass still left in SagDEG. M 54 has a very concentrated appearance and was characterized by Shapley as a class III cluster. The brightest individual stars are only magnitude 15.5, due to their large distance, and the horizontal branch starts at magnitude 17.7. Most of the known 211 variables are RR Lyrae stars; two semi-regular red variables show periods of 77 and 101 days. Observation M 54 is regarded as the faintest glo- bular cluster in the Messier catalog, and its southerly position in the sky makes it an even more diffi cult object to observe. 10×50 binoculars show only a faint, unsharp star. In amateur telescopes, M 54 appears as a strongly concentrated ball of nebulosity with a core of almost stellar appearance. Several 12 th -magnitude foreground stars fake resolution into individual clus- ter stars. True resolution, though still partial, is gained with a 14-inch telescope, but not in the luminous center. The visual extent remains small, only 2'. M 54 is the most distant globular cluster in the Messier catalog. It belongs not to the Milky Way, but to the dwarf galaxy SagDEG.

He registered this globular cluster as his 14 th object in the class “nebula without stars” and likened it to an obscure core of a large comet. Messier was hoping to repeat Lacaille’s observation on the 29 th of July 1764 for his fi rst catalog, but he could not fi nd this very southern object. However, almost exactly 14 years later, on the 24 th of July 1778, he was fi nally successful, right after discovering M 54 by accident the same night. He noted on M 55: “Nebula, which is a whitish patch of about 6' in extent, its light is even and appears not to contain any star.” The debated Australian observer James Dunlop also failed to re- solve this globular cluster into individual stars. He described M 55 as a “beautiful large round bright nebula, about 2' diameter, slight condensation to the center.” Only William and John Herschel resol- ved cluster stars and saw a better part, 10', of the pretty large angular diameter of M 55. Curtis gave this description, according to photographic images: “A fi ne globular cluster 10' in diameter. The background of faint stars is less dense near the center than in most clusters of this type.” Astrophysics With its generous angular dia- meter of 19', M 55 is among the (apparently) largest globular clusters in our sky. However, with its distance of just over 19,000 light-years, it has a fairly average physi- cal diameter of 110 light-years. Its moderate mass has been estimated as equivalent to that of 250,000 Suns, and its luminosity to that of 100,000 solar luminosities. M 55 is a globular cluster of the galactic bulge. It never exceeds a distance of 20,000 light-years from the galactic center, but it can get as close to it as 5,000 light-years. Its orbit has an inclination of 60° to the galactic plane and takes about 100 million years to complete. The age of M 55 has been estimated as 12.5 thousand million years, a typical value for globular clusters. M 55 is almost the least concentrated object of its kind in the Messier catalog; Shapley gave it his class XI. Only M 71 is looser. A good explanation is that during the many passages of M 55 through the dense inner galactic bulge, it must have lost a lot of its stars. The brightest stars of M 55 reach a remarkable magnitude 11.2. Sawyer-Hogg gave 13.6 as the mean magnitude of the 25 brightest cluster stars. About 40 variables have been found in this globular cluster, including 15 RR Lyrae stars and three eclipsing variables. Furthermore, 24 of the 74 confi rmed “blue stragglers” are variables of the SX Phoenicis type. In 1996, Mateo and Mirabel discovered that a considerable frac- tion of the stars in this fi eld actually belong to the dwarf galaxy SagDEG, which lies only 9° east of M 55 (see M 54). These include 3 RR Lyrae stars, which, at their larger distance of 85,000 light-years, are not physical members of M 55, but lie far behind it. Observation O'Meara has reported naked-eye sightings of this cluster, but any confi rmation seems to require very southerly sites. 10×50 glasses hint not only at the large apparent size, but also at the relatively low surface brightness of M 55. Under good observing conditions, this globular cluster can be re- solved into individual stars with a 4-inch telescope. The poor con- centration of its central region is very noticeable, and it is quite easy to resolve. Larger apertures yield a visual diameter of 12'. Skiff and Glyn Jones reported a dark bay in the southeastern part of the clus- ter.

On the 23 rd , when he fi nally reobserved M 56 to measure its position, he noted: “nebula without star, has little light, near to it is a star of 10 th magnitude.” Five years later in 1784, John Herschel succeeded in resolving this globular cluster into individual stars, thereby proving Messier’s note wrong. Herschel described M 56 as a “fi ne compressed cluster, round, inclining to triangular form, brighter towards the middle, stars of 12 th to 14 th magnitude.” Observing with an 11-inch refractor, d’Arrest noted: “A star clus- ter, which contains a large number of stars, none of which is brighter than 12 th to 13 th magnitude. With 356× magnifi cation resolved into minute stars.” Reverend Webb even thought he had resolved M 56 with his very modest 3.7-inch refractor. Curtis’ description of the photographic appearance reads: “Rather bright, condensed cluster, 3' in diameter. Probably globular.” Astrophysics M 56 is a poorly concentrated glo- bular cluster of the Shapley class X. Only M 55 and M 71 are even less concentrated. Shapley was the fi rst to notice the slightly elliptical shape of M 56 in PA 45°. Its very eccentric, but low-inclination, orbit around the galactic center takes M56 out to distances of 40,000 light-years. But then, 125 mil lion years later, it gets as close as just a few thousand light- years to the galactic core. The current distance of M 56 from us is 27,000 light-years, as it passes through the outer half of its orbit. In 2000, an X-ray tail was discovered, which is trailing the globular cluster. This seems to indicate an interaction between the cluster and the ga- lactic halo gas through which it moves. With just about 200,000 solar masses, M 56 has only a third of the mass of M 13. Its brightest stars reach magnitude 13.0, and Sa- wyer-Hogg found an average magnitude of 15.3 for the 25 brightest cluster stars; the horizontal branch begins at magnitude 16.2. The brightest star of the cluster is a variable of the RV Tauri type. The- re are fi ve more known variables of this kind in M 56, others have been found in Omega Centauri, M 2, M 5, M 10, and M 28. The vari- able reaches a maximum magnitude of 13.0b and was discovered in 1940 by Davis; its period is 90 days. At least 13 more variables have been found in M 56, including the two next brightest cluster stars at about 13 th magnitude. Even the neighborhood of the cluster is quite rich in variables: six more have been found within a distance of 10' from the center of M 56. Observation Seen through a pair of 10×50 bi- noculars, M 56 looks like a small, nebulous ball. This impression becomes more distinct in a small tele- scope, which also shows a nearby 10 th -magnitude star to the west. In a 4.7-inch refractor, glimpses of the fi rst individual stars can be seen, but the globular cluster is still not fully resolved. Its elliptical shape remains unnoticeable. 6 to 8 inches of aperture fully resolve M 56 into individual stars, 10 inches the relatively open center. A 14-inch telescope shows a wide central region of 5' diameter without any real core, perfectly resolved, with apparent chains of stars rea- ching westward. There is a semicircle of brighter stars, south of the central region of M 56, seen against a nebulous background.

The comment on M 57 made by its discoverer, Antoine de Darquier de Pellepoix, led to the name for this class of objects. In January 1779 he wrote: “It is very dull, but perfectly outlined; as large as Jupiter and looks like a fading planet.” Soon, Charles Messier learned of Darquier’s obser- vation and looked for this nebula himself. His note from the 31 st of January 1779 reads: “It seems that this mass of light, which is roun- ded, is composed of very faint stars. Even with the best telescopes it is not possible to perceive them, there is only a suspicion that they are there.” Observing with a small telescope of today, we can easily agree with Darquier’s description, while we are certainly bewildered by Messier’s impression. However, without any knowledge of the true, gaseous nature of M 57, historic observers tried to resolve it into in- dividual stars until the late-nineteenth century. The great observer William Herschel remarked: “Among the curi- osities of the heavens should be placed this nebula, which has a re- gular, concentric, dark patch in the middle, and is probably a Ring of stars. It is of an oval shape, the shorter axis being to the longer as about 83 to 100. The light is of the resolvable kind, and on the nort- hern side three very faint stars can be seen, as well as one or two in the southern part. The endings of the longer axis seem less bright and not so well defi ned as the rest.” So, even Herschel succumbed to the mistaken impression that M 57 was composed of stars. The wealthy German amateur astronomer Friedrich von Hahn had built an observatory next to his castle in Remplin (in northern Ger- many) and used an 18-inch mirror made by Herschel. In 1803, he reported: “A few years ago, the inside of the ring was so clear that in its middle I could make out a small telescopic star. Now there appear faint, fi ne clouds and the small star is not visible any more.” With this fi rst mention of the central star of M 57, the myth of its varia- bility was born. Johann Hieronymus Schröter, another German customer of Herschel’s fi ne large mirrors during that time, was actually the fi rst to mention the nebulosity inside the bright ring of M 57, and he very appropriately described it as “like the moonlit sky.” Later, in 1830, John Herschel confi rmed this observation and remarked: “The edges exhibit a curdled and confused appearance, like stars out of focus. The interior is far from absolutely dark. It is fi lled with a feeble but very evident nebulous light, which I do not remember to have seen noticed by former observers.” Lord Rosse saw remarkable detail in his giant telescope in 1844: “The fi laments proceeding from the edge become more conspicuous under increasing magnifying power within certain limits, which is strikingly characteristic of a cluster.” In 1850, after another obser- M 57.

In the ring, especially on the outsides of the small axis, are several small stars, but there is still a lot of nebulosity which cannot be seen as indivi- dual stars.” In addition, he saw “wisps and cloudlets on the inside; the evenness of the outside is interrupted by diverging appendages, seen best around the small axis.” A number of nineteenth-century observers reported resolution of the nebula into faint stars. The last prominent example was Angelo Secchi, who thought he saw “a ring of stars, glittering like diamond dust.” We may, from today’s perspective, explain some of these claims in terms of true nebular fi ne-structure. Only William Huggins’ pionee- ring spectroscopic observations fi nally taught the visual observers that M 57 is a ring of gas. Hence, Holden’s detailed description of M 57, as seen through a 26-inch refractor in 1875, reads: “Northern edge of small axis very well defi ned, there is a bright spot near the northern end of the small axis. Occasional visibility of the star inside the ring. Glittering spots in the inner part are perceivable. Nebulous fi laments branch out from the southern end of the small axis, they may extend up to 30\", very faint. Two brighter patches in the north preceding [northwestern] and south following [southeastern] part of the ring can be seen, probably exists a third one in the south preceding [southwestern] part.” In 1861 d’Arrest reported another faint star near the central star. Four years later, H. Schultz described fi ve stars inside the ring, la- ter observers up to eleven, but none of these extra stars is real. A reliable visual observation was made by the great Edward Emerson Barnard in 1894 with an aperture of 40 inches, and he saw only the “17 th magnitude companion 8.5\" northwest of the central star inside the nebula.” In 1937, on deep exposures, Duncan discovered the faint outer halo of M 57. The “appendages” seen by Lord Rosse on the outside of the ring actually belong to the inner, brighter part of this halo. Astrophysics M 57 probably is the most popular planetary nebula. The bright, cen- tral ring measures 86\" by 62\". It is surrounded by a faint inner halo of about 156\" by 136\" and a very faint outer halo of about 3.8' diame- ter. The surface brightnesses of these three morphological components form a ratio of 5000:5:1. Early studies gave large distances for M 57, up to 4100 light-years (Cudworth, 1974). At the other extreme, 1000 light-years was suggested by Kwok (2000). But Harris and colleagues (1997) obtained an improved geometrical parallax of the central star and determined a reliable distance of 2300 light-years. From this, a physical size of of 0.9 light-years is derived for the ring, while the outer halo has a diameter of 2.5 light-years. M 57, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian. Ronald Stoyan."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"223 Earlier models of M 57 described its appearance in the sky in terms of a bipolar cylinder, tighter in its middle, into which we look along its long axis. The ring of M 57 is then just a projection of a nebu- lous object which, seen from the side, would resemble the Dumbbell Nebula M 27. In 1994, Bryce, Balick and Maeburn published a refi ned model, in which the main body of the M 57 nebula has not a cylinder but an ellipsoidal shape, with open poles and an aspect angle of 45°. Even this densest part of M 57 has, by laboratory standards, a very low gas density. The surrounding inner halo would be bipolar and tilted by 30°, embedded in a spherical outer halo. Guerrero and colleagues refi ned that model in 1997 for the inner halo, which they describe as just the UV-excited, inner region of a single outer halo, which is shaped by the bipolar output of UV-photons from the polar openings of the inner nebula. In 2000, Japanese astronomers measured the fi lamentary knots in the inner and outer haloes. They found typical sizes from 1.2\" to 3.2\", from which they derived life spans of 400 to 1200 years for these de- licate structures. They are bubbles formed by the hot and fast wind from the central star, where it clashes with the slowly expanding halo gas. The latter is the cool wind envelope, which left at only 10 to 15 km/s some 20,000 years ago, when the star was still a red giant. The central ellipsoidal part of M 57, which appears to us as the ring, expands at 50 km/s, pushed outwards from inside by the hot wind. Its expansion is equivalent to about 1\" per century. This sets a lower limit for the age of M 57 of about 10,000 years. Hence, it is probably older than the planetary nebulae M 27 and M 97. The central star is very hot and compact. It is the now-exposed hot core of the former red giant. It has about one solar luminosity, with a temperature of 100,000 to 120,000 K, and mainly radiates in UV light. In fact, color photos nicely show the successively decreasing degree of ionization of the surrounding gas: blue-violet in the inner, central part, green ([OIII] emission) along the inner side of the ring, and red (H D emission) in the ring of M 57 itself. Observation M 57 can be spotted in 10×50 bi- noculars, but it appears only as a faint star. In small telescopes, when locating it with low power, M 57 looks like an unsharp star. A magnifi cation of about 100× brings out its famous appearance, like a ring of smoke. Even under a moonlit, urban sky, a 60mm re- fractor will do this. However, the ring then appears rather round; perception of the oval form is improved against a darker sky. This is because the faint ends on the major axis of this nebula are lost in a bright background. A 4.7-inch refractor used at high power shows a bright oval ring with an elongation ratio of 1:1.26 in PA 60°. There is a distinct 12 th - magnitude star just 1' south of the nebula’s center, well outside the ring. The brightest parts of the nebula are formed by the thinner sides of the ring on the minor axis, while the ring is wider but dimmer along the major axis. Northwest and southeast of the center, the ring’s brightness appears to be somewhat uneven, but no distinct structure can be perceived. Observing with a low power, the nebulous disk gi- ves a pale-bluish impression. Using a good 14-inch telescope, the central star is within reach, but it requires excellent seeing and a high magnifi cation of around 500×. There is a 14 th -magnitude star 1' west outside the nebula. The northern side of M 57 appears to be the brightest part. Here a bright, slightly mottled structure reaches west where it spreads out. Hence, the western end bears resemblance to the “ears” of M 27. The southern part of the ring is not quite as bright as the northern part, but it is very well defi ned at its eastern edge. Here, an outer edge appears and gives the impression of a helical structure. Small extensions like fl ames at the perimeter of the ring can be perceived in the north and, more distinctly, the south. Also, a shallow bulge is seen in the south. The inside of the ring is fi lled with homogeneous light. The total size of the ring is 90\"×62\", with a ring width of 12\" on the minor axis and 25\" on the major axis. With classic, blue-sensitive photographic emulsions, M 57 is fainter (magnitude 9.7) than visually (magnitude 8.8), and its bluish central part is enhanced to a 60\" sized disk. By contrast, a red image (which includes H E ) emphasizes the 90\" ring, and shows it dark in- side. However, any visual perception of its colors, red and blue, re- quires really large apertures. There are positive reports with 25 to 30-inch telescopes. No sightings have been reported by modern visual observers of Lord Rosse’s wisps of nebulosity across the inner part of the ring. The same is true for the photographically recorded 170\" halo and its 216\" outskirts. Its extremely low surface brightness of around 16 magni- tudes per square-arcminute, by contrast to the 9.5mag/arcmin 2 of the ring, would require the darkest of clear nights at high altitude. The visibility of the central star (magnitude 15.8 according to Harris et al.) has been a matter of debate for 200 years. It depends strongly on the quality of the seeing, since the size of its disk needs to be small enough to reach a surface brightness higher than that of the surrounding nebulous background. At least 12 inches, or better yet 16 inches, of aperture and a magnifi cation of over 400× are re- quired. To have a chance of spotting the central star, the observer should be able to make out stars as faint as magnitude 16.5 outside M 57. Sightings of the second star inside the ring have been reported from amateurs with 20- and 25-inch telescopes. Two more stars in front of the bright ring in the southeast of M 57, however, have not been mentioned so far. Deep photographic exposures show numerous faint stars of about 20 th magnitude. By far the brightest and best-known galaxy near the Ring Nebula is the small barred spiral IC 1296 (magnitude 14.8), 5' northwest of M 57. A multiple star 1.2' north of the central star is known to pho- tographers as a nice test of image quality."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"224 M 58 Degree of diffi culty 4 (of 5) Minimum aperture 50mm Designation  NGC 4579 Type  Galaxy Class  SBc Distance 62.5 Mly (V2002) Size  107,000  ly Constellation Virgo R.A.  12 h 37.7 min Decl.  +11°  49' Magnitude  9.6 Surface brightness 21.9mag/arcsec 2 Apparent diameter 5,9'×4,7' Discoverer  Messier,  1779 History Charles Messier discovered M 58 when he was observing the comet of that year, on the 15 th of April 1779. He characterized this object as a “very faint nebula.” In 1830, John Herschel observed a size of 5' by 4' and described M 58 as “rather mottled as if with stars,” which may be the fi rst hint of the spiral structure of this galaxy. Lord Rosse even noticed the bar “a little extended south preceding [southwest] to north following [nor- theast].” D’Arrest perceived the central region as only a bit elliptical, 100\" by 80\". Astrophysics M 58 is a member of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, at a distance of 63 million light-years. This galaxy measures a respectable 107,000 light-years in diameter and contains 300,000 solar masses. M 58 is one of four barred spiral galaxies (SBb or SBc) in Messier’s catalog, the other three are M 91, M 95, and M 109. Some authors see M 58 as a transitional case between a normal spiral (type Sab, according to Maoz et al.) and a real barred spiral. Tully classifi ed it as SABc. The central region of M 58 contains an active galactic nucleus and has been classifi ed as a LINER by Filippenko and Sargent in 1985 (see M 81). The Hubble Space Telescope resolved it and a diameter of 0.11” was measured. On the 18 th of January 1988, Ikeya found a type II supernova only 40\" south of the core of M 58. SN 1988A reached an apparent brightness of magnitude 13.5. A year and a half later, on the 28 th of June 1989, Kimeridze discovered yet another supernova (SN 1988A), this time 50\" northwest of the galaxy’s center, which reached ma- gnitude 12.2. Observation A 7 th -magnitude star directly west of M 58 makes it fairly easy to fi nd this galaxy. With 10×50 binoculars it appears as just a rounded ne- bulous spot. 4.7 inches of aperture show a bright, elliptical galaxy, elongated east-west. A bright central region is surrounded by a faint halo of light. With a 14-inch telescope, the visual extent of M 58 becomes 3'×2'. There is now a core of almost stellar appearance, which is a little elon- gated in the same direction as the whole galaxy. The mottled bar of the galaxy is vaguely visible. From the core, it points to PA 40° and 240°. To the north, bar and core are well defi ned by their contrast with a neighboring, distinctly darker region. Further outside the ga- laxy, a diffuse darker region and a spiral arm can be made out. The latter is seen best about 1' southwest of the core, where it branches off the bar. However, no consistent picture of spiral structure can be perceived. M 58 remains a tough object to observe, the spirals diffi - cult to grasp in visual observation. M 58, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

Köhler used an achromatic refractor of about one-meter focal length. Also following the comet, Oriani and Messier independently found that same galaxy only days later. Messier’s note says: “it is of the same light as that above [M 58], just as faint.” In 1830, John Herschel credited M 59 with only a tiny diameter of 20\" and characterized it as faint and round. D’Arrest did not seem to be too enthusiastic about this galaxy, either. His notes simply read: “becoming denser toward the center like most of the nebulae in this region.” Astrophysics The elliptical galaxy M 59 is one of the smaller members of the Virgo cluster. It has an oval shape, and has received classifi cations of E3 to E5. A modest diameter for M 59 of 76,000 light-years has been derived. This apparently uninspiring ellipse, however, hides interesting ki- nematics. A very bright core, 200 light-years diameter, rotates in the opposite direction to the rest of the galaxy (see M 64), and it appears to consist of young stars. The apparent size of this region is only 1\". It is surrounded by a bright disk 5\" to 7\" in size. Its rotation curve seems to indicate the existence of a central black hole, or some other kind of massive central object, of 300 million solar masses. M 59 is thought to possess 2200 globular clusters, of which 69 have been cataloged. Observation M 59 is faintly visible in 10×50 bi- noculars. A small telescope shows an oval patch of nebulosity with a star-like core. 4.7 inches reveal the elliptical shape more clearly. There is a 12.1-magnitude star 1.8' north of the galaxy’s center. In a 14-inch telescope, the galaxy’s bright core stands out. It is almost stellar, but high magnifi cations reveal its elongation in PA 30°. This core is surrounded by a bright central region only 1.5'×1.0' in size. The fainter, halo-like glow around it brings the total visual extent of M 59 to 2.0'×1.5'. However, the galaxy is still too small to touch the magnitude-12.1 star. There is also a 15 th -magnitude star, only 1' southwest of the galaxy’s center.

It was Johann Gott- fried Köhler who actually saw M 60 fi rst, right after his discovery of M 59, on the 11 th of April 1779. He noted: “Two very small nebulae, hardly visible in a 3-foot telescope, the one above the other.” Barnabus Oriani found M 60 only a day later and remarked: “very pale, looking like the comet.” Messier noticed it, fi nally, on the 15 th of April, without any knowledge of the other observations. He wrote: “[The comet] passed very near, on April 13 th and 14 th , that being both in the fi eld of the refractor, but it [M 60] became visible to him [Messier] only on the 15 th , when looking out for the comet.” Messier described this galaxy as “a little more distinct than the two previous [M 58, M 59].” Admiral Smyth called M 60, together with NGC 4647 (discovered by William Herschel), a “double nebula, the preceding [western] one being extremely faint.” John Herschel, too, characterized the view as a double nebula and wrote: “a very fi ne and curious object. The pre- ceding [NGC 4647] is very faint, the following [M 60] very bright; both large, estimated distance of centers is 4'; position angle 45° north preceding.” Similarly, d’Arrest’s note reads: “Double nebula. M 60 is round and much brighter in the center, its diameter is 100\"; NGC 4647 also round, not more than 3' diameter.” As seen in photos, Curtis gave this description of M 60 in 1918: “2' in diameter, growing rapidly brighter to a very bright central portion, which shows no true nucleus in short exposures; no spiral whorls discernible.” Astrophysics M 60 is the easternmost Messier ga- laxy of the Virgo cluster and forms a chain with M 58 and M 59. The latter is only 25' away. The structu- reless elliptical galaxy M 60 belongs to the larger galaxies of the Virgo cluster, with a diameter of 115,000 light-years and a luminosity of 60 thousand million suns. Its large mass holds on to a large halo of an estimated 3700 globular clusters. The center of M 60 has been studied with the Hubble Space Telescope. It hosts a super-massive object, pre- sumably a black hole, of 4 thousand million solar masses. Only 2.5' northwest, at a projected distance from M 60 of 40,000 light-years, is the barred spiral NGC 4647.

It took him six days to discover his mistake, on the 11 th of May. Messier characterized M 61 as a “very faint nebula and diffi cult to perceive.” 50 years later, John Herschel described the view with the words: “Bright nucleus in a very faint atmosphere of 2' diameter, gradually fading away.” His contemporary, Lord Rosse, recognized the spiral structure of M 61 with his giant 72-inch telescope. He also noticed two knots, which he may have confused with faint foreground stars. D’Arrest was unable to see the spiral structure with the 11-inch re- fractor at his disposal and commented: “Halo of diffuse light around a core, like a mag 13 bright star.” The photographic description by Curtis reads: “Nearly round; 6' in diameter; very bright. A beautiful spiral, with a very bright, almost stellar nucleus, and many almost stellar condensations in its open, somewhat irregular whorls.” Astrophysics Like all three previous Messier ob- jects, M 61 is a member of the Vir- go cluster, at a distance of about 50,000 light-years. Its 6' total size yields an outer diameter of 94,000 light-years, and it contains about 70 thousand million solar masses. Well-resolved photos of M 61 show a bright, round central region of 10.” This is a star-forming disk with a total mass of 500 million suns, in which new stars are being born. Short exposures of this inner region reveal a spiral structure with a bar and numerous star-forming regions. The core itself emits an emission-line spectrum, which makes it a transitional case between a Seyfert-2 galaxy and a LINER object. Spanish astronomers found out in 2003 that this active core is in close co-existence, within just 10 light-years, with a young super star clus- ter (SSC) of 100,000 solar masses and only 4 million years of age. The spiral arms continue outwards into an open, diffuse pattern. This, and the large number of star formation and HII regions, could hint at a possible gravitational interaction with the neighboring ga- laxies NGC 4303A and NGC 4292. Another hint comes from the oddly angled spiral arms. This type of structure, called Vorontsov- Velyaminov chains, probably has its origin in density fl uctuations of the galaxy’s gas.

With a 14-inch telescope, the spiral structure of M 61 is amazing. A very small, but not star-like, core resides in an irregular bar of about 1' length in PA 150°. The southern spiral arm bends westward and meets a magnitude 14.5 star, 1.3' southwest of the core. From there, a fainter arm fragment reaches northward. The northern spiral arm turns towards the east and features unusual, angled bends. A somewhat diffuse region continues eastward. The total visual size of M 61 reaches 2.6'×2.2'.

Hence, this object received a higher number in Messier’s catalog than if he had added it at its fi rst date of observation (i.e., No. 50). Messier described M 62 as a “very fi ne nebula, it resembles a small comet, its center is bright and surrounded by a faint light.” Only a few years later, William Herschel succeeded in resolving this cluster into individual stars. John Herschel, like his father, was challenged by the low height of M 62 above the English horizon, but he noticed its asymmetrical shape. In 1847, he described this globular cluster as “well resolved into stars of 15 th magnitude.” Heber D. Curtis characterized M 62’s morphology as seen on photographic images: “Bright globular cluster, greatly condensed at center, this central part is 1.5' in diameter, main part of cluster 6' di- ameter.” Astrophysics M62 is located behind the galactic center. Its distance to us is 35,000 light-years, less than it is to its apparent neighbor M 19. M 62 be- longs to the globular clusters of the galactic bulge and never moves far away from the galactic center. Its total mass is equivalent to that of 1 million Suns. Tidal interaction with the galactic center has been blamed for some irregularity in the shape of this cluster, the center of which appears to be displaced slightly to the southeast. Shapley, using star counts, found a PA of 75° for this elongation. Well over 200 variable stars are known in M 62, including 205 RR Lyrae stars, which are often found in globular cluters. By con- trast, the apparent neighbor M 19 has only eight known variables! What makes M 62 special are the six millisecond pulsars found in it (see M 53); this is the largest number in any Messier globular cluster. This unique feature may be due to the high star density in the core of the cluster, which has experienced a core collapse (see M 15). The fastest of these pulsars rotates in only 2.295 milliseconds. At least three of them are part of binary systems with white dwarfs, in which the components orbit each other in just a few days. Observation M 62 is easily seen as a small, round nebula in 10×50 binoculars. Under a very dark southern sky, it may even be within reach of the naked eye. Under ideal observing conditions, 4 inches of aperture will suffi ce to resolve M 62 into individual stars. However, due to its low position above the southern horizon in the summer sky, observers based in northern temperate latitudes would usually require noticeably larger apertures. The small, very bright but hardly resolvable core of M 62 appears displaced to the southeast, which gives the whole object a comet-like shape with a “tail” of stars towards the northwest.

Messier observed M 63 on the 14 th of June 1779, and wrote: “it has about the same brightness as the nebula registered under No. 59, it does not contain any star. There is a star of 8 th magnitude near it, which precedes [west of] the nebula.” William Herschel estimated M 63 to be 9' to 10' long and 4' wide. He remarked: “it has a very brilliant nucleus.” His son John deter- mined the PA of the elongation to be 150° and noticed the nearly stellar appearance of the core. He also noted: “The south following [southeastern] end more diffused. Has a bright star north preceding [northwest] and a double star following.” Admiral Smyth, in particular, described the oval shape of M 63 and its “milky-white tint,” while Lord Rosse was able to see hints of spiral structure. Heinrich d’Arrest found a diameter of only 85\" and commented: “nucleus like magnitude 11 star.” Curtis summarized the photographic appearance with the words: “A bright, beautiful spiral 8'×3' in PA 98°. Has an almost stellar nu- cleus. The whorls are narrow, very compactly arranged, and show numerous almost stellar condensations.” Astrophysics M 63 is often considered the most beautiful Messier galaxy on pho- tographs, and it has been nicknamed the “Sunfl ower Nebula.” This idea refers to the fragmented (“fl occulent”) or multiple spiral arm structure which probably comes quite close to the morphology of our own Galaxy. The southern, more dust-rich side of M 63 is closer to us and on a much smaller scale produces an effect similar to the “black eye” in M 64. M 63 belongs to the M 51 group of galaxies at about 27 milli- on light-years distance. That group probably includes NGC 5023, 2° north of M 63, and UGC 8320 more than 4° south. M 63 has been classifi ed as an Sc or Sb spiral, its size just falls short of 100,000 light- years and it contains about 140 thousand million solar masses. The bright central region of M 63, only 6\" in size, could contain a core with 900 million solar masses, which represents, as Pismis et al. (1994) phrased it, a “mildly active nucleus.” According to its emissi- on line spectrum, it is a LINER object (see M 81). The galactic disk of M 63 is surrounded by a cool, fl attened envelope of neutral hydrogen (HI), which is tilted 20º with respect to the plane of the galaxy. The only supernova observed so far in M 63, SN 1971I, reached a peak brightness of magnitude 11.8 on the 25 th of May 1971. M 63, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

High po- wer reveals mottled brightenings in the surrounding halo, but these cannot be grasped individually.

Pigott wrote about his discovery: “Its light being exceedingly weak, I could not see it in the two-feet telescope of our quadrant.” Only 12 days later, Johann Elert Bode made an independent discovery of this galaxy, which he described as a “small nebulous star.” Charles Messier had no know- ledge of either observation when he found M 64 on the 1 st of March 1780. He characterized it as a bit fainter than M 53. 50 years later, John Herschel wrote this about M 64: “I am much mistaken if the nucleus not be a double star, in the general direction of the nebula: magnifi cation 320× much increases this suspicion; 240× shows well a vacuity below (north of) the nucleus.” With that “vacuity,” Herschel was the fi rst to recognize the now popular “Devil’s Eye,” “Evil Eye,” or “Black Eye” in M 64. Heinrich d’Arrest missed this detail. He commented about an “unexpectedly brighter center which may be partially resolvable” and measured the visual angular size as 140\" by 95\". Even more convinced about resolving M 64 into stars was Lord Rosse. Unaware of the large distance and true nature of this object, he wrote: “Of a round shape, with a dark and a bright spot on one side. With much certainty, this is a starcluster.” In 1918, Curtis delivered a substantial description of this galaxy, based on deep photographic exposures: “The central portion of this fi ne nebula is very bright, and there is a bright, almost stellar nucle- us. It is 8'×4' in PA 110°. The whorls are rather compact, and of very uniform texture, without irregularities or condensations. The most striking feature of this spiral is the somewhat irregular, but very clear- cut, absorption area on the north of the nucleus.\" Astrophysics The “Black Eye” of M 64 on the northern side of the galaxy core is formed by a complicated structure of absorbing dark clouds. These are concentrated on the southern side of the galaxy disk, which is tipped toward us. Thus, the dark, dusty complex of clouds stands out against the bright central region behind it only on one side of the nucleus. Detailed images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope show a large number of HII and star-forming regions, embedded between the dark clouds of dust. These regions become more numerous to- wards the galaxy core, while there is very little structure in the ou- ter regions. This led de Vaucouleurs to a classifi cation of M 64 as a SA(rs)ab spiral. Braun and colleagues (1994) found that the many star-forming regions in M 64 are created by a steep gradient in the rotational velo- city of the gas. The central region, within a radius of 3000 light-years, actually rotates against the sense of the outer parts of the galaxy disk. The star formation sites are observed in the only 1500-light-year wide zone of rotational inversion, from +180 km/s to –200 km/s. A possi- ble origin of this unusual kinematics could lie in the cannibalization of a former companion galaxy, but some authors suggest M 64 was simply born that way. M 64.

Weak spectral emission structures led to a classifi cation of a Seyfert-2 galaxy (see M 77). Some authors see M 64 as a transitional case towards LINER objects (see M 81). In addition, M 64 has been identifi ed as the radio source PKS 1254+21. The distance of this galaxy, which has a radial veloci- ty away from us of 377 km/s, has been revised substan- tially in the past. Holmberg believed in a membership of the Virgo cluster and suggested 44 million light-years, but more recent studies have suggested much smaller di- stances, down to 13.5 million light- years. At 18 million light-years away, determined in 2003, M 64 is one-third the distance of the Virgo cluster. NGC 4789A, 7.4° to the east, is a physical companion of M 64. De Vaucouleurs suggested that these two gala- xies form a small group with M 94, which has a similar distance from us. Observation M 64 looks like a faint star in 10×50 binocu- lars. Small telescopes show it as a small, oval nebula of large surface brightness, but without a core. A 4.7-inch refractor reveals a core of almost stellar appearance in an elongated galaxy with a ratio of 2:1. Northeast, near the core, a dark, peanut-sized absorp- tion can be perceived with higher magnifi cation, the “black eye.” A 14-inch telescope shows the eye immediately as a banana-shaped shadow. It keeps a distance of 20\" from the bright, 5\" oval core, which is hosted by a central region of 40\"×25\". The dark crescent starts narrow at PA 110°, then gets wider and diffuse, and fi nally fades away at PA 0°, directly north of the core. The outer edge of the eye is brighter than the surrounding galaxy and contributes to the inner side of a 1.2'×0.8' diffuse ring, elongated in PA 115°. Further outside follows a very dif- fuse darker zone northeast of the core, which leads into a second, outer ring of 5.5'×2.2', with the same orien- tation as the inner one. This is a distinct feature only on the “black eye” side – on the other side, the galaxy’s light decreases more gradually outward from the core. There is a faint, magnitude-15 star on the southern edge of the galaxy. Two other, fainter foreground stars in the eastern part of M 64 are not visible with 14 in- ches of aperture. A bright star, 4' northeast, marks the exact position angle of the black eye. M 64, historical drawings. John Herschel (before 1833), William Lassell (1862). M 64, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

Charles Messier, who observed both galaxies on the 1 st of March 1780, did not make any mention of Méchain in this case, although he credited all the other discoveries of his colleague. It may just be possible that Glyn Jones was mistaken here; after all, there are no other sources in support of Méchain. Hence, we consider Messier as the discoverer of this nice galaxy pair. The Frenchman remarked on M 65: “it is very faint and does not contain any star.” William Herschel saw “two opposite very faint branches” and noted the total length of the galaxy as 12'. In 1830, John Herschel described M 65 as having “a large, resolvable center with two faint branches, extended in a PA 45° north preceding [northwest] to south following [southeast].” Lord Rosse observed M 65 on several occasions. In 1848, he re- marked: “A curious nebula with a bright nucleus; resolvable; a spi- ral or annular arrangement about it; no other portion of the nebula resolved.” “Resolution” did not necessarily mean to the lord and his contemporaries the visibility of individual stars, but this term equal- ly refers to resolving structure and dots in a diffuse object. In 1854, Rosse saw “curious dark spots to both sides of the nucleus,\" which were only later identifi ed as dust lanes. Heinrich d’Arrest observed with an 11\" refractor from near Copen- hagen, Denmark, and gave this description: “very beautiful, strongly elongated, gradually brighter toward center, at 147× resolvable into faint stars: arms stretched out from both sides, almost in north-south direction.” We may safely assume that the German astronomer did not truly see individual stars in M 65 – rather, perhaps, brighter dots, like Lord Rosse. The well-known German lunar observer Mädler described M 65 more realistically as a “very longish nebula, consisting of a core and two arms, which stretch out with decreasing light intensity 3.3' in opposite directions. The whole has a length towards 7.7' and a dark appearance. No stars can be distinguished in it.” The photographic appearance has been documented by Curtis with the words: “A beautiful, bright spiral 8'×2' in PA 174°. Whorls rather indistinct, with one almost stellar condensation; bright, almost stellar nucleus. Absorption lane on the east.” Astrophysics M 65 is a type Sa spiral galaxy that we see 74° inclined to our line of sight. M 66, only 20' to the east, is a physical companion.

Similar distances are found for the galaxy group around M 96, with M 95 and M 105, and we may conclude that these groups are loosely associated. M 65 itself consists of a central lens of yellowish older stars, and of tightly wound spiral arms with prominent dust lanes and a few bluish star-forming regions. In contrast to M 66, M 65 does not seem to have undergone any recent close encounters with another galaxy. This has been confi rmed by a study of Afanasiev, focusing on the fi ve thousand million year old starburst-ring with a 15\" diameter around the core. Hence, in terms of star formation, M 65 cannot compete with the much more active M 66. Observation Observed with 10×50 binoculars, M 65 and M 66 form a nice pair of faint nebulous spots. In a small telescope, M 65 appears as the more elongated of the two galaxies. Its orientation is almost exactly in the north-south direction. A 4.7-inch refractor shows the strong elongation of M 65 very clearly; it has a 4:1 ratio and a PA of 10°. A bright, oval core is em- bedded asymmetrically in a 5' long, nebulous bar. In addition, there is a 12 th -magnitude star 2.5' southeast of the galaxy center. When observing with 14 inches of aperture, the visual extent of M 65 reaches 6'×2'. A small, oval core of less than 10\" diameter is embedded in a bright central region that has a sharp edge on its eas- tern border. This is due to a dark lane along the galaxy’s eastern side, of which only a vague perception can be obtained. 25\" east of the core, there is a faint star right on this dust lane. Dark spiral struc- ture and fragments of arms become more distinct towards the north and south. However, their rotational sense cannot be determined.

Charles Messier, ho- wever, made no such note in his description, although he did in all other cases, and there are no other hints to any initial observation by Méchain. With certainty, though, we have the observation by Mes- sier made on the 1 st of March 1780. He describes this galaxy as “very weak” and recounts: “The comet observed in 1773 and 1774 passed right through these two nebulae [M 65 and M 66] on the 1 st and 2 nd of November 1773. Messier did not see them, without doubt due to the light of the comet.” John Herschel noted a size of 3' by 2' in PA 60° and saw it “sud- denly brighter toward the middle.” Later, Lord Rosse made out “dark dots to both sides of the core,” while d’Arrest characterized M 66 as a twin of M 65. Curtis gave this description in 1918, based on pho- tographic images: “A very bright, beautiful, spiral 8'×2.5' in PA 180°. Bright, slightly elongated nucleus; the whorls are somewhat irregular and show numerous condensations.” Astrophysics Together with M 65 and NGC 3628, M 66 forms the popular Leo Triplet, with a distance of 33 million light-years. However, there is also a fourth, more widely separated member of this group of gala- xies, NGC 3593. M 66 has a very similar size to M 65. Two spiral arms originate from the ends of a short, bright bar in the center. While the eastern arm is closely wound around the galaxy, we fi nd the western arm somewhat angled and, apparently, angled away from the galaxy. The true 3D morphology of M 66 is a bit different: in fact, the spiral arms are warped with respect to the well-inclined galaxy plane, and the eastern arm curves to cover part of the central region. This deformation is the result of a past encounter with another galaxy in the Leo Triplet. The most likely candidate is NGC 3628 in the north: in very deep exposures, a 40'-long cloud of gas and stars is seen stretched out eastwards over nearly 400,000 light-years. It has been suggested that an encounter with M 66 lost a total of some hundreds of thousands of solar masses about a thousand million years ago. Hence, Halton Arp rightfully added M 66 to his list of peculiar galaxies as entry number 16, while the entire Leo group is an addi- tional entry as number 317. M 66 has also been classifi ed as a LINER (see M 81), or as a tran- sitional case, since its core spectrum shows some features typical of Seyfert-2-galaxies (see M 77). The radio spectrum of the core resem- bles that of a low-luminosity AGN (active galactic nucleus). Three supernovae have been discovered in M 66. SN 1979R re- ached magnitude 15 on the 12 th of December 1973. SN 1989B was discovered by the Australian amateur astronomer Evans, on the 31 st of January 1989, and it reached magnitude 12.2 the next day. On the 15 th of April 1997, SN 1997bs was discovered at Lick Observatory at magnitude 17. Considering this low brightness, van Dyck and col- leagues later (2000) argued that it was, in fact, not a real supernova but an K -Carinae-type outburst, like the supposed “supernova” 1961V in NGC 1058, and 1954J in NGC 2403.

He de- scribed it as a “rather prominent nebula of longish shape,” but his observation was not published. Hence, Messier made an independent discovery of this cluster when he found it on the 6 th of April 1780, and saw a “cluster of small stars with nebulosity.” A few years later, William Herschel described M 67 as a “very beautiful and pretty much compressed cluster of stars, easily to be seen by any good telescope and in which I have observed above 200 stars at once in the fi eld of view of my great refl ector, with a power of 157.” His son John gave a brightness range of magnitude 11 to 15 for the cluster stars and wrote: “It is preceded by a rich region of stars of 9 th and 10 th magnitude.” D’Arrest saw a “dainty star cluster, the stars have a brightness of magnitudes 11 to 13,” while Smyth likened its shape to that of a “Phrygian cap,” like those worn by bishops. Heinrich Maedler saw, like William Herschel, “about 200 stars in a space of 12' to 15' diameter. The stars differ a lot in their shimmer, and there is only little concentration toward the middle.” Leo Bren- ner commented: “In the viewfi nder apparent as a nebulous patch, but already in low magnifi cation recognizable as a star cluster and a splendid object. Surrounded by a semicircle of brighter stars, there are laid out 230 stars of magnitude 9 to 12.5.” Finally, Curtis quoted a photographic diameter of 16'. Astrophysics M 67 is one of the oldest open clu- sters known. A recent estimate pu- blished by Michaud and colleagues (2004) gives 3.7 thousand million years, which is almost the age of our Solar System. It will continue to exist for a further fi ve thousand million years, which is its remai- ning dynamical lifespan. Only a very few open clusters are older: NGC 188 is one of these, at 6.4 thousand million years old. A controversial case is NGC 6791, for which ages between 2.4 and 8 thousand million years have been derived. M 67 owes its long survival and large dynamical lifespan to its richness and, in particular, to its large distance from the galactic pla- ne and the galactic center, which let it avoid disruptive gravitational interactions. At a distance of just under 3000 light-years, a total di- ameter of 21 light-years is derived. The great age of M 67 allows us to see a large number of high- ly evolved stars in this cluster. It is rich in red giant stars – at least 20 are confi rmed, with nearly 1.5 solar masses – and there are over 150 white dwarfs, according to Richer and colleagues. In addition, 23 “blue stragglers” have been found, which are more typical of the older and denser globular clusters. According to Sandquist, the brightest blue straggler is one of the brightest stars in M 67 at 10 th magnitude and has a luminosity 50 times higher than the Sun. Because of this remarkable diversity of the M 67 stars, this cluster has been the subject of many photometric studies. Thus, its 13 brigh- test stars, in particular, have been photometric standard stars for the UBVRI and ubvy E fi lter systems for decades. A total of 776 stars down to magnitude 17 are supposed to be true cluster members according to Balaguer-Núñez (2007). These in- clude 8 confi rmed and 4 suspected variables and, in particular, 4 W UMa eclipsing variables. One of them is AH Cnc, which varies between magnitude 13.3 and 13.7 with a period of only 0.36 days. Some blue stragglers of the RS CVn type also exhibit small bright- ness variations. The cluster M 67 has been classifi ed on the Trümpler scale by dif- ferent authors as II2r, II2m, or II3r. Observation On a clear mountain night, M 67 can be spotted with the naked eye, as reported by O’Meara. In a small binocular with 15mm lenses, M 67 appears as an elongated, nebulous patch. 10×50 binoculars reveal a granulated cloud of light with a star on its northern edge. A telescope of 2 inches, used with a magnifi cation of 50×, resolves the 12' cluster into individual stars – this demonstrates the relatively poor optical quality of the instruments of the discoverer of M 67, Köhler. The number of visible cluster stars grows signifi cantly with tele- scope aperture. There are about 30 with 2.5 inches, 50 with 6 inches, and over 100 with 12 inches. In large telescopes, the richness of the cluster is impressive; it reaches a visual diameter of 20', and is round in shape. With smaller apertures, however, the cluster appears slightly elongated in the east-west direction. A number of observers have commented metaphorically on the apparent star chains of M 67.

Hence, in agreement with most authors, we give the credit of discovery to Messier. William Herschel described M 68 as “a beautiful cluster of stars, extremely rich, and so compressed that most of the stars are blended together.” His son John saw it “all clearly resolved into stars of 12 th magnitude, very loose and ragged at the borders.” Smyth, by contrast, was hampered by his smaller telescope and the haze of English midlands. He only saw a “large, round and very pale nebula.” His countryman and contemporary, Reverend Webb, howe- ver, described M 68 as “well resolved” and noticed a red star. Astrophysics M 68 not only appears to be far away from the Milky Way as seen from our viewpoint, but it is also a typical cluster of the outer ga- lactic halo. Its 500-million-year orbit has a considerable eccentricity of 0.5 and leads M 68 up to 100,000 light-years away from the ga- lactic center. Its present distance to Earth is 36,000 light-years, which yields a moderate physical diameter of 120 light-years for this cluster. Its class X means that M 68 has one of the lowest concentrations of all Messier globular clusters. M 68 is over 10 thousand million years old and has a low metal abundance (see M 79). 42 variables are known in it, including 2 SX Phoenicis and 40 RR Lyrae stars. Tweenty-seven of these were found by Shapley. By contrast, nearby FI Hydrae is a variable unrelated to M 68, northeast of the cluster. The brightest individual stars reach magnitude 12.6, and Hogg found 25 stars brighter than magnitude 14.8. The horizontal branch stars, which are a good distance indicator for globular clusters, reach magnitude 15.6. There is, however, still disagreement over the total brightness of M 68. Glyn Jones quoted 8.2, modern catalogs 7.3, and O’Meara fi nds 7.6 the most adequate value. Observation O’Meara regards M 68 as a “won- derfully challenging” object for na- ked-eye detection, but any successful sighting would certainly require an excellent site high in the mountains. The visibility of M 68 as a small nebula in 10×50 binoculars, however, is certain. Since the brightest cluster stars have the same brightness as those of the more popular M 3, resolution of M 68 should begin with a modest aperture of about 4 inches. This is al- most impossible to achieve from sites in Europe and the northern USA, because of the bad seeing caused by this object being so low above the horizon. If located high in the sky, as from southern latitudes, M 68 can be resolved into individual stars even in the center with a telescope of 8 to 10 inches. With a diameter of 10', it is one of the visually larger globular clusters. It has a noticeably wide center, and 5' northwest of its core is a reddish star. The magnitude 5.4 star HD 109799 lies 45' southwest of M 68. It has a challenging companion (van den Bos 230) of magnitude only 11.3, just 1.4\" away in PA 179°. Furthermore, the Mira star FI Hydrae, with a period of 324 days, is only 7.4' away northeast of M 68.

Entry I.11 in his catalog published in 1755 reads: “nebula without star, resembles the small nucleus of a comet.” Charles Messier looked for this object without success in 1764, since the position given by Lacaille was wrong by 1.2°. 16 years later, on the 31 st of August 1780, Messier fi nally suc- ceeded in rediscovering this southern globular, which became his No. 69. He recognized that this was Lacaille’s object and commen- ted: “Nebula without stars, near it is a star of the 9 th magnitude. Its light is very faint.” John Herschel saw M 69 as a star cluster and characterized it as “bright, large, round, well resolved, stars from 14 th to 16 th magnitu- de.” Curtis' photographic description reads: “Bright globular cluster 3' in diameter.” Astrophysics The distance to M 69, which is 37,000 light-years, gives this clus- ter a location 5000 light-years behind the galactic center, but also 5000 light-years below the galactic plane. Hence, M 69 belongs to the inner galactic bulge, which it never leaves. Its age is about 14 thou- sand million years, and the largest angular diameter in deep, modern photographs of 10' corresponds to a total physical size of 110 light- years. Its mass is an estimated 300,000 solar masses. For a globular cluster, it has quite a generous abundance of heavy elements, related to its origin near the galactic center. The individual stars, the brightest reach magnitude 13.2, are grou- ped around a relatively compact center. 61 variables have been found in M 69, among them 8 RR Lyrae stars, 48 variables of the SX Phoenicis type, and 10 eclipsing binaries. They include the two brightest cluster members and two Mira stars: V1894 Sgr (magnitude 13.3–18.8) 1.5' sou- theast of the center, and V3480 Sagittarii (magnitude 15.5–18.2) 5' west. In 1986, a star with a temporary magnitude of 12.5 and a spectrum with emission lines was observed. A later analysis showed that it was not a nova but an unusual Mira variable. Observation Southeast of an 8 th -magnitude fi eld star, a very small nebula can be made out even in 10×50 binoculars. In a telescope, this round object assumes a size of 2.5'. To see individual stars, a telescope with 6 to 8 inches of aperture is required. Then, a dark region near the southern edge of the cluster appears like a gap or dark line.

The great observer commented on M 70 as a “miniature of M 3.” The Australian observer James Dunlop observed M 70 fi ve times and described his view as “a pretty bright, round nebula, 1.5' diame- ter, very much condensed to the center.” In 1918, Curtis noted, on photographic images of M 70: “bright, condensed cluster 2' in diameter, doubtless globular.” Astrophysics M 70 is only slightly closer to us than M 69, and it, too, is a globu- lar cluster of the galactic bulge. M 70’s orbit never leaves the galactic bulge. Presently, it is receding from us at 200 km/s and has a distance of 7000 light-years from the galactic center. Consequently, it should suffer from tidal interaction. The brighter region of the cluster has a 4' diameter, but its halo reaches 7.8'. The latter gives M 70 a total physical size of 80 light-years; it has a total mass of 200,000 Suns. The core region of M 70 is densely packed with stars. This cluster has already undergone a core collapse, as about 20% of all globular clusters in the Milky Way have. This is a dynamical instability that, in the course of numerous close encounters, relatively quickly leads to a very high star density in the central region, driven by gravita- tional attraction and by a transfer of kinetic energy into the outer regions of the cluster. The brightest individual stars of M 70 reach only a meager magni- tude 14.0, due to the distance and interstellar extinction. Only very few variables have been found: the fi rst two RR Lyrae stars were dis- covered by Rosino in 1962; Liller added another four in 1983. Spec- troscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope helped to identify the two brightest stars in the center of the cluster as probable “blue stragg- lers” (see M 30). In 1995, not far east from M 70, the US amateur astronomers Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp discovered their bright comet. Observation M 70 is faintly visible even with 50mm binoculars. In a small te- lescope, it appears as a small, nebulous ball. It differs from nearby M 69 only in having a much denser, yet extended, core – the visual testimony of the core collapse mentioned above. With an aperture of 8 inches, individual stars are successfully re- solved. In the outskirts northeast of M 70, a wide pair of two stars of magnitude 11 points due north. Another pair can be found further away to the north. The visual diameter of M 70 is only about 3'.

It received No. 13 in his short list of nebulous stars, which, unfortu- nately, was only read before the Paris Academy of Sciences and was never published in print. Hence, this and all other observations of de Chéseaux were soon forgotten. A new discovery of this object was made by Johann Gottfried Köhler in Dresden, Germany, some time between 1772 and 1779. He described it as a “very pale nebulous patch in Sagitta.” Köhler’s obser- vations took a long time to become known in France. Even the third discovery of M 71, on the 28 th of June 1780, by Pierre Méchain, must be regarded as independent. He delegated his fi nd to Charles Messier, who remarked on the 4 th of October 1780: “it is very faint and does not contain any star.” William Herschel was able to resolve this globular cluster into in- dividual stars, and his son John characterized it very nicely: “Irregu- larly round cluster of very small stars, inclining to triangular form.” In a more extended description written in 1830, he also said: “A fi ne object; stars of 11 th to 16 th magnitude; the most condensed part is 3' in diameter, of a triangular fi gure, the angle northward.” Webb com- mented that in his 3.7-inch refractor, M 71 appeared “hazy to low power, yielding to a cloud of faint stars to higher powers.” On the fi rst photographs of the early twentieth century, Curtis spotted only a “rather sparse globular cluster 5' in diameter.” Astrophysics Is M 71 an old, compact open clus- ter, or a loose globular cluster? This question remained unsolved for many decades and is sometimes debated still today. Morphologically M 71 bears similarity to both the compact open cluster M 11, as well as the poor, hardly concentra- ted globular cluster M 68. Hence, Shapley and Trümpler considered M 71 as an open cluster. In 1943, James Cuffey, on the other hand, classifi ed it as a loose globular cluster of concentration class X to XII. However, his CMD (color-magnitude diagram) obtained in 1959 rather bears characteristics of an open cluster. Even the abundance of heavy elements and metals, which is rat- her high for its age, does not settle this case either way. Nevertheless, by today’s consensus M 71 is a globular cluster, and a modern study draws some parallels to NGC 104 (47 Tucanae), which undoubtedly is a true globular. M 71 has a distance of 18,000 light-years from us. On its mildly eccentric (0.2) orbit around the galactic center, which takes the cluster 160 million years to complete, it always remains within the galactic disk. Frequent close encounters with other galactic objects probably explain its remaining mass of only 40,000 Suns and its unusually small size, when compared with other globular clusters, of only 40 light-years. The brightest individual stars in M 71 reach a respectable magnitu- de of 12.1, but most cluster stars are fainter than 14. Only 40 variables have been found in M 71, but no RR Lyrae stars, the typical globular cluster variable. Z Sagittae, discovered in 1912 by Silbernagel, with a brightness change of mag 13.6b to 15.8b, is one of over six red giants in M 71. Park and Nemec identifi ed a few eclipsing binaries, 24 were recently found by Korean astronomers (2006). The brightest example is QU Sagittae (mag 15.2p to 17.0p). Furthermore, there are a few blue pulsation variables of the SX Phoenicis type. Thirteen suspected 50 “blue stragglers” (see M 80) were confi rmed in 2000 by Geffert and Maintz as true cluster members. Not physically belonging to M 71, however, is the eclipsing variable FX Sagittae 8' east of the cluster center. Its brightness varies between magnitudes 14.4 and 15.8 with a period of 1.15 days. Observation M 71 is seen with relative ease in 10×50 binoculars as a small diffuse nebulous spot. The impression remains that of a nebula when using a small telescope. With 3 inches aperture, the brightest stars of M 71 become visible, but they are hardly noticeable among the many stars of the rich, surrounding fi eld of the Milky Way. A 4.7-inch refractor, used with medium to high magnifi cation, shows a swarm of about 30 faint stars. The triangular form of M 71 appeals to the observer, and the low degree of concentration is also obvious. The visual diameter is 5'. With larger telescopes, the impression of this cluster becomes ever richer in stars, but it is diffi cult to distinguish between the clus- ter stars and foreground or background stars of the rich Milky Way. The most prominent feature of M 71 is the rounded tip of its denser central region, which points southwest. A few visual observers have reported an impression of dark eyes in the central region, or of linear dark structures in the eastern part of this globular cluster."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"255 M 71 is a globular cluster with little concentration and rather poor in stars.

He reported his fi nd to Messier who observed it on the 4 th /5 th of Oc- tober the same year and described it as a “nebula, its light faint as the previous [M 71], near it is a telescopic star.” Three years later, William Herschel recognized the true nature of this globular cluster. In 1810, the great observer described at length how M 72 looked to him at 280× magnifi cation: “It is a cluster of stars of a round fi gure, but the very faint stars on the outside of glo- bular clusters are generally a little dispersed so as to deviate from a perfectly circular form. It is very gradually extremely condensed in the center, but, with much attention, even there, the stars may be di- stinguished. It is not possible to form an idea of the number of stars that may be in such a cluster; but I think we cannot estimate them by hundreds.” His son John agreed with that in his fi rst note on this cluster: “Pretty bright; very compressed cluster; irregularly round; barely re- solved; very gradually brighter toward the middle; resolved into very small stars; many straggling stars near, but none so small as those of the cluster.” But after a later observation of M 72, he had a so- mewhat different impression: “Faint; round; 2' diameter; resolvable, but I do not see the stars separated enough to count them. Is rather an insignifi cant object.” Admiral Smyth, who was in close contact with John Herschel, saw M 72 resolved in his 5.9-inch refractor as a “globular cluster of minute stars.” Heinrich d’Arrest was using a telescope twice that diameter and, for him, M 72 looked “bright, irregularly round, partially resolved with 95× magnifi cation. Very rich heap of the most minute stars, well resol- ved with 132× magnifi cation. Shape irregular or nearly oval.” Heber Curtis summarized the photographic appearance in 1918: “small, bright cluster 3' in diameter, globular, comparatively open.” Astrophysics At 58,000 light-years away, M 72 is one of the most distant globular clusters in Messier’s list. Its location lies far beyond the galactic cen- ter, and the cluster circles the galaxy in a retrograde orbit. Hence, it has been speculated that M 72 was once captured from a companion galaxy, after a close encounter. A good candidate for the victim is the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr Dwarf, not to be confused with the SagDEG, which hosts M 54). Due to the large distance, the brightest individual stars of M 72 reach only magnitude 14.2. According to Hogg, the 25 brightest mem- bers have an average magnitude of 15.9. M 72 shows little concen- tration and has been classifi ed as a class IX globular cluster. Only a handful of the Messier globulars, i.e. M 55 and M 71, are even less compact. The total mass of M 72 has been estimated as a meager 200,000 Suns. This metal-poor cluster belongs to the objects of the outer galac- tic Halo. 51 variables are known in M 72, the fi rst 34 were found by 1920 by Shapley and Ritchie. Unsurprisingly, they are mostly of the RR Lyrae type. 1.6° north of M 72, we fi nd the faint dwarf galaxy MCG-2-53-3, better known as the “Aquarius Dwarf.” It is located far in the back- ground of the cluster, at a distance of 3 million light-years. Observation In 10×50 binoculars, M 72 is seen as just a faint small nebulous spot. In modest telescopes, it is a more distinct but starless ball of nebu- losity, 2' in diameter. There is also a foreground star of magnitude 9.5' east. Resolution of this globular cluster into individual stars re- quires telescope apertures as large as 8 inches or more. Then, faint stars become visible even in front of the loosely concentrated central region. With a 14-inch telescope, a brighter central region of 3' is seen, with brighter cluster stars in front of a nebulous background. The outer region of the cluster reaches only a diameter of 5'.

On the night of the 4 th to the 5 th of October 1780, while obviously looking for Méchain’s M 72, Messier came across a “cluster of three or four faint stars, which resembles a nebula at fi rst glance, contains some nebulosity.” He made a mistake with the positi- on, but it turned out all right, although he was using HD 19843 as his reference star instead of, as noted, Aqr. Later observers located M 73, even though it is not very spectacular. These four stars of Messier even made it into John Herschel’s ‘General Catalogue’ of (GC 4617, “extremely poor”), and from thereon into the NGC. Even later, M 73 remained the subject of confusion; Per Collinder confused it with M 72 and classifi ed it as a globular cluster. This mi- stake was then transcribed into many subsequent catalogs. Astrophysics Now, is M 73 the poor remains of an old open cluster, or is it a coincidental alignment, from our perspective, of some physically un- related stars? The certain facts are these: four stars with magnitudes 10.5, 11.3, 11.9, and 11.9 fi ll a small area with 1.4' diameter, and all four stars are evolved giants. But did they form at the same time, and are they at the same distance? In 1979, Murdin, Allen, and Malin made the following calculation: The probability of fi nding four stars brighter than magnitude 12 within a specifi c patch of 1' is two in a thousand million. However 150 million such areas fi ll the sky. In total, there remains a fair 1 in 4 chance. Nevertheless, those authors held M 73 for a physical object and gave its distance as 2000 light-years. In 2000, Bassino, Waldhausen, and Martinez also regarded M 73 as an open cluster, which they give a larger outer diameter of 9'. In this fi eld, they studied 144 stars, of which they fi nd 24 to be cluster members; these include all stars brighter than magnitude 14.5. The authors derived a cluster age for M 73 of two to three thousand mil- lion years. But in 2002, Odenkirchen and Soubiran disagreed with this. Their study is based on spectroscopic observations of the six brightest stars, within 6' around the four Messier stars, carried out with the 1.93m te- lescope of the Haute-Provence Observatory (France), and it produced no evidence for a common origin. Proper motion measurements do not support that interpretation, either. Hence, M 73 is probably just a chance alignment, and the table below lists the suggested distances and accurate positions of the four Messier stars. Observation Messier’s impression of a nebulous object is suggested only by very small or poor telescopes. Even a refractor of 3 inches shows M 73 as three stars, forming an equilateral triangle, and a fourth, fainter star nearby, to the west of the western triangle tip. The nice double star Hussey 82, two stars of magnitudes 9.2 and 9.6 separated by 2.6\" in PA 7°, can be found only 12' west of M 73. M 73 is a chance pattern of stars at different distances from us.

He plainly noted “nebula without star” and gave it number 74 in his catalog. John Herschel described his fi rst view as “extremely faint; 5' dia- meter with a brighter mass of 1' diameter in the center, and this again pretty suddenly brighter toward the middle to a suspected star. Several very small stars nearby.” After a later observation, he had mistakenly convinced himself that M 74 was a globular cluster and noted now: “Globular cluster; faint; very large; round; very gradually, then pretty suddenly much brighter to the middle; partially resolved.” Rosse, in 1844, recognized spiral structure in M 74, but in 1851 he wrote: “Center formed of stars, easily seen to be such.” Foreground stars probably deceived the great observer. D’Arrest characterized M 74 as “pale and tenuous, very much denser toward the center; the central part is almost round,” and he measured a visual diameter of only 40\". The misclassifi cation as a globular cluster, however, survived into the twentieth century – pro- bably due to the authority of John Herschel. It is found even in some 40-year-old catalogs and star charts. In 1918, Curtis made it absolu- tely clear, based on his deep photographs, that M 74 is “an unusual- ly beautiful and symmetric spiral, showing numerous, almost stellar condensations. Nucleus bright and small, but not stellar.” Astrophysics M 74 certainly is a grand-design spiral galaxy, and de Vaucouleurs classifi ed it as a type SA(s)c. Our modern distance measures (as of 2005) still vary between 25 and 31 million light-years, depending on the method used. Its total mass has been estimated as 300 thousand million solar masses, while its physical diameter depends on its actual distance: between 77,000 and 96,000 light-years. The approximately 7000 light-year-wide spiral arms are made up of bluish, young star clusters and red HII regions, which are testimo- ny to an active star-forming history in the past 500 million years. In 1976, Hodge cataloged 730 HII regions in M 74, and Ivanov et al. found 147 star associations. M 74 is embedded in a disk of neutral hydrogen, twice the size of the galaxy itself. It shows disruptions, although there are no galaxies nearby that would be candidates for recent encounters. The formati- on of the spiral arms is usually explained in terms of density waves, which can also be induced by gravitational interaction during an encounter with another galaxy. The star-forming regions and spiral arms mark the locations of density maxima in the waves. M 74, drawing. 20-inch Newtonian. Ronald Stoyan."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"260 M 74.

(2003) dis- covered a bright, varia- ble X-ray source, which undergoes radiation changes by an order of magnitude within just 30 minutes. Therefore, the source must be very compact, comparable in size to the inner solar system, and it could be a micro-quasar. There may also be some con- nection with the active star-forming regions nearby. M 74 is the gravita- tional center of a small group of galaxies. This includes the barred spiral NGC 660 and the fainter galaxies UGC 891, UGC 1176, UGC 1195, UGC 1200, and UGCA 20. According to Sharina and colleagues, UGC 1171 and 1104 are ad- ditional group members. On the 29 th of January 2002, the Japanese amateur astronomer Yoji Hirose discovered a supernova in M 74, 4.5' southwest of the galaxy’s core and of magnitude 14.5. SN 2002ap considerably increased its brightness in the following days, to 13.4 on the 31 st of January and 12.5 on the 3 rd of February. It reached maximum brightness with a plateau at magnitude 12.3 between the 5 th and the 12 th of February 2002. Its considerable brightness and its spectrum led to a classifi cation of a type Ib/c supernova, the result of the collapse of a very massive star. The peak brightness of a hundred times that of an ordinary type Ia super- nova made some authors even talk about SN2002ap as a ‘hypernova.’ The progenitor star had an estimated 40 solar masses. Only a year later, on the 12 th of June 2003, Robert Evans discove- red yet another supernova in M 74, SN 2003gd, about 3' south of the core in the southern spiral arm. It was magnitude 13.2 at discovery, and continuously faded to 16.2 by the 30 th of July of that year. Observation M 74 is regarded, after M 91, as the second most diffi cult Messier object for visual observation. Because it has the lowest surface brightness of all, this is particularly true under a light-polluted sky. For any suc- cessful observation, the quality of the night sky matters more than the telescope. 10×50 binoculars show M 74 as a faint, nebulous spot. Small te- lescopes display a small galaxy core, surrounded by a faint, round halo with a diameter of 5'. This visual impression remains more or less the same with increasing aperture. With a 14-inch telescope, a core of about 1' diameter is seen, which resembles the core of an unresolved globular cluster. A faint foreground star at its southern side adds to this impression. The spi- ral arms take a lot of concentration and can be made out only with much diffi culty. The brighter arm emerges from the central glow in the southwest, near a second foreground star. It then makes a half- turn around the northern side of the core, increasing in distance. The fainter arm appears to emerge northeast of the core and then turns southwest. The spiral structure is easier to verify with an aperture of 20 in- ches, but still not without some effort. A telescope of this size even shows the brightest HII regions and gives a visual extent to the galaxy of 6'×4', elongated in PA 140°. The northern spiral arm is now seen to emerge from the southeast of the core region, near the position of the fi rst, nearer foreground star. It is well defi ned but loses a lot of substance further along its course. The origin of the southern spiral arm remains vague, but it can be perceived quite clearly southeast and south of the galaxy core. It contains the two brightest HII regions of M 74, Hodge 627 and 598, seen as faint spots 2' south and 2.5' southwest of the galaxy center.

Messier confi rmed Méchain’s fi nd with two observations, made on the 5 th and 18 th of October the same year, but his impression was one of very faint stars. This seems unlikely, though; only William Herschel was truly able to resolve this star clus- ter with his much larger apertures, four years later. He characterized M 75 as a miniature version of M 3. Smyth appeared disappointed and described M 75 as a “lucid white mass among some glimpse stars.” He criticized Messier as “courageous” to have included this cluster in his catalog. Heinrich d’Arrest had 11 inches of aperture at his disposal, twice as much as Smyth. Hence, he wrote about M 75 that it was “very bright, much brighter in the center. Accompanied by many small stars, one with mag 12.” He also determined a visual diameter of 75\" to 80\". Curtis again gave a description of the photographic appearance of M 75: “A bright, compact globular cluster 2' in diameter, greatly condensed at center.” Astrophysics At a distance of 78,000 light-ye- ars, M 75 is the second-farthest globular cluster in the Messier catalog. Its location is 40,000 light- years beyond the galactic center, below the galactic plane. Its size is a reasonable 160 light-years; M 75 has 500,000 solar masses and a luminosity of 160,000 Suns. This globular cluster is remarkable for its very compact appearance and concentration towards the center, which gave it the highest concentration classifi cation of class I accor- ding to Shapley. Typical for a cluster of the outer galactic halo, M 75 is very metal-poor, which means that all elements heavier than helium have a very much lower abundance than found in the Sun. Due to the large distance, the brightest stars of M 75 only reach magnitude 14.6, and Hogg determined an average magnitude of 17.1 for the 25 brightest cluster stars. 50 variables are known in M 75, among which are 38 RR Lyrae stars, typical for globular clusters. Ca- telan et al. (2002) found 26 “blue straggler” candidates (see M 30). Observation M 75 looks like a faint star in 10×50 binoculars. A small telescope shows it as a 2' nebula with a highly concentrated center. There is a magni- tude 11.7 star 4' southeast. Even under good observing conditions, it takes 8 to 10 inches of aperture to resolve the fi rst cluster stars. The center of M 75 remains unresolved except for a few stars in its periphery, even in much lar- ger telescopes. At high power, the cluster core appears like a knot of stars. A 12.5-magnitude star, 1.5' southeast of the core, marks the edge of the cluster. Some observers report a slight elongation in PA 45°. Deep photographs show faint background galaxies in the southern outskirts of M 75.

In 1837, Admiral Smyth saw an “oval, pearly white nebula.” Isaac Roberts delivered the fi rst photograph of M 76 in 1891 and suggested that it could be a bright bar around a torus of nebulosity, seen from the side. Curtis focused his description on the outer regions as he saw them on his deep exposures. Astrophysics At fi rst sight, M 76 bears some si- milarity to the Dumbbell Nebula, M 27, which is why it’s called the Little Dumbbell. Yet Isaac Roberts had already suggested in 1891 that this planetary nebula could be si- milar to the Ring Nebula (M 57) seen from the side. The bright central nebulous region, 95\" by 42\" in PA 35°, is a gas torus, seen at an an- gle of 75°, i.e., almost looking onto its equator. Bryce and colleagues measured expansion velocities of 43 to 60km/s for it. Perpendicular to this ring, there are bipolar loops of nebulosity in PA 125° and 305°. The southeastern loop has a slightly larger distance from the central star (165\") than the northwestern (135\") on the facing side. This ma- terial left the star before the birth of the planetary nebula, as a slow cool wind with a speed of 5 to 20km/s. It is now freshly excited by the present, fast bipolar outfl ow. Its direction depends on the rotational axis of the central star and on the magnetic fi eld orientation. For the distance to M 76, values of between 2550 light-years (as of 2004) and 3900 light-years (from an earlier study with the Hubble Space Telescope) have been published. The very hot but tiny central star has a visual magnitude of only 17.5. Nevertheless, at 140,000 K it is one of the hottest known stars. It represents the hot, dense core of a former red giant, and now has between 0.6 and 0.9 solar masses. Only 1.33\" southeast of the central star (PA 135°) is a very close, faint stellar pair (magnitudes 18.4 and 19.2, 0.16\" separation) in the background, 15,000 to 20,000 light-years away. Observation The third planetary nebula in Messier’s catalog is also the fain- test. Still, M 76 is a nice object which shows a lot of detail in modest and larger telescopes. With 2 inches of aperture it is still at the limit of perception, but 2.5 inches distinctly show a faint bar with brighter tips – indicative of the double nature described by Herschel. M 76 appears quite bright and with some detail in a 4.7-inch re- fractor. The western end of the almost rectangular bar is the brightest part. Two star-like condensations are embedded in it. The eastern end is bright, too, but fainter than the western. Vague structure appears in the central part of the bar, diffi cult to grasp. An [OIII] line fi lter reveals the two nebulous loops, which reach north from the east side of the bar, and south from the west side. They become much better defi ned with a 14-inch refl ector: the northern loop ends in a faint, patchy condensation, while the southern loop returns to the bar. One of the two brighter spots in the western end of the central part turns out to be a star of magnitude 13. M 76, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

Mes- sier saw a “cluster of small stars, which contains nebulosity.” William Herschel also took M 77 for a star cluster, resolvable in large tele- scopes. William Smyth speculated, following an observation with his 5.9-inch refractor: “This object is wonderfully distant and insulated, with presumptive evidence of intrinsic density in its aggregation; and bearing indication of the existence of a central force, residing either in a central body or in the center of gravity of the whole sy- stem.” As we now know, the retired admiral came close to the truth with this note, but of course he was unaware of the true dimensions of this galaxy. In 1848, Lord Rosse recognized M 77 as a “blue spiral,” and in 1851 he confi rmed: “the central part is, I’m sure, spiral,” while John Herschel followed his father in believing that “there is a nucleus which is partially resolved, some stars seen near it.” Heinrich d’Arrest stated “no clustering of stars” and observing with the 11-inch Merz refractor noted: “perfectly round at 356 power, nucleus seems stellar.” Only photography would fi nally resolve the dispute of whether M 77 was a cluster or a galaxy. H. D. Curtis summarized the result in 1918: “A very bright and beautiful spiral. Several, almost stellar condensations on the periphery of the brighter central portions, near the bright nucleus, which is apparently not stellar. The whorls are compactly arranged.” In 1908, E.A.

Mills showed in 1952 that M 77 is a strong radio source, later classifi ed as Cetus A and 3C 71. Astrophysics For a long time M 77 was thought to be the most distant Messier ob- ject, as its redshift is 0.0038. More recent distance evaluations, howe- ver, put it at a little under 50 million light-years, which is comparable with the distances of the Messier galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Nevertheless, M 77 is one of the largest galaxies in the catalog: while its disk has a diameter of 100,000 light-years, faint extensions have been traced out to over 170,000 light-years. The morphology is that of a spiral with broad, structured arms. The inner disk of 40'' apparent diameter, tilted at 51° to our line-of-sight, is composed of a starburst ring of young blue stars, formed in the past 4 to 40 milli- on years. While this ring contains 27 million solar masses, the total galaxy mass is estimated to reach a thousand thousand million solar masses. M 77 is famous for being a unique galaxy, exhibiting broad spec- tral emission lines of H E , [OII], [NIII], and [OIII]. After Carl Seyfert, who studied M 77 in 1943, this type of galaxy is called a Seyfert ga- laxy. M 77 is the nearest and brightest of this class. The origin of the emission lines is a strong energy source in the nucleus of the galaxy. It is powered by a very small and super-mas- sive central object, which ejects gas in large amounts and with high velocities. Infrared observations with the 10m Keck telescope demons- trated that the core of M 77 is only 12 light-years across, surrounded by an elongated halo of gas 100 light-years in diameter. By means of radio observations, it was possible to resolve the central object into a nucleus and a disk, fi ve light-years wide, consisting of water mo- lecules. In 2004, the dust shell around the nucleus, measuring only a M 77 is a Seyfert galaxy with a core of 100 million solar masses.

Active Seyfert nuclei such as in M 77 were compared to small quasars by Osterbrook and Parker in 1977. A super-massive central object – the estimated mass is 100 million suns for the one in M 77 – attracts matter from its environment and emits large amounts of radiation across the entire spectrum. This same phenomenon is ob- served in quasars, BL Lacertae objects, and radio galaxies, yet with different viewing geometries and intensities. Currently, most astro- nomers believe Seyfert galaxies to be BL Lac objects by nature, but observed by us from an oblique angle – not down the jet in the axis of the accretion disk – so that the central object is partially obstructed by a surrounding dust torus. Paradoxically, M 77 is listed in the Arp catalog of interacting galaxies as No. 37. Halton Arp called it “a spiral with a low surface brightness companion on one arm,” but no evidence for this claim is found on modern photographs. M 77 is the main galaxy of a group comprising NGC 1055, NGC 1073, UGC 2161, UGC 2275, UGC 2302, UGCA 44, and Mrk 600. Several other galaxies in the neighborhood, NGC 1087, NGC 1090, and NGC 1094, are in fact distant background galaxies with higher redshifts. Observation M 77 appears quite conspicuously as a stellar object in 10×50 bino- culars. Small telescopes show only the bright galaxy core west of a magnitude-10.7 star. With 4.7 inches of aperture, M 77 appears bright and stretched in an east-west direction. It has a large core, while the visual galaxy barely exceeds 1'. The central 60\" are resolved by a 14-inch telescope into an im- pressive spiral. The nucleus of the galaxy appears star-like, sym- metrically surrounded by a very minute bar in PA 135°. This bar is embedded in the glow of a central area measuring 30\"×20\", which includes two subtle inner spiral arms, originating at each bar end. As displayed wonderfully in a 20-inch telescope, the western arm is more pronounced and ends in a small knot, after a half-turn around the core. A dark gap of 10\" separates the central region and its spiral arms from an outer spiral structure, which is more diffuse and broa- der. These outer arms can be followed over a full turn around the core. The southern bar end points to a small star-like condensation, just visible in the 20-inch, glowing at magnitude 17.7, which is the brightest of the HII regions of M 77. To make out these fi ne details in the central region, powers of 300× to 500× are required. Visually, M 77 shows a size of 2.5'×2.0' in the 20-inch, and its outskirts do not reach the 10.7-magnitude star to the east. Only deep photographs show the outermost parts of the spiral arms, which are very faint and cover an overall size of 7'×6'. By contrast, the peculiar emission lines of the star-like nucleus of the galaxy can be observed visually in a spectroscope. 3.2' to the west and 2.8' to the south of M 77, the brightest of a large number of very small, anonymous fi eld galaxies can be found. M 77 itself is sometimes confused with NGC 1005, 20' north, which looks much more like a galaxy. On photographs, this edge-on galaxy displays a fi ne dust lane, bisecting it along its length.

Oddly, he noted a “cluster of stars, with much nebulosity.” William Herschel discovered the detached nebula NGC 2071 north of the main complex. Still very representative for the view of M 78 in moderate telescopes is the mid-nineteenth-century description given by Admiral Smyth, after an observation with his 5.9-inch refractor: “Two stars in a wispy nebula. It is a singular mass of matter trending from a well defi ned northern disc into the south following quadrant, where it melts away. Its most compressed portion is the wide double star.” Likewise, John Herschel saw “two stars equally bright at 9m in a wispy nebula. It extends 5'; terminating abruptly to the north,” but he also noticed a third star. Lord Rosse claimed in 1851 to see spiral structure, which con- nected the two bright stars. In 1858, however, he renounced that du- bious observation. Heinrich d’Arrest reported, after his observation with an 11-inch refractor in Copenhagen: “6' or 7' diameter, with an enclosed pair.

The northern edge is well defi ned, the southern less so.” Prior to this, d’Arrest had found a very faint nebula southwest of M 78, which is now known as NGC 2064. Its northern extension, NGC 2067, may have been sighted a few years earlier by Wilhelm Tempel. Leo Brenner observed in M 78 a “triple star: one has 8 th magnitu- de, its companion mag 8.5 is separated by 51\" and consists itself of two stars, 1.7\" apart.” Heber D. Curtis described the photographic appearance as a “a mass of rather irregular, fairly bright, diffuse nebulosity, whose brigh- ter portion is 6'×4', involving two 10 th magnitude stars. Two fainter patches lie 6' west, apparently separated from the main mass by a wide lane of dark matter.” It was Vesto M. Slipher at Lowell Observatory in 1919, analyzing spectra of M 78, who found out that, contrary to all other gaseous nebulae known then, this one shines purely in refl ected starlight. Astrophysics M 78 is a part of the larger Orion nebula complex with M 42/43 as its most prominent object. It is the only principal refl ection nebula in the Messier catalog: the light of the stars HD 38563A and HD 38563B (magnitudes 10.2 and 10.6, separation 51\" in PA 202°) does not pro- vide suffi cient power in the UV to ionize the interstellar gas and to make it glow. Hence, light is refl ected only by the dust component of the interstellar clouds. The nebula has a blue color because the young central stars are blue, and because small dust particles have better refl ectivity in blue light. M 78, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

This whole region has a size of 200 light-years. Similar to famous M 42, M 78 hosts a large number of very young (several 100,000 years) stars, most of which have not even reached their equilibrium position on the main sequence yet. These are still T Tauri variables (see M 42), which show irregular light variations of up to three magnitudes in a short time. In 1991, infrared observations with the 1.3m Kitt Peak telescope revealed four star clusters in this region, which are totally hidden in visual light by the dark absorbing cloud. Furthermore, Zhao and col- leagues (1999) found 17 Herbig-Haro objects around M 78. These are mostly bipolar nebulous knots which betray the presence of embed- ded protostars with jets that are heating the surrounding interstellar material they hit. The US amateur astronomer Jay McNeil made a CCD picture of M 78 on the 23 rd of January 2004, using his 3\" refractor. After image processing, he discovered a new nebulous object 10' south of M 78, which is absent on older images. It is associated with the star IRAS 05436-0007, a possible FU Ori [Orionis] type variable. Well-resolved images have now revealed that this star forms the southern tip of the 0.5'-long, new nebula, which must have been formed in an out- burst in October 2003 and then gained fi ve magnitudes within four months. This wasn’t the fi rst such event, though: some much older photographs show a nebula here, too. Observation M 78 appears as just a faint spot in 10×50 binoculars. A 70mm aperture and a magnifi cation of 16× are enough to reveal its characteristic co- met-like appearance, by which it engulfs two stars. The well-defi ned northwestern edge of the nebula becomes very no- ticeable in a 4.7-inch telescope. Next to it is the brightest part of M 78, which hosts the two magnitude-11 stars. The nebula fades out gradu- ally towards the southeast, where there is a third, much fainter star of 13 th magnitude. Facing the northwest edge of M 78, separated by a dark canal, lies the faint nebulosity NGC 2067, elongated in northeast- southwest direction. It narrows towards the southwest and ends there at a star of magnitude 12. Further southwest is NGC 2064 – at the limit of perception with 4.7 inches of aperture. By contrast, NGC 2071, 20' north of M 78, can be seen even in a 2\" telescope. 4.7 inches of aperture show it round and bright, surrounding a star of 10 th magnitude. A somewhat fainter star to the northwest is clear of nebulosity. A 14-inch telescope brings out structure in pale M 78. The brightest part of the nebula is its northern edge of the 6'×5' main part, north of the two bright stars. Faint extensions can be seen reaching southwest and east. Dark clouds become visible immediately south of the third, faint star in M 78. NGC 2067 and NGC 2064 appear vaguely connected, but visibility of the McNeil’s new nebula, further south, remains uncertain; it is at the very limit of the telescope. NGC 2071 in the north, by contrast, appears clearly structured in a 14-inch. It features a bright fi lament of 4' length and 1.5' width, stretched out in an east-west direction. There is a faint companion right southwest of its main star. The companion of the bright star in M 78, the one seen by Leo Brenner, remains invisible.

Messier observed this globular cluster two months later, on the 17 th of December, and noted: “Nebula without star, the center bright, the nebulosity a little diffuse.” Thereafter, hard- ly any attention was given to M 79 – perhaps due to its low southerly position in the sky. Astrophysics At a distance of 45,000 light-years, M 79 lies far beyond the galactic center, from which it presently has its maximum distance. In 200 mil- lion years, its mildly eccentric orbit will have brought it to a minimal distance of still 14 million light-years from the galactic center. M 79 is, in absolute terms, a very average globular cluster with an estimated 400,000 solar masses, 80 light-year diameter and up to 900,000 stars. M 79 is known for its large number of very blue stars on the horizon- tal branch in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Cheng and colleagues discovered 91 such stars, which are very evolved, burn helium in their cores, and are not far away from their stellar “death.” The properties of these stars suggest that M 79 is one of the oldest globular clusters of the Galaxy, and some age estimates exceed even the 15 thousand million years supposed to be the age of the universe. This age confl ict with at least some globular clusters is an old, persisting problem in as- trophysics, but it has already improved with better stellar and cosmo- logical models. M 79 is slightly elliptical in PA 45°. Among the individual cluster stars up to magnitude 13, only seven have deen identifi ed as variables. In 2004, Martin et al. found that M 79 does not have a galactic ori- gin, but – together with NGC 1851, 2298, and 2808 – once belonged to the Canis Major dwarf galaxy. This companion of our Milky Way is being torn apart by tidal forces, and our galaxy has already succeeded in winning over those globular clusters. The dwarf galaxy has also lost many of its stars, which are now orbiting the Milky Way in the so-called “Monoceros-Ring.” Observation O’Meara has claimed a naked-eye sighting of M 79 under very good conditions, with a naked-eye limiting magnitude 7.5. However, there are no other reports to confi rm this. 10×50 binoculars show M 79 as a small ball of nebulosity. Under good conditions, the globular cluster can be resolved into individual stars with 4-inch and larger telescopes. At the same time, M 79 appears luminous and strongly concentrated, with a visual diameter of 3'. There is a 9 th -magnitude star in the north and another in the south. Larger telescopes show extensions of M 79, which reach up to 5'. A star of magnitude 12 marks the northern side of the cluster. The nice double star h 3752 lies 30' southwest of M 79. It consists of two stars magnitudes 5.5 and 9.2, separated by a generous 63\". M 79 lies on the opposite side of the galactic center, where many globular clusters are found.

He added: “bright center, resembles the nucleus of a small comet, surrounded by nebulosity.” Four years later, William Herschel was able to resolve this globu- lar cluster into individual stars. He described M 80 later as “one of the richest and most compressed clusters of small stars I remember to have seen; is on the western border of the Opening in the Heavens.” With the last remark, this great observer referred to the dark, starless cloud seen around U Ophiuchi, which Herschel held rather for a real hole in the Milky Way, devoid of stars. Smyth described M 80 in 1837 with the words: “Fine and bright object, from the blazing center and attenuated disc, it has a very co- metary aspect.” Astrophysics This globular cluster is almost four times as far away as the famous M 4 in its immediate neighborhood. M 80 contains nearly a million stars of over 400,000 solar masses. It is one of the densest and most compact globular clusters of the Galaxy. Its orbit around the galactic center takes only 70 million years to complete and keeps M 80 always inside the outer galactic bulge. The brightest stars of M 80 reach a respectable magnitude 13.4, suffering only from a very modest – considering the distance and location – 0.5 magnitudes of interstellar absorption. With the Hub- ble Space Telescope, a large number (305) of “blue stragglers” were discovered in 1999, almost twice as many as known in M 3 (170). These stars are bluer, more luminous and more massive and, hence, they should be younger than all the ordinary cluster stars. It has been suggested that they are the merged end-products of stellar collisions, M 80. Total view of this very concentrated globular cluster by the Hubble Space Telescope.

Today known as T Scorpii, it reached a maximum of 6.8, outshining the whole cluster, then the star fainted to mag 10.5 by the 16 th of June 1860. To the present day, very few novae have been discovered in other Messier clusters, only in M 5, M 14, and M 30. In 1995, M 80 was searched for other nova candidates, of which there could be up to 200. Apart from T Scorpii, only 10 variables have been found in M 80. Observation In 10×50 binoculars, M 80 appears as a very small, round nebula. A small telescope makes it look like a strongly concentrated ball of nebulosity, with a magnitude 8 star 4' northeast. With 4.7 inches of aperture, the cluster center becomes noticea- ble; it has an almost stellar appearance. Individual stars cannot yet be resolved but they cause the mottled character of the cluster, which now appears to have a diameter of 5'. Full resolution of M 80 into individual stars requires relatively large telescopes. Two Mira variables can be found in the neighborhood of M 80. R Scorpii, 8' east, changes between magnitudes 9.8 and 15.5 with a period of 224.61 days.

Consequently, especially in England, this galaxy is known as Bode’s Nebula. Bode described his fi nd as “round with a dense nucleus in the middle.” Messier made his fi rst observation of M 81 two months later, on the 9 th of February 1781, and noted: “slightly oval, the cen- ter bright.” Apparently, the spiral structure was not recognized, neither by the Herschels nor by later visual observers. Smyth only saw a “fi ne bright oval nebula, of a white color,” and Brenner estimated its visu- ally perceivable extent to 15' by 5'. He also noted: “Two stellar pairs southwest, of mags 9.5 and 8.2, of 9\" and 2\" separation, respectively.” Finally, deep photographs revealed the spiral nature of this galaxy. Curtis wrote about M 81: “very beautiful spiral, 16'×10'. Short expo- sures show that the nucleus is almost stellar.” Astrophysics M 81 is the p rimary galaxy in the nearest galaxy group, which is com- parable to our ‘local group’. At least ten galaxies are recognized mem- bers of this M 81 group: M 82, NGC 2366, 2403, 2976, and 3077, IC 2574, UGC 4459, and the dwarf galaxies Holmberg I, II, and IX. M 82 is a physical close companion of M 81 at a projected distance of only 125,000 light-years. M 81 is a good example of a “grand design” spiral with open, uninterrupted arms. An interesting detail is the bend in the eastern spiral arm which points towards M 82. Apparently, the close encoun- ter of these two galaxies about 10 million years ago resulted in this deformation of the spiral pattern, as well as in the pronounced spiral arms and extra absorption structures near the core of M 81. In the galaxy center, a super-massive object of 60 million solar masses was discovered. From its immediate surroundings, we receive an emissi- on line spectrum of the LINER type (low ionization nuclear emission region). Hence, M 81 has been considered a weakly active galaxy, or containing a “low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.” Its central object, quite likely a massive black hole, accretes matter from its sur- roundings. The resulting energetic radiation has ionized the gaseous envelope of the core, which leads to the observed emission line spec- trum. There are some LINER galaxies, though, which take their en- ergetic radiation not from an accreting, super-massive central object but from a compact central starburst region. A study of the radial velocity curve of M 81 in 1994 revealed that it does not contain much dark matter. By contrast to our Galaxy, the rotation velocity in M 81 is decreasing outwards, while it is conti- nuing to rise in the Milky Way. In total M 81 has about 50 thousand million solar masses, considerably less than our Galaxy. In 1993, the Hubble Space Telescope observed 31 cepheids in M 81 and gave a reliable distance measurement of 11 million light-years.

A bright supernova, discovered on the 28 th of March 1993 by the Spanish amateur astronomer Francisco Garcia with his 10\" Newtonian at 111× magnifi cation, fetched a lot of attention. It reached magnitude 10.5 in the best obser- ving season and became visible even to a 2.4-inch refractor. Worldwide VLBI radio-interferometry was able to resolve the small supernova remnant only 6 months later. Chandar and colleagues (2001) cataloged 114 open clu- sters in M 81 down to 22 nd magnitude. In addition, 44 glo- bular clusters have been found; the brightest are of 18 th magnitude. Their estimated total number of 210 is close to that of the Milky Way. Observation M 81 can be seen with the naked eye in very clear spring nights high in mountain skies (naked-eye limiting magnitude > 7.3). To do so, it is crucial to have a map with stars down to about 7.5 magnitudes to distinguish the faint glow of the galaxy from neighboring stars. The author has been able to see this galaxy in an exceptionally clear sky in the Alps at an altitude of 2800m. In 10×50 binoculars, M 81 is visible as a large, 12' nebula with a bright core. This impression remains the same with small telescopes; the bright core appears stellar. With an aperture of 14 inches this galaxy reaches the considerable visual size of 20'×12' in PA 155°. A very small, but not star-like, nucleus is surrounded by a bright core regi- on of 1.5', elongated in a different direction from the galaxy in general, PA 130°. This, in turn, is embedded in a brighter oval of nebulosity (now PA 155°) of 3'×2'. A mottled region south of the core, and south of two foreground stars, gives way to the visually brightest spiral arm of M 81. With a width of only 1', this arm is most distinct near two foreground stars 4' and 5' east of the galaxy’s core. It then becomes more diffuse in its turn around the northern end of the galaxy. The less distinct beginnings of the western spiral arms can be seen north of the galaxy’s core, on the major axis. Dark clouds give structure mainly to two regions, northwest and directly southeast of the core, supporting the impression of a spiral. Otherwise, the whole oval area covered by the galaxy is fi lled with a homogeneous, diffuse light. There are two bright double stars southwest of the core. Q 1387, consisting of two components of magnitude 10.9 sepa- rated by 9.0\" in PA 112º, is easier to resolve than the brighter pair of 1386, just to its south, with two stars of magnitude 9.5, only 2.1\" apart in PA 271º. Consequently, the latter dou- ble star requires a high magnifi cation. Only under excellent conditions can a 20-inch telescope give a glimpse of the companion galaxy Holmberg IX (UGC 5336), which has a very low surface brightness and lies 10' east of the core of M 81.

He described this galaxy as “pale and elongated.” Messier observed M 82 on the 9 th of February 1781, and he described it as a “nebula without star, its light is faint and elon- gated, near one end is a telescopic star.” Ever since, the sight of this unusual galaxy has fascinated numerous observers. Smyth characterized M 82 as “very long, narrow, and bright, es- pecially at its northern limb.” William Herschel saw it as a “beautiful ray of light,” while Lord Rosse noticed the dark absorption streaks perpendicular to the long axis. Heinrich d’Arrest described M 82 in more detail: “fi ne bright rays, luminous and sparkling, 7' long and 100\" wide with two nuclei eccentrically placed on the major axis. It sparkles as if with innumerable bright spots.” Brenner remarked later that M 82 looked like a “bent strip” to him. Heber Curtis, studying deep exposures of this galaxy, still could not quite fi gure out its true nature. He noted: “A very patchy and irregular, elongated mass, showing numerous rifts; an irregular lane divides it approximately along the shorter axis. It is possibly a very irregular spiral seen edgewise.” Astrophysics M 82 is regarded as the textbook example of a starburst galaxy. Photographic images show large regions with massive starburst ac- tivity, as well as dark, absorbing clouds and bright, ionized gaseous nebulae in a seemingly chaotic pattern. M 82 is the brightest infrared- galaxy in our sky. This is due to the numerous young stars, which are still embedded and hidden (in optical light) in dust clouds warmed up by their radiation. In an area of only 30” diameter near the core of M 82, there are more stars being born than in all of our Milky Way. The cause of this ongoing, strong star formation activity are the close encounters with its ten times more massive “sister” galaxy M 81. The tidal interaction of an encounter induces density waves, which trigger waves of star formation. Soon, many young, massive stars blow up as supernovae, which collectively create a galactic super- wind. That drives out large amounts of gas from M 82 with velocities of up to 500 to 800 km/s. The superwind clashes with the surroun- ding halo gas, and a lot of its material falls back into the galaxy. Large amounts of in-falling gas are excited by the young, hot stars and show strong emissions in the red hydrogen H D and nitrogen lines. While the body of M 82 has a disk size short of only 40,000 light-years, traces of ejected gas clouds can be detected out to 34,000 light-years on either side! Most of the star formation activity in M 82 appears to be related to an earlier close encounter, about 600 million years ago. In addi- tion, there is a fresh new starburst, which has been triggered by the most recent close encounter, about 10 million years ago. That en- counter has disrupted the whole structure of M 82. It does not show a typical core, nor any other characteristic galaxy structure. A visi- ble example is the chaotic absorption features seen in front of most of the galaxy. In 1953, Brown and Harald discovered a radio source near M 81, which in 1961 was identifi ed with M 82 by Lynds, now known under its designations UMa A or 3C231.

In the brightest region, M 82A, 100 young super star clusters (SSCs) were found, none older than 50 million years. As a result of the combined ener- getic radiation and its effect on the surrounding interstellar gas and dust, the region M 82A alone is fi ve times as luminous, in absolute terms, as the whole Milky Way. Each SSC contains over 100,000 very young stars, has about a million solar masses and is 10 to 20 light-years in dia- meter. Many of the stars have not even reached the main sequence yet, but in the distant future, many M 82 SSCs will have evolved into some- thing similar to a globular cluster. The less bright region M 82B contains seve- ral massive star clusters with 10,000 to about a million solar masses each. Here, the starburst activity came to an end around 20 million years ago, and M 82B will probably fade away within the next 30 million years. This region contains M 82F, which is the second-largest SSC in M 82 with 1.2 million solar masses. It has an age of 60 million years. Smith and Gallagher found out that it does not contain any stars with less than two or three solar masses. A reason for this may be that the exceptionally intense radiation of the massive, young stars disrupted the slower formation of the less massive stars. As a result, no star of this SSC will ever stay on the main sequence for more than one or two thousand million years. Hence, this super-cluster will not last long enough to become a globular cluster. In 2004, the fi rst supernova was found in M 82, only 35\" west of its core. It exploded in November 2003, as seen on pre-discovery photographs, in a very dusty environment. Hence, it suffered a lot of interstellar absorption inside M 82 and reached a maximum magni- tude of only 16.0 around the 21 st of November 2003. Observation M 82 can be seen, jointly with M 81, even in small binoculars. In a small telescope, its long-drawn bar of light appeals to the observer and contrasts with its oval sister galaxy. From about 4 inches of aperture upwards, dark perpendicular ab- sorption lanes gain visibility. The most distinct of these nearly zig- zags through the center of the galaxy, which now has a visual size of 6'×1.5'. More dark incursions from the south are seen in the western half of M 82, while east of the main dark lane, bright condensations can be perceived. The galaxy’s eastern end appears cut off, by con- trast to the gradually fading western end. Under a dark sky, a 14-inch telescope shows an overwhelmingly torn object, which takes a whole night to capture in a detailed dra- wing. A good starting point is two brighter stars southwest of the galaxy, nearly pointing to its center. A faint 16 th -magnitude star 1' northeast of the closer of those two stars is at the limit of perception with 14 inches of aperture. Here, the southern edge of M 82 forms a deep bay, which turns into a dark bar that crosses the whole galaxy in PA 35°. The part of the galaxy to the west features at least one more dark bar before it fades away into the background. The central region of M 82 is characterized by large star-forming regions. The huge region M 82A of magnitude 13.8 measuring 20\" stands out in the south of the galaxy, with two noticeably separated parts. The brightest star clusters reach only 16 th magnitude but, re- peatedly, several points of light seem to fl ash into perception. This effect becomes more pronounced with even larger apertures than 14 inches. M 82E lies just 1' west of M 82A and it, too, is visibly non- stellar. Only 20\" further west, there is just another dot of light. The northern edge of the central region is also bright, but individual con- densations cannot be resolved here – even though M 82F (mag 16.3) should potentially be within reach of a 14-inch telescope. Towards the east, the central region is bordered by the dark ab- sorption bar in PA 70°. The area beyond it shows structure, which is more pronounced near the southern side, but signifi cantly fainter than the central region. A perpendicular, straight absorption lane ends this region abruptly in the east. The remaining eastern part of M 82 is pretty faint and has only a vague structure. The visual extent of M 82 in a 14-inch telescope is 7.5'×1.5', in PA 65°. Deep photographs show a much thicker galaxy body because it reveals the masses of gas, which stream in from the sides.

His entry under number I.6 reads: “nebula without star, small and shapeless.” Messier, who knew Lacaille’s catalog, fi nally ma- naged to see this very southerly galaxy on the 17 th of February 1881. He saw a “nebula without star, it appears as a faint and even light.” The Australian observer James Dunlop described this galaxy in de- tail as his catalog number 62B: “A very beautiful round nebula, with an exceedingly bright well-defi ned planetary disk or nucleus, about 7\" or 8\" diameter, surrounded by a luminous atmosphere or chevelure [mane], about 6' diameter. The nebulous matter is rather a little brighter towards the edge of the planetary disk, but very slightly so. I can see several extremely minute points or stars in the chevelure, but I do not consider them as indications of its being resolvable, although I have no doubt it is composed of stars.” Dunlop probably glimpsed the many prominent star clusters in the spiral arms of M 83. William Lassell ob- served this galaxy from Malta. With a large aperture, he recognized it as a “three-branched spiral.” Most historical observers skipped M 83 because of its southerly position. Curtis summarized the photographic appearance in 1918 very ap- propriately with the words: “A bright and unusually beautiful spiral. A large number of almost stellar condensations in the rather open whorls of this fi ne object.” Astrophysics Undoubtedly, M 83 is one of the most beautiful spiral galaxies in the whole Messier catalog. De Vaucouleurs characterized it as a tran- sitional object between a barred spiral and a normal spiral galaxy, and he classifi ed it as SAB(s)c. M 83 is seen nearly face-on, with an inclination to our line of sight of only 24°. Many prominent blue young star clusters outline the spiral arms of M 83. By contrast, the core and the bar of the galaxy consist of fairly old yellowish stars. Hubble Space Telescope images led to the discovery of gigantic, young star clusters (super star clusters, SSCs) in the immediate vicinity of the galactic core, within a radius of only 3\" to 7\". Each cluster and SSC contains between 10,000 and about a million solar masses, and they are less than 10 million years old. In the same central region, two rings of dust were found in 1998, an inner one with a radius of 2.8\", and an outer with 8.6\"; the latter is not centered on the galaxy’s nucleus. These two dust rings frame the star burst region between them. The core of M 83 appears to be double (2.7\", PA 243°), similar to the one in M 31, and each part contains about 130 million so- lar masses. It shows an emission line spectrum, which may hint at a super-massive central object. The radial velocity of M 83 is +337 km/s, which led to early di- stance estimates, simply by using the Hubble law and ignoring any peculiar velocity, of 22 to 25 million light-years. By contrast, Thim et al. derived 14.5 million light-years. At that distance, M 83 has a relatively small diameter of 55,000 light-years. Studying Thim’s data again in 2003, Bonanos and Stanek discovered 112 cepheids and even 2 eclipsing variables, the fi rst outside the Local Group, which have helped to pin down the distance of M 83 to 14.7 million light- years with an even better accuracy. M 83, together with M 31, is now even regarded as a calibration tool for other distance measuring methods. M 83 and Centaurus A (NGC 5139) form two sub-centers of a joint galaxy association. Galaxies considered to be gravitationally dominated by M 83 are, among others, NGC 5264, 5253, and 5408. NGC 5253, only 2° south of M 83 and with 1/10 of the mass of the latter, has been held responsible for the young, inner starburst ring and the deformation of the spiral arms of M 83. Dynamical studies suggest that both galaxies had a close encounter only some million years ago. With a count of six, M 83 holds the supernova record among all Messier galaxies, and it is only just behind the seven observed events of NGC 6946, the galaxy with the largest number of supernovae dis- coveries. Interestingly, SN 1945B was discovered as late as 1990 by Liller on old photographic plates of the Bloemfontein Observatory. Its light curve could be obtained from photos until 1950. The supernova of 1968 was discovered by the well-known amateur astronomer Ben- nett, of South Africa, while searching for comets. It had a position only 5\" west of the galaxy nucleus.

However, observers from most of Europe and the northern USA cannot appreciate it as such. M 83 is thought to be one of the most diffi cult objects to observe in the Messier catalog, due to its very southerly declination. Often, there are only a few nights in April and May that would offer a successful observation. While M 83 can be spotted with 10×50 binoculars without pro- blem, it can remain just a pale patch of a few arcminutes size even in larger telescopes in less-than-ideal observing conditions. On a good night, however, a 4.7-inch refractor shows a 30\" core region, surrounded by a somewhat elongated (PA 60°) nebulous halo of 6.5' by 5'. Asymmetrical structures can be made out, indicative of spiral arms, between the center and an 11 th -magnitude star 3' southwest of the core, right on the major axis of the galaxy. With an aperture of 14 inches, a clearer view emerges: the round core expan- ds into a bar to either side of the major axis. From the south, a dark structure touches the bar, east of the core. Spiral arms can be seen to begin at the western bar and to bend northward, likewise southward from the eastern bar end. Near the latter, there are two stars of ma- gnitude 13. A really impressive view of the structure of M 83, however, can only be obtained from a southern location. A 20-inch telescope in Namibia shows a large (10'×8', in PA 65°) galaxy with a small core in a 4'-long bar. From its southwest side, two spiral arms emerge, rich in structure. The inner one makes a close, nearly full turn around the northern side of the galaxy and fi zzles out about 6' south of the core. The outer one features a remarkable right-angled bend. In the north, faint extensions link it with the inner arc. The southern spiral arm, which emerges from the northeastern side of the bar, is much shorter. Throughout the inner 5' of M 83, there are numerous knots. Two regions 2' east of the core respond well to the use of an [OIII] narrowband fi lter. ESO 444-85, presumably a background galaxy, lies 8' east of the core of M 83. Furthermore, there is a bright star 5.5' southeast of the core, which is not shown on GSC computer-generated star charts. At high power, it turns out to be a nice double star of two components with magnitudes 10.4/11.2 separated by 10.4\" in PA 215° (h 4599). M 83, historical drawing. William Lassell (1862).

What was supposed to be a confi rmation observati- on of M 85, just found by Méchain, led to the discovery of six new nebulae: M 84 to M 91. These nebulae have been cataloged in or- der of their right ascension, except for the last (by mistake). Messier described M 84 as a “nebula without star, its center is rather bright, surrounded by light nebulosity, its brightness and appearance resem- bles No. 59 and 60 of this catalog.” To John Herschel, M 84 looked “very bright, pretty large, round, pretty suddenly brighter in the middle, scarcely resolvable.” D’Arrest’s description is similar to the one he gave for M 86: “Luminous nu- cleus, round, gradually increasing brightness towards the center. The nucleus is equivalent to a 10 th or 11 th magnitude star.” Curtis wrote, after studying his deep exposures of M 84: “Very bright; round, 1' in diameter. Center large. No spiral structure dis- cernible.” Astrophysics M 84 lies in the central region of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Only 17' east is M 86, which is probably also physically close to M 84. M 84 has often been classifi ed as an elliptical galaxy of type E1, but there are speculations it could be a spindle-shaped or lenticular galaxy seen face-on, of type S0. Very similar to M 86, M 84 contains mainly old, yellow stars and a signifi cant halo of an estimated 1775 globular clusters, of which 98 have already been identifi ed. In 1997, a study of the galaxy center with the Hubble Space Te- lescope produced evidence for a super-massive object of about 1.5 thousand million solar masses. The diameter of the surrounding ac- cretion disk is only 50 light-years. Its rotational velocity suggests that the central object is, indeed, a black hole. Furthermore, the HST images show dark lanes superimposed on the central region over an 18\"×10\" fi eld, orientated in an east-west direction. They can also be traced on good photos from the ground. The nucleus appears as a bright, elongated core (PA 72°), about 5\" across. In addition, M 84 has two jets leaving the core, similar to M 87 but on a much smaller scale. The jets are radio-bright and emit syn- chrotron radiation, which is generated when high-energy particles are forced into a spiralling motion by strong magnetic fi elds. M 84.

SN 1957B was disco- vered on the 18 th of May 1957, by Romano. The 13 th -magnitude object was later discovered on photographs taken from Mount Palomar a month before the discovery. On the 13 th of June 1980, Rosker found a supernova of 14 th magnitude (SN 1980I), for which some authors dis- pute a physical connection with M 84. The most recent event occurred on the 3 rd of December 1991 (SN 1991bg, 14 th magnitude). Only 1.4' northeast of the core of M 84 is the very faint galaxy VPC 379 (at 12h 24min 58.4s, 12° 54' 14\"), which could be a small physical companion. Observation M 84 can be seen fairly easily with a pair of 50mm binoculars next to M 86. Small telescopes show it as a round patch without detail, loo- king like a twin of M 86. In a 4.7-inch refractor, the bright core of M 84 becomes visible, with an almost stellar appearance. The slightly oval galaxy has a vi- sual diameter of 1.5' and appears a bit smaller than its close neigh- bor, M 86. An aperture of 14 inches shows M 84 as a galaxy of 2'×1.5' size, slightly elongated in PA 130°. It can no longer be regarded as a twin of M 86 – M 84 is noticeably smaller and less elongated. The core region is bright but does not, by contrast to M 86, contain a star-like nucleus. The dark structures in front of the M 84 core region remain, unfortunately, invisible.

Soon after receiving that message, Messier observed the object on 18 th of the same month. He saw a “nebula wi- thout star, very faint.” John Herschel described M 85 as “Very bright; round; brighter toward the middle.” Heinrich d’Arrest noticed the nearby galaxy, NGC 4394, and wrote: “large, bright, denser toward centre. Another nebula follows in close distance.” Curtis characterized M 85 as “Very bright oval, very slight traces of spiral structure.” Astrophysics M 85’s location is in the northern part of the Virgo galaxy cluster, and it is the northernmost Messier galaxy in it. Morphologically it strongly resembles M 84, but its estimated mass of 400 thousand million solar masses is a little less – though still making it a signi- fi cant galaxy. Usually, M 85 is classifi ed as a lenticular, spindle-type S0 galaxy. However, very deep exposures show traces of spiral structure to the north and south of the core, which had already been noticed by Curtis. The spiral arms seem to be infl uenced by the small barred spiral NGC 4394, only 8' east, with which M 85 is in close interaction. Another likely consequence of that interaction could be the rela- tively young stars in the core region of M 85. These are atypical for a spindle-type galaxy, which normally have strongly reduced star- formation rates. But McDermid showed in 2004 that this central re- gion rotates against the rotational sense of the rest of M 85! Hubble Space Telescope images revealed two brightness peaks in the core region, which resemble the double core of M 31. A total of 58 individual X-ray sources were found all over M 85. Most of them are supposedly X-ray binary stars. On the 20 th of De- cember 1960, a Supernova was discovered in M 85 (SN 1960R). It reached a magnitude of 11.7 and topped even the foreground star in the northern outskirts of the galaxy. Observation Even 10×50 binoculars show M 85 clearly. In a 2.5-inch refractor, it ap- pears as a bright, oval nebula with a distinct, almost stellar core. With apertures of 3 inches and upwards, the companion galaxy NGC 4394 is visible, too. To an observer with a 4.7-inch telescope, the almost star-like core becomes very obvious. It is surrounded by a 2'×1.5' oval halo. There is a bright star to the southeast, and another, faint 12.5-magnitude fo- reground star may, with some patience, be perceived just 50\" north of the galaxy core. It has repeatedly been mistaken for a supernova. The galaxy NGC 4394 makes a pale patch of light, 7' to the east. The visual impression of M 85 in a larger telescope has often been likened to that of an unresolved globular cluster. This is mainly due to the small, but not at all star-like, core 15\" in diameter and the faint foreground star mentioned above. In a 14-inch telescope, the galaxy covers 3'×2' with moderate elongation in PA 35°. The same aperture shows NGC 4394 as a diffuse, oval nebula with a size of 1.5'×1' (PA 145°) and a non-stellar core. The other, much fainter companions – i.e., IC 3292, magnitude 15.5 and 8.5' west, and MCG+3-32-28, magnitude 17.0 and 3.5' south – remain invisible in the 14-inch Newtonian.

But because he ordered the galaxies discovered that night by right ascension, M 85 comes between. Messier described M 86 as a “Nebula without star, very near the nebula above, No. 84: their appearance is the same, and both appear in the same fi eld of the refractor.” John Herschel saw M 86 as “Very bright; large; round; gradu- ally brighter toward the middle where there is a nucleus; mottled.” Heinrich d’Arrest noted: “Large, bright nebula, circular, brightness of nucleus equivalent to a star of 11 th to 12 th magnitude.” Curtis descri- bed the photographic appearance in 1918 with the words: “Slightly oval, bright centre, which is not stellar in short exposures; no spiral structure discernible.” Astrophysics M 86 is a little more distant than M 87 and lies near the back side of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. According to Kenney et al. (2007), it is the dominant galaxy in a sub-cluster merging with the rest of the main cluster. It forms a physical pair with M 84, but even mo- dern measurements cannot agree on which of the two is nearer to us. Sanchis and colleagues (2004) see M 86 about one million light- years behind M 84. M 86 is a giant galaxy of the elliptical type E3, or maybe S0. It may be considered a transitional object between elliptical and spindle-type galaxies. M 86 possesses an impressive halo of an esti- mated 3800 globular clusters, which is more than M 84 but still con- siderably less than M 87. 108 of these globular clusters have been identifi ed and cataloged. The very small dwarf galaxy VCC 882, to the east, is a physical companion. The radial velocity of M 86 has led to some confusion. The galaxy is approaching us at 227 km/s, although the Virgo cluster is receding at about 1100 km/s. This had at fi rst given reason to doubt the clus- ter membership of M 86 and some authors suspected it to be a much nearer object. But today, a very large relative velocity of M 86 with respect to the Virgo cluster (over 1300 km/s) has been fully accepted. A close encounter with another galaxy can cause such an unusually large velocity. But most importantly, observational evidence for a lar- ge relative velocity came in 1976 from Forman and colleagues, later confi rmed by Rangarajan in 1995: the gas of M 86 collides with the intracluster gas and is ripped off (“ram pressure stripping”). In additi- on, Elmegreen and colleagues (2000) observed that M 86 is also strip- ping interstellar matter from VCC 882; both galaxies are connected by a tail of gas and dust at least 90,000 light-years long. M 86 is the starting point of a chain of galaxies, which has been named after the Armenian astronomer Markarian. Further members are NGC 4435, 4438, 4458, 4461, and 4473, to mention only the brightest examples. The end point is formed by M 88. This chain M 86, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

In small telescopes, both galaxies remain diffuse, oval spots which do not differ from each other.

He described this object as a “Nebula without star. This nebula appears of the same brightness as the two nebulae No’s. 84 & 86.” To John Herschel, M 87 looked “very bright, pretty large, round, much brighter in the middle where there is a distinct nucleus.” Hein- rich d’Arrest had a very similar perception of this galaxy: “very large and bright, circular, 85\" in diameter; brighter to the middle, centre likens a star of 9 th or 10 th magnitude.” Heber Curtis studied in detail the fi rst deep exposures of M 87. His 1918 description is the fi rst to mention the famous jet near the galaxy’s nucleus: “Exceedingly bright; No spiral structure is discer- nible. A curious straight ray lies in a gap in the nebulosity in PA 20°, apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter. The ray is brightest at its inner end, which is 11\" from the nucleus.” Astrophysics M 87 is the dominant, central ga- laxy of the Virgo cluster and a very interesting object in astrophysical terms. This elliptical giant galaxy (type E1 or E0) has a diameter of 132,000 light-years. That appears to be just a bit larger than the Milky Way, but its elliptical shape gives it a much larger volume. According to J.C. Brandt and R.G. Roosen, M 87 has a total mass of as much as 2700 thousand million Suns! It is probably the most massive galaxy we know. Its absolute magnitude is –22 (or 50 thousand million times the Sun’s luminosity), at least. In very deep exposures with the 3.3m telescope of the Anglo- Australian Observatory, David Malin was able to detect an outermost diameter of M 87 of even 0.5°, which corresponds to a physical size of 500,000 light-years. In addition, he discovered a plume of stellar matter which reaches 300,000 light-years outwards, along the major galaxy axis in a southeastern direction. The faint outer parts of M 87 appear disrupted by interaction with other galaxies of the cluster. Quite possibly, they are formed by aggregation of material, gained from mergers with small, colliding companion galaxies. M 87 possesses a large number of companion galaxies. Among the brightest are NGC 4476, 4478, 4486A, and 4486B. A gigantic halo of an estimated 16,000 (!) globular clusters surrounds M 87; 5700 of these have already been identifi ed in observations. The brightest glo- bular clusters reach 23 rd magnitude. A distance to M 87 of 55 million light-years has been measured by Whitmore and colleagues (1995) with the Hubble Space Telescope, using the globular cluster properties. Observations of planetary ne- bulae and mean surface brightness measures confi rmed this value in 2000, and so did Sanchis et al. (2004), who published a distance of 54.5 million light-years. M 87 has become famous for its central jet, 65,000 light-years (or 25\") long, which was discovered by Curtis in 1918. Its light is con- tinuous, bluish, and strongly polarized. Here, fast particles, near the speed of light, are interacting with strong magnetic fi elds and emit synchrotron radiation. In 1977, Halton C. Arp was able to resolve the jet into a series of small knots, in photographs made with the 5m Palomar telescope. In 1996, he discovered a second jet, leaving the nucleus in the opposite direction. For these unusual structures, Arp added M 87 to his catalog of peculiar galaxies as his 152 nd object.

The jet originates from a central region only 60 light-years wide, but which contains a mass of 2 to 3 thousand million solar masses. An accretion disk surrounds, we may safely assume, a super-massive black hole. Tsvetanov et al. have registered bright- ness variations of about a factor of 2 within two and a half months, from the innermost region of 16 light-years diameter. Apart from these variations, there are other characteristics of the nucleus of M 87 which coincide well with those of BL Lacertae ob- jects (see M 77) and LINER-type galaxy cores, inclu- ding the relativistic jet. Atypical, however, is the re- latively faint nucleus of M 87. That may be the result of the inclination of the M 87 core region by 30° to 35° from our line of sight, causing obstruction, while BL-Lac objects are seen fully face-on. Furthermore, the nucleus of M 87 is one of the most luminous radio sources in our sky (Virgo A), which was discovered in 1954 by Baade and Min- kowsky. Owen and colleagues (1999) discovered a radio halo around M 87 that spans 200,000 light- years and is heated by the jet. And we know that M 87 is a prominent X-ray source as well. The single supernova observed so far in M 87 occurred in February 1919. It was only discovered three years later, by Balanowsky, on photographic plates. The maximum brightness must have been around magnitude 11.5. In 2002, Shara and Zurek reported the fi ndings of over 400 novae in M 87. In 2004, special at- tention was attracted by an event, which most probably was a nova in one of the M 87 globular clusters – which would be only the se- cond nova in a globular cluster since the fi rst such sighting in 1860 (see M 80). Observation With a pair of 10×50 binoculars, M 87 is relatively well visible as a round, nebulous spot. Almost the same appearance is maintained in telescopes of all sizes. With an aperture of 4.7 inches, M 87 appears noticeably brighter than the neighboring Messier galaxies, and with a visual size of 3' it is also one of the largest. An apparently stellar nucleus dominates the otherwise featureless galaxy. A 14-inch telescope shows a very small, but not star-like, core embedded in a round, bright central region of about 2' diameter. It is surrounded by a faint halo, which reaches a total visual size of 5'. The sparseness of the surrounding star fi eld is quite remarkable. There are only two faint (15 th -magnitude) stars near M 87, northeast of it. The jet gains visibility only in telescopes with a relatively large aperture and magnifi cations over 300×. It then reaches a length of 20\" in PA 290°, right off the core. The jet is sometimes confused with the 16 th -magnitude galaxy pair UGC 7652-1/2, because it is aligned radially (in PA 215°). These galaxies are totally unrelated to the jet, but they are demanding visual targets for large telescopes, and can be detected with 14 inches of aperture under dark skies. A galaxy of much better visibility is 11 th -magnitude NGC 4478, 10' southwest of M 87. The foreground Mira variable CV Vir, 7' southeast of the galaxy core, can be seen only from time to time: its magnitude changes between 14.2 and 16.5 with a period of 146 days.

He noted about this galaxy: “Nebula without star. Its light is one of the faintest and re- sembles No. 58 in the Virgin.” William Herschel reported a companion, “another nebula, just following [east] M 88,” but that object (H II 118) was never found again. To John Herschel, M 88 looked “bright; very large; very much extended; 8' long, 1' broad. The northern half is brighter than the southern.” In 1850, Lord Rosse observed remarkable detail with his large telescope: “The whorls are rather close, and show numerous condensations.” Heinrich d’Arrest determined the visual extent of M 88 to 7' by 1.5'. Curtis described M 88 in 1918, based on deep photographs: “A bright, beautiful spiral. Bright, elongated nuclear region, including a bright, almost stellar nucleus. The whorls are rather close, and show numerous condensations.” Astrophysics M 88 is a member of the Virgo galaxy cluster and forms the end- point of the Markarian galaxy chain, which starts with M 86. M 88 has been classifi ed as a multiple spiral (type Sc), and it is inclined 58° to our line of sight. Its physical diameter is about 115,000 light- years, its mass is that of 250 thousand million Suns – similar to our Galaxy. As with many other galaxies, emission lines are found in the spec- trum of the 5\" core of M 88. This hints at an accreting, super-massive central object and makes M 88 a Seyfert-2 galaxy (see M 77). At lon- ger wavelengths, Japanese astronomers discovered two sub-centers of the galaxy core. The radial velocity of 2000 km/s (receding) of M 88 is much higher than the rest of the Virgo cluster, which means that this galaxy moves quite fast through the cluster. On the 29 th of May 1999, a supernova was discovered in M 88 at Lick Observatory. SN 1999cl reached a maximum magnitude of 13.4 on the 12 th of June 1999, well observable with amateur telescopes.

Its light changes irregularly between 13 th and 20 th magnitude, sometimes within only a few days, bearing some similarity to U Geminorum stars. Observation In 10×50 binoculars, M 88 is just a tiny, faint spot. In a small telescope, it is seen as a nice oval nebula, right next (5' north) to a pair of stars (magnitudes 11.5/12.5, 30\" separation in PA 210°). Another 12 th -ma- gnitude star lies only 3.5' north of the galaxy’s core. With an aperture of 4.7 inches, this is a respectable, bright and noticeably elongated (in PA 140°) galaxy. Its core appears small and bright, surrounded by a 3'×1.5' halo. In a 14-inch telescope, M 88 turns out to be one of the most beau- tiful spiral galaxies of the Virgo cluster. The core, which does not ap- pear stellar but has a diameter of about 5\", resides in a 2'-long central region which stands out well from the rest of the galaxy. Dark dust lanes spiral into this brighter central region from the south and east. The spiral arms remain diffi cult to perceive and may be seen better in the southern part of M 88. The total visual extent reaches 5'×1.8', while a length of as much as 6' appears on photographs. There is a faint pair of stars (magnitudes 13.8/14.2) at the sou- theast tip of the galaxy, with 15\" separation in PA 200°. In fact, the fainter star is a double star itself, which can be recognized only with really large telescopes. M 88 is one of the most massive spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster.

In addition, he noted “Its light was extremely faint and rare, and it is not without trouble it is perceived.” John Her- schel described this rather insignifi cant Messier object as, neverthe- less: “Pretty bright; pretty small; round; gradually much brighter to- ward the middle.” D’Arrest characterized M 89 as “very pretty, round, 45\" in diameter, considerably brighter in the centre. Brightness of the nucleus equivalent to a star of 10 th magnitude.” Astrophysics Like its neighbors in the sky, M 89 is a member of the Virgo galaxy cluster. Recent distance measurements still disagree a little: 50 to 65 million light-years have been published in 2003 and 2004. Even deep exposures show no structure in M 89, because it is a perfectly round elliptical galaxy (type E0). In 1979, David Malin boosted interest in M 89 when he recor- ded three concentric shells in his very deep exposures, which are of 5', 7', and 10' diameter. This halo structure is most prominent north- northwest and south-southeast of the core. In a southwest direction, outside the halo, Malin recognized a 10.4' long jet, which corresponds to a physical length of 151,000 light-years at a distance of 50 million light-years. Malin suggested that this might be the remains of a small companion galaxy in the process of destruction, torn apart by tidal forces from M 89. A modern study suggests that this material was left behind after a close encounter with a (surviving) companion galaxy. M 89 is known to have a super-massive central object of a thou- sand million solar masses, probably a black hole, from which we receive a characteristic emission line spectrum, emitted by heated, accreting mass. Hence, M 89 is considered a weak Seyfert galaxy (see M 77), or at least a LINER object (see M 81). The Hubble Space Telescope recorded strong UV brightness fl uctuations of the nucleus in the 1990s, which could have been the signature of a ripped-apart star falling into the central black hole. Observation M 89 is one of the least spectacular Messier objects for visual observati- on. 10×50 binoculars show it close to the limit of perception. In small telescopes, it is seen as a small round nebula, much like Messier saw it more than 200 years ago. With an aperture of 4.7 inches, the vi- sual size of M 89 reaches 1.5', and a structureless nebula surrounds a star-like nucleus. With a 14-inch telescope, two nearby fi eld stars are visible: a bright one (magnitude 12.8) in the east, and a faint one (magnitude 15.3) in the south. The round galaxy appears 1.5' across, with an ob- vious, bright, almost stellar nucleus. Three anonymous background objects, 3' west, 5' south, and 6' east, are too faint for the visual obser- ver.

His note about M 90 reads: “Nebula without star, its light as faint as the previous No. 89.” Around 1830, using much larger telescopes, John Herschel cha- racterized this galaxy as “Pretty large; brighter toward the middle where there is a nucleus.” Heinrich d’Arrest took a closer look in 1864 and gave this description: “Very large, elongated nebula, size 7'× 2', which surrounds a star of 12 th magnitude. The nucleus appears as if a star was shining through fog here; it is closer to the preceding [we- stern] part.” Astrophysics M 90 is a pretty spiral galaxy in the direction of the Virgo cluster. Its western side is tilted towards us. On color photos, its tightly wound arms have a yellowish tint. This hints at an older stellar population and very little star formation in the recent past of this galaxy. Ho- wever, shorter exposures of the bright central region of M 90 reveal a very different picture there. In this central starburst region, about two new stars are born every year. The very star-like, bright nucleus, 1\" in diameter or less, is an unusual feature of the morphology of M 90. In 1956, Humason even took it for a foreground star. Still in 1996, Keele held this as a pos- sibility, when even the Hubble Space Telescope could not resolve it. But he concluded that the M 90 nucleus would most probably consist of an unusually bright cluster of A-type supergiants. The observed emission lines in the spectrum of the core have led several authors to classify it as a LINER object (see M 81), despite a lack of intensity. The alternative characterization as a low-luminosity AGN (see M 77) has been dropped, since X-ray observations have produced no evi- dence for it. An ongoing very controversial issue is that of the galaxy’s mem- bership in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. The distance measures of M 90 disagree with each other more than for any galaxy in the Vir- go cluster. In a study published in 2003, 65 million light-years had been concluded but, in 2002 and 2004, Spanish astronomers derived a three-dimensional picture of the cluster in which M 90 is a fore- ground galaxy, at a distance of only 30 million light-years. The di- stance measurement methods used may have been confused by the interaction of M 90 with its close companion galaxy IC 3583, as well as by an unusually low content of neutral hydrogen. Indirect evi- dence for a nearer location of M 90 comes from the fact that at the further distance of the Virgo cluster it would be considerably over- proportioned.

M 90 approaches us with a velocity of 235 km/s, while the Virgo cluster recedes with about 1100 km/s. However, this is not an argument against cluster membership (see M 86). Close encounters can accelerate a galaxy considerably. Furthermore, a lar- ge relative velocity within the cluster would explain nicely how M 90 lost most of its neutral hydrogen. Vollmer et al. have suggested that M 90 may have crossed the denser cluster center about 300 million years ago. M 90 and its companion IC 3583, only 6' north, have been cataloged as the interacting galaxy pair Arp 86. While there is a visible impact of this inter- action on the small companion, hardly any traces of it can be detected in M 90, at least not in visible light. A halo of an estimated 1000 globular clusters surrounds M 90, but only 30 of these have actually been identifi ed and catalogued. Observation For 10×50 bi no- culars, M 90 is an object close to the limit of perception. The galaxy remains a faint object in small telescopes. Apart from its inclined 1:3 orientation in PA 25° and a brighter nucleus, hardly any details can be made out. With 4.7 inches aperture, the bright, apparently stellar nucleus is obvious. The oval galaxy has quite a low surface brightness but, with a visual size of 4'×1.5', it is one of the largest galaxies in the Vir- go cluster. With a 14-inch telescope, its spiral structure is visible, even though it appears diffuse and of low contrast. The nucleus, which maintains a stellar ap- pearance even under high magnifi cation, looks like a 12 th -magnitude foreground star. It is embedded in a 2'-long, brighter central region, which follows the orientation of the inclined galaxy. A dark dust lane spirals in from the east. In the diffuse oval halo of 6.5'×2.5', further spiral structure can be seen, but only vaguely. In general, the galaxy makes a pale impression. To the north, IC 3583 appears faint and coreless in a 14-inch telescope. Several stars are in its imme- diate neighborhood, one of these (12 th magnitude) is right at its southeastern edge. Deep photographs show a few fi eld stars in front of M 90 and countless faint galaxies in its back- ground. The most distinct of these tiny Milky Ways lies only 2.5' southwest of the nucleus of M 90. It may just be in reach of visual observers with large telescopes.

At the erroneous position, there isn't any object, which would have been bright enough for Messier’s telescopes. In earlier attempts to explain M 91, it has been suggested that Messier came across a co- met, or that he may have confused it with M 58. Even much too faint (magnitude 11.3) NGC 4571 was proposed as the mysterious M 91. It was W.C. Williams who fi nally resolved this mystery in 1969, when he reconstructed Messier’s mistake in detail: instead of coming to M 91 from M 89, as he thought he would, he headed out from M 58. Hence, we now know that M 91 is, in fact, identical to NGC 4548. That same galaxy was described by John Herschel as: “Pretty bright; round; brighter toward the middle; 60\" [diameter].” Other historic observers, however, did not pay much attention to this see- mingly anonymous object, because of its long-unknown identity with M 91. Astrophysics M 91 is a member of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. It is a nice example of a barred spiral, and deep exposures show a lot of dust in its main spiral arms; they become broader and split up, as they spread out. The bright bar is very conspicuous, and the nucleus was found to be of the LINER type (see M 81), by the emission lines in its spectrum. M 91 is located in the densest part of the Virgo cluster and be- longs to the subgroup around M 87. Its radial velocity of 486 km/s (receding) shows, compared to the Virgo cluster velocity of about 1100 km/s, that it has a considerable relative velocity (about 600 km/s) within the cluster. This may be refl ected in the atypical (for a spiral galaxy) scarceness of neutral hydrogen in M 91 (see M 86). However, past close encounters with other cluster galaxies could also be blamed for that. The distance to M 91 has been measured repeatedly by means of cepheid variables. Using the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, this method gave a distance of 52 million light-years, which agrees very well with all more recent results. Observation M 91 is the most diffi cult of all Mes- sier objects to observe visually. It is the only one which cannot be seen in 10×50 binoculars. With small telescopes, or under inferior observing conditions, only the bright central part of the galaxy with its nucleus and bar is visible. It then appears elongated in PA 80°. A faint, round halo, made of the diffuse light of the spiral arms, appears only under very good conditions. A 14-inch telescope shows an oval nebulosity of 3'×2' (PA 160°). A very bright, round core of 10\" size marks the center of the distinctly visible galaxy bar, 1.5' long. In addition, a star-like nucleus appears in moments of good seeing. South of the bar, a distinctly darker area is seen, but the spiral arms remain very vague. Their true sense of “rotation” cannot be perceived. M 91, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

He found this globular cluster on the 27 th of December 1777, observing from Berlin. Messier, still unaware of Bode’s observations, made an independent discovery in his very productive observing night of the 18 th of March 1781. He saw a “Nebula, fi ne, conspicuous and of a great brightness. It does not contain any star; the center is clear and brilliant, surrounded by nebulosity, and resembles the nucleus of a big comet.” Two years later, William Herschel was able to resolve M 92 into many “very small stars.” His son John later commented: “very bright; very large, well resolved; small stars.” Admiral Smyth noticed the bright, hardly resolvable core of M 92. Lord Rosse, however, seems to have had too-high expectations, when he wrote: “It is possible that the core is spiral-shaped, there are dark mottles; the nucleus is, if at all, only va- guely resolvable.” In 1918, Curtis described M 92, according to his deep photographic exposures, as a “bright, unusually condensed globular cluster.” About that same time, the fi rst variable was discovered in M 92 by Woods (1916). Astrophysics At 27,000 light-years, M 92 is not much more distant than the famous M 13. But with only 400,000 solar masses and a diameter of 110 light- years, it is considerably smaller. A detailed photometric study by Buo- nanno et al. made this globular cluster a good calibration object for determining limiting magnitudes: M 92 contains 511 stars brighter than magnitude 17.5, 74 brighter than 16.5, and still 20 brighter than 14.5. M 92 is an especially metal-poor globular cluster and hence has been considered one of their oldest examples. More recent stellar modeling gives this cluster an age of 14 thousand million years, close to the cur- rently assumed age of the universe. Earlier stellar modeling of globular cluster stars was even in direct confl ict with contemporary age values for the universe, then still based on a decelerating expansion. M 92 contains 25 recognized variables, of which 17 are RR Lyrae type stars, typical for globular clusters, and seven are SX Pheonicis type stars. In addition, there is an eclipsing binary of the W Ursae Maioris type, which is rare in globular clusters. Apparently, the high star den- sity with frequent, close stellar encounters in globular clusters disrupts many of their binaries. Recent studies even suggest this variable (V798 Herculis) is not even a physical member of M 92. M 92 orbits the galactic center once every 200 million years. A large eccentricity leads it as close as 5000 light-years, and as far as 35,000 light-years from the galactic core. In about 14,000 years, as a result of the precession of the rotation axis of Earth, M 92 will be within 1° of the celestial north pole. Observation Under good mountain skies, M 92 can be seen with the naked eye by keen observers, who reach a visual limiting magnitude of 7.0. In a pair of binoculars, this object shows up as a bright, round nebulous patch. In a small telescope, the well-concentrated cluster center is seen as a nebulous core. Since the brightest individual stars reach magnitude 12.1, the cluster center appears mottled, or almost resolved from an aperture of 2.5 inches upwards. Resolution into individual stars in the outer regions of M 92 is provided even by telescopes of 3 to 4 inches. But it takes 12 inches to fully resolve the whole cluster. This is due to a stronger degree of concentration than, for example, its brighter and famous neighbor M13. The amount of concentration is the main difference between these two globular clusters in Hercules. That has led to the popular but unjustifi ed belief that M 92 would not be as beautiful. In fact, in a 14-inch telescope, M 92 reaches two-thirds of the visual extent of M 13. Its bright core resembles that of M 5 and appears to be split unevenly, from northwest to southeast, by a dark line. But unlike M 5 or M 13, no marked star chains are seen in M 92.

He did so on the 20 th of March 1781, and noted: “Cluster of small stars, without nebulosity.” Thereafter, hardly any attention was paid to this open cluster by other historic observers – obviously, its very southern, low position in the sky is to blame. There is a single reported observation of this object, by William Smyth, whom it reminded of a starfi sh. Astrophysics Looking in th e direction of M 93, our view spans a long part of the approaching Orion spiral arm. This open cluster is located on its far side, 3380 light-years from us, and it is very close to the galactic plane. Bonatto and Birca measured a total cluster diameter of 23 light- years and a core diameter of 2.3 light-years. The total mass is an es- timated 1700 solar masses. The brightest cluster stars, which reach magnitude 8.1, are blue supergiants of spectral type B9 but, in addition, M 93 contains eight red giants. This has led to an age estimate for this galactic cluster of 400 million years. Observation From the northern latitudes of the USA, Canada, and Europe, naked- eye sightings of M 93 seem just out of reach. But observers living further south, like Walter Scott Houston, have repeatedly pointed out that this is possible. In 10×50 binoculars, a bright but small cluster is seen. The central region of M 93 is perceived as an elongated (in the east-west direc- tion) knot, which forms a western tip, and which is surrounded by a halo of fainter stars. A small telescope shows about 50 stars, which are tightly grouped in a pattern of triples. Like the ’starfi sh' of Smyth, the view of this cluster has inspired the imagination of many obser- vers.

Quickly informed by Méchain, Messier observed it only two nights later. His note of the 24 th of March reads: “Nebula without star, its center is brilliant, the nebulosity slightly diffuse. It resembles the nebula which is below the Hare, No. 79: but this one is fi ner and more brilliant.” Smyth characterized M 94 as a “fi ne pale-white object, with evident symptoms of being a compressed cluster of small stars.” John Herschel, too, got a bit deceived by the mottled, visual appearance of this galaxy, as we read at the end of his note: “Very bright; very suddenly much brighter toward the middle; 4' diameter. Not resolved but resolvable.” Lord Rosse pointed his giant telescope to M 94 in 1855. He re- ported some remarkable detail: “A dark ring surrounds the nucleus, followed by a bright ring outside. This ring is not closed but disrupted and mottled; hence, it probably is a spiral.” D’Arrest’s impression of M 94 was less accurate: “Very pretty, an almost circular disk with a very bright core, similar to a star of 8 th or 9 th magnitude, surrounded by clear, extended nebulosity.” Only photography proved Lord Rosse and his observation right, and clearly showed the spiral structure of M 94. Curtis described it as: “A beautiful object. From the very bright, large nucleus spring many bright, closely packed whorls. These inner whorls show many stellar condensations, whose sharpness and proximity to the nucleus would seem to make this one of the most favorable examples known for the investigation of motions in spirals.” Only later would it become clear that extragalactic distances are too large to allow proper motions in other galaxies observed directly. Astrophysics The remarkable galaxy M 94 is only 17 million light-years away. It is probably a member of the M 106 galaxy group, but some aut- hors count it in with the CVn I cloud of galaxies with M 64. M 94 is a modest galaxy, it has a diameter of 56,000 light-years and contains 60 thousand million solar masses. M 94 is a so-called “starburst-galaxy” (see M 82). In certain regi- ons, we see the simultaneous formation of many new stars. This pro- cess is triggered by density waves, which compress interstellar matter enough to collapse into protostars. In M 94, the main starburst region has the shape of a ring of 1.1' diameter and 10\" thickness. Such a structure is the result of a Lindblad resonance of the density waves with the local rotation velocity of the galaxy. The central region consists, by contrast, of very old, reddish stars. Its age has been estimated at 10 thousand million years. Again, out- side the starburst ring, at 2' to 4' from the galaxy’s nucleus, old stars dominate. The outer edge is outlined by a ring, 7' in diameter, with weak star formation. In addition, in very deep exposures with the Mount Palomar 48-inch telescope, a very faint outermost ring with a diameter of 15' was found. Hence, this galaxy resembles an onion with four layers. M 94 is a rare case of a galaxy with two simultane- ous waves of star formation. In 1995, Möllenhoff and colleagues found traces of a 21\" long bar in PA 28°, inside the bright inner ring, with some deviation from the major axis in PA 90°. The nucleus is of the LINER type (see M 81) and hosts a strong X-ray source. Between the bar and the bright ring, photos show some spiral structure, which has been classifi ed as (R) Sab(s), (R)SA(r)ab, or RSab(r). M 94, historical drawings.

Messier observed these two galaxies only four days later and characterized M 95 as a “nebula without star, its light is very faint.” 50 years later, Admiral Smyth described it as a “lucid white nebula. This nebula is round and bright, and perhaps better defi ned on the southern than on the northern limb.” Lord Rosse saw two ellipses with his giant telescope and had the impression that the “center is pos- sibly resolvable.” Heinrich d’Arrest commented on M 95 as an object “pretty and very bright, a little small and oval, much denser in the central region.” Heber Curtis devoted a detailed description to M 95 in 1918: “A beautiful object; nearly round. The whorls are rather faint and form an almost complete ring; a wide band of matter extends across the nebula from one side to the other; an example of the T -type spiral. The centre is exceedingly bright, and of unusual structure. It is about 12\" in diameter, and appears trinuclear; the center of the disk is not marked by any condensation, but on its periphery has two stellar nu- clei, and a short, very bright, slightly curved mass.” Astrophysics M 95 belongs to the Leo I group of galaxies, of which M 96 is the major galaxy (see M 96). With a diameter of 70,000 light-years, M 95 is the slightly smaller galaxy of the two, with only 50 thousand mil- lion solar masses. M 95 is one of only a few barred spirals in the Messier catalog. It has been classifi ed as SBb or SB(r)ab. Its spiral arms are almost closed into rings, so that A. Sandage called it a “typical ring-galaxy.” The core is surrounded by a small, inner ring of active star formation regions, 14\" in diameter (2000 light-years), which was described by Curtis. It is surrounded by HII regions, which make this central part 1' in diameter. These rings have been formed by resonance effects (see M 94). Observations of cepheids, using the Hubble Space Telescope, gave a distance to M 95 of 31.2 million light-years. After subtle recalibra- tions, today’s value is 32.6 million light-years. Hence, several sources now agree with each other that M 95 is closer to us than M 96. Observation M 95 is at the limit of visibility in 10×50 binoculars. A small telescope shows it as the faintest member of a group of four, with M 96, M 105, and NGC 3384. Its shape is slightly oval, and there is a very faint, apparently stellar nucleus in its center. 4.7 inches aperture reveal a better view of the nucleus, which still looks almost like a star, and M 95 appears more clearly oval than its brighter neighbor M 96. In a 14-inch telescope, the bright core gives the impression of a planetary nebula. There are strong irregularities in it, but even with 400× magnifi cation, they cannot be grasped with certainty. The well- defi ned bar has a length of 1.5' in PA 120° and a brighter western side. The spiral arms are diffi cult to perceive, even with this aperture. While the edge of M 95 does appear slightly brighter, this is not en- ough to give the impression of a ring. The visual diameter of the oval galaxy reaches 3' in PA 15°.

While these discoveries were actually made after he found M 97 to M 100, their order got changed in the Messier catalog, because Mes- sier chose to confi rm the discoveries of M 95 and M 96 fi rst. On the 24 th of March 1781, M 96 appeared to him as a “nebula without star, near the previous [M 95]; this one is less apparent, they resemble the two nebulae in the Virgin, Nos. 84 and 86.” Smyth described M 96 as “round but not equally well defi ned nebula, large, and of a pale white colour.” D’Arrest regarded it as “a twin of M 95, but it appears to be superior in luminosity. A cluster which has an ill-defi ned boundary. Resolved at 226× magnifi cation.” D’Arrest must have been misled by the mottled structure of the central region, which only shows its true, spiral character on photographic images. Hence, Curtis wrote in 1918: “A fi ne strong spiral. Bright stel- lar nucleus; the outer whorl of the brighter structure forms a nearly complete oval ring; a much fainter whorl outside.” Astrophysics M 96 is the brightest member of the Leo I galaxy group. The other members are M 95, M 105, NGC 3299, 3377, 3384, 3412, 3489, 3627, and UGC 5889. There may also be a physical association with the M 65 group, which has a very similar distance from us. The distance to M 96 has been measured by means of eight cepheids, observed with the Hubble Space Telescope; the result was 31.9 million light-years. In 1997, 31.2 million light-years were derived. More recent studies, depending on the method used, have produced values between 31 and 39 million light-years. M 96 is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 76,000 light-years and a total mass of 80 thousand million Suns. The central region contains older, yellowish stars, which form a very small, bar-like structure (PA 35°). They are surrounded by a ring of young, blue star clusters. Another very faint outer ring of fragments of old spiral arms borders the galaxy. It is connected with the rest of the galaxy by a spiral arm fragment in the north. There is visible dust, which apparently is concentrated in the we- stern half of M 96. However, this is due to our perspective: the galaxy is inclined to the line of sight by 55°. Furthermore, there is some evi- dence for a ring of dust perpendicular to the innermost bar, and for an intergalactic cloud of neutral hydrogen right in between M 96 and its close neighbor NGC 3384. A supernova (SN 1998bu) was discovered in M 96 on the 5 th of May 1998, by the Italian amateur astronomer Mirko Vili, 1' north M 96, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

This event was of considerable interest, since it provided an op- portunity to improve the calibration of the distance scale by type Ia supernovae, after the distance of M 96 had already been determined with good precision by means of cepheids. Only type Ia supernovae show the required consistency in peak brightness and light curves. This qualifi es them for being calibrated “standard candles” in mea- surements of large distances. In such an event, it’s not a single, mas- sive star that’s exploding, but rather an accreting white dwarf in a close binary system. At some point, the white dwarf reaches its cri- tical mass limit (the Chandrasekhar limit) of 1.44 solar masses and collapses into a neutron star. By contrast, type II and Ib supernovae involve a large variety of very different stellar envelopes, depending on the individual, massive star collapsing, and every light curve and peak brightness turn out differently. Observation M 96 is only 42' east of M 95. Both galaxies are faintly visible in bino- culars. A small telescope shows M 96 as the brightest object in a group of four, with M 95, M 105, and NGC 3384 – all fi tting into a fi eld of view of 1.5° or more. M 96 appears round, with an apparently stellar, faint nucleus. With 4.7 inches, M 96 is also a bit brighter than M 95, round and marked by a nearly star-like nucleus. A 14-inch telescope shows a bright core of 5\" diameter, embedded in an elongated (in PA 130°), 50\"×15\" central region. It extends into a 2.5'-long bar, which reaches the visual edges of the galaxy. Streched out in PA 145°, M 96 reaches a diameter of 3'. Just south of the cen- tral region is an elongated, dark structure, bordered to the south by a spiral arm fragment. This, together with a northern arm fragment, gives the visual impression of an eye or a ring, but all detail remains diffuse, especially in the northern region. The outer edges of the ga- laxy are bright, starting from the bar ends and turning clockwise. The dark structures inside create the visual illusion of a double-ringed spiral, although diffuse. The very faint, outer ring of spiral arms surrounding M 96 is a challenge, even for photographers. There are several faint background galaxies nearby, among them a strongly reddened edge-on galaxy seen right through that outer ring.

Messier ob- served it, together with several other recent discoveries by his close colleague, on the night of the 24 th of March 1781. He noted: “Nebu- la, it is diffi cult to observe, its light is faint, without star.” William Herschel, using his large, home-made metal mirrors, saw much more of M 97: “A very bright, round nebula of about 3' in diameter; it is nearly of equal light throughout, with an ill defi ned margin of no great extent.” Admiral Smyth apparently had his diffi culties with this object, when he reported: “This very singular object is circular and uniform, and after a long inspection looks like a condensed mass of attenua- ted light, seemingly of the size of Jupiter.” Webb commented: “Large pale planetary nebula, very remarkable object.” In March 1848, Lord Rosse and his assistant Rambaut pointed the giant 72-inch telescope at M 97 on six nights and saw “two stars considerably apart in the central region; dark penumbra around each spiral arrangement, with stars as apparent centres of attraction; stars sparkling in it, resolvable; night excellent.” A friend of Lord Rosse, T.R. Robinson, who had the privilege of joining the observations at the large telescope, gave a description which refl ects Rambaut’s sketch of M 97: “A most intricate group of spiral arcs disposed around two starry centres, looking like the visage of a monkey.” In his later observations, however, Lord Rosse did correct himself: “On many occasions only one star seen and spiral structure doubtful.” It was also Rosse who likened the dark patches in M 97 to the eyes of an owl. Later observers had their diffi culties with the early M 97 observati- on of Lord Rosse. For example, Leo Brenner commented at the end of the nineteenth century: “Planetary nebula, which appears like the face of a monkey in Rosse’s drawing, because Rosse saw in it two stars sur- rounded by darkness which equal a pair of eyes. However, despite all efforts with magnifi cations 40×, 52×, 70×, 98× and 137×, I could see nothing but a nebulous disk of uniform brightness, without details.” In 1907, Barnard devoted a detailed visual-observing study to M 97 to verify Lord Rosse’s sketch. He could confi rm the dark patches and, in one of them, a faint star – but there truly is no second star. Where the second star of Lord Rosse has gone remains a mystery. In 1866, Huggins observed the spectrum of M 97 and proved its gaseous nature. This observation made clear that the nebula could neither consist of stars, nor be a spiral galaxy. In 1918, Curtis gave this description, which still is valid today: “The central star is visual magnitude 14 (Burnham), and about 12 photographically. The brighter central oval lies in PA 12°, and the diameter along this line is 199\"; at right angles to this direction it is 203\" in diameter to outside the whorls.

Philipp Keller, Christian Fuchs."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"320 Astrophysics The Owl nebula is a planetary ne- bula, like M 27 or M 57. It shows a triple shell structure: the inner shell of 182\"×168\" is slightly elongated in P.A. 20° and dominates the visual appearance. Two less bright regi- ons along the major axis form the “eyes of the owl.” They are caused by a bipolar cavity in the central shell. The second shell of 218\" is nearly circular and, because of its H D emission, appears red in color photos. It is surrounded by a faint, round but asymmetric halo, best recorded in the light of the [OIII] line, which reaches a diameter of 350\". The shells have similar expansion velocities of 40 to 45 km/s. Distance measures of planetary nebulae are notoriously uncertain, since their physical properties are diffi cult to calibrate and depend a lot on the individual case. For M 97, distances between 1300 and 12,000 light-years have been derived. A study published in 1999 quotes 4100 light-years, Guerrero et al. (2003) assume 3300 light-years. This would give M 97 a physical diameter of 3 light-years, similar to M 27, and a shell of 0.5 solar masses. For the same reasons as above, it is diffi cult to derive an accurate age for a planetary nebula. For M 97, ages between 6000 and 12,000 years have been suggested. The advanced state of the shell, in which the inner hot wind has already lost its expansion-driving power (Guerrero et al. 2003), would rather indicate the older age, which is si- milar to the other two planetary nebulae in the Messier catalog. Observation Because it radiates strongly in the green [OIII] emission line, which is quite characteristic for planetary nebulae and happens to coincide with the highest spectral sensitivity of the human eye, M 97 appears much brighter visually (magnitude 9.9v) than photographically (magnitude 12.2p). But modern photography now has the edge in recording the deep-red H D emission line structures of the hydrogen gas, which are well defi ned – by contrast to the more diffuse blue-green image. Even 10×50 binoculars show a very faint, round nebula without detail. In a small telescope, the pale nebulous disk remains without detail. An [OIII] line-fi lter improves the view a bit when used with low powers. With an aperture of 4.7 inches, the “eyes of the owl” are vaguely visible. Here, a line fi lter is not helpful: in brightening the nebula, those two dark regions get fi lled in with light and the contrast with the sur- rounding nebula is lost. From 8 inches upwards, the faint central star can be seen. It lies on the bridge of brighter nebulosity, right between the two “eyes.” But good seeing and high magnifi cations are required to achieve suffi cient contrast between the nebula and the small diffrac- tion disk of the central star (see M 57). The obscure “eye”-patches become more distinct with larger aper- tures, but they are not entirely void of nebulosity and remain low-con- trast structures; the southeastern eye is easier to perceive. The two fain- ter stars in M 97 have not yet been mentioned by visual observers. The irregular structure visible on photos taken in the wavelength H D\u0003 on the edge of the nebula is not visible, not even with very lar- ge telescopes. Hence, visually, M 97 remains a diffuse object without sharp contours. Photographs show a star 3.5' southeast of M 97 with a nebulous attachment, the 16 th -magnitude galaxy MCG+9-19-14. Visu- ally, it can be glimpsed in a 14-inch telescope, while a 20-inch shows it unambiguously, apparently attached to the foreground star. M 97, historical drawings.

Near the middle of it are a few stars visible, and more suspected. My fi eld of view will not quite take in the whole nebula. John Herschel saw M 98 as a “ray, much brighter toward the middle almost to a nucleus; 10' long,” while Smyth with his much smaller aperture describes a “fi ne and large, but rather pale nebu- la, but on keeping a fi xed gaze it brightens up towards the centre.” The spiral structure was recognized only on good photographs. Cur- tis characterized M 98 in 1918 as “An open, elongated spiral. Bright stellar nucleus; numerous almost stellar condensations. Absorption effects on east side.” Astrophysics M 98 is a member of the Virgo ga- laxy cluster and is located on its facing side. It has a radial velocity of only 125 km/s, this is almost 1000 km/s less than the average Virgo cluster velocity. Hence, Holm- berg even took M 98 for an unrelated foreground galaxy. However, today it is believed that a close encounter with M 99 brought M 98 into its present fast track towards us. M 98 has been characterized as a transitional object, the core of which has LINER characteristics (see M 81), and exhibits HII regions surrounding it also. These are photo-ionized by many young, hot stars, not by an active galaxy nucleus. With a diameter of 126,000 light-years and 200 thousand million solar masses, M 98 is among the largest Virgo cluster galaxies. We observe this spiral nearly edge-on, at an angle of 10°. Just 5' south, there is NGC 4186, and very deep exposures reveal the faint dwarf galaxy VCC 90, only 2' west of the southern tip of M 98. Observation M 98 ties with M 91 for the fainest Messier galaxy. 10×50 binoculars can just show it at the very limit of perception. In small refractors, M 98 can be seen only at low power, and an elongated shape in the north-south direction is all that can be recognized. A 4.7-inch telescope shows an elongated, 5'-long spindle of light with a barely pronounced core region. Mottled structure in the southern part of the galaxy gives the false impression of faint stars, but it rather indicates bright star formation regions. M 98 remains the most diffi cult spiral galaxy of the Messier ca- talog for visual observers even with an aperture of 14 inches. Clearly visible is an elongated core of up to 15\" size. The rest of the 7.5'×1.5', slim galaxy is very faint. A dark absorption lane north of the core can be recognized vaguely. Both ends of the galaxy appear a little brighter and wider, which is a pointed hint to its spiral structure.

The nebula is between two stars of the seventh & eighth magnitude.” All John Herschel saw was a mottled, round nebula. Lord Rosse in 1846, however, discovered the spiral structure of M 99 – exactly a year after his famous observation of M 51. In 1848, he described his observations with his giant 72-inch telescope: “Spiral with a bright star above; a thin portion of the nebula reaches across this star and some distance past it. Principal spiral at the bottom, and turning to- ward the right.” Not much later, d’Arrest summarized his observation with the words: “large and round spiral: the nucleus is more or less resolvable. Apparently scattered along the margins.” R. H. Allen called M 99 the “Pinwheel Nebula” and celebrated it as “one of the pyrotechnics in the sky.” Curtis described the photogra- phic appearance in 1918 as “A very bright, approximately round spiral 4.5' in diameter. Nucleus almost stellar. There are two main whorls, rather open, which show many almost stellar condensations.” Astrophysics M 99 is a physical member of the Virgo cluster, at a distance of about 53 million light-years. A very recent study of the 3D structure of this galaxy cluster places M 99 about 4 million light-years behind M 100. Its radial velocity of 2407 km/s is the largest of all Messier objects, and it exceeds that of the Virgo cluster by a remarkable 1300 km/s. M 99 has a diameter of 83,000 light-years and contains about 100 thousand million solar masses – less than our Milky Way. The stars in the Sc spiral rotate clockwise around the nucleus, which contains 100 million solar masses. M 99 is of an unusual, asymmetric shape with a displaced core and unequal spiral arms. It is a rare example of a galaxy with one domi- nant spiral arm. The strong star formation in this arm may indicate density waves induced by a past encounter with another galaxy, which would also explain the large relative velocity of M 99 within the Vir- go cluster. But the galaxies in the immediate neighborhood appear to be too small to have done this. The dominance of this one spiral arm is, instead, related to the infall of 23 million solar masses of hydrogen gas, observed with radio telescopes. Three supernovae have been observed in M 99.

He noted: “Nebula without star, of the same brightness as the previous [M 99].” Initially, M 100 was supposed to be the fi nal entry of Messier’s list; all further objects are annexes or later add-ons by other authors. William Herschel estimated the apparent diameter of M 100 as 10' and commented: “there is in the middle of it, a small, bright cluster of supposed stars.” Admiral Smith was clearly misled by his view of M 100: “A round nebula, pearly white. This is a large but pale object, of little character, though it brightens from its attenuated edges to- wards the centre; and is therefore proved to be globular.” Lord Rosse discovered the spiral nature of M 100 but believed that a planetary nebula would form its center. Lastly, Curtis described this galaxy very well, as seen on deep photographs: “A bright, regular, ne- arly round spiral 5' in diameter. Very faint stellar nucleus surrounded by bright, short whorls, forming a central oval. The outer whorls are rather open, quite regular, and show many stellar condensations.” Astrophysics M 100 is one of the largest spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster. With a diameter of 107,000 light-years and 200 thousand million solar masses, it is comparable to the Milky Way in size and mass. Our view of the two major spiral arms is face-on. Blue, young star clusters and star formation regions outline the main arms while fragments of weak arms are found in between. Overall, the structure of M 100 appears a little asymmetric, with the major arms slightly bent. This impression agrees with detailed studies which reveal a larger amount of young stars south of the galaxy core. The central region was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993. It is very bright and like a small spiral of its own within the large galaxy. NASA’s Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board the Astro-1 satellite recorded intensive UV radia- tion from the central region of M 100. There is a ring of intense star formation, 7.5\" to 20\" in diameter, with many young, massive stars. This bright ring gave historic observers the impression of a planetary nebula or a central star cluster. Its formation, as well as the asym- metric appearance of the galaxy as a whole, can be attributed to past encounters with other Virgo cluster galaxies, and the related action of tidal forces. In 1993, with the use of the Hubble Space Telescope, M 100 be- came the fi rst Virgo cluster galaxy in which cepheids were observed. Twenty such variables with 24 th to 26 th magnitude were found and a distance of 55.8 million light-years was derived. Later recalibration reduced that distance measure to 52.7 million light-years, and most recent data give preference to an even slightly lower value of 49.6 million light-years. M 100 has produced fi ve observed supernovae so far. SN 1901B reached magnitude 15.6 in March 1901; similarly SN 1914A attained magnitude 15.7 in February 1914. SN 1959E reached its maximum of only magnitude 17.5 in August 1959, before its actual discovery in February 1960. The brightest by far supernova in M 100 was SN M 100.

Observation In 10×50 binoculars, this fabulous spiral appears only as a round ne- bulous patch. A 2.5-inch refractor shows a nearly stellar core with a diffuse, round halo. With a 4.7-inch telescope, the spiral structure can vaguely be perceived under a clear mountain sky. But it takes an aperture of 14 inches to see it in its full beauty. Then, M 100 turns out to be a great spiral with two tightly wound, diffuse arms, which both make a full turn around the galaxy’s center. The arm that ends in the north is fainter, and it is mottled towards its end; its root, however, is brightly marked and well distinguished from the core. The south-ending arm is better defi ned, and it becomes diffuse before it vanishes towards the south. In its visual appearance, M 100 is an oval in PA 105°, which is almost perpendicular to the major axis of the photographic image (PA 30°).

He described the new fi nd as “Nebula without star, very obscure and pretty large, 6' to 7' in diame- ter.” This galaxy was found just before the fi nal version of Messier’s catalog was going into print. In a last-minute effort, M 101 made it into an appendix, together with two more objects found by Méchain that night (M 102 and M 103). On the 14 th of April 1789, William Herschel observed M 101 and discovered three nebulous spots within its glow. These are now known as NGC 5461, 5462, and 5447. William Smyth got very inspired by this object, although misled about its nature, when he wrote in the 1830s: “It is one of those globular nebulae that seem to be caused by a vast agglomeration of stars, rather than by a mass of diffused lumino- us matter; and though the idea of too dense a crowd may intrude, yet the paleness tells of its inconceivable distance, and probable discrete- ness.” Lord Rosse fi nally noticed and sketched the spiral structure of M 101 with its knots, and he made out a diameter of 14'. To d’Arrest, who had a much smaller telescope at his disposal, this galaxy looked much different: “The outer margin is very faint and diffi cult to perceive. The nebula is not quite round, its nucleus diffuse. This is a complex object with two centres linked to each other; that, however, is not easily recognized.” Curtis, in 1918, had good photographs to characterize M 101: “This unusually beautiful spiral is about 16' in diameter. There is an almost stellar nucleus, with two bright condensations very close which give a tri-nuclear appearance. The open whorls show a multitude of stellar condensations. 5449, 5450, 5451, 5453, 5455, 5458, 5461, 5462, are simply brighter knots in the great nebula.” Astrophysics M 101 is the textbook example of a “grand design” spiral, type Sc, which we see face-on, and which is only half so far as the distance of the Virgo cluster and the spiral galaxies there (see M 99). Only a close inspection reveals some asymmetries; it shows that the nucleus appears a little displaced from the geometric center. Arp characterized M 101 as a “spiral with one heavy arm” and included it in his list of interacting galaxies, as No. 26. These interactions must have their origin in the near companion galaxies NGC 5477, NGC 5474, and Holmberg IV. Close encounters would have caused deformations of spiral arms and initiated new star-formation regions. Other less close members of the M 101 gala- xy group are NGC 5204, NGC 5238, and UGC 8882, UGC 8837, and UGC 9405. In addition, there is a small, anonymous galaxy near the end of the northern spiral arm of M 101, which is probably a back- ground object. M 101 is an important object in the calibration and comparison of various distance measurement methods and distance indicators. In 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope found several cepheids, from which a distance of 24 million light-years was derived. Hipparcos data sug- gested 27 million light-years, and recent cepheid recalibrations cor- rect the Hubble data to a distance of 22 million light-years. Even this smallest distance value for M 101 yields a very large physical diameter of 184,000 light-years – almost twice as large as our Milky Way! Along the spiral arms, numerous bluish spots with active star formation and red HII regions stand out. Ten of these knots have re- ceived individual NGC identifi cations (5447, 5449, 5450, 5451, 5453, 5455, 5458, 5461, 5462, and 5471). Some of these knots contain the mass of more than 10 million Suns and rival the mass of a dwarf galaxy. In 1990, Hodge cataloged 1264 HII regions in M 101, and Ju- rcevic et al. (2007) found 3000 probably young open clusters along the spiral arms. Three supernovae have so far been observed in M 101. SN 1909A was discovered on the 26 th of January 1909, by Max Wolf at Heidel- berg Observatory (Germany), and reached magnitude 12.1. SN 1951H followed in September 1951 with only magnitude 17.5, and SN 1970G fi nally made it to magnitude 11.5 on the 30 th of January 1970. A lot of observers got deceived, though, by a foreground star of magnitu- de 12.5 just 1.2' north of the galaxy core, which really is in the right place and has the right brightness to be taken for a supernova. Observation M 101 is the third-largest galaxy in the Messier catalog, by appearance in the sky. This is already obvious in 10×50 binoculars, which show M 101 as an unambiguous nebula without a core. Even a sighting with the naked eye may not be impossible, but no such observation has been reported so far."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"330 M 101.

The joint patch of NGC 5447 and NGC 5450 appears elongated, NGC 5455 stellar in a pale background, and NGC 5461 and 5462 are visible as small spots. They indicate the outline of the southwestern spiral arm. With 14 inches aperture, M 101 has gained so much detail that a whole night is required to record it all. The spiral pattern remains weak and is best seen as chains of knots rather than well-defi ned arms. The eastern spiral arm makes a full turn around the ga- laxy. It starts 10' northeast of the nu- cleus, at H 1216 (Hodge, 1990), which appears almost stellar but very faint. Nearby NGC 5471 looks much like a magnitude 13.7 star. The arm is a faint glow here, which reaches NGC 5462, an oval, clumpy nebula of 1' length and magnitude 14.0. Further on towards the core, there is NGC 5461, which is a bit smaller than NGC 5462 but clearly visible. Both these NGC objects gain by the use of narrowband fi lters.

The confusi- on about this object started two years later, on the 6 th of May 1783, with a letter by Méchain, who wrote to Bernoulli in Berlin: “M. Mes- sier lists under No. 102 a nebula which I have discovered between Omicron Boötis and Iota Draconis; this is a mistake. This nebula is the same as the preceding No. 101. Mr. Messier, due to an error in the sky charts, has confused this one in the list of my nebulous stars communicated to him.” So, does M 102 = M 101? This remains a debated issue, but it ap- pears quite likely that Messier, searching for an object at the errone- ous position given by Méchain actually did fi nd a new nebula there: NGC 5866. Messier’s description of M 102 does not match the appea- rance of M 101 (see discussion on page 36), and NGC 5866 is in the right place and of suffi cient brightness to be the object seen by Mes- sier. This is now a commonly accepted view in Europe and, hence, the author does not believe that M 102 is just a doubling of M 101. William Smyth saw this galaxy as a “bright-class oval nebula. It is rather faint at the edges, though not so as to obscure the form.” Lord Rosse studied M 102 with his giant telescope in 1848 and commented: “A very bright resolvable nebula, but none of the component stars to be seen distinctly even with a power of a thousand. A perfectly straight line and longitudinal division in the direction of the major axis. Resolvability most strongly indicated towards the nucleus.” In 1918, Curtis gave his description, based on the fi rst photographs of this object: “No spiral structure is discernible, but it appears to be a spiral of the Andromeda type seen edgewise. Its most striking fea- ture is a narrow, clear-cut dark lane along the middle, making a slight angle with the major axis.” Astrophysics M 102 is a beautiful example of a spindle-type galaxy, seen edge- on. Based on over-exposed photos, it was at fi rst misclassifi ed as an E6-type, elliptical galaxy. De Vaucouleurs corrected that to SA0sp, and modern notations now simply use S0. The galaxy has a disk and a central bulge like a spiral galaxy, but it lacks spiral arms. Japanese scientists have concluded that the disk is composed of relatively young stars, while the bulge contains old stars, like in our own galaxy. The orientation of M 102 is so exactly edge-on that the dust lane in the galaxy’s plane appears as a remarkably sharp, 3\" thin, black line. In 1959, Burbidge found a slight warp in this dust lane. Recent studies (Kacprazk, Welch 2003) focused on the continuing star forma- tion in the disk and concluded that it would be fed by stellar winds, planetary nebulae, and supernovae from the already existing stars – a recycling of stellar material, so to speak. Ciardullo and colleagues (2002) found 11 probable planetary nebulae in the halo of M 102 and used them to derive a distance of 45 million light-years; a study in the following year adopts a value of 41 million light-years. With this, M 102 has a physical diameter of 71,000 light-years. M 102, historical drawing. Lord Rosse (1848)."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"334 M 102.

Méchain recognized it correctly as a “Cluster of stars between H and G of the leg of Cassiopeia.” 50 years later, Admiral Smyth described M 103 as a “fan-shaped group, diverging from a sharp star in the north following [northeast] quadrant. The cluster is brilliant from the splash of a score of its lar- gest members, the four principle ones of which are from the 7 th to the 9 th magnitude; and under the largest, in the southeast, is a red star of the 8 th magnitude.” A similar view, expressed in fewer words, had d’Arrest: “A pretty, reddish star stands out, of a rosé tint. An uneven cluster, consisting of stars of 9 th , 10 th , and 11 th magnitude.” Leo Brenner observed M 103 with a 7-inch telescope and noticed its double star: “pretty with magnifi cation 93×, triangular, with pretty double star magnitudes 6 and 10, 13\" to 14\" separation, furthermo- re a beautiful red star of 8 th magnitude, otherwise stars of 9 th to 10 th magnitudes.” Astrophysics With a likely distance of 7200 light-years, M 103 is about as far away as the famous double cluster h and F in the Perseus arm of the Milky Way, and it is the farthest open cluster in the Messier catalog. The interstellar extinction, probably 1.5 magnitudes, makes precise distance and age determinations for M 103 diffi cult. Shapley cha- racterized this object as a loose and poor cluster, and he even questi- oned its physical existence, but Wallenquist recognized 40 member stars. Sanner et al. (1999) studied 228 stars brighter than magnitu- de 14.5 in a fi eld of 10' radius and confi rmed 77 of them as cluster members. The brightest cluster star, at the northern tip, is a blue giant. It has magnitude 7.2 (or about 40,000 solar luminosities), a spectral type B5 and two companions, one of which is a Be star. The second- brightest star (magnitude 8.5) of the cluster is a red M1 giant with 10,000 solar luminosities. Earlier sources claimed that these stars were not physical members of M 103, but Sanner et al. (1999) confi rmed the membership of both. They also showed that the bright star which marks the southeastern corner of the cluster, a suspected variable, does not belong to it. A group of Polish astronomers discovered six variables in M 103. In 1993, G. Meynet derived an age of 25 million years for M 103. According to Sanner et al. (1999), the cluster is probably even youn- ger, 16 million years. The true cluster diameter is 17 light-years, and the Trümpler classifi cation is II3m, according to Trümpler himself, or II2m, according to Götz. M 103 is part of the young (age 20 to 25 million years) Cas OB8 association. Other members are the neighboring clusters, in order of increasing age, NGC 654, 659, and 663. The brightest star in that association is the giant HD 9973 with magnitude 6.9 and spectral type F5. Observation Even through 8×30 binoculars, M 103 is visible as a compressed, mottled patch of light, not far northeast of the bright star G Cas. A small refractor shows half a dozen stars in a triangular arrangement. At low power, M 103 is just one of many highlights in a rich star fi eld, which includes NGC 663, 654, 659, and Trümpler 1 – all these objects are confi ned within a 3° radius. A medium-sized telescope shows 20 to 30 stars, which are densely packed into a triangular shape. The colors of the stars become well perceivable with a 14-inch telescope. A red star near the cluster cen- ter contrasts nicely with a white-golden star at the southwest corner. The bright double star at the northern tip ( 6 131, ADS 1209) is white. It has a blue companion of magnitude 10.9, separated by 13.8\" (PA 142°), and another magnitude 10.9 star, twice as far away in the same direction (28.2\", PA 145°). A much fainter double star can be found in the southeastern part of the cluster: Stein 232 consists of two stars magnitudes 11.9 and 14.4 with a separation of 12.3\", PA 20°."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"337 M 103 impresses with member stars of different colors.

It is of a faint light.” Messier knew about Méchain’s discovery, since he added a hand-written note of it to his printed copy of his fi nal catalog, and it is likely that he observed this ob- ject himself. However, this object came too late to make it into the original catalog. Finally, the well-known French popular astronomy writer Camil- le Flammarion found Messier’s note in 1921 and awarded this galaxy the merits of a Messier object. William Herschel was able to see much more of M 104 than Méchain. He described it as “A faint diffused oval light” and observed the dark lane bisecting the galaxy. His son John confi rmed in 1833 “that there is a dark interval or stratum separating the nucleus and general mass of the nebula from the light above it. Surely no illusion.” A few years later, Admiral Smyth speculated: “This must be another of those vast fl at rings seen very obliquely, already spoken of, and is an elegant example of that celestial perspective.” Heinrich d’Arrest, however, saw just a “bright ray, small nucleus like a star of 10 th magnitude.” It took the fi rst deep photographic exposures in the early 20 th century to reveal the full beauty of this galaxy. Curtis wrote: “A remarkable, slightly cur- ved, clear-cut dark lane runs along the entire length to the south of the nucleus; probably the fi nest known example of this phenomenon. There are very slight traces of spiral whorls.” M 104 became the fi rst galaxy known to have a large radial velocity in 1912, when Vesto M. Slipher obtained a value of 1000 km/s away from us. The modern value (Burk- head, 1986) is 625 km/s. In addition, Slipher discovered the rotation of this galaxy from Doppler-shift measurements across M 104. Astrophysics Remarkably, the distance of this famous spiral galaxy still remains unclear. The latest values range from 28 to 45 million light-years. In any case, M 104 is not a member of the Virgo cluster but a foreground object. We see it edge-on, at an angle of only 6° south of the galaxy’s plane. From this perspective, the dark dust lane dominates the view. The many micron-size dust particles alone have an estimated mass of, at least, 10 million Suns, and the whole galaxy contains several hundred thousand million solar masses. Short exposures show, despite the edge-on perspective, well- defi ned spiral arms near the core region. Hence, in 1951, Lindblad characterized M 104 as a multiple-arm spiral with fragmented spiral arms. Hubble classifi ed it (in 1961) as between types Sa and Sb. To- day, however, M 104 is instead considered to be a transitional object between a spiral and an elliptical galaxy. Very deep exposures taken by David Malin show an extended halo of elliptical shape, partially deformed by interaction with neighboring galaxies. The center of the galaxy hosts a super-massive object, probably a black hole, which contains a thousand million solar masses. In 1988, M 104 was one of the fi rst such galaxies to be found with this kind of nucleus. That has also become known as a X-ray source, discovered by the Einstein satellite. Hence, M 104 is a LINER galaxy (see M 81), even though the X-ray emission is relatively weak and extended. Ac- cording to standard accretion theory, this black hole should be 200 times more luminous in X-rays. The central bulge of M 104 is remarkably pronounced. It compri- ses about a quarter of all the mass of that galaxy, while the bulge of our Milky Way contains only one seventh of the total mass. In addition, M 104 possesses a very large halo of an estimated 2000 globular clusters, of which 1200 have already been identifi ed. It may be the largest halo of all known spiral galaxies and reaches out to 20' from the galaxy core. The brightest globular clusters re- ach magnitude 19.1. This globular cluster system has been studied in detail since it may serve as a standard for extragalactic distance measures. Observation M 104 is visible as a small, elongated nebulous spot in 10×50 binoculars. Small telescopes show an elongated nebula, while the dust band re- quires larger apertures. With a 4.7-inch refractor, a strongly elongated (PA 90°) spindle becomes visible, with a sharp southern borderline and a rounded, detached southern part. The dust band makes a va- gue appearance with indirect vision. It is directly visible, as it cuts off the faint southern part from the bright, extended core, only with 12 inches of aperture and more. It measures about 15\" in width. An elliptical halo surrounds the galaxy and reaches a 12 th -magnitude star 1.5' north of the core. In total, M 104 has a visual extent of 5'×3', while photographic images show almost twice the size. The brightest globular clusters remain beyond the reach of visual observation, but they look like a swarm of bees in deep photographic exposures of the Sombrero Galaxy. The double star 6 1669 lies 1.4° southeast of M 104. With two almost equally bright components of magnitudes 6.0 and 6.1, and a separation of 5.2\", it makes a nice object for small telescopes."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"339 M 104.

He reported this in a letter to Bernoulli: “Mr. Messier mentions two nebulous stars, which I have discovered in the Lion. There is, however, a third one, somewhat more northerly, which is even more vivid than the two preceding ones.” Messier knew of that third nebula but, apparently, he had not enough time in those last days before his fi nal catalog went into print to ob- serve and include it. Hence, M 105 was added to the Messier list only much later, in 1947, by Helen Sawyer-Hogg. The mid-nineteenth century observer Reverend Webb described the view of M 105 with his 3-inch refractor as “two faint nebulae, preceding [the western] much larger and brighter, with stellar nucle- us.” Herschel made out a third, faint nebula, forming with the others “a right-angled triangle.” These other two objects are nearby galaxies, as we can read in the description given by Curtis: “This, with NGC 3384 and 3389, forms a striking group, a right-angled triangle whose shorter sides are 7' long. 3379 is nearly round, 2' in diameter; very bright; no spiral structure discernible.” Astrophysics M 105 is a member of the Leo I galaxy group, together with M 96 and M 95. Consequently, the distance to this elliptical, structureless galaxy is in the range of 33 to 38 million light-years. In projection, if the distances were exactly equal, M 105 would be separated from M 96 by only 450,000 light-years. With about 100 thousand million solar masses, M 105 is almost as massive as the Milky Way, but at 55,000 light-years in diameter, it is much smaller in size. Because of its textbook elliptical appearance and lack of structure, M 105 is used as a photometric standard for the density distribution in elliptical galaxies. According to van den Bergh, it is the best-studied elliptical galaxy of all. Nevertheless, Capaccioli claimed in 1987 that it should be classifi ed as an S0-type (spindle) galaxy or, at least, as an oblate elliptical seen face-on. High-resolution images of the core of M 105, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, have revealed a dark band-like structure near the nucleus. The stars here are in fast orbits around the galaxy’s center, which indicates a super-massive object there, possibly a black hole of 200 million solar masses.

There appears to be a relatively small number of globular clusters around M 105. In 1984, Pritchet and van den Bergh counted 140 globular clusters brighter than magnitude 24.5. In 2003, Whitlock confi rmed such a low count, fi nding 133. The nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3389 has a similar mass, but it is twice as far away as M 105. It shows a considerably larger radial ve- locity, 1306 km/s (Leo I group: 850 km/s) and is a member of the NGC 3338 galaxy group, formed by NGC 3338, 3389, and 3346. But NGC 3384, by contrast, seems to be a true, physical companion of M 105 and is counted as a Leo I group member. Observation In 10×50 binoculars, M 105 is faint- ly, but unambiguously, visible. The fi eld of a small telescope shows the appealing arrangement of a small galaxy group, formed by M 105 with M 95 and M 96.

Mé- chain also informed Messier of his fi nd, but the latter may never have observed M 106. And it was already too late for an entry in his last catalog version, anyway. It was Helen Sawyer-Hogg who suggested in 1948 adding this galaxy to the famous Messier list. William Herschel appropriately described this object in 1788 as “Very brilliant. Bright Nucleus. With faint milky branches north pre- ceding [northwest] and south following [southeast]. 15' long and to the south following running into very faint nebulosity extending a great way. The nucleus is not round.” His son John noted: “Very bright; very large; very suddenly very much brighter toward the middle to an oval nucleus; 8' or 9' long, 4' or 5' broad,” and Webb very nicely characterized M 106 as a “scaled-down image of the An- dromeda galaxy.” Astrophysics The bright Sb spiral M 106 should be considered one of the fi nest ga- laxies of the catalog. According to Sandage, the match by radial ve- locity (537 km/s) may suggest membership in the Ursa Major group of galaxies, which includes M 108 and M 109. But the most recent distance values of 23.5 to 26.0 million light-years place it half as far away. Such a close distance yields a large physical diameter of 135,000 light-years, in better agreement with the size of other spirals than what it would be at any larger distance. Tully regards M 106 as a member of the Coma-Sculptor galaxy association, which forms a bridge between the M 64 group and NGC 253. M 106 itself is the center of a galaxy group of 17 objects, which include the beautiful edge-on galaxy NGC 4242, the galaxy pair NGC 4485/4490, and the irregular galaxy NGC 4449 in the neighborhood of M 106. Tully considers M 106 a transitional object between a spiral and a barred spiral and has classifi ed it as SABbc. Most authors, however, agree with Webb’s historic remark, and see a strong morphologic si- milarity to M 31. That has led to a classifi cation of SAb or Spb. The spiral arms of M 106 are accompanied by prominent clouds of dust that reach to the core. Blue star clusters and red HII regions outline the spiral structure further outside. Courtes et al. (1993) cata- loged a total of 137 HII regions in M 106. Already in 1943, Seyfert discovered characteristic emission lines in the spectrum of the nucleus of M 106, which shows it is a LINER- type galaxy (see M 81), a mild form of a compact, active galactic nucleus. This was confi rmed in 1995 when observations with the VLA radio telescope revealed a strong radio source. There is a mas- sive central object, probably a black hole, of about 39 million solar masses (moderate, though, by comparison with other galaxies) and a diameter of only 1/12 to 1/24 light-year (2700 to 5300 AU). It is surrounded by a dense accretion disk and consumes about 1% of a solar mass every year. M 106, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

Robert Gendler."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"346 In addition, Tully and colleagues (1995) discovered a bipolar jet that leaves the nucleus of M 106, similar to the ones in M 87, which are especially prominent in radio emission. They are inclined by 30° to the galaxy’s plane and stimulate motions in the low-density halo gas, which make it plunge into the gas-rich galaxy disk. X-ray images are dominated by apparent “abnormal spiral arms,” a projection ef- fect. 2800 and 5500 light-years away from the galaxy nucleus, “hot spots” are formed by the jets where they shock the surrounding halo gas – visible in radio and X-ray emission. Only one supernova has been observed in M 106, so far. SN 1981K reached magnitude 16 in August 1981. Observation M 106 and M51 have the most easi- ly visible spiral structure of all the galaxies in Messier’s catalog. Even small 8×30 binoculars show M 106 as a faint nebulous spot. With 2 inches of aperture, it appears bright and distinctly elongated. A core of almost stellar appearance easily shows up in small telescopes. 4.7 inches of aperture show the nucleus embedded in a bar per- pendicular to the major axis of the galaxy’s body. Two spiral arms start at the ends of the bar and run along the northeast and southwest edge of the luminous spindle. The northern arm is the more distinct of the two and reaches out to a star of 11 th magnitude 5' north of the galaxy’s center. With larger apertures, M 106 is an object with an impressive rich- ness in detail. Observed with a 14-inch telescope, dark dust lanes spiral outwards. The 15\" small core is oval (PA 120°) and leads into the 2.5'-long bar (PA 110°), outlined by the dust lanes. The bar ends are the starting points for two spiral arms, of which the northern is brighter and wider, and the southern appears narrower and straigh- ter. Both arms are structured by dark mottles and bright condensa- tions, the northern arm appears to give way to an inward-spiralling structure. Both spiral arms reach out to 4' on the major axis. Outside is a halo of vaguely visible, faint spiral structure which engulfs the 11 th -magnitude star to the north. This gives the galaxy a total visible length of 14' (PA 165°). Photographic images reveal an extent of an impressive 20'! There are several faint galaxies in the immediate neighborhood of M 106.

Messier may not have observed this object himself, but his handwritten notes prove that he knew of it. Hence, in 1948, Helen Sawyer-Hogg suggested ad- ding this globular cluster to Messier’s famous list as object No. 107. In 1793, William Herschel described M 107 as a “very beautiful ex- tremely compressed cluster of stars, extremely rich, 5' or 6' in diame- ter, gradually more compressed toward the centre.” Reverend Webb, observing with a 3\" refractor, could only see a “large, faint star clus- ter, best with low power.” From deep photographic exposures, Curtis measured an outer cluster diameter of 8' and a core diameter of 3'. Astrophysics M 107 is a globular cluster at a di- stance of about 27,000 light-years – but older distance values disagree by over 5000 light-years, either way. In any case, M 107 is a globular cluster of the galactic bulge. Its orbit, which is inclined 45° to the galactic plane and takes 100 mil- lion years to complete, never leaves the bulge for the galactic halo around it. Globular clusters near the galactic center are usually not as metal-poor as those from the outer halo. The above distance and its largest diameter in modern deep photo- graphs give M 107 a physical size of 105 light-years. Its total mass is equivalent to only a meager 200,000 Suns, because the concentration of this globular cluster is remarkably low (class X). Deep photos show a few dark absorption patches, and the brightest cluster stars, all gi- ants, reach magnitude 13. The giant branch leaves the main sequence (turn-off point) at about magnitude 15.6. Hence, most cluster stars are even fainter than that. So far, 23 variables are known in M 107. Observation M 107 appears bright and almost stellar in 10×50 binoculars. Tele- scopes with apertures of less than 6 inches show this globular cluster as a nebulous patch without concentration. With a 4.7-inch refrac- tor, the fi rst stars can be made out, and the cluster is well resolved everywhere from 8 inches and upwards. Because of the low degree of concentration, this globular cluster appears loose and of low density; there is hardly a denser center. The brightest stars occupy the nor- thwestern region of the cluster, while a darker zone can be perceived near the southeastern edge. In large telescopes, apparent chains of outer stars may look a bit like the spiral arms of a galaxy. The Mira variable V720 Ophiuchi lies in the same fi eld as M 107, only 9' south. Its brightness changes semi-regularly with a period of 332 days between magnitudes 12.1 and 17.0. M 107 is a typical globular cluster of the galactic bulge. Stefan Heutz, Wolfgang Ries.

Pierre Méchain discovered this galaxy on the 19 th of February 1781, and Messier observed it on his own three weeks later: “nebula near the previous [M 97], it is even fainter.” Hence, this object should have received No. 98, as even suggested so in a handwritten note of Messier. Nevertheless, he changed his mind and did not give it any proper entry in his fi nal catalog; we only fi nd it mentioned in that note on M 97. In 1953, Owen Gingerich suggested adding this object to the original Messier list as its No. 108. In 1789, William Herschel observed M 108 and described it as “Very bright, much extended, resolvable. 10' long, 2' broad. There is an unconnected pretty bright star in the middle.” To Smyth, this object appeared “milky-white” and he wrote: “It is faint but well defi ned, being much elongated with the major axis trending south preceding and north following across the parallel, and a small star, like a nucleus, in its center.” Leo Brenner’s note on M 108, after an observation with his fi ne 7\" refractor, uttered doubt about Herschel’s claim “resolvable.” Furthermore, the colorful amateur of Serbian ori- gin here proved his debated observational skills, as he was able to see the faint companion of the diffi cult double star in front of the central galaxy region. Curtis described M 108, as seen on photographic images, as “an irregular, patchy spiral; quite bright. Has a faint nucleus and shows a number of condensations, three of which are almost stellar; a star of 11 th magnitude near the nucleus.” Astrophysics M 108, together with M 109, be- longs to the long-stretched Ursa Major group of galaxies at around 45 million light-years distance. It has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years, and we see it almost edge-on, at an angle of 8° from the galaxy’s plane. This perspective makes it diffi cult to classify, but by general consensus this is a spiral galaxy of type Sc. Tully considered it as a barred spiral (SBcd), and de Vaucouleurs as a transitional object (SAB(s)cd). This galaxy appears as a disk mottled with detail but without a bright center. Along its major axis, there is a conspicuous dark absorption structure. A few HII regions and young star clusters appear against this seemingly chaotic background. There is only little evidence for a well-defi ned spiral structure. On both sides of the galaxy, shells of neutral hydrogen have been discovered, 10,000 to 20,000 light-years long. They contain a total mass of 50 million Suns and may have been created by jets from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) about 50 million years ago, but that process would have consumed a lot of energy. Alterna- tively, Giguere and Irwin have suggested that these shells may be maintained by a large magnetic fi eld. In addition, X-ray observa- M 108, drawing. 14-inch Newtonian.

A faint bar of light is visible in a small refractor. In apertures over 6 inches, some irre- gular structure appears. A 12 th -magnitude star near the center is not the galaxy’s core but a foreground object. It has sometimes been mi- staken for a supernova. After an observation with his 4-inch refrac- tor, John Mallas described M 108 nicely as a “silvery-white beauty, saucer-shaped and very well defi ned, central region surrounded by bright and dark knots.” With larger apertures, this cigar-shaped object is characterized by numerous dark and bright structures. Dark absorption bands stretch along the galaxy’s body, while the brightest parts are just east of the magnitude-12 star, as well as in the eastern tip. There is a faint star immediately southwest of that tip, and another one half way toward the star near the center, both seen with diffi culty through a 14-inch telescope. To resolve the 14 th -magnitude companion of the “central star,” which was fi rst mentioned by Leo Brenner, requires a mirror of at least 20 inches and over 300× magnifi cation. Visually, the galaxy reaches a length of 8.5' with an elongati- on ratio of 8:1. Photographic images of M 108 show a spindle over 10'-long and a halo. There is an easy double star 11' west of the galaxy’s core: h 2560 with two components of magnitudes 9.6 and 12.7 at a separation of 40\".

Pierre Méchain discovered this galaxy on the 12 th of March 1781, and Messier must have observed it himself. A handwritten note in a draft catalog manuscript even suggested it as object No. 99, but it did not make it into the fi nal, printed version as such. In 1953, Owen Gingerich suggested adding this object to the original Messier list as its No. 109. William Herschel observed M 109 with his large refl ectors and described it as “Considerably bright. Bright resolvable nucleus with very faint extended branches to position angle 30° north preceding to south following [northwest to southeast].” John Herschel quoted a visual diameter of 3'. From the fi rst deep photographs, Heber Curtis described M109 as “a beautiful, slightly oval spiral 7' in length. Bright, almost stellar nucleus; whorls are rather open and show a number of faint conden- sations; the central portions show signs of I -type formation.” Astrophysics M 109 is a barred spiral galaxy. In the year 2000, a distance of 67 million light-years was derived from cepheid observations. This gala- xy is a member of the widely spread Ursa Major group of galaxies. Its 79 members possess only 5% of the mass of the Virgo cluster. With a diameter of 137,000 light-years and an impressive mass of 250 thou- sand million Suns, M 109 is one of the largest galaxies of that associ- ation and forms a galaxy group of its own, with 25 members. In fact, the total mass of M 109 would suggest an even larger luminosity and size, as if the galaxy was rather more distant by 10 million light-years. There are three companion galaxies, of the same type as the Magella- nic Clouds, in the immediate neighborhood of M 109: UGC 6923, 14' southwest; UGC 6940, 8' south; and UGC 6969, 11' east. The bar of M 109 is quite short and it ends soon give way to two spiral arms, which give the central region a T -shape. Hence, this ga- laxy has been classifi ed as SBc or SB(rs)bc. Further out, we fi nd four tightly wound spiral arms full of star formation regions; their longest segment makes a 270° turn around the core. Cepa and Beckman (1989) cataloged 394 HII regions. Thus, the spiral arms are characterized by a generally younger, bluish stellar population, while the bar, by contrast, contains older, reddish stars. In this region, within 50\" around the nucleus, there is practically no gas left and star formation ceased long ago. Wilke et al. (2000) explained this in terms of a dynamical effect related to the bar. On the 17 th of March 1956, the only supernova of M 109 (SN 1956A) was discovered – it reached a brightness of magnitude 12.8.

It is at the very limit of 50mm binoculars. A 2.5-inch refractor doesn’t show much more than the bright central region 5' northeast of a 10 th -ma- gnitude star. Ghost images of the bright star J Ursae Majoris (Phekda, magnitude 2.4), only 1° away, interfere with the observation. 4.7 inches of aperture show the galaxy elongated with a ratio 2:1, aiming at the 10 th -magnitude star. The central region appears brighter, but lacks a nucleus. With larger apertures, a very faint halo can be perceived. With 14 inches, the spiral arms become visible, but only with diffi culty.

Almost thirty years after his initial ob- servation, he fi nally published the following note in the Connais- sances des Temps, 1801: “On the 10 th of August, 1773, I studied the beautiful nebula in the girdle of Andromeda (No. 31) under a very good sky, using my achromatic refractor with a 68× magnifi cation, in order to produce a drawing like the one for the nebula in Orion. I saw the nebula which LeGentil had discovered on Oct. 29, 1749 (No. 32). In addition, I saw a new, fainter situated north of the large one. It seemed unbelievable to me, that the faint nebula would not have been noticed by astronomers and myself since the discovery of the large one by Simon Marius in 1612, since the small one is in the same fi eld of the telescope when observing the large one.” Finally, it was Kenneth Glyn Jones, in 1966, who suggested making this galaxy the last addition to the Messier catalogue, as No. 110. An independent discovery of M 110 was made by Caroline Herschel on the 27 th of August 1783. Her brother William then described her object as “a very considerable, broad, pretty faint, small nebula. It shows the same faint color as the great one, and is, no doubt, in the neighbourhood of it.” Admiral Smyth characterized M 110 in 1836 as “a large faintish nebula of an oval form,” and Reverend Webb wrote: “Large faint oval nebula, best with low powers, a very large fi eld in- cludes it with M 32 and M 31. Seems to sparkle.” The description by Curtis, based on the fi rst deep photographic images, mentions the two absorption patches (see below), and also “traces of rather irregular spiral structure.” In 1932, Hubble discovered eight globular clusters in his photo- graphs of M 110, and Walter Baade was the fi rst, in 1944, to succeed in resolving this galaxy into individual stars. He was using the 2.5m Hooker Telescope on Mt. Wilson, and two war-related circumstances actually assisted him: the ordered blackout of nearby Los Angeles, and that his native colleagues were drawn by the US army while he, a German immigrant, was not wanted and could continue to use the telescope. Baade noticed that reddish stars make up most of the suns in M 110 and M 32, which helped him to develop his theory of two different stellar populations, I and II. It was also he, in 1951, who studied the two dark nebulae in M 32 and discovered a dozen related young bright stars in the galaxy’s core – in apparent contradiction to the mass of old, reddish stars around them. Astrophysics M 110 is, like M 32, a physical companion of the great Andro- meda Galaxy, M 31, and has about the same distance of 2.5 million light-years. It contains about 10 thousand million solar masses, which make it the largest companion of M 31. However, with its diameter of only 16,000 light-years, it still is a dwarf within our local galaxy group. Sidney van den Bergh coined the expression “spheroidal ga- laxy” for M 110, as well as for the fainter M 31 satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185, and Sandage would even classify M 110 as an S0-type galaxy. Modern terminology classifi es M 110 as a spheroidal dwarf galaxy, by contrast to earlier characterizations as an elliptical dwarf of type E5 or E6. In 1973, Hodge cataloged a total of twelve dark nebulae in M 110 and described its general shape as elliptical, deformed by tidal inter- action with M 31. Corradi and colleagues (2005) found 75 planetary nebulae in the fi eld of M 110. After deduction of those belonging to M 31, they concluded that 35 belong to M 110. The only recognizable structures in this galaxy are the two dark patches near its center. These dust-clouds are rather atypical features for an elliptical or spheroidal dwarf galaxy, which has lost most of its interstellar gas and dust during encounters with the main galaxy – as Possible globular clusters in M 110 Designation R.A.

Gerald Rhemann, Michael Jäger."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"355 has M 110, in which the normal star formation stopped about 500 mil- lion years ago. However, a recent close encounter must have sparked the formation of the young B stars, now 10 to 20 million years old, within a 40\" radius from the center. Some of these stars have already developed into red giants, and the nearby dust clouds seem to be fed by the collective stellar mass loss of these young stars. The vast ma- jority of the stars in M 110, however, are old, yellowish suns. Among them, 30 RR Lyrae variables, well known from globular clusters, have been found and cataloged. The remaining interstellar gas in M 110 has about one tenth of the normal gas density in a galaxy and rotates against the rotational sense of the stars, which probably is another consequence of the last encounter with M 31. In addition, very deep exposures show a faint light bridge between M 31 and M 110. This 1º-long stream of stars begins in the northwest quadrant of M 31, and it is recognizable by its stars showing M 110 properties (old, reddish), rather than those of M 31. McConnachie et al. (2004) found further observational evi- dence for this being a direct link between the two galaxies in terms of a stream of stars. M 110 possesses more than a dozen globular clusters brighter than magnitude 18.5. The brightest is G 73 with a visual apparent bright- ness of 14.9. Next is G 11, which is over 1° away but is a confi rmed member of M 110. Membership is not certain for G 9, G 51, and G 53, which seem to be younger objects not physically related to M 110. As of 2005, fi ve supernovae have been observed in M 110, all but one in recent years. Zwicky found one in 1957, 7' north of the nucleus. In 1997, the Peking supernova search project found a new 18 th -magni- tude star 7' southwest of the nucleus. The Lick search programme was successful on the 15 th of August 1999 with a supernova of magnitu- de 17.5, 4' north of the galaxy’s center. In 2002 and 2004, two more supernovae of magnitude 17 were found in M 110. In addition, Shara and Neil estimate a nova rate for this galaxy of two per year. Observation Under good conditions, M 110 is vi- sible even in 10×50 binoculars, faint but distinct. In a telescope, it appears as a structureless oval (PA 165°) smudge. Contrary to photographic images, there is no bright core. With 14 inches aperture, a star-like nucleus becomes visible, surrounded by a brighter, elongated central region. The dark structures are vaguely visible with this aperture. A faint star lies directly north of the center on the major axis of the galaxy, which reaches a visual size of 16'×8'. Photographically, an extent of even 26'×16' can be recorded. The southern end of the ellipse and the light of M 31 are then separated by only 6'. On a very clear mountain night, with a large exit pupil, the light bridge between the two galaxies can be perceived. The globular cluster G 73 appears as a stellar object with an aper- ture of as little as 8 inches. Of the fainter globular clusters, only a sighting of G 63 with a 20-inch telescope has been reported. With 14 inches, G 58 can be seen 15' south of M 110’s core, but this object belongs to M 31.

Red giant highly evolved star of spectral type K or M with relatively low surface temperature but large (30 to 1000 times the solar) radi- us. In the HRD, red giants form the giant branches . Redshift shift of the entire spectrum of an astronomical object to- wards longer wavelengths, caused by a considerable relative velo- city away from the observer ( Doppler-shift ), or by the general ex- pansion of the cosmos (cosmological redshift, as for distant galaxies and quasars ), or by the presence of a strong gravitational fi eld. Refl ection nebula caused by stellar light refl ected at the dust in an in- terstellar cloud, in the absence of bright H α emission from the gas, when the illuminating star is not hot enough (spectral type “later” than B1) to ionize the hydrogen. Rosat satellite German imaging X-ray satellite, operating from 1990 to 1999. Runaway star galactic star with unusually large proper motion (50–250 km/s), probably accelerated by a supernova explosion or by a gravitational interaction during a near encounter with a more massive star. Seyfert galaxy type of active galaxy with lower absolute brightness than quasars. Two sub-types can be defi ned by their spectral cha- racteristics: Seyfert 1 galaxies show Balmer lines distinctively broa- der than the forbidden lines , while with Seyfert 2 galaxies, both types of emission lines have about the same width. Solar luminosity total power of the solar radiation over the entire spectrum 3.847 × 10 26 W. Solar mass total mass of the Sun 1.989 × 10 30 kg. Spectral type defi ned empirically by the occurrence of different, cha- racteristic absorption lines in the spectrum, classes O, B, A, F, G, K, M, as well as special classes S and C, are distinguished. Each class is further divided into 10 subclasses. Classes O to M form a tempe- rature sequence, “early” spectral types O to A are hot, blue stars, the “later” types F to M are relatively cool and appear yellow to red. Spectrum distribution of the electromagnetic radiation, organized by wavelength O or frequency; particle radiation spectra are arranged by kinetic energy. The electromagnetic spectrum reaches from long radiowaves (about 1 km to 1 m) via microwaves (1 mm to 1 cm), the infrared (IR, 700 nm to 0.1 mm), optical (380 nm to 750 nm) and ultraviolet light (UV, 100 nm) to X-rays (1 nm) and gamma- rays (1 pm). Spiral arm characteristic feature of a spiral galaxy in the plane of its disk, formed by young stars and interstellar clouds. Star burst short but very intense phase of star formation."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"360 Stellar wind gaseous outfl ow from a star, leading to mass loss; can be hot, fast (2000km/s) and highly ionized, or cool, slow (10 to 100km/s) and even forming dust or soot-like particles. Supergalactic wind hot, gaseous outfl ow from a galaxy into the ex- tragalactic medium, driven by the radiation pressure, supernova explosions, and hot stellar winds of a large starburst region (see M 82, p. 278 ). Supergiants the most luminous stars with up to 1000 solar radii, in all spectral classes from O (blue supergiants) to M (red supergiants). Supermassive object extremely massive and small, compact object; normally a black hole . Supernova (SN) sudden increase of a star’s luminosity by 20 magnitu- des (a factor of 100 million!), triggered by the gravitational collapse of the highly evolved core of a massive star. Remnants are made up of a nebula in fast expansion (the former outer layers of the star) and a neutron star or, possibly, a black hole. Surface brightness measure of the light emitted per surface area by an astronomical object, often given in apparent magnitude per square arcsecond. Surface brightness fl uctuations (SBF) indirect method of distance measurement by means of the spatial fl uctuations in the surface brightness of a galaxy on a CCD chip, employing the discrete nature of the many superimposed stellar images. Synchrotron radiation electromagnetic radiation emitted by very fast (near the speed of light) charged particles, spiralling in a strong magnetic fi eld. Telescope aperture usually given as the diameter of the telescopes primary lens or mirror in inches (e.g., 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 4.7 inches = 120 mm, 14 inches = 360 mm). Tidal forces differential forces between far and near side of a body orbiting in a gravitational fi eld, which cause changing levels of at- mospheres, solid and liquid surfaces (as the tides in the Earth-Moon system), and which can even destroy a loosely bound object too close to the central body. Trümpler classifi cation morphological classifi cation scheme for open star clusters, see p. 53 . Variables all types of stars, which change their luminosity periodical- ly, semi-periodically, or irregularly, for physical or geometrical (i.e., eclipses) reasons, in particular: Cataclysmic variables characterized by large, irregular or semi-re- gular eruptions of light, including the classes of AM Her stars, dwarf novae and novae. These are double stars with a white dwarf in an accretion disk, fed by a mass-overfl ow from the companion star. Cepheids large class of pulsating variables. Their luminosity obeys a tight relation with the period (and, to some extent, the metallici- ty). Hence, these stars are excellent distance indicators. Changes of their internal absorption processes systematically transfer a small fraction of their radiation energy into the pulsation. Periods range between 1 and 50 days, amplitudes between 0.1 and 2 magnitudes. Eclipsing binaries binary system of which the orbital plane lies in the line of sight, allowing regular eclipses to occur. Flare stars see variables ; UV Ceti Mira stars long-period pulsation variables; periods range from about 80 to 1000 days, amplitudes are very large, from 2.5 to 11 magnitudes in visual light. Miras are very evolved red supergiants of spectral classes K5 to M9, S or C, with around 2 solar masses and a strong mass loss, up to 10–4 solar masses per year. Different types of light curves indicate different modes of pulsation, and most Mira spectra show emission lines. Pulsating variables pulsating stars in general, which periodically change their radius, temperature, and luminosity. R CrB supergiants of spectral classes C, F to G, which show sud- den drops of luminosity by 1m to 9m, which can last several weeks, months or even years, probably caused by large and dark, transient circumstellar clouds of carbon-rich dust particles. RR Lyr large class of pulsating variables with periods between 0.2 and 1.2 days and amplitudes between 0.2 and 2 magnitudes. These variables are old stars on the horizontal branch and populate the galactic halo and globular clusters. They all have very similar lu- minosity (around absolute magnitude +0.7, or 40 solar luminosi- ties), which make them good distance indicators. For subtypes, see M 3, p. 76 . RV Tau small class of very luminous pulsation variables, mainly yellow supergiants of spectral type G and K, much less F, with 1 to 3 solar masses and 50 to 100 times the solar luminosity. Their light curves are characterized by alternating shallow and deep minima, periods are between 30 and 150 days. SX Phe dwarf cepheids with very short pulsation periods between 0.05 and 0.21 days, and with amplitudes of 0.3 to 0.8 magnitudes, spectral classes A to F, apparently including some blue stragglers in globular clusters. These variables are somehow similar to δ Scu stars in being evolved main sequence stars of 1.5 to 2 solar masses, but their light curves bear more similarity to those of RR Lyr stars. T Tauri irregular variables; very young (pre-main-sequence) stars of spectral classes F to M with emission line spectra. They are se- veral times the size of the Sun, still in the phase of contraction and mass accretion, with masses between about 0.2 to 2.5 solar masses. UV Ceti fl are stars; class of irregular, eruptive variables due to the occurrence of fl ares, similar to, but much more powerful than, so- lar fl ares. It is thought that sudden reconnection of twisted magne- tic fi elds lines generate bursts of energy. These stars are low-mass (about 0.1 solar masses) main-sequence stars of spectral type M with a relatively young age of about 100 million years. W Ursa Majoris very close, eclipsing binaries. The highly defor- med components have assumed an elliptical shape, which leads to a nearly sine-shaped light curve. W Virginis similar to cepheids, but these stars are much older and mostly belong to the Population II . They are low-mass (around 0.6 solar masses) giant stars of spectral type A2 to K, with periods bet- ween 1 and 100 days, amplitudes up to 2 magnitudes, and light- curves less regular than those of cepheids. G Scuti pulsating variables of spectral type A2 to F6 and very short periods of 0.03 to 0.2 days, with amplitudes of 0.003 to 0.1 magnitudes. Similar to RR Lyr variables, but these stars are evolved main-sequence stars of about 1.5 to 2 solar masses. J Doradus small class of pulsating variables akin to δ Scuti stars, with spectral classes A to F and amplitudes of some 0.001 to 0.1"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"361 magnitudes, but they are more evolved (to subgiants) and have lon- ger periods (0.3 to 3 days) and sine-shaped light-curves.
