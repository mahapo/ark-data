preface All three of the authors of this book worked together o nNASA's Voyager Project during its encounters with the four giant planets. Two of us (Miner and Cuzzi) continued that association during the preparation, launch, and early ̄ight of the international Cassini±Huygens Mission to Saturn and Titan. The third (Wessen) is now Program Systems Engineer for Mission Systems Concepts at NASA's Jet Propul- sion Laboratory. All three of us have enjoyed talking to general and professional audiences about the bene®ts and ®ndings of the ongoing space program. While only one of us (Cuzzi) remains actively involved in ring studies (in fact serves as the Cassini Interdisciplinary Scientist for Rings), all of us continue to follow the successes and rich data return of the international space program, in particular that of the Cassini± Huygens Mission. This book follows the general format and content of two prior books, Uranus: The Planet, Rings and Satellites , writte nas a part of the Wiley-Praxis Series i n Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Neptune: The Planet, Rings and Satellites , a com- ponent of Springer-Praxis Books in Astronomy and Space Sciences. In fact, some of the material in those two books, to the extent that it is still current and relevant to the contents of this book, has been used in the discussion of the Uranus and Neptune ring systems. It is our belief that the inspiring story of the continuing discoveries associated with spacecraft and telescopic exploration of the solar system cannot be told too often. Although much of the planning, data collection, and data analysis lies in the hands of professionals, the harvest belongs to the world, and it is our sincere desire to make these ®ndings as accessible as possible to those who are not professional ring scientists. Most of the research, and indeed all the elements of the space program relevant to the contents of this book, is publicly funded, primarily by the established space agencies of the United States and other nations. We are grateful that so many nations have chosen to support ongoing space research, ground-based telescopic observations, and theo- retical studies."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A number of professional texts published by the University of Arizona Press contain articles about the ring systems. Both Saturn , edited by Tom Gehrels and Mildred S. Matthews, and Planetary Rings , edited by Richard Greenberg and Andre Â Brahic, were published in 1984. They have been referenced frequently in this book, particularly in discussions of pre-Galileo knowledge of Jupiter's ring system and pre- Cassini knowledge of Saturn's ring system. Both were published before the Voyager encounters of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus , edited by Jay T. Bergstralh, Ellis D. Miner, and Mildred S. Matthews (published in 1991), and Neptune and Triton , edited by Dale P. Cruikshank (published in 1995), have been invaluable sources for discus- sions of the ring systems of those two planets. The importance of spacecraft observa- tio nis so great that these books remai na good i ntroductio nto the subject decades after their publication. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and of adaptive optics systems in large ground-based telescopes, and the development of radar and passive radio systems at large radio telescopes (especially Arecibo i nPuerto Rico) have also provided much new data on the rings that supplement and update the data from Voyagers 1 and 2. Most of those results are available in open scienti®c literature. Advances in theoretical studies of ring systems also bene®t from the better understanding of ring system characteristics that is emerging from the observations. It is apparent that the ring systems, particularly (but not limited to) that of Saturn, are far more complex than anyone had reason to believe a few short decades ago. It was in this environment that the authors were approached about producing a text describing the known planetary ring systems and aimed at general audiences. One of us (Miner) was at ®rst reluctant to do so, in part because of approaching retirement, but he took only a little additional persuasion. It has been challenging for each of us to do the research and writing necessary to bring this project to fruition in the midst of other competing responsibilities. For those of you unfamiliar with the world of scienti®c books, such projects provide little ®nancial remuneration; this book is presented to you, fellow citizens of Earth, as a labor of love.

Roughly interpreted out of the Latin, Galileo was telling his colleague, ``I have observed that the most distant of planets has a triple form.'' (Note that U and V are interchangeable in Latin.) Of course, Kepler did not understand what Galileo was announcing until Galileo himself later unscrambled the anagram. This was a practice used by early astronomers to lay claim to a new discovery without divulging its nature until the results were ready for publication. Galileo had been the ®rst to observe the rings of Saturn, although their basic particulate nature (Figure 1.1) was not recognized until the middle of the 19th Century. Four centuries have gone by since Galileo's startling discovery. The existence of Saturn's extensive ring system (and lesser ring systems around Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune) is no longer debated. Nevertheless, as more and more details of these ring systems surface, the observations reveal complexities never before imagined, and many of the features within the rings have not yet been adequately explained. In that sense, this book may be somewhat premature. It is our intent to provide possible explanations for many of the observations as well as to describe phenomena that remain unexplained. Scienti®c advances often come from the ranks of those who may not be experts in the ®eld, but whose interest leads them to contemplate such mysteries. Perhaps among the readers of this book there will be some whose new insights about ring dynamics may one day become the accepted explanations for those phenomena. In a sense, the rings ®rst viewed by Galileo in 1610 and later observed in greater and greater detail by Earth-based telescopes and sophisticated spacecraft have pre- sented us an anagram far more dicult to interpret than Galileo's Latin one.

Instead, we are left to interpret the observations through years of intensive study and contemplation. Of one thing we can be certain: the giant planet ring systems do not violate the laws of physics. But in the process of ascertaining that fact, we may come to newer and more complete understanding of those immutable laws. We welcome you to share i nthat adve nture. 1.2 FIRST IMPRESSIONS Almost everyone who has viewed Saturn and its rings through a moderate-sized telescope can remember that ®rst experience vividly. Many long years ago, the wife of one of the authors of this book was expecting their ®rst child. About two weeks before the due date, we had occasio nto view Satur nthrough a 24-i nch Cassegrai n 2 The scienti®c signi®cance of planetary ring systems [Ch. 1 Figure 1.1.

The view at the lower left (1996) is approximately the same ring opening as when Galileo ®rst observed Saturn in 1610. By squinting the eyes, it is not dicult to see why the fuzzy view through his small telescope might have led him to think there were two smaller bodies ̄anking Saturn.

There were several other young couples with us on that occasion, and, like us, one of the other couples was expecting a child in the near future. The sky clarity and stillness were ideal, and Saturn made a huge impression on each of us. The night was June 28, 1962, and before the evening hours of June 29 both expectant mothers had given birth to healthy new babies. It is entirely possible that our viewing of Saturn that evening had no connection with the births of those two babies; it is also likely that the climbing of a steep ̄ight of stairs that marked the entrance to the observatory was more directly responsible for the timing of these blessed events than was Saturn. Whichever (if either) hastened the births of the two babies, Saturn has nevertheless held a special place in our family's hearts and minds since that night. Because of its spectacular appearance through even a moderate-sized telescope, primarily due to the presence of its bright ring system, Saturn has often been called the ``Jewel of the Solar System.'' For more tha nthree a nd a half ce nturies, Satur n's ring was the only planetary ring system known to humanity. It is still the only planetary ring system easily viewable from Earth-based telescopes. The rings of Uranus were discovered in 1977 from Earth-based telescopes as each ring momenta- rily blocked the light of a background star in front of which Uranus was passing. Similar star ``occultation'' measurements of Neptune from Earth left the nature of its rings uncertain at best, sometimes returning positive results, but more often showing no evidence of a Neptune ring system. The discovery of the Jupiter ring system in 1979, the ®rst images of the Uranus ring system, and the veri®cation of a Neptune ring system in 1989 were left for NASA's hardy interplanetary spacecraft, Voyagers 1 and 2. The Galileo mission provided much additional data on the precise nature and origin of Jupiter rings between 1995 and 2003. In a similar fashion, data on the Saturn ring 1.2 First impressions 3 ] Sec. 1.2 Figure 1.2.

An entire chapter of this book (Chapter 10) will be devoted to a preliminary analysis of Saturn ring system data from the Cassini mission. 1.3 MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS SHARED BY THE KNOWN RING SYSTEMS At ®rst blink, one might suppose that all the known planetary ring systems are pretty much alike. For example, essentially all the ring particles at each of the four giant planets orbit their respective planet very close to that planet's equator. All are composed primarily of small particles, with a major fractio nof the ri ng particles having typical sizes of a centimeter or less. Most of the rings are very thin compared with their radial extent, two major exceptions being Saturn's outermost ring, called the E ring, and Jupiter's innermost ring, called the Halo ring (see Figure 1.3). Both the E ring and the Halo ring are composed of tiny particles, most with diameters of about a micrometer, or about the size of the particles i ncigarette smoke. Particles with such small sizes (and correspondingly small mass) may be subject to other forces which, over the long term, may substantially alter their orbits around the central planet. The possible nature of those forces will be discussed in later chapters. All of the known ring systems are relatively young compared with the ages of their respective planets. The estimated ages of the four giant planets is about 4.5 \u0002 10 9 years, close to the estimated ages of both the Earth and the Sun. A number of factors seem to indicate that dynamic processes within the four ring systems limit their lifetimes to no more than 1% (and perhaps closer to 0.1%) of the ages of the planets. Rings composed of dust-sized particles may have lifetimes that are much shorter, 4 The scienti®c signi®cance of planetary ring systems [Ch. 1 Figure 1.3. In the long-exposure upper image, the vertical extent of Jupiter's Halo ring can be seen to extend well above and below the equatorial plane; in the lower image, the Main ring lies well withi na degree of the equatorial pla ne.

We either have the fortune to be living at precisely the time when rings exist for each of the giant planets, an unlikely scenario, or each of the rings is replenished by ongoing processes. In later chapters, we will try to outline some of these replenishment processes, which vary somewhat from planet to planet. Each of the ring systems seems to exhibit a structure which has the appearance of a series of concentric ringlets, with easily observable radial structure and little or no observable azimuthal variations. This radial sorting of ring particles is primarily the result of gravitational interaction with nearby planetary satellites, although there are a variety of ways this interaction aects the structure. Sometimes it causes sharp inner or outer boundaries of a ring. At other times gaps in an otherwise (radially) con- tinuous ring are created. Gravitational forces from nearby satellites can even result in eectively ``corrugating'' the rings (bending waves) or causing tightly wound spiral variations in the ring particle population (density waves). We will attempt to explain these eects (at least those that are well understood) in terms that do not require the reader to have an extensive background in celestial dynamics or a keen understanding of higher mathematics. All in all, the creation and molding of planetary ring systems is both complex and fascinating. 1.4 MAJOR DIFFERENCE SBETWEEN THE KNOWN RING SY STEM S While the similarities betwee nthe ri ng systems are primarily those that provide a description of planetary ring systems in general, it is the dierences that give each ring system its own unique personality and appearance. It is also these individually unique personalities that provide the motivation for this book. Without that diversity, a treatise on planetary ring systems might require little more than a 15-page illustrated magazine article. In this introductory chapter, only a few of the major dierences between the ring systems are discussed. In later chapters the individual ring systems will be discussed i ndetail. Composition dierences between the ring systems are substantial. Jupiter's ring system is primarily rocky (silicate) material, tiny fragments of several of the small inner moons of Jupiter. The Jupiter ring system appears to be almost completely devoid of icy material, either water ice (H 2 O) or methane ice (CH 4 ). The Satur nri ng system, on the other hand, is dominated by water ice, although other constituents, especially rocky materials, are also relatively abundant. The composition of the Uranus and Neptune rings is inferred more on the basis of theoretical modeling than on actual spectral measurements. The Voyager 2 spacecraft, the sole planetary probe to visit these two distant giant planets, did not carry a mass spectrometer, and the narrow rings of Uranus and Neptune were dicult targets for the relatively broad ®eld of view of Voyager 2's infrared spectrometer. However, it is tempting to conclude, because of their darkened surfaces, that the ring particles in these two ring systems are either coated with carbo nor composed largely of carbo n. The theoretical source of such carbon is methane, which is more abundant in the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune than in either Jupiter's or Saturn's atmospheres. Methane ice may also be 1.4 Major dierences between the known ring systems 5 ] Sec. 1.4"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"abundant in the icy moons of Uranus and Neptune. Processes which might cause the methane gas or ice to separate into its constituent elementsÐcarbon and hydrogenÐ have also bee nproposed. (These processes will be discussed i na later chapter.) O nce the carbo na nd hydroge nare separated, the hydroge n, with its low mass, could more easily escape into interplanetary space, thereby leaving behind it an excess of free carbo nto darke nthe surfaces of the ri ng particles. The ring systems also dier markedly in their physical appearance. Jupiter's ring is con®ned relatively close to the planet. Because it is primarily composed of dispersed tiny dust particles, the Jupiter ring is almost transparent. In that respect, it is much like dust o na nautomobile wi ndshield, barely visible except whe nlooki ng through it toward the Sun. Jupiter's ``Main ring'' and its ``Gossamer ring'' (the nomenclature will be explained in Chapter 4) are ̄at and very near the plane of Jupiter's equator; the ``Halo'' is between the other rings and Jupiter itself, but is spread north and south of Jupiter's equator into an enormous donut shape. Saturn's ring system is the most extensive in a radial direction, reaching nearly to the orbit of its moon Titan, a distance nearly twenty times the radius of the planet. Most of Saturn's rings are thin and near the equator of the planet, but Saturn's outermost ring, its E ring, reaches a vertical thickness of thousands of kilometers in 6 The scienti®c signi®cance of planetary ring systems [Ch. 1 Figure 1.4. Voyager 2 captured this image of two of Neptune's narrow rings in 1989. The outer, or Adams, ring is seen to have several brighter ring arcs along a portion of its circumference. The overexposed crescent of Neptune is at the lower left. (PIA02207)"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"places. There are few empty gaps in Saturn's ring system, except where there are satellites that basically sweep up ring particles near their orbits. The rings of Uranus and Neptune, by contrast, are mainly very narrow structures with little i nthe way of ri ng matter (other tha nti ny dust particles) betwee nthem. The innermost ring of Uranus is broad, without distinct edges, and dicult to see in Voyager or Earth-based images. Recent advances in instrumentation and image processing have now permitted the viewing of all of the Uranus rings by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Telescope equipped with adaptive optics, including two new rings exterior to those imaged by Voyager 2, but still interior to the orbit of Miranda. Most of Uranus's rings are non-circular, and they are generally somewhat wider at the most distant parts of their orbits than at the closer distances. This is especially noticeable in the outermost of the rings observed by Voyager 2 (the Epsilon ring). The outermost (Adams) ring of Neptune (see Figure 1.4) sports ®ve brighter ring arcs (Courage, Liberte Â , Egalite Â 1, Egalite Â 2, and Fraternite Â ), all con®ned within about 10% of the ring circumference. One faint ring seems to share the orbit of one of Neptune's satellites (Galatea) and is sometimes called the Galatea ring. Another, known as the Lassell ring, seems to span the approximately 4,000 km between the narrow Arago and Le Verrier rings. Still another, the Galle ring, has a narrow core but diuses outward and inward about 1,000 km, with no distinct outer or inner edge. As is apparent from the above, it is patently untrue that ``A ring is a ring is a ring!''Ðhence the need for a book like this one that provides a partial roadmap to the planetary ring systems of which we are presently aware. As new planetary ring systems are discovered and new characteristics of previously known planetary ring systems are disclosed, it will very likely be necessary to expand the contents of this book. In that sense, planetary ring systems are much like their larger cousins, the satellites circling the planets of our solar system: the closer we examine them, the more complex and varied they become. However, i nma ny ways it is that very complexity that may eventually provide the key to a relatively complete understanding of their origins, their present characteristics, and their eventual fates. 1.5 WHAT CAUSES RING SYSTEMS? Between 1610, when Galileo ®rst glimpsed Saturn's ring, and 1977, when the ring of Uranus was discovered, the solar system, for that matter the universe, contained only a single example of a planetary ring systemÐnamely, the ring of Saturn. Astronomers speculated on which of two mechanisms gave birth to that ring: (1) Was it the remnant material from Saturn's formative years that was prevented from coalescing into individual satellites? or (2) Was the ring material the debris from one or more former satellites that somehow wandered too close to Saturn and were torn apart by gravita- tional tides or were shattered by a collision with an interplanetary interloper? It is now abundantly clear that the ®rst of these choices is no longer tenable, primarily because ring scientists have come to understand that the present rings cannot have existed for more tha na small fractio nof the age of the solar system. 1.5 What causes ring systems? 7 ] Sec. 1.5"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Does that then once and for all answer the question about the origins of Saturn's rings and, by analogy, the origins of planetary ring systems in general? Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, depending on one's viewpoint), continued observations of planetary ring systems have suggested that a number of dierent mechanisms help to generate rings and de®ne their shape. As is often the case in scienti®c investigations, more detailed examination of ring characteristics and phenomena revealed a wholly unsuspected complexity and diversity associated with planetary rings and ring systems. Let's examine brie ̄y the second mechanism proposed by astronomers: that the rings of Saturn formed as one or more satellites wandered too close to Saturn. Most individuals are familiar with the concept of tides, especially Earth's tides, which are caused primarily by the gravitational pull of Earth's only natural satellite, the Moon. What may be less familiar is that the Earth also exerts tidal forces o nthe Moo n. The Moo nhas no liquid o nits surface, but the solid surface is deformed as a result of these tidal forces. The Moo nkeeps its same face toward the Earth, so the deformatio n results in a slightly non-circular equator for the Moon, whose equatorial diameter in the li ne of sight from Earth is more tha n600 meters larger tha nits equatorial diameter along its orbit. That equatorial deformation is only about 0.002% of the equatorial diameter. French mathematician E Â douard Albert Roche (1820±1883) recognized that, for a satellite which is closer than a distance which has become known as the ``Roche limit'', such tidal forces ca nbecome stro nger tha nthe forces which hold the satellite together. In such circumstances the satellite will be torn asunder. For an icy satellite circling Saturn, the Roche limit is at a distance from Saturn's center of about 2.4 times the radius of the planet. All of Saturn's main rings (D, C, B, A, and F) are within this distance, so it seems likely that they are primarily the product of tidal breakup of former moons of Saturn. The approximate distance (from the center of the respective planet) of the Roche limit for Earth and the four giant planets is given in Table 1.1. The equatorial radius of each planet is also shown. The main rings of Saturn and Uranus and all the rings of Jupiter and Neptune are within their respective Roche limits. Earth's Moo nis at a mea ndista nce from Earth's ce nter of 384,400 km, more tha ntwe nty times Earth's Roche limit. 8 The scienti®c signi®cance of planetary ring systems [Ch. 1 Table 1.1.

They are therefore u nlikely to have bee nformed by the breakup of natural satellites or gravitationally captured asteroids. The origin of the G ring remains unexplained, but the origin of the E ring has been attributed to icy eruptions from Saturn's satellite Enceladus. More will be said about that in Chapter 10, which covers early ®ndings on the ring system from the Cassini Orbiter. Once a large quantity of ring particles has been created, mutual collisions between the particles cause them to spread i nall directio ns from the poi nt of breakup. Polar ̄attening of the planet and the gravitational in ̄uence of satellites, nearly all of which orbit the planet near its equatorial plane, tend to ̄atten the distribution of the ring particles over time. Given enough time, the azimuthal distribution of ring particles becomes almost uniform unless the gravitational interactions with nearby satellites prevent such a uniform distribution. Radial spreading is also relatively ecient, but such spreading is inhibited or modi®ed by two mechanisms. Those particles that spread inward toward the planet may eventually fall into the atmosphere of the planet and are lost from the ring system. Both outward and inward movement of particles can also be inhibited by the gravitational in ̄uence of nearby satellites. These two eects will be discussed i nmore detail i nlater chapters. Jupiter's Main and Gossamer rings are unlikely to be the result of either satellite breakup or eruptions from satellite surfaces. In some ways, Jupiter's enormous gravity acts like a magnet for large numbers of meteoroids in the solar system. These meteoroids occasionally strike the surfaces of small satellites and launch surface dust and debris into orbit around Jupiter. The Gossamer ring actually has characteristics that enable scientists to determine relatively unambiguously the source satellite for the ring material. More will be said about this in Chapters 4 and 6. Jupiter's Halo ring and tiny particles that form radial spokes in Saturn's B ring are aected by still another mechanism. If the particles are tiny enough and can also become electrically charged, either by the action of sunlight or by other mechanisms, such particles can be de ̄ected from normal near-equatorial orbits around Jupiter or Saturn by the respective planet's magnetic ®eld, which tends to drag them along at the angular speed of rotation of the planet itself. For Jupiter's Halo ring, the result is a donut-shaped torus of ring particles interior to Jupiter's main ring. For Saturn's B- ring spokes, the result is ghostly structures that seem to defy the laws of orbital mechanics. It is likely that a variety of other mechanisms create and shape planetary rings, and it is partially the pursuit of ring studies to discover and explain these eects and to use them as predictors of ring system evolution. 1.6 WHAT RING STELL U SABOUT THE PLANET THEY CIRCLE Knowledge of some characteristics of the central planet can be gleaned from or en- hanced by careful measurements of planetary ring systems. Such gleaning or knowl- edge enhancement requires a clear understanding of the precise nature of the interactions between the planet and its ring system. Furthermore, there must exist 1.6 What rings tell us about the planet they circle 9 ] Sec. 1.6"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"a means of determining the relevant ring system characteristics with sucient preci- sion to enable the extraction of the desired central planet information. Let's look at a couple of examples. Early ring observers, including Christiaan Huygens (1629±1695), who correctly deduced on the basis of long-term observations that the Saturn ring circled the planet, nowhere touching it, incorrectly assumed ®rst that the ring was a solid disk of material and then later that there were a number of solid concentric rings. Both theoretical considerations (by James Clerk Maxwell in 1859) [1] and observational data (by James Keeler in 1895) [2] eventually convinced scientists that the rings must consist of an innumerable array of discrete ring particles, which, like the tiny satellites they were, orbited according to the laws of motion described by Johannes Kepler (1571±1630). According to those laws, independent bodies orbiting closer to the planet complete an orbit of the planet in less time than those further from the planet. In addition, close orbiters must also move at higher velocities than their more distant siblings. The rate of motion is more or less independent of the size and mass of the individual rings particles, but, as implied above, the rate is highly dependent on the radial distance of each particle from the center of the planet. Additionally, that speed is dependent on the mass of the planet whose gravity holds the ring particles in their orbits. Theo- retically, then, it should be possible to deduce the mass of the planet from measure- ments of the distance and orbital periods of a large number of ring particles. I npractice, however, it is very dicult to measure the orbital periods of i ndividual ring particles, primarily because of their small size and the impracticality of uniquely identifying individual ring particles at all, let alone uniquely re-identifying the same particles on later circuits of the planet. Mass determination for the central planet is far more easily determined from the orbital motions of the larger natural satellites, or, still better, from radio tracking of properly equipped robotic spacecraft during swingbys or orbits of the respective planet. Although ring observations contribute little toward improvement of the precision of mass determinations of the planet, they can, under certain circumstances, help us to better understand the distribution of mass within the central planet. At the same time, they can help de®ne the planet's equatorial plane. The orbit of a ring that is eccentric (non-circular) will slowly precess (turn) at a rate that depends directly on the degree of ̄attening (oblateness) of the planet. Hence, a measurement of the precession rate of an eccentric ring orbit can lead to a determination of the planet's oblateness. Note, however, that the oblateness determined in this manner is not necessarily the same as the amount of ̄attening seen in images of the planet (i.e., the optical oblateness), but instead represents the degree to which mass has been shifted from the polar regions of the planet toward its equator. That quantity is known as the planet's dynamic oblateness and is generally designated as J 2 . A planet without polar ̄attening would have J 2  0. With a J 2 of 0.0163, Satur nis the most oblate pla net i nthe solar system. The dynamic oblateness of Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune are 0.0147, 0.0035, and 0.0034, respectively [3]. All four known planetary ring systems lie close to the equatorial planes of their respective planets, the largest departures of ring planes from planetary equatorial planes being less than a tenth of a degreeÐthat is, less than 1/900th of a right angle. In 10 The scienti®c signi®cance of planetary ring systems [Ch. 1"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"that respect, rings provide a reasonably accurate visual marker for the planet's equator. But if the orientation of an inclined ring orbit can be tracked through a large part of a 360 \u000e precession, the actual orientation of the plane of the equator can often be determined to a small fraction of the ring's inclinationÐthat is, to less than a hundredth of a degree. Tiny dust particles in the rings also interact with the planetary magnetic ®eld. Two speci®c examples of such interactions are radial spokes in Saturn's B ring and Jupiter's Halo ring. The B-ring spokes rotate, at least for a time, at the same rate as Saturn's magnetic ®eld and therefore provide corroborating information on the rotation rate of Saturn's interior. The Halo ring has inner and outer boundaries near what are called Lorentz resonances, where electrically charged dust particles orbit Jupiter in periods that are rational multiples (like 3 : 2) of the rotational period of Jupiter's magnetic ®eld (and the interior of the planet). At the radial distances of these resonances, the ring particles experience strong forces tending to remove them from the ring altogether, thus creating relatively sharp edges to these dust rings [4]. Studies of these phenomena can help determine the rotation rate of the planet's magnetic ®eld or serve as a veri®cation of the rotation rate as determined from radio emissions. 1.7 WHAT RING STELL U SABOUT THE NEARBY MOON S Spiral bending waves (corrugations) and density waves (alternate crowding and separating of ring particles in a radial direction) are due to gravitational interactions with nearby satellites, especially in the rings of Saturn and Uranus (Figure 1.5). Sharp edges to ring boundaries or gaps within otherwise continuous rings are generally also indications of ring particle interactions with natural satellites. Still other eectsÐlike wakes along an otherwise sharp edge or condensations within a ring, or chaotic appearance at the outer or inner boundaries of a ringÐare due to interactions with planetary satellites. It is therefore natural, when such ring features are observed, to try to associate the features with known satellites. Occasionally such associations with known satellites are not possible, or the ring features are of such a nature that they are more likely to be associated with nearby, as yet unseen, satellites. In such circumstances, the ring features often lead to predictions about the precise location of a potential new satellite, and additional observations (or poring over existing images) can result in the dis- covery of the proposed satellite. The former procedure led to the discovery of a small satellite (Daphnis) orbiting within the Keeler gap near the outer edge of Saturn's A ring. The latter is exempli®ed by Pan, discovered nearly eight years after the Voyager swingbys of Saturn from Voyager images of the Encke gap in Saturn's A ring [5]. The nature and magnitude of the gravitational interactions between ring particles and the satellites responsible for the individual features can also lead to a rough estimate of the mass of the perturbing satellite. When these are combined with images of sucient resolution to permit size and shape estimates for the relevant satellite, rough density estimates are possible. Those density estimates can further lead to composition estimates, relatively easily distinguishing between solid rocky satellites 1.7 What rings tell us about the nearby moons 11 ] Sec. 1.7"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"(with densities greater than 2 grams per cubic cm, abbreviated g cm \u0005 3 ), solid icy satellites (densities between about 1 and 1.5 g cm \u0005 3 ), or loose ``rubble piles'' of icy material (densities signi®cantly less than 1 g cm \u0005 3 ). Finally, radial ring density variations and, to some extent, vertical ring structure, has led ring scientists to speculate that the source of nearby ring material is from a particular satellite. Saturn's expansive E ring was brightest (densest) near the orbit of Enceladus, and one of the goals of the Cassini Mission was to determine if evidence can be found to substantiate geologically active processes on Enceladus that might generate E-ring particles. Similarly, Jupiter's Gossamer ring has a vertical structure that has led scientists to speculate that it is being fed by particles being blasted (most likely by meteoroid bombardment) from the surfaces of Thebe and Amalthea, each of whose orbits is slightly inclined to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Gossamer ring particles thus generated seem to migrate only toward Jupiter's atmosphere and not outward. That behavior and possible explanations for it will also be discussed in later chapters. 12 The scienti®c signi®cance of planetary ring systems [Ch. 1 Figure 1.5.

It is in that sense that planetary ring systems serve as a natural laboratory for the studies of many-body interactions elsewhere in the universe. Some relationships of this nature have already been established. Some gaps in Saturn's rings are caused by the gravitational in ̄uence of the satellite Mimas; gaps in the asteroid belt are due to the gravitational in ̄uence of the planet Jupiter. While no such relationship has been established between the formation of spiral structure in galaxies and the spiral density waves and bending waves in planetary rings, there is reaso nto believe that there are similarities i nthe formative processes. The formatio n of a relatively ̄at Kuiper Belt beyond the orbit of Neptune and the ̄atness of the arms of a spiral galaxy are reminiscent of the ̄atness of planetary rings as well. Continued study of these and other phenomena may reveal a large variety of characteristics shared by planetary ring systems and their larger cousins. 1.9 OUTLINE OF THE REMAINDER OF THI SBOOK So join us in this journey of discovery and examination of planetary rings. We hope you will ®nd it as fascinating to contemplate as we have, and we trust that the journey's completion will have succeeded in acquainting you with the detailed nature of the planetary ring systems within our solar system. Following this introductory chapter, Chapter 2 will provide a detailed overview of the discovery and early ®ndings relative to Saturn's rings. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 will deal with the discoveries and early ®ndings on the rings of Uranus, Jupiter, and Neptune, respectively. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 will summarize all we presently know about the Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune ring systems, with possible alternative explanations for the observed features in those cases where there is not yet a unanimity of opinion among ring scientists. Our coverage of the Saturn ring system is extensive enough that we have chosen to split it into two chapters. Chapter 9 will summarize the state of our knowledge of the granddaddy of all ring systems prior to the arrival of the international Cassini Mission at Saturn in July 2004. Chapter 10 will be a progress report on what new things we have learned about the Saturn system from approximately 18 months of detailed observations and analysis of Cassini Orbiter data. The ®nal two chapters are attempts to provide a reader's digest of the data from the earlier chapters, doing a detailed comparison of the four known planetary ring systems (Chapter 11) and providing a possible roadmap to future observations and analysis, including extension of planetary ring system ®ndings to their larger counter- parts in the solar system and beyond (Chapter 12). Each chapter has extensive notes and references to help guide those of you who would like to refer to original research or have more detailed explanations of certain co ncepts tha nca neasily be provided i nthe chapter texts themselves. We have also included a bibliography at the end of each chapter to books or summary articles that have bee nco nsulted i nthe preparatio nof the chapters or that provide other authors' 14 The scienti®c signi®cance of planetary ring systems [Ch. 1"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"views on ring systems.

Astronomers no longer needed to scan the heavens with their eyes alone. The ``looking glass'' opened the solar system and indeed the universe to the scrutiny of humanity. The ®rst recorded use of the telescope for astronomical study was performed in 1610 by Galileo Galilei. Using just a 20-powered spyglass, Galileo discovered spots on the Sun, four satellites about Jupiter, and surface features on the Moon (see Figure 2.1). His curiosity also led him to turn his attention and his looking glass towards Saturn. In that same year, in the middle of July, Galileo was surprised to see that Saturn was not a single sphere. It appeared to be composed of three individual spheres [1] (see Figure 2.2). With this extraordinary discovery came an extraordinary problem. Galileo real- ized that some unscrupulous astronomers might try to take credit for his discovery. Some approach had to be take nto preserve his claim. To safeguard his discovery, he encrypted his results into an anagram and then asked others to come forward with their own observations and explanation [2, 3]. His anagram was as follows: Smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras. Johannes Kepler (1571±1630), who had been following Galileo's telescopic discoveries with great interest, believed that Galileo's anagram had to do with companions around Mars [4]. Kepler believed that the solar system followed speci®c laws based on simple mathematical relationships. Since Earth had one moon and Jupiter had four, Kepler ®rmly believed that Mars should have two. Applied further out into the solar system, this simple arithmetic relationship would predict that Saturn should be surrounded by eight moons. Kepler's belief was really just a guess and nothing more. However, he was so convinced of the correctness of his belief that he tried"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"18 The discovery of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 2 Figure 2.1.

From Galileo's clue, Kepler was able to rearrange the letters in the anagram into the following phrase: Salue umbistineum geminatum Martia proles. The translation of this was ``Hail, twin companionship, children of Mars'' [5]. How- ever, i nNovember 1610, Galileo published the true solutio nto his a nagram: Altissimum planetam tergeminum obseruaui. This translation was, ``I have observed the highest planet to be triple-bodied'' [6]. Galileo believed that the other objects could not be large moons orbiting Saturn. His assertio nstemmed from the fact that Jupiter's four moo ns were solitary poi nts of light and could be observed to orbit about the planet. In contrast, Saturn's companions appeared much larger relative to the planet and appeared motionless. The static nature of the three bodies made Galileo lose interest in studying the planet. Consequently, his observations of Saturn became less and less frequent. Unbeknown to Galileo, the aspect of the rings was approaching an edge-on orienta- tion. With only an occasional observation of the planet, Galileo was surprised by what he saw in the fall of 1612. To his astonishment, the two companions had vanished. Galileo was mysti®ed and could not explain their disappearance. However, he was con®dent that they would return. As a matter of fact, he was so certain that he developed a detailed theory about how the bodies had disappeared and how they would return. In the summer of 1613, the companions did reappear, but not in the manner Galileo had predicted. Over the next three years, few observations of Saturn were made, possibly due to the very slow changes in the system's appearance. Most astronomers lost interest in Saturn and turned their attention to more stimulating astronomical questions. No one recorded the gradual changes of Saturn and its companions between 1613 and 1616. Whe nGalileo agai ntur ned his telescope toward Satur ni nSeptember 1616, he was again shocked by what he saw. The change in the shape of Saturn's companions prompted Galileo to write: ``two companions are no longer two small perfectly round globes ... but are at present much larger and no longer round ... [7] A drawing made by Galileo in 1616 showed a spherical planet that can be best described by the planet having ``cup handles'' (see Figure 2.3). To this day, because of this description, the edges of Saturn's rings are often referred to as ansae , the Latin word for handles. Unfortunately, the slowly changing shape of Saturn's companions were perceived more as a noddity tha nas a serious astro nomical problem worthy of scienti®c inquiry. During the next thirty years, Saturn's companions were frequently observed, but very little progress was made toward explaining them. Even the 2.1 First observations of Saturn's companions 19 ] Sec. 2.1"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"disappearance of Saturn's companions in 1626 and their reappearance the following year did little to excite the scienti®c community of the day. 2.2 A MODEL FOR THE RING EMERGES In 1642 astronomers began once again to take interest in the problem of Saturn's companions and their slowly changing shape. Notable astronomers like Pierre Gas- sendi (1592±1655), Francesco Fontana (1585±1656), Antonius Maria Schyrlaeus de Rheita (1597±1660) and Johannes Hevelius (1611±1687) all began to make systematic observations of the planet [8]. Although the accumulation of a greater number of observations was necessary for determining the true nature of Saturn and its com- panions, many of the observations seemed to contradict each other. Scienti®c progress using apparently con ̄icting data was dicult at best. Early i n1655 Christiaa nHuyge ns (1629±1695) bega nhis astro nomical observa- tions of Saturn. During that winter he applied the logic established by Rene Descartes (1596±1650) to his planetary observations. This logic allowed Huygens to make the following statements: Saturn was its own system, Saturn should rotate about its own axis, and material located between Saturn and its newly discovered moon Titan should rotate with a period less tha nthat of the moo n(estimated to be about 16 days). Because there were no visible changes in the shape of Saturn's companions in 16 days, the companions had to have a shape that was symmetric about the planet's spin axis [10]. I nother words, Satur nmust have a ri ng! Like his fellow astronomers, Huygens wrote his theory on the nature of Saturn's companions as an anagram in De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova [11] i nMarch 1656. Though this was written in 1656, most of the astronomical community did not become aware of his theory for another three years when it was published in Systema Saturnium (see Figure 2.4). Some members of the astronomical community adopted 20 The discovery of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 2 Figure 2.3.

Those who were skeptical had problems with Huygens' characterization of the ring. It was dicult for some to believe that the ring was solid, had an observable thickness (approximately 4,000 km), and was inclined to the planet's orbital plane. Even those who were proponents of Huygens' ring model thought the ring was not thick but very thin. Many of these astronomers believed that the ring was so thin that, when viewed edge-on, it would essentially disappear. However, some astronomers had diculty believing that Saturn's companions were really the two ansae of one large ring. Johannes Hevelius believed that the two crescents were attached to either side of the planet. Even though he was wrong about the companions, he was able to correctly explain the periodic nature of the planet and its companions. His drawing, made in 1656, contained 24 sketches of crescents about 2.2 A model for the ring emerges 21 ] Sec. 2.2 Figure 2.4.

Two years later, Christopher Wren (1632±1723) developed an alternative to rings and crescents. He claimed that Saturn had an elliptical corona attached to it. This corona was supposedly ̄uid-like and was emitted from the planet's equator. As the planet and its corona orbited the Sun, the corona would present dierent aspects as viewed from Earth. Wre nbelieved that the coro na would disappear whe nit was see n edge-on [9]. However, Wren's hypothesis still had the fundamental shortcoming that it could not explain how coronas (or any other shapes) could exist in the heavens. While aware of these competing hypotheses, Huygens was still convinced that his ring theory was correct, and he continued to re®ne it. His ®rst challenge was to somehow resolve the issue of the ring's inclination about the planet. From the beginning, Huygens had assumed that Saturn's ring was inclined to its orbital plane by 23.5 \u000e , just like Earth's equator was to its orbital plane (see Figure 2.6). The actual 22 The discovery of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 2 Figure 2.5.

It took several years, but in 1668 Huygens made an adjustment to the ring's inclination such that his ring model came reasonably close to predicting the edge-on disappearance of the ring. When the ri ng disappeared i n1671 as his revised theory predicted, oppositio nto his theory also disappeared and the reality of Saturn's ring became an accepted scienti®c fact. 2.3 THE NATURE OF THE RINGS The ring's thickness was not the only erroneous conclusion Huygens had made about the ring: Huygens had also proposed that the ring was a solid body [12]. First, astronomers had diculties explaining the stability and periodic motions of a solid spinning ring. Remember that astronomers of the day did not yet understand the law of gravitatio nor the laws of pla netary motio ns. Newto n's Principia Mathematica , which contained the ®rst formulation of the law of gravitation, would not be pub- lished until 1687. Astronomers came up with two alternate explanations for the nature of the rings, either of which might help to resolve their diculties with the solid-ring theory. The ring could be composed of a cloud of vapor, or it might be composed of a very large number of small satellites [13]. Scienti®c literature indicates that the ``large number of small satellites'' hypothesis was ®rst proposed by the French poet Jean Chapelain (1595±1674) i n1660 [14]. Give na choice betwee nthe vapor-cloud a nd the small- satellite models, most astronomers chose the small satellite model as their favorite. In 1664 Giuseppe Campani (1635±1715) made an etching of Saturn with an inter- esting dierence from those made by his predecessors and contemporaries. Campani's etching had a bright inner ring with a dimmer outer ring [15]. Twelve years later 2.3 The nature of the rings 23 ] Sec. 2.3 Figure 2.6. These drawings were made by Christiaan Huygens and published in 1659 in Systema Saturnium . Even though he made his ®nal change to the ring's inclination in 1668, he clearly understood the reasons for the changing appearance of Saturn's rings many years earlier."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625±1712), observing Saturn from the Paris Observa- tory, noticed that the outer dimmer ring and the brighter inner ring appeared to be separated by a gap or divisio n(see Figure 2.7). The idea left astro nomers i nthe awkward position of trying to understand how a planet could have two solid spinning rings. This diculty added to the popularity of the ``large number of very small satellites'' model. Observations continued for the remainder of the 17th Century and into the 18th Century. With each passing decade came better and better data from which to resolve the true nature of Saturn's ring. Many prominent astronomers, including William Herschel (1738±1822), continued for a time to cling to the concept of a solid ring encircling Saturn [16]. However, astronomers kept observing features that made it increasingly dicult to defend a solid ring model. For example, James Short (1710± 1768) believed that he had observed multiple gaps in Saturn's ring. It was not until Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749±1827) and his analysis of the ring that astronomers conceded that Saturn's ring could be composed of multiple divisions. Their ring model had many individual, solid, thin rings with spaces between each one [17]. The number of reported gaps and divisions continued to grow. The issue of assigning credit to the gaps in the rings was and still is quite convoluted. The number of gap observations, coupled with lack of precision for describing their position in the rings, has led to many dierences of opinion over who was the ®rst to observe a particular gap. Along with gaps, some light and dark features were also reported. In 1837 Johann Franz Encke (1791±1865) recorded a low contrast feature in the middle of the outer ring (see Figure 2.8). In that very same year Encke's assistant Johann Galle (1812±1910) reported that there appeared to be a ring interior to the already known bright inner ring. This proposed inner-most ring was detected by the shadow 24 The discovery of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 2 Figure 2.7. In 1676 Cassini made this drawing of Saturn with a ring that appears to be divided into an inner and an outer ring."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"that it cast on the atmosphere of Saturn. To standardize a naming scheme and to clarify which portion of the ring astronomers were referring, the outer ring became known as the A ring, the brighter middle ring was called the B ring, while the ring closest to the planet was named the C or Crepe ring. As telescopes improved, better and better measurements of the radial width of the rings were made. Data from dierent telescopes made at dierent times showed that the width of the rings had varied over time. This made it increasingly dicult to hold on to the belief that the rings were solid. By the middle of the nineteenth century Laplace's model for multiple solid rings was appearing less likely. In 1850, George P. Bond (1825±1865) evaluated Laplace's work and realized that thin solid rings would be unstable [19]. In addition, observations of the translucent C ring lent support to a non-solid ring model. All of these disjointed facts made under- standing the true nature of Saturn's ring a major astronomical problem. In hopes of obtaining an answer to this dilemma, the University of Cambridge in 1855 made this problem the subject of the Adams Prize Essay [20]. I n1857 the prize was wo nby James Clerk Maxwell (1831±1879), who successfully explained all the observations by assuming the ring was composed of an in®nite number of small particles. The last remaining unexplained observations to be incorporated into a Saturn ring model were the many gaps found in the rings. To be successful, a modi®cation to the ring model had to describe the mechanism by which the Cassini Division, the Encke gap, and the numerous other dark ring features were produced (see Figure 2.9). An explanation for the existence of ring gaps was ®nally formulated in 1866 by Daniel Kirkwood (1814±1895) with his proposal of ring resonances. Ring resonances occur when the orbital period of one of Saturn's moons is in some integer multiple of the orbital period for a particular region of the ring. In this case, Kirkwood noticed that a particle i nthe Cassi ni Divisio nwould orbit exactly three times for every orbit of 2.3 The nature of the rings 25 ] Sec. 2.3 Figure 2.8.

At the time, the idea of resonances was still in doubt until Kirkwood was able to use it to successfully explain the structure of Saturn's rings and the gaps in the asteroid belt. Today the gaps i nthe asteroid belt are k now nas Kirkwood gaps i nhis honor. From the late 1800s to the middle of the 1900s astronomers continued to re®ne the accepted model of Saturn's ring. The planet had three rings (A, B, and C), each composed of ring particles, and the spatial density (i.e., the number of particles in a volume of one cubic meter) of ring particles in each was responsible for its observed brightness (i.e., the amount of light re ̄ected back towards the Earth). With the advent of photographic plates and larger telescopes, details in Saturn's rings became more and more apparent. These new details led some astronomers to believe that there might be a ring even fainter than the C ring between the inner edge of the C ring and the top of Saturn's atmosphere. Although the existence of such a ring was never veri®ed from ground- based observations, the letter was ``reserved'' for such a ring. The D ring since observed by NASA spacecraft could not have been detected from ground-based telescopes. The last major ground-based ring discovery was made in 1967 by Walter A. Feibelman (1925±2004). Feibelman was working as an assistant research professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh. While studying Saturn images taken by the university's Allegheny Observatory, Feibelman thought he saw material in orbit outside of the planet's main ring. Combining his observations with mathe- 26 The discovery of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 2 g( Figure 2.9.

If true, this would be Saturn's E ring. Unfortunately, other ground- based data would not be able to support his claim. Con®rmation would require a close-up visit by a robotic ambassador from Earth. 2.4 ENCOUNTER SWITH THE RING S The birth of the space age i n1957 had a profou nd impact o nthe study of pla netary rings. For the ®rst time, rings could be observed from the vicinity of the ring system itself. This includes views from behind the planet as seen from the Sun. The advantage of this is that ring particle size can be determined by how light from the Sun is scattered by them. Large particles re ̄ect light back towards the Su n(i.e., the light is back-scattered), while small particles are more visible whe nviewed from the directio n opposite that of the Su n(i.e., the light is forward-scattered). Forward-scatteri ng is particularly noticeable when driving a car with a dusty windshield toward a rising or setting sun. Thus rings composed of small ring particles, as seen from behind, appear bright (see Figure 2.10). The ®rst spacecraft to visit the Saturnian system was Pioneer 11. Pioneer 11, which was renamed Pioneer Saturn in honor of its historic encounter with the planet, reached its closest approach to the planet on September 1, 1979. Unfortunately for the remote sensing community, Pioneer Saturn was designed primarily as a ®elds-and- particles spacecraft. The consequence of this was that the spacecraft was spin-stabil- ized rather than ®xed in its orientation in space. Consequently, a framing camera was not included as one of the instruments in Pioneer Saturn's science payload. The visible-light-collecting device that was included was the imaging photopolarimeter (IPP) (i.e., a scanning radiometer) and was not suited for high-resolution imaging. 2.4 Encounters with the rings 27 ] Sec. 2.4 (a) (b) Figure 2.10.

The F ring was seen as a narrow ring just outside of the A ring (see Figure 2.11). The IPP was only able to detect the densest portion of the F ring, but the data indicated that it had a double-ring structure [23]. Pioneer Saturn also con®rmed the existence of Saturn's E ring. Outside of the main ring system, Pioneer Saturn also observed a very thin ring, now known as the G ring [24]. Alone, the IPP data were not that conclusive, but combined with the spacecraft's asteroid±meteoroid detector sensor, positive identi- ®cation of the structure was con®rmed. The ®rst images of the G ring would have to wait for another spacecraft that would have far superior instruments to the ones onboard Pioneer. As is the case in robotic planetary exploration, Pioneer Saturn was the prelude to the Voyager 1 and 2 encounters with the ringed planet. The two Voyager spacecraft launched four years after Pioneer Saturn had a much more capable instrument suite and were designed for remote sensing observations. Together the Voyager spacecraft discovered many new characteristics of Saturn's ring system. Among them, Voyager discovered Saturn's real D ring inside the C ring. The D ring extends from the inner edge of the C ring about half-way to the top of the planet's atmosphere [25] (see Figure 2.12). Voyager's sensitive imaging system was also able to discern Saturn's G ring. Though the ®rst indication of this ring came from Pioneer Saturn, the ®rst images of the G ring came from Voyager [26]. The Voyager 1 spacecraft also discovered ``braiding'' in the F ring (see Figure 2.13). This unique tangled structure was thought to be produced from gravitational interactions between the F ring and two ``shepherd- ing'' satellites, Prometheus and Pandora [27]. 28 The discovery of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 2 Figure 2.11.

This may imply that tiny particles in the radial spokes are electrically charged. By the end of Voyager 2's Post-Encounter phase at Saturn, the planet's ring system was more or less completely de®ned (see Figure 2.15). The number of rings, their relative optical and physical thicknesses, composition, and radial structure were now known. However, there was a growing list of unanswered questions arising from Voyager data that needed to be answered. These answers would require more time, better ring models and the visit to Saturn by a long-duration orbiter. 30 The discovery of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 2 Figure 2.14.

This was no ordinary ̄ight and no ordinary plane. The ̄ight was scheduled to leave Perth International Airport and head southwest over the south Paci®c Ocean. The goal was to deliver a 0.9-m infrared telescope to an altitude of 12,500 m. At that height the telescope would be above most of the infrared-blocking atmospheric water vapor. The missio nobjective was to observe the ®rst every predicted occultatio nof a star by the planet Uranus [1]. The plane was a C-141 and was NASA's Gerard P. Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) (see Figure 3.1). This plane was speci®cally designed for airborne astronomical observing runs. However, this observing run was unique. This was the ®rst time people knew in advance that Uranus was going to pass in front of a star (SAO 158687), and astronomers would be able to take advantage of it. This star was also a good target, since it was a 9th-magnitude star slightly redder than our Sun, and at infrared wavelengths it would appear as bright as Uranus [2]. If all went as planned, astron- omers would be able to make detailed temperature measurements of the planet's upper atmosphere and a precise measurement of its diameter. There was just one catch. Even if the instrumentation worked perfectly and the atmosphere cooperated, there was still a 17% chance that during the occultation the KAO would be just north of the occultation's northern edge [3]. This made Jim Elliot, the lead astronomer for this observing run, very nervous. It's a very time-consuming, expensive, and dicult endeavor to plan for and execute an observation campaign using an observatory, especially a small one with wings. A science team had to be assembled with missio ndirectors, telescope operators, i ndividuals to ru nthe record- ing equipment, meteorologists to monitor the atmospheric conditions, and of course the pilots. It didn't help that before he left for Australia, one of his colleagues said"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"something that would echo in his ears for the duration of the ̄ight. Joe Veverka, a fellow astronomer at Cornell University said, ``that a near miss would place an upper limit o na possible Ura nia nri ng system'' [4]. The discovery of a ring system around Uranus would be a triumph for observa- tional astronomy, but every grade school pupil knew that Saturn was the only planet in the solar system with rings. Nonetheless, the fact that they could miss the occulta- tion altogether was a frightening thought. It didn't help that a near miss could be used to limit the extent of a hypothetical Uranian ring. After all, Uranus didn't have rings. It became an inside joke for all those on the ̄ight that they were using this occultation event to probe Uranus for rings. Regardless of the slight possibility of failure, plans were made to perform a coordinated observation with another team. Jim Elliot joined forces with Robert L. Millis, observing from the Perth Observatory in western Australia, to guard against weather problems and equipment errors. A second independent observation of the same event could also be used to corroborate data obtained during their ̄ight. This approach had worked well before, when these two teams performed joint observations of a noccultatio nby Mars i n1976 [5]. The KAO took o from Perth at 10 : 37 p.m. About ®ve and a half hours later the science team began setting the equipment up for the event. First, they centered the telescope o nthe target. About 40 mi nutes prior to the start of the occultatio nthe recorders were turned on and set for continuous data collection. As the time for the occultatio napproached, the team watched the photometer's sig nal levels. The nTed Dunham, Jim Elliot's graduate student who was operating the data-gathering equip- 36 The discovery of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 3 Figure 3.1. The Kuiper Airborne Observatory in ̄ight.

The team's ®rst reaction was that the plane had passed through a faint wisp of a cloud that had absorbed the very photons they were trying to measure. But independent measurements indicated that water vapor levels were very low. Then a second dip occurred. At that point Jim Elliot said, ``Well maybe this is a D ring. The D ring of Uranus!'' [6]. With that everyone laughed. But clearly the team had seen something, and no one was sure what it was. Then the occultation began. Though this was the event that they had prepared for, the team couldn't help think about the dips prior to the occultation. Would brief dropouts be seen again when the star reappeared from behind Uranus? If they were, had they observed rings, a string of satellites orbiting the planet, or something else? They just had to wait for the star to emerge from behind the planet. When the star reappeared so did the dips in the star's intensity. Something was clearly blocking the starlight, but whatever it was it sure wasn't rings like those seen on the only other known ringed planet. Saturn's rings were very broad, while these events indicated something very narrow. The team knew they had discovered something; they just had to ®gure out what it was. At this point Jim Elliot began to compose a note to alert the astronomical community about their discovery (see Figure 3.2). Astronomers around the world had to be noti®ed about these unexpected events. Anyone observing this occultatio nwould otherwise tur no their recorders a few mi nutes after the star emerged from behind the planet. There would be no reason to keep recording unless there was a need to con®rm the data dropouts found by the KAO team. Meanwhile, back on the ground, Robert Millis's team also saw the brightness variations in their occultation data. And they too wondered if the dropouts were caused by clouds, equipment problems, or rings. Unfortunately, their Perth Obser- vatory was further east than the KAO ̄ight path and was only able to record the occultation ingress. Without seeing similar dropouts after occultation egress, the team's interpretation of the intensity variations would naturally tend toward equip- ment problems, clouds, or highly unlikely occultations by new satellites circling Uranus. In total, there were ®ve other observatories recording the event: Tokyo, Japan; Peking, China; Naini Tal and Kavalur, India; and Cape Town, South Africa. How- ever, with the exceptio nof the Cape Tow nObservatory, their latitudes were much farther north than either the KAO ̄ight path or the Perth Observatory. None of the observatories other tha nthe KAO saw the occultatio nby the pla net. While the Perth and Peking Observatories saw starlight dropouts on both sides, they observed only a few (three to ®ve) of the dropouts before Uranus dipped beneath their western horizons. Cape Town Observatory recorded the last of the outbound dropouts, but the inbound and planetary portions of the occultation occurred before Uranus was high enough in the east. Only the KAO recovered the complete occultation data set. On returning to their hotel in Perth, the KAO team unrolled the recorded data and examined the data dropouts. Rings were brie ̄y considered, but because these data dropouts were so unlike anything expected from rings as they knew them, that possibility was discarded. Whatever caused the dropouts was simply too thi nto be rings. With all the activity the night before and the lack of sleep, the tired team 3.1 First observations of Uranus's ring 37 ] Sec. 3.1"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"considered other possible scenarios, things like an asteroid belt or a belt of satellites around Uranus. But Jim Elliot wasn't convinced. He and his team returned to the United States on March 13, 1977, still questioning the nature of the data dropouts. He ®nally convinced himself that the planet did have rings the following night when he agai nspread out the data o nhis livi ng room ̄oor. There i nplai nsight were ®ve secondary occultations on either side of the primary Uranus occultation. Elliot and his team published their results in the science magazine Nature [7]. I nit the team named the rings after the Greek alphabet. The innermost ring was named Alpha, followed by Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon rings. The Epsilon ring by far was the widest of the rings, but they all were very narrow. However, data from Millis and his team could not con®rm all of the same events. The Millis team saw six statistically signi®cant brightness variations, but only three corresponded to those see nby Elliot's team. Whe nthe two data sets were compared, Millis's ri ngs 1, 2, a nd 3 corresponded with Elliot's Epsilon, Gamma, and Beta rings. However, rings 4, 5, and 38 The discovery of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 3 Figure 3.2. Discovery telegram written by James L. Elliott notifying the International Astro- nomical Union (IAU) of the discovery of small objects in orbit about Uranus."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"6 did not correspond to any of the rings reported by Elliot's team. Upon re-exam- ination of their data, Elliot's team found the additional rings reported by Millis's team, along with another ring between the Beta and Gamma rings. This ring they called the Eta ring. Eventually the two dierent nomenclature schemes were combined to produce the naming scheme we have today. 3.2 OBSERVATIONS PRIOR TO VOYAGER'S URANUS ENCOUNTER The ®rst ground-based images of Uranus's rings, following their discovery, were obtained by Matthews, Neugebauer, and Nicholson at the Palomar Observatory in May 1978 [8]. These images were not able to actually resolve the rings, but they were able to detect them. The technique was to take two images of the planet at dierent infrared wavelengths. One was taken at 2.2 micrometers, which made the planet appear slightly darker than the rings, and the other at 1.6 micrometers, which made the planet appear much brighter. By subtracting the 1.6-micrometer image from the 2.2-micrometer image, the image show ni nFigure 3.3 was produced with the planet virtually removed [9]. Though this technique was able to detect the rings, it clearly was unsatisfactory for determining any of their physical properties. The darkness of the ring material combined with the very low light levels to make Uranus ring images very dicult to obtain. However, this diculty did little to stop many observers from trying. One of the more successful observations was done by Rich Terrile and Brad Smith at the 2.5-m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Their ap- proach was to observe the planet in 11 dierent wavelengths from 0.435 to 1.000 micrometer. The multiple wavelength approach was designed to reveal planetary atmospheric features. However, at 0.89 micrometers atmospheric methane absorbs sunlight making the planet appear very dark. Observations taken at this wavelength can be processed to reveal the planet's rings, as seen in Figure 3.4. As was obvious from the stellar occultation observations, the Uranian ring system was dominated by the much more pronounced Epsilon ring than by any of the others. Computer processing gave the image a 3-D feel that has the Epsilon ring appear as a ``step'' surrounding the planet. Notice that the ®ve major satellites of Uranus can also be seen in the image. Direct imaging was not the only technique for understanding the structure of the Uranian rings. Stellar ring occultations, like those that led to their discovery, can also be used. However, this timeÐrather than discovering rings by accidentÐone can optimize the observation to product better ring results. And indeed this was the case. More than 15 stellar occultations were performed between the rings' discovery in 1977 and the Voyager 2 encounter in 1986. These observations were able to provide better information on the rings' size, eccentricity, inclination, width, and optical thickness. Results of these occultation observations may be found in many books, journals and papers (Elliot [10]; Elliot and Nicholson [11]; French, Elliot, and Levine [12]; and French et al. [13]). Our understanding of Uranus's nine rings continues to improve. The rings, as stated previously, were very dierent from those around Saturn. Saturn's rings were 3.2 Observations prior to Voyager's Uranus encounter 39 ] Sec. 3.2"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"40 The discovery of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 3  Figure 3.4.

[8])"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"very wide, whereas Uranus's rings were extremely narrow. In 1979 Goldreich and Tremaine proposed an explanation for the narrowness of the Uranian rings [14]. Their theory suggested that a ring would stay narrow if satellites straddled either side of it. These ``shepherding satellites'' would force a ring to keep a narrow shape rather than follow their natural tendency to disperse. A vivid con®rmation of their theory seemingly came from analysis of Voyager Saturn ring data. Researchers found two satellites, Prometheus and Pandora, on either side of Saturn's F ring (see Figure 2.13). The F ring's braided behavior seemed to illustrate this tension between the ring's natural tendency to disperse and the satellites' gravitational interactions to keep it narrow. 3.3 VOYAGER 2' SENCOUNTER WITH URANU S' SRING S The Voyager 2 Uranus encounter began on November 4, 1985, after a very long journey from Saturn. No one was sure if Voyager would survive this trek, because the craft's design was optimized for encounters with only Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus was well over a billion kilometers and another four and a half years away. In addition, the spacecraft was showing signs of age. The scan platform for pointing the science instruments had a failing azimuth actuator; one of the spacecraft's receivers was dead and the other was ``tone deaf''; and the infrared interferometer spectrometer and radiometer (IRIS) and the photopolarimeter (PPS) instruments were showing signs of age, both partially disabled and losing sensitivity. There were also a number of other smaller problems that limited the performance of the spacecraft. For the Uranus encounter, Voyager science was divided between atmosphere, magnetosphere, ring, and satellite objectives. From ground-based ring observations, scientist knew that it would be particularly dicult to obtain useful ring observations, especially on the inbound leg. These observations were dicult because the rings were narrow and had a very low re ̄ectivity that was only compounded by the extremely low light levels. With all of these challenges and spacecraft problems, JPL engineers had done a phenomenal job nursing the craft to Uranus. This eort paid o with an historic Uranus encounter, and by the end of November 1985 scientists were rewarded with the ®rst detectio nof the Epsilo nri ng. This detectio noccurred with Voyager still 72,300,000 km away from its planetary closest approach [15]. About one day away from its planetary rendezvous, Voyager 2 discovered a new ring between the Delta and the Epsilon rings. This ring was given a provisional name of 1986U1R. This naming convention designated the year of discovery, the planetary body, and that it was the ®rst ring found in that year. However there was more in store for the scientists than just one new ring. About one hour away from closest approach, Voyager 2 performed another set of ring observations. Although badly smeared from the relatively high velocities, one of these frames discovered a second new ring (1986U2R). This ring was dierent from the other Uranian rings. It was 2,500 km wide and located planetward of the 6 ring. Approximately ®fteen minutes later Voyager passed the equatorial plane of the planet. This was followed a few minutes 3.3 Voyager 2's encounter with Uranus's rings 41 ] Sec. 3.3"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"later by an observation that caught the nine original thin rings against the brighter atmosphere of the planet (Figure 3.5). As previously stated, imaging the rings was very dicult. The rings were just too narrow and dark to obtain much information. A more eective approach was to apply the same technique that was used to discover them nine years earlier. Both the PPS and the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) performed stellar ring occultations. These meas- urements were designed to watch a bright star as the planet's rings passed between it and the spacecraft. The ®rst stellar ring occultation was of sigma Sagittarii, but the observing geom- etry was less than ideal. The apparent motion of the star through the ring system just grazed the outer portion of the rings. However, it was able to obtain optical thickness information on the Epsilon, 1986U1R, and the Delta rings. This occultation provided a radial ring resolution of about 10 m [16]. The other stellar ring occultation was accomplished using the star beta Persei. This occultation was a radial cut which crossed all of the known rings, but with a degraded radial resolutio nof 100 m [17]. Nature appears to have a se nse of humor by providing either a good geometry or a good resolution, but not both. A perpendicular pass through the rings results in a relatively shorter time in each ring. The shorter duration produces a lower ring resolution. Fortunately, scientists did not have to make the dicult choice between the two. Mission planners were limited to the viewing geometry provided by the trajectory through the system and by the avail- ability of bright and stable stars. Scientists had no real other choice than to accept the most favorable stars that Nature provided. Voyager had another approach for obtaining ring information. Rather than using a star as the light source, the spacecraft could transmit its own carrier radio frequency through the rings. Data collected by the Deep Space Network antennas could then be interpreted to provide an understanding of the ring structure and its average particle 42 The discovery of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 3 Figure 3.5.

The longer radio wavelengths, when compared with the ultraviolet wavelengths received by the other two instruments, provided another measure of the ring particle size. The radio science subsystem (RSS) ring occultation experiment was able to detect all of the nine previous rings but was unable to see either of the new ones. This placed a limit on the ring particle sizes in these new rings. If the particles were smaller than the RSS wavelengths, then the radio signals would pass through them undiminished in intensity and unaltered in their coherent structure. There was also the matter of the thin rings and the mechanism for keeping them narrow. As stated previously, the leading theory was that each ring should have small moons on either side of them to maintain their shape. Voyager 2 did discover ten new satellites of Uranus, but only two were close enough to a ring to be considered shepherding satellites. The new shepherding satellites were eventually named Cordelia and Ophelia and were found on either side of the Epsilon ring. Unfortunately, no other satellites were found close enough to the other rings to explain their narrow widths. This could mean that shepherding satellites around the other rings were just too small to be detected or that some other mechanism was keeping them narrow. On the outbound leg of the Voyager encounter more than 200 high-phase angle ring images were taken to determine the ring's forward-scattering properties. Virtually all of these images were completely black because the rings contained less dust than predicted. However, one imaging frame, the one used to protect the imaging campaign against extreme ring conditions, had both a long enough exposure (96 s) and was taken at a high enough phase angle (172.5 \u000e ) to provide the most revealing view of the rings (Figure 3.6). This frame, the only one of its kind, shows a dramatic ring structure, and 3.3 Voyager 2's encounter with Uranus's rings 43 ] Sec. 3.3 Figure 3.6.

Unfortunately, since no Uranus mission is currently being planned, this event is at least many decades away. 3.4 POST-VOYAGER OBSERVATIONS OF URANUS'S RINGS Voyager 2's encounter with Uranus was a spectacular success, but it didn't discover all of the planet's secrets. In August 2004 the Hubble Space Telescope, with its Advanced Camera for Surveys instrument, discovered two new moons and two new rings around Uranus (Figure 3.7). The orbits of the two new rings are extremely far from the planet. The more distant of the two rings (2003U1R) is almost twice the radial distance of the Epsilon ring, the most distant of the previously known rings. The inner of the two new rings (2003U2R) has a radius of 67,300 km and is bounded by the satellite Portia on the inside and Rosalind on the outside [18]. The new outer ring has a radius of 97,700 km and has the newly discovered satellite Mab, orbiting near its center [19] (see Figure 3.8). O nDecember 22, 2005, Imke De Pater, Heidi B. Hammel, a nd Sera nGibbard released an image of these two newly discovered rings. The team acquired it on the Near I nfrared Camera (NIRC2) mou nted o nthe 10-m Keck II Telescope o nMau na Kea, Hawaii (Figure 3.9). The team had to combine 30 (2-min exposure) images, equivalent to a single one-hour exposure, to make the rings visible [20]. Notice that in this infrared observation the outer of the two new rings could not be seen. Because it was observed at visible wavelengths by the Hubble Space Telescope but not in the infrared, the data suggest that there is a color dierence between the two rings. The ring particles of the outer ring, invisible at infrared wavelengths, must be bluer and therefore composed of smaller particles than those of the inner ring. This conclusion suggests dierent origins for the two rings and could be explained by a hypothesis put forth by M. R. Showalter and J. J. Lissauer [21]. Their hypothesis states that small-to-modest-sized ring particles collide with each other producing smaller particles tha nthe pare nt particles, but still relatively large. This debris pro- duces a ring that appears slightly red and would have a dusty characteristic. Examples of other dusty rings are Jupiter's rings and Saturn's G ring. The outer ring, which is devoid of these relatively larger particles, is created by a completely dierent mech- anism. In this case, Uranus's new outer ring could be produced by meteoroid impacts with Mab, presumed to be a body largely composed of water ice. The collisions eject icy particles from the satellite's surface to produce a ring that would appear bluer than the relatively larger particle sized inner ring. An example of this type of ring, one that is composed of ®ne particles, is Saturn's E ring. If it weren't for the planet's axial tilt, the very faint nature of the rings and the fact that there are no planned future missions to Uranus would mean that very little new information would be gained about these rings in the near future. Fortunately, Uranus is approaching its equinox and its rings will appear edge-on as seen from Earth. This orientation will occur in 2007 and is our best hope for learning more about Uranus's rings. 3.4 Post-Voyager observations of Uranus's rings 45 ] Sec. 3.4"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"3.5 NOTE SAND REFERENCE S [1] Elliot, J., Kerr, R., 1984, RingsÐDiscoveries from Galileo to Voyager , The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, p. 1.

Even models used to predict long-term stability of planetary rings indicated that the Jovian system could not maintain one [1]. Nonetheless, Tobias Owen, a co-investigator on the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) Team, thought that a planet the size of Jupiter must have debris around it [2]. He postulated that Jupiter might have material about it in the equivalent region of Saturn's B ring. Although most investigators thought that Jupiter did not have such material, Brad Smith, the ISS Principal Investigator, had his own reason to support such an observation. In retrospect, Dr. Smith stated that a search for a Jovian ring was not made ``with any great expectatio nof a positive result but more for the purpose of providi ng a degree of completeness to Voyager's survey of the entire Jupiter system'' [3]. The ``B-ring'' distance from Jupiter was a logical place to search for a ring since it was inside the planet's Roche limit. Inside the Roche limit, the dierence in gravita- tional forces on the front and back of a satellite is so extreme that a satellite drifting interior to this limit will be torn apart. In Saturn's case, the main ring system, including the F ring, lies inside this limit. Of course, the limit would be dierent for each planet. It also would be dependent on a satellite's size and composition. A Jupiter ring observation would have to be designed to span a region that would account for every possible size and composition of the original satellite. Once designed, the ring observation had to be inserted somewhere in a Voyager 1 timeline of events already crowded with higher priority observations. Since a Jupiter ring had never been seen from Earth, a ring, if it existed, would be optically thin. Consequently, the best time to try to detect such a ring would be during ring-plane crossing. During that time period, the observation would look through as much as possible of the ring material that orbited near the planet's equatorial plane. To further"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"increase the chance of success, the observation should incorporate a long imaging exposure. With numerous competing science observations and an allocation of only two ring-plane crossing events, Tobias Owen and Ed Danielson, another ISS co-investi- gator, designed a ring observation that would ®t into the ®rst ring-plane crossing event. They initially requested a four-image observation but competing science demands resulted in reducing the observation time down to just one exposure [4]. Fortunately, the investigators knew they could recover at least one of the lost imaging frames by simultaneously shuttering both the wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras. The cameras' ®elds of view were oriented diagonally (to span the region of the proposed ring) and centered between Jupiter and its innermost satellite, Amalthea [5] (see Figure 4.1). The exposure times for both cameras were set to 11.2 minutes to maximize their chance of detecting faint ring material that might exist [6]. The Voyager 1 encounter began sixty days before its March 5, 1979, 4 : 42 a.m. PST rendezvous with Jupiter [7]. The start date had been chosen to coincide with the time when Voyager 1's imaging capabilities exceeded those of ground-based obser- vatories. Unfortunately, this would have placed the start of the encounter just before the Christmas holidays. I norder to give the operatio ns teams o ne last break before the historic and exceedingly hectic Jupiter encounter, the start time was delayed to early January 1979. The single-ring search observation was known as JRINGS and was scheduled to execute at 16 hours and 52 minutes before Jupiter closest approach [8]. The Jupiter encounter was divided into four phases: Observatory, Far Encounter, Near Encounter and Post Encounter. The Near Encounter Phase contained the closest approach point and was the most scienti®cally valuable part of the encounter. As Voyager approached its rendezvous with Jupiter, command sequences in its onboard computer executed one by one. At the designated time in the Near Encounter Phase, Voyager faithfully shuttered its cameras for the JRINGS observation. The wide-angle image was saturated, but the narrow-angle image found a ring [9] (shown in Figure 4.2). 50 The discovery of the Jupiter ring system [Ch. 4 Figure 4.1.

The Jovian ring discovery was announced on March 7, 1979, and appeared in the next day's newspaper.

The project had four months to understand the ®rst Jupiter encounter results, ®gure out what observations should be added to answer questions raised by that encounter; and then make the painful decisions about what observa- tions to delete to make room for the new ones.

The large quantity of high- priority science that could only be captured by Voyager 2, even if Voyager 1 collected all of its planned encounter observations, had led investigators to forgo future ring observations. The Voyager 2 encounter with Jupiter began on April 24, 1979, approximately 76 days before closest approach [14]. The dimness of the rings in the Voyager 1 image led scientists to speculate that the ring particles were very small, there was therefore a desire to image the rings from beyond Jupiter, where expected forward-scattering would make the rings brighter. Ring observations would have to wait until after the July 9, 1979, closest approach when the spacecraft was behind the planet. O nJuly 10, 1979, the Voyager 2 cameras were comma nded to look back towards the Sun (which was hidden from the spacecraft by Jupiter) and search for aurorae and lightning. Nestled into these high-phase-angle observations were imaging frames designed to detect scattered light from the newly discovered ring. Data transmitted back to Earth showed that these high-phase-angle ring observations were a spec- tacular success. A series of narrow-angle frames revealed a faint ring structure that was all but absent from the Voyager 1 images. Figure 4.3 shows a narrow-angle frame that captures one edge of the Jupiter ring system. 52 The discovery of the Jupiter ring system [Ch. 4 Figure 4.3.

(PIA00377)"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"From this and other narrow-angle frames, imaging scientists were able to deter- mine that the Jupiter ring was composed of two very tenuous rings. The inner ring extended from the upper atmosphere to a distance of 53,000 km above the cloud tops [15]. The outer ring, which is the more pronounced portion of the ring system, extended further by another 5,000 km. The thickness of the outer ring was not determi ned but was probably less tha n30 km a nd more likely less tha n1 km [16]. There were also some indications that the ring particles extended out of the equatorial plane [17]. Subsequent analysis of Voyager 2 data revealed a third ring residing outside the two already discovered. This additional ring was extremely faint and extended to approximately 210,000 km [18]. Barely observable, this ``gossamer'' ring would require more data from a more sensitive instrument to ascertain its true nature. The two Voyager Jupiter encounters were a dramatic success. They greatly increased the understanding of the planet's atmosphere, magnetosphere, satellites, and rings. However, every question that was answered seemed to give rise to many more questions. Of the new questions raised, many were about the rings themselves. These questions included, ``What was the source of the ring material?''; ``Why were there multiple rings?''; and ``Why were some ring particles out of the equatorial plane?''. Another mission to Jupiter was needed to attempt to answer these questions, a mission that would spend years, not months, making detailed observations of all aspects of the system, including its rings. 4.3 GALILEO ENCOUNTER The Galileo spacecraft was the ®rst vehicle ever designed to orbit an outer planet. Its prime missio nwas to release a natmospheric probe i nto Jupiter's atmosphere a nd the n spend the next two years in orbit about the planet trying to answers as many questions as possible that were raised by Voyager's Jupiter encounters. Galileo science objec- tives were divided into three main disciplines: atmosphere, magnetosphere, and satellites. The satellite discipline was also responsible for determining the origin, composition, and dynamics of the Jovian rings. Unfortunately, prior to its Jupiter arrival the Galileo spacecraft was unable to unfurl its high-gain antenna (HGA). Galileo would have to use its rigid low-gain antenna (LGA). The LGA was primarily designed for spacecraft emergencies when the spacecraft might not be able to locate Earth. This small antenna could transmit data only at low rates but could radiate its signal over a much wider area. If it was needed, all science transmissions would be terminated and only engineering data would be sent to Earth. The loss of the HGA meant that the spacecraft could collect vastly more data tha nit could possibly tra nsmit to Earth. Data rates had to be reduced from the planned 134,000 bits/s with the HGA down to approximately 30 bits/s with the much lower capability of the LGA [19]. Drastic times called for drastic measures. Torrence Johnson, the Galileo Project Scientist, allocated to each science discipline an exceedingly small number of bits. The total number of bits was dictated by the amount of data that could be collected and 4.3 Galileo encounter 53 ] Sec. 4.3"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"transmitted to Earth between successive Jupiter orbits. Each science discipline had to determine their highest-value observations on each particular orbit. Then an appro- priate fraction of the allocated bits was assigned to each instrument to capture its relevant science data. Investigators' decisions were based on the discipline's highest- priority science, the particular satellite the spacecraft was going to encounter on that orbit, and the desired instrument viewing geometry. Needless to say, the Galileo investigators agonized over what data to collect and what to abandon. The Galileo spacecraft arrived at Jupiter o nDecember 7, 1995. Its prime orbital mission was to last for two years and included 11 orbits about the planet. In reality, the spacecraft lasted much more than the planned two years. Galileo had three mission extensions. The ®rst was called the Galileo Europa mission (GEM) and was designed to focus orbits 12 through 25 on determining if Europa had subsurface liquid water [20]. The next extension was called the Galileo Millennium mission (GMM) and added four more science data collection orbits about the planet [21]. The ®nal extension, known as the Galileo Millennium mission extension, added ®ve more orbits [22]. 4.4 GALILEO RING OBSERVATIONS During Galileo's many years of operations, its science instruments revealed many additional details about the three distinct parts of the planet's ring system. The inner donut-shaped ring, called the Halo ring, may extend all the way to the planet's cloud tops. Outside of the Halo ring is an optically thicker and ̄atter ring, known as the Main ring. The third and most distant part of the system is the tenuous Gossamer ring. The Gossamer ring in actuality is composed of two overlapping rings. One begins at the inner edge of the Main ring and extends outward to the orbit of Amalthea. Its physical thickness is greater than that of the Main ring and thus engulfs the Main ring. The other Gossamer ring also begins at the inner edge of the Main ring but extends out past Amalthea to the orbit of Thebe. This outer Gossamer ring is also thicker than the inner Gossamer ring and thus contains both the inner Gossamer ring and the Main ring [23] (see Figure 4.4). Galileo spacecraft observations indicate that the rings are short lived and are composed of small dust particles. Particle size was inferred from the light-scattering properties of the individual rings. It is believed that the small ring particles are liberated from the four inner moons (Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea and Thebe), when meteoroids collide with their surfaces [24]. Figure 4.5 is a mosaic of ®ve images and is displayed twice. The top set of images contains the raw imaging data while the bottom is the same data annotated with the now-accepted names of three of the four rings and the four innermost moons. The exposures of the individual frames were successively increased to show the faint material in orbit about the planet. The vertical arc on the left is from sunlight transmitted through Jupiter's atmosphere. The ®rst frame, starting from the left, has the typical image sensitivity and shows the Main ring. The next image has ten times the sensitivity and shows an over-exposed Main ring with fainter material further away from the planet. The outer edge of the faint Halo ring is also visible. 54 The discovery of the Jupiter ring system [Ch. 4"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"4.4 Galileo ring observations 55 ] Sec. 4.4 Figure 4.4.

The image shows that the inner Gossamer ring abruptly ends at the orbit of Amalthea while the outer Gossamer ring ends at the orbit of Thebe. This, coupled with the fact that Gossamer rings have a thickness corresponding to the entire northern and southern extent of the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe, respectively, revealed an unusual mechanism for their structure. Micro-meteoroids impacting the surfaces of the two satellites eject material from the moons' surfaces. Since the orbits of these satellites are inclined to the planet's equatorial plane, so are the orbits of the liberated dust particles [25]. Since material is ejected from both satellites from all parts of their orbit, the continuous loss of particles produces a ring structure that is much thicker than for the Main ring (see Figure 4.6). The two Gossamer rings do not have a ̄at elliptical or circular shape like Jupiter's Main ring or the rings in Saturn's ring system, but are more like ̄at-edged disks [26]. The Main ring has no such dispersion: both Metis and Adrastea are in Jupiter's equatorial plane [27]. During its 35 orbits around Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft passed through Jupiter's shadow only three times (orbit 3, 4, and 5) [28]. These shadow passages provided the sole opportunities for the sensitive science instruments to look close to the direction of the Sun without being damaged. It is these high-phase-angle observa- tions that revealed the detailed structure of the Jupiter rings. During Galileo's third orbit of Jupiter, which included a close encounter of Callisto, the spacecraft looked back towards the Sun during shadow passage and imaged Jupiter and its entire ring system [29] (see Figure 4.7). 56 The discovery of the Jupiter ring system [Ch. 4 Jupiter Equatorial Plane Amalthea Amalthea Figure 4.6.

Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus all had rings. If there was justice in the universe, Neptune should also have rings. But if it didn't, some explanation would have to be developed to account for Neptune's inadequacy. In either case, astronomers ®rst had to determine if there were rings. Unfortunately, the search for these rings was made more dicult by the planet's extreme distance from the Sun. The only viable approach for discovering rings was by stellar ring occultation observa- tions. This technique requires the planet to cross in front of a stable star. If there are rings, the star will appear to ̄icker prior to the occultation and then again after the star emerges from behind the planet's disk. A stable star of known output is essential if the data are to be interpreted correctly. One could easily mistake brightness variations of a star for ring occultation events. At ®rst blush, searching for rings with stellar ring occultations would seem to have an equally high probability of success at Neptune as it had at Uranus. After all, it was this technique that was used to discover Uranus's rings. However, there are two major geometric dierences between Uranus and Neptune that make this technique for discovering rings at Neptune far more dicult. First, Neptune is one-and-one-half times as far away from the Sun (and Earth) as Uranus is. This makes Neptune's disk appear smaller, which in turn means that fewer star occultations occur. As a matter of fact, stellar ring occultions at Neptune are so rare that they occur on average only a few times a year. The other factor is tied to the planets' axial tilts. Uranus's axial tilt is 97.9 \u000e to its orbital plane [1]. This makes the ring system appear open as seen from Earth, at least away from the times that Uranus's rings are edge-on to Earth (1965, 2007, 2049, etc.). Because of this, Uranus's rings generally subtend a relatively larger amount of sky than Neptune's; this factor increases the odds that Uranus's rings will occult a star. For Neptune the situation is not as favorable. If Neptune had a ring, it would most"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"likely be equatorial. In that case, a ring system would appear more nearly edge-on to Earth-based observers since Neptune's axial tilt is only 29.6 \u000e [2]. Thus, the Uranian ring system subtends four times the amount of sky as compared with a proposed Neptune ring system (about 8 arc-seconds for Uranus as opposed to only 2 arc- seconds for Neptune) [3]. Astronomers started to look for Neptune rings immediately following the planet's discovery i n1846. As a matter of fact, two weeks after the pla net's discovery, astronomer William Lassell (1799±1880) reported ®nding such a ring [4]. However, there were no corroborating data to support his claim. This was not the ®rst time an illusive ring was thought to be encircling a newly discovered planet. William Herschel (1738±1822) thought he saw a ring around his newly discovered ``Georgian Star''. Though his telescope was strong enough to discover Uranus it wasn't strong enough to discern a ring. Richard Baum, Vice President of the British Astronomical Associa- tio nfrom 1993 to 1995, thought Herschel's ri ng was more likely astigmatism asso- ciated with his telescope rather the na nactual physical ri ng. This type of defect may also have led Lassell to make his claim about Neptune. The earliest documented observation of a possible Neptune ring occurred more tha n120 years later i n1968. I nthat year, astro nomers at Villa nova U niversity were trying to obtain a better measurement for Neptune's diameter. Their approach was to accurately measure the duratio nof a Neptu ne occultatio nof a 7th mag nitude star. The observation was a success, but no one noticed a 30% decrease in stellar brightness for 2 minutes and 48 seconds, beginning three minutes after the planet occultation. Thirteen years later on May 10, 1981, another Neptune occultation was observed photometrically. This time the brightness variation prior to the occultation was noted, albeit well after the event. Villanova team members, excited by this ®nding, went back to the data archives for data from the 1968 event. Sure enough, something had occulted the star prior to the occultation of Neptune's atmosphere. Astronomers immediately went to work to determine the geometry of a possible ring. Results indicated that if Neptune had an equatorial ring it would be located about 29,800 km to 36,125 km from the planet's center [5]. Of course, this was just an educated guess. The dimming could have been from variability of the occulted star, an experimental error, or possibly something else. 5.2 MORE STELLAR RING OCCULTATIONS Luck was on the side of the Villanova team. Another Neptune stellar occultation was to occur only two weeks later (on May 24, 1981). It would only be a grazing event, but the star was very stable and well-behaved. The team, led by Harold J. Reitsema, could potentially con®rm the Villanova team's discovery. Once the observations were made, measurements made by Reitsema's team did show a brief drop in brightness, but the data didn't look like what one would expect for a ring occultation. The interpretation was more consistent with the unlikely discovery of a new Neptune satellite, one with a diameter of approximately 180 km [6]. The only way to substantiate this discovery was with additional measurements. Unfortunately, the small size of the satellite, the poor 62 The discovery of the Neptune ring system [Ch. 5"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"knowledge of its orbit, and the paucity of occultation events made con®rmation unlikely. The Villanova team would have to wait eight more years for the Voyager 2 Neptune encounter to have a chance at con®rmation of their potential discovery. Meanwhile, the two stellar occultations and their atypical results served to increase interest and speculation about the cause of these brightness decreases. The next observed stellar occultation event was on June 15, 1983, and W. B. Hubbard was ready. Hubbard and his colleagues observed the event from six dierent locations. The multiple viewing angles allowed Hubbard to search as close as 0.03 radii of the planet's surface for rings. Unfortunately, no indications of rings were found [7]. Over the next six years many observations were made. Table 5.1 lists these attempts and their varied results. These inconsistencies vividly demonstrated how dicult these measurements are and how dicult it is to determine from Earth whether or not Neptune had rings. With only a third of the occultation events showing possible brightness variations, the ring system, if it existed, was not typical. It was the job of the theoreticians to combine all the observed data and piece together a model that could explain these observations. However, no single model would ®t all the ®ndings. If Neptune's rings existed, the truth about them would contain some combination of the following hypotheses: (1) Two shepherding satellites, each between 100 to 200 km in diameter could con- ®ne the ring (they would be too small to be seen from Earth) [9]. (2) The ring system was either incomplete or at least highly azimuthally variable [10]. (3) Newly discovered satellites might produce some of the observations. (4) Incomplete rings could consist of a series of short arcs having a width of 100 km that center on co-rotation resonances of a single satellite in an inclined orbit [11]. Ring scientists were clearly puzzled. One of them, Philip D. Nicholson, stated that no more tha nthree of all the stellar occultatio neve nts were probably real. However, based o nthis meager data set, he postulated that if Neptu ne did have ri ngs it would have at least three distinct ring arcs, the outer-most of which was approximately 72,500 km from the center of the planet. The other two could not be resolved into a single location. In 1984 the situation was summed up by Elliot and Kerr who said, ``If Neptune has rings, they almost certainly will not be discovered from the ground'' [12]. 5.3 THE VOYAGER 2 NEPTUNE ENCOUNTER Voyager 2 was going to be the ®rst spacecraft from Earth to visit Neptune. However, a Voyager 2 Neptune encounter was not always in the approved plan or in the budget. Fortunately, mission planners continued to keep the possibility alive from the mis- sion's very inception back in the early 1970s. Almost 20 years later very little had changed to increase our understanding of the planet.

With this in mind, the project did the best it could and began planning the encounter sequences for the upcoming rendezvous. The project ®rst evaluated the condition of the spacecraft and the available ground assets. On the science side of the house, the Voyager science investigators held their own Neptune Science Working Group meetings between August 1986 and July 1987. At these meetings scientists discussed what was known about Neptune from the sparse and often con ̄icting ground-based observations; the type of capabilities the spacecraft had; and what were the highest value observations the craft could perform to reveal the greatest amount of information about Neptune. The Voyager 2 science goals for Neptune ring observations were to obtain information on the following (if rings existed) [13]: (1) Ring-arc structure: both radial and azimuthal pro®les and their changes with time. (2) Ring satellite search for moonlets in or near the rings. (3) Search for additional ring material. (4) Orbital kinematicsÐimprove orbit models, compare ring motions with satellite motions. (5) Ring particle motionsÐimportance of self-gravity, vertical thickness of rings, collisions between particles. (6) Ring particle properties: size, shape, re ̄ectivity, temperature, and composition. (7) Ring environment: interaction with magnetospheric plasma or with an extended neutral atmosphere. By the time Voyager reached Neptu ne, the spacecraft had bee ni nspace for almost 12 years; the light levels were dow nby a factor of 900 as compared with Earth; a nd data rates had falle nfrom 115,000 bits/s at Jupiter to about 3,200 bits/s at Neptu ne due to the greater distance [14]. All of these factors severely limited the amount and quality of data that could be collected and was clearly not acceptable. So, engineers at the Jet Propulsio nLaboratory bega nto modify the ̄ight software to make Voyager 2 a much more capable craft. Spacecraft engineers knew that there were only a limited number of things that could be done to the spacecraft to compensate for the more dicult observing conditions. The lower light levels could be overcome with longer exposures. But longer exposures produce greater smear. To compensate for this, engineers programmed the spacecraft to gently rotate as the images were shuttered. This image motion compensa- tion (IMC) was analogous to a human photographer panning her camera to remove blur out of the subject while the background is excessively smeared. The major liability of this technique is that since the spacecraft was turning, the spacecraft's high-gain antenna would drift away from Earth-point. The lack of Earth-point meant that all data collected during an IMC observation had to be placed on the spacecraft's digital tape recorder (DTR). This technique had been successfully executed at Uranus and was planned for use again at Neptune. 5.3 The Voyager 2 Neptune encounter 65 ] Sec. 5.3"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"However, the greater spacecraft range from Earth resulted in slower data rates, which i ntur nrequired a lo nger time to retur nthe data from the spacecraft's recorder. This turned the data storage on the tape recorder into a valuable resource. Knowing this, engineers designed a new type of IMC to ``nod'' back and forth. This nodding motion allowed the angular rates to be taken out of the target without drifting too far away from the Earth. Between each ``nod'', the spacecraft would be commanded to reposition for the next imaging frame. Nodding image motion compensation (NIMC) could be done without interrupting the downlink telemetry and saved the DTR for other more valuable observations. Engineers also developed another type of IMC that did not involve moving the spacecraft at all. The idea was to command the spacecraft to move only its scan platform at its slowest possible rate. This did produce a distinctive ``jerkiness'' in the images but maneuverless image motion compensation (MIMC) was reserved for those observations of rapidly moving targets that otherwise would be useless. The moving scan platform had the imaging cameras (ISS), the infrared interferometer and spec- trometer (IRIS), the photopolarimeter (PPS), and the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) mounted on it, but IMC would be primarily used to help the imaging instruments. Table 5.2 shows the Voyager 2 Neptune ring observations that were designed with IMC. In this table, retargetable observations were sequences on the spacecraft with parameters that could be updated with better pointing information. Retargeting ensured successful pointing of the instruments at the target body. The start times are give ni ne ncou nter relative time which is the time relative to the spacecraft's arrival at its closest approach point. Table 5.2.

One of these was to make all three of the large 64-m Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas larger. Increasing their aperture from 64 m to 70 m improved their ability to receive weak signals by 1.4 dB. This would enable them to receive data at a faster data rate while maintaining an acceptably low error rate from a spacecraft that was 4.5 billion kilometers away [16]. The 70-m and 34-m antennas at a give nsite were the narrayed together to provide eve ngreater se nsitivity. Just arrayi ng a 70-m antenna with one 34-m high-eciency antenna (HEF) improved overall signal strength by another 0.8 dB [17]. After the spacecraft was reprogrammed and the three large DSN antenna aper- 66 The discovery of the Neptune ring system [Ch. 5"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"tures increased, negotiations were held between the United States, Japan, and Aus- tralia. These negotiations were for use of the Japanese 64-m Usuda Antenna and the Australian 64-m Parkes Radio Telescope. In addition, negotiations were held with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) for the use of their Very Large Array i nSocorro, New Mexico. Basically, the Voyager Project wa nted to ``liste nwith the entire Paci®c Basin'' for data being transmitted by Voyager 2 during its historic Neptune encounter. With the ground antennas enlarged and the spacecraft upgraded, the Voyager Project was ready. The Neptune encounter began on June 5, 1989 [18]. The planet was full of surprises. The planet's upper atmosphere showed unexpected atmospheric features; the planet's magnetosphere was not aligned with its spin axis; Triton, the planet's largest moon, had active geysers; and on August 11, ring astronomers were rewarded with the discovery of two ring-arcs (Figure 5.1). Initial observations indi- cated that they were 50,000 km and 10,000 km long [19]. Now the questions turned from whether Neptune had rings to trying to understand the mechanism that created the arcs? One immediate possibility was that the Neptune satellites were somehow responsible. 5.3 The Voyager 2 Neptune encounter 67 ] Sec. 5.3 Figure 5.1.

Starting from the innermost ring and working outward, they are now named Galle, Le Verrier, Lassel, Arago, and Adams (Figure 5.2). Each is named after a prominent 19th-Century astronomer who had a major role leading to uncovering the true nature of this trans-Uranian planet. The rings do not all have the same structure. Le Verrier, Arago, and Adams are very narrow and distinct while Galle and Lassell are broad and diuse. In addition to the ®ve continuous rings named above, there is a partial ring which shares its orbit with the satellite Galatea. For that reaso nit is sometimes called the Galatea ring, but it has not been given an ocial name as yet and very little is known about its detailed characteristics. Adams (the outermost ring) was also found to have dense clumps of material. These clumps of material are called ring-arcs and are the physical ring features that were responsible for the strange and confusing stellar ring occultation observations.

Neptune's rings were found to be more ill-de®ned than those of Uranus. Some of this has to do with the much larger number of Earth-based star occultation data sets for the Uranus rings as compared with those for Neptune [20]. Neptune ring data are tabulated i nTable 5.3. In general, planetary rings display very little in the way of azimuthal variations; most of the dramatic variability appears in the radial direction. The Neptune ring-arcs seem to violate that general rule. Many ring scientists believe that the ring arcs are a very short-lived phenomenon and that they will quickly distribute their material around the entire Adams ring. While the Voyager encounter period was very short, especially compared with most geologic periods, the ring-arcs appeared to remain 5.4 The rings of Neptune 69 ] Sec. 5.4 Figure 5.3.

This is in marked contrast with Saturn's B-ring spokes, one of the only other examples in the solar system of azimuthal structure in ring systems. Saturn's B-ring spokes appeared almost instan- taneously, underwent major changes over the course of just one revolution about the planet, and often disappeared within two or three circuits of Saturn. Table 5.4 shows the approximate length and separation between the ring-arcs as determined from Voyager 2 observations. Hubble Space Telescope observations taken in 2005 have revealed that there have been changes in Neptune's ring system since the Voyager 2 encounter. The Adams and Le Verrier rings are still at their expected locations but the ring-arc Liberte Â has almost completely vanished and Courage appears to have moved an additional 8 \u000e ahead of its prior position [21]. This is in contrast with ring-arcs Egalite Â and Fraternite Â which do not appear to have changed at all. Clearly, something is going on that cannot be explained by Voyager data alone. 70 The discovery of the Neptune ring system [Ch. 5 Table 5.3. Neptune ring and ring satellite data from Voyager 2.

Scientists preparing the Jupiter encounter observations of Voyager 1 did not devote much time or eort to ring observations, primarily because no ring of Jupiter had ever been detected. The single observation that was added to the Voyager 1 encounter sequence was a long-exposure image designed to search for a possible tenuous ring near Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Pioneer 11 spacecraft would not arrive at Saturn to reveal new rings there until September 1, 1979, shortly after the completion of Voyager 2's Jupiter encounter sequence (Chapter 2). Initial attempts to detect Neptune's rings by means of stellar occultation measurements did not begin until a year later, although possible evidence for detection of a partial ring was thereafter found in a 1968 measurement (Chapter 5). It was not until the Voyager 1 detection of a Jupiter ring system that ring scientists came to realize that planetary ring systems are a seemingly ubiquitous characteristic of giant planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Now it appears likely that rings will eventually be sighted around giant planets discovered in other solar systems withi nthe Orio nSpur of our Milky Way Galaxy. Fortunately, the Voyager 1 discovery came at a time when it was still possible to make slight alterations to the Voyager 2 Jupiter encounter, thereby enabling capture of the Voyager mission's best images of Jupiter's ring system. Armed with these de®ning data, the Galileo mission, a long-term Jupiter orbital mission, was able to plan for more detailed imaging of Jupiter's ring system, and it is primarily the results and analysis of these data that we discuss in this chapter. Pioneer 11 also played a pivotal role in the discovery of the Jupiter ring system. Its 1974 data revealed an unexpectedly low energetic charged particle population planetward of Jupiter's little satellite, Amalthea, which orbits Jupiter at a range of 181,400 km. Jupiter's equatorial radius is 71,492 km, so Amalthea orbits at a scant"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"1.54 Jupiter radii above the cloud tops. Noting the paucity of energetic particles, Pioneer magnetometer scientists Acun Ä a and Ness [1] suggested that an unseen ring or undiscovered satellite might be responsible for absorbing some of the charged particle ̄ux inward of Amalthea's orbit. In hindsight, their suggestion proved to be prophetic. However, other explanations for the reduced ̄ux of energetic particles were also suggested, so there was no unanimity of opinion on the cause or causes, and little attention was given to the suggestion until after the Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter. It is interesting to note that, had Voyager 1 not made its serendipitous discovery, Voyager 2 might not have devoted any of its precious time to capturing additional ring data at Jupiter, and Galileo, with its crippled antenna and drastically reduced data return capability, might not have deemed a Jupiter ring search of high potential value. But for the unexpected discovery, we might even now know little or nothing about the ring system of the solar system's largest planet. 6.2 RING RADIAL CHARACTERISTICS There is very little visible radial structure withi nthe Jupiter ri ng system other tha nthe boundaries between the dierent ring portions. The Main ring is both the narrowest and the thinnest of the rings, with a radial extent of 7,200 km and a vertical extent of less than 30 km [2]. Each of the other rings is brightest near its outer edge, which also likely corresponds to the location of the respective primary source of the ring's material. The source of material in the Halo ring is the Main ring; sources for the inner and outer Gossamer rings are Amalthea and Thebe, respectively. The general dimensions of the Jupiter rings are given in Table 6.1. An image and diagram of the rings was given in Figures 4.4 and 4.5. Detailed information on the individual rings is given in the following sections of this chapter. 6.3 MAIN RING All of Jupiter's rings appear to be composed primarily of dust-sized particles, as clearly demonstrated by the fact that they are much brighter in Voyager 2 and Galileo images looki ng back i nthe ge neral directio nof the Su ntha nthey are i nimages with the Sun and the ring in opposite directions from the spacecraft.

Both their relative positioning and brightness gradation within the Main ring make it apparent that the small satellites Metis and Adrastea (see Figure 6.1) provide much or all of the material in the ring. Jupiter's immense gravity focuses the paths of many meteoroids that approach the planet, and while most of these meteoroids fall into the atmosphere and are burned up, satellites close to Jupiter undergo heavy bombardment.

If the satellite is large, most of the debris falls back to the satellite surface, but the low gravity of smaller moonlets permits much of the debris to escape and go into orbit around Jupiter. Adrastea, with a mea ndiameter of o nly 20 km probably provides much more of the Mai nri ng material tha ndoes 43-km-wide Metis; Metis's surface gravity is three times that of Adrastea. Eve nsmaller u nsee nmoo ns may also provide some of the debris that forms the Mai nri ng. Once separated from their source moonlets, material in the Main ring continues to undergo bombardment, breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces. In denser rings, mutual collisions between the ring particles cause them to spread radially both toward and away from the planet. But, for the tenuous rings of Jupiter, including the Main ring, interparticle collisions are relatively rare, and other eects dominate. In the Main and Gossamer rings, the primary force appears to be Poynting±Robertson drag. This is an eect caused by sunlight, which comes from a single direction and heats the ring particle. If the particle is small (i.e., dust-sized or smaller), the entire particle is warmed and re-emits the energy in all directions. Although the energies involved are small, they are sucient to cause small particles to slow down, thereby spiraling planetward over time. Most of the Main ring particles appear to be lost to the Halo ring (see Section 6.5), where other forces due to interaction with the Jupiter magnetic ®eld and electrically charged particles within that ®eld add to the Poynting±Robertson drag. The combined eect is to cause the dust-sized and smaller ring particles to fall into Jupiter's atmosphere within 1,000 years or less [3]. The Main ring (and the other Jupiter rings) must therefore be continually replenished or they would disappear in extremely short times compared with the 4.5-billion-year age of Jupiter. While the outer edge of the Mai nri ng cuts o abruptly just outside the orbit of Adrastea, its inner edge is much less distinct. At its outer edge the thickness of the Main ring is less than 30 km (as mentioned in Section 6.2), comparable with the diameters of its larger source moonlets. The ring is also brightest (and densest?) at its outer edge. However, as material moves inward, the ring becomes thicker, possibly an indication that electromagnetic forces play more of a role. 6.4 GOSSAMER RINGS The inner Gossamer ring has as its source the satellite Amalthea (see Figure 6.1). Amalthea has a mea ndiameter of 167 km, butÐmore importa ntlyÐit has a norbital inclination to Jupiter's equator of 0.388 \u000e . With its mea norbital radius of 181,400 km, an inclination of 0.388 \u000e leads to excursions above and below Jupiter's equator of 1,230 km, or a full thickness of 2,460 km. If one then adds Amalthea's mean diameter of 172 km, the result is remarkably close to the 2,600-km estimated thickness of the inner Gossamer ring. Add to that the fact that the inner Gossamer ring's outer edge is essentially at the orbit of Amalthea, especially considering that the eccentricity of the orbit carries Amalthea more tha n800 km farther tha nits mea ndista nce, a nd the correspondence is unmistakable. A similar situation exists for the outer Gossamer ring. Its estimated thickness is 76 Present knowledge of the Jupiter ring system [Ch. 6"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"8,800 km. Thebe's mea norbital radius is 221,900 km a nd its orbital i ncli natio nis 1.070 \u000e , leading to excursions above and below Jupiter's equator of 4,140 km, or a full thickness of 8,280 km. Thebe's mean diameter is about 100 km (Figure 6.1). While the match (8,380 km versus 8,800 km) is not as close as for the inner Gossamer ring, the bright part of the outer Gossamer ring again extends to the orbit of Thebe. A very faint outward extension of the outer Gossamer ring also has the same 8,800-km thickness. A faint outward extension of the inner Gossamer ring would probably be hidde ni nthe glare of the outer Gossamer ri ng. Although Table 6.1 indicates that the inner edges of the outer and inner Gossamer rings are coincident with the outer edges of the inner Gossamer ring and the Main ring, respectively, each of the Gossamer rings actually extends much further inward, albeit at reduced brightness levels. It is likely that the outer Gossamer ring surrounds the inner Gossamer ring, which in turn surrounds the Main ring. The orbital motions of Amalthea and Thebe are such that these satellites spend more time near their extreme upper and lower limits than at any other intermediate distance above or below Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Gossamer rings are consequently brightest at their upper and lower extremes rather than being disks of uniform brightness. The orbits of Amalthea and Thebe also precess (change the orientation of their orbits while maintaining the same tilt) rapidly, wobbling like slowly spinning hoops which return their orientation to the original position in only a few months. Therefore, over periods as short as a few months, the Gossamer rings form relatively uniform disks of dusty material, densest at their upper and lower surfaces and least dense at their centers. Because of their associatio nwith the two satellites of Jupiter, the outer Gossamer ring is sometimes called the Thebe Gossamer ring, and the inner Gossamer ring is sometimes called the Amalthea Gossamer ring. 6.5 HALO RING Four small satellites (possibly aided by smaller unseen moonlets) provide the dusty material that makes up the Main and Gossamer rings of Jupiter. Material in those rings is acted upon by Poynting±Robertson drag (described in Section 6.3) and slowly moves planetward. However, when it reaches a radial distance of 122,150 km from the center of Jupiter, it completes precisely three orbits of Jupiter for every two rotations of the planet's magnetic ®eld. (Note that the planetary magnetic ®eld has a rotation period of 9.924 hr.) Hence, any tiny ring particles that have acquired an electrical charge will experience slight vertical forces that tend to push the particle out of the ring plane. At the radius of the so-called 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance , those forces will be i nthe same direction every third orbit of the ring particles, and the near-equatorial orbits of particles moving inward from the Main ring are very quickly spread vertically to a thickness approaching 20,000 km. Poynting±Robertson drag then continues to move the tiny particles further inward until they reach the 2 : 1 Lorentz resonance, which occurs when the natural orbit period of the particles is half that of the Jupiter rotatio nperiod. That occurs near 6.5 Halo ring 77 ] Sec. 6.5"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"a radial distance of 100,450 km, where the orbital period is 4.962 hr and is strong enough for sub-micrometer particles such that it rivals the gravity of Jupiter. At that point, the vertical forces on charged particles are much stronger than for the 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance, and Halo ring particles are carried completely out of the Jupiter ring, the vast majority quickly entering the atmosphere of Jupiter and becoming a part of the planet itself. From inspection of Table 6.1, it is clear that the boundaries of the Halo ring correspond closely with these two resonance radii. The electromagnetic process brie ̄y discussed here is described i nmore detail i nseveral good scie nti®c articles [4]. There are other Lorentz resonances within the ring system. The 1 : 1 synchronous orbital radius occurs midway through the inner Gossamer ring, for example. However, there seems little i nthe way of visible effects from this or the more distant Lorentz resonances. There are several possible reasons for that fact: ®rst, the particles might be too large to be easily de ̄ected (i nother words, the charge-to-mass ratio is too small); second, the particles may not yet have acquired an electrical charge (Lorentz forces work only on electrically charged particles); or, third, the Gossamer rings are already very faint, and vertical de ̄ection of a small fraction of their particle populations may be entirely undetectable. How do the particles become electrically charged? Jupiter's magnetic ®eld is populated with charged particles, which circle the planet in the same amount of time as the planet's rotation period (9.924 hr). The magnetic axis of Jupiter is tilted by 10 \u000e to the rotation axis. Therefore, in general, orbiting ring particles will cross the magnetic equator twice each rotation of the planet. During the ensuing collisions, the ring particles acquire some of the electrical charge of the magnetospheric particles. At the 1 : 1 resonance distance in the inner Gossamer ring, however, the orbiting ring particles maintain their position with respect to the planet's magnetic equator, and few collisions between magnetospheric particles and ring particles occur. This charging mechanism therefore becomes more ecient the farther the ring particles are from the 1 : 1 resonance radius. It is perhaps noteworthy that the Jupiter ring system extends from the 2 : 1 Lorentz resonance (the inner boundary of the Halo ring) to the 1 : 2 Lorentz resonance at the outer edge of the outer Gossamer ring (see Figure 6.2). For those ring particles closer in to the planet, a second charging mechanism becomes important. Jupiter's ionosphere electron population peaks near altitudes that vary from a few hundred to a few thousand kilometers above the cloud tops, both well planetward of the known rings [5]. However, the ionosphere falls o very slowly with altitude, and there are still remnants of this electron population near the inner edge of the Jupiter rings. These also move with the magnetic ®eld and can serve as an electrical charge source for close-i nri ng particles. The third mechanism for charging ring particles operates relatively equally in all parts of the rings. Like the Poynting±Robertson eect, it depends on sunlight. It is known as the photoelectric eect . When sunlight impinges on atoms and molecules near the surfaces of ring particles, occasionally enough energy is added to those atoms or molecules to free some of the outer electrons, which escape into space, leaving the ring particle with a small positive charge. For large particles, this has a negligible eect on their motions, but for tiny particles, this can serve over time to build up a relatively 78 Present knowledge of the Jupiter ring system [Ch. 6"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"large charge-to-mass ratio for the particles, whose motions are then more readily perturbed by interaction with Jupiter's magnetic ®eld. 6.6 RING-PARTICLE PROPERTIES Voyager observations of Jupiter's Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) reveal that their densities decrease with increasing distance from Jupiter. Their respective densities, in grams per cubic centimeter, are 3.57, 3.04, 1.94, and 1.86 [6]. The mean density of Earth's Moon, composed mainly of rocky materials, is 3.34 g/cm 3 ; the density of pure water is 1.00 g/cm 3 . This range of densities of the four Galilean satellites has been interpreted as an indication that heat from Jupiter during the planet's formative stages was responsible for driving volatile matter (like water) away from the inner portions of the Jupiter satellite system. No evidence is found for water at Io. Of course, that may be at least partly due to Io's volcanic activity. Europa was heated enough to allow the less dense materials (like water) to rise to the surface, 6.6 Ring-particle properties 79 ] Sec. 6.6 Figure 6.2. Lorentz resonances, which mark ring radii where enhanced interactions with the Jupiter magnetosphere occur, are shown in this diagram from Burns et al. (2004) [4].

Ganymede and Callisto are probably more like Earth's Moon, although they probably have more water ice (and possibly liquid water) i ntheir i nteriors. If indeed Jupiter's heat did drive away volatiles in the inner satellite system, the four source satellites for Jupiter's rings (Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe) would likely also be waterless objects. Although their sizes are fairly well determined, only Amalthea's mass has been measured (during the November 2002 close approach of the Galileo spacecraft). From radio data obtained during that encounter, Anderson et al. [7] have determined an Amalthea density of 0.857 \b 0.099 g/cm 3 , which is cer- tainly less than that of water. Such a low density suggests a high amount of porosity. Amalthea (and the other Jupiter ring moons?) may be ``rubble piles'' rather than well- consolidated natural satellites. If Amalthea were composed entirely of rocky materials, loose packing alone would likely be insucient to yield so low a density; the low density led Anderson et al. to conclude that a substantial fraction of Amalthea's composition is water ice. That conclusion in turn requires abandonment of the theory that Jupiter's formative heat drove out volatiles or, alternatively, an origin for Amalthea in colder regions of the solar system and subsequent capture by Jupiter after the planet had cooled. The general compositions and origins of the other three ring moons are likely similar to those of Amalthea. Whatever their internal composi- tion, all three moons are dark objects, re ̄ecting only 5±9% of the sunlight incident on their surfaces. The low re ̄ectivity testi®es to the eects of the heavy meteoroid bombardment they have undergone; most meteoroids are dark. Direct measurements of the composition of Jupiter's ring particles are dicult to obtain, either from Earth or from spacecraft. The diculty is due to their closeness to the planet and to their inherent faintness. Multicolor imaging of the rings from Voyager and Galileo, especially the main ring, con®rms that they re ̄ect red light more eciently than blue light. A reddish hue is more characteristic of silicate (rocky) material tha nof icy material. I nthe early 1980s, direct measureme nts of their re ̄ectivity were attempted from Earth by Smith and Reitsema [8] and Neugebauer et al. [9]. The Galileo near-infrared mapping spectrometer obtained a few spectral observations of Jupiter's rings, but all from very high ( \u0018 180 \u000e ) phase angles. Perhaps the best data set on Jupiter's rings to date is from Cassini observations during a 6- month period surrounding Cassini's closest approach on December 30, 2000. An attempt to integrate Earth-based and spacecraft (Galileo and Cassini) obser- vations was made by Throop et al. [10], and the discussion from this point forward in this chapter is take nmostly from that treatise. It seems that the phase curve of Jupiter's ring system is dominated at low phase angles by the larger (non-dust) ring particles, whereas the dust component is dominant at high phase angles (see Figure 6.3). The model ®t seems to show that, for unknown reasons, the particle population peaks at particle sizes near 15 micrometers in radius and that the particles are likely irregular i nshape rather tha nspherical. The data co n®rm that the larger ri ng particles (from which the dust-sized grains are derived) are very red (much like Amalthea), at least over the wavelength range from 0.4 micrometers in the blue to 2.5 micrometers in the near infrared.

It also obtained data from a variety of sensors and over a variety of viewing and illumination conditions which help to determine the re ̄ective properties and composition of the ring particles as well as their particle size distribution. However, continuing Earth-based measurements of stellar ring occultations (i.e., blockage of starlight by the rings as viewed from Earth) have provided the longest time base and most accurate data on ring radii, shapes, inclinations, widths, optical depths (transparency), precession rates (how fast the orbit changes orientation), and dynamic stability, all data that were not obtained by Voyager 2 in the short time period during which it was in the vicinity of Uranus. This chapter will follow up the discussions of Chapter 3 on the discovery of the Uranus rings with a discussion of what we really know about the rings 30 years after their initial discovery. Except for three broad and indistinct rings (the innermost and the two outer- most), none of which have yet been given ocial names by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Astronomical Union, the rings of Uranus are all narrow, relatively sharp-edged bands of intrinsically dark particles. Early Earth-based attempts to image the rings between the 1977 discovery and the 1986 Voyager 2 encounter were hampered by their narrowness, their low re ̄ectivity, their great distance from Earth, and their close proximity to Uranus. Even following the Voyager 2 encounter and more than 20 years of additional theoretical and observational data since 1986, ring scientists are hard-pressed to explain the mechanisms which con®ne the rings. Cordelia is about 1,400 km interior to the Epsilon ring and Ophelia is about 2,600 km exterior to the Epsilon ring; it is tempting to assume that these two small satellites gravitationally impede radial spreading in the Epsilon ring. The case for shepherding of the Epsilon ring by Cordelia"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"(inner edge) and Ophelia (outer edge) is in fact stronger than for any other Uranus ring. Three other rings may possibly be gravitationally constrained by a known satellite at either a ring inner edge or an outer edge, but not both. For the vast majority of the Uranus rings, no known satellites can provide the gravitational forces needed to con®ne the ring particles. A thorough search by Voyager 2 and subsequent searches by Earth-based observers have not been successful in locating satellites closer to the planet than Cordelia. Either the satellites which might shape the rings of Uranus are too small to have bee ndiscovered as yet or else some mecha nism other tha n gravitational shepherding is acting within this unique ring system. 7.2 RING DIMENSIONS, SHAPES, AND INCLINATIONS Table 7.1 provides an overview of the mean radial distances, velocities, periods, and masses of the 13 known rings and the 14 inner satellites of Uranus [1]. Their widths, orbital eccentricities and inclinations, and equivalent depths are give ni nTable 7.2 [2]. Because the eccentric rings have widths that vary with orbital longitude, the concept of equivalent depth (physical width multiplied by optical depth) is important because it remains essentially constant around the ring and is a measure of the number of particles passing a given point in the rings per unit time. [The following discussion is restricted to the nine brightest rings; i.e., it includes neither the Lambda ring nor the three broad rings. None of these dusty rings is seen in stellar occultations from Earth.]. From Table 7.2, it is seen that all of the rings except Eta, Gamma, and Delta depart measurably from circularity. Widths of the Epsilon, Delta, Beta, and Alpha rings vary such that they are widest at their most distant excursions from the planet and narrowest when they are closest to the planet. The Eta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon rings are con®ned (within measurement uncertainties) to Uranus's equatorial plane; the ®ve inner rings have small but measurable inclinations. The Epsilon ring and the ®ve inner rings (Six, Five, Four, Alpha, and Beta) have orbits which precess (change the orientation in space of their elliptical orbits) uniformly with time. One of the more interesting results of the Earth-based studies of the rings is their tendency to behave almost like rigid bodies. For example, precession rates of the inner and outer edges of the Epsilon ring would be expected on theoretical grounds to be slightly dierent, but they are identical. The longitude of the periapsis (closest point to the planet within its elliptical orbit) of the Epsilo nri ng precesses at a rate of 1.363 25 \u000e per day. I nother words, the elliptical orbit shape of the Epsilon ring ``revolves'' around Uranus every 264 days. This precession is due in part to the non-spherical shape of the planet. The other rings with non-circular shapes (eccentricities greater than 0, see Table 7.2) also precess around the planet at rates which increase with decreasing distance from Uranus. For example, the orbit of the most eccentric of the Uranus rings, the Five ring, precesses at a rate of 2.671 51 \u000e per day, completing a full 360 \u000e precessio ni no nly 121 days. In a similar fashion, the point at which inclined ring orbits cross the Uranus equator also moves around the planet. The rates of this so-called nodal regression are very close i nmag nitude to those of the apsidal precession rates for each ring discussed 84 Present knowledge of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 7"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"i nthe previous paragraph, but in the opposite direction . I nother words, the lo ngitude at which an inclined ring crosses the equator of Uranus moves backward around the planet at rates of between 1 \u000e and 3 \u000e each day.

There are likely variations of equivalent depth around the rings; the measurements here are for single cuts. ** In addition to a uniform dust band of 3,500-km width, there is an inward extension of the Zeta (1986U2R) ring with gradually decreasing brightness to a distance of about 32,600km [3]."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Using the de®nitions for equivalent width and depth to describe Uranus ring observations reveals something of their nature. If the rings were monolayers (only a single particle thick), there should be no variations of E around the rings. The four eccentric rings that show systematic variations of width with distance from the planet (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Epsilon rings) all show variations of E with ring azimuth. These rings, and by analogy all of the Uranian rings, are not monolayers, but are many particles thick. In spite of that conclusion, recent observations of the Uranus rings from the Hubble Space Telescope at low tilt angles (the Uranus rings are edge-on to the Sun and Earth in 2007) seem to show that the narrow rings of Uranus may be the only true monolayered rings in the solar system [4]. Equivalent depth, A , provides a measure of the amount of material in a ring, and might be expected to be relatively constant around a ring. The ground-based observa- tions were not conclusive on this point. Values of A around any ring tend toward constancy, but the measured variations are larger than the estimated errors in the measurements. These variations in A could be due either to clumpiness (azimuthal non-uniformity in the numbers of ring particles) or to substantial radial variations in optical depth across a given ring. Radial variations could invalidate the assumption that equivalent depth, de®ned by multiplying the measured width by an average optical depth, is representative of the number of ring particles. The ground-based observations of the rings suggest that both clumpiness and radial non-uniformity contribute to the noted azimuthal variations in equivalent depth. There is probably a close relationship between the equivalent depth of a ring and its total mass. Ring masses are sometimes estimated on the basis of their average optical depths or their equivalent depths. A more direct method of estimating ring mass is by studying density waves created in a ring by nearby satellites. Unfortunately, only one such wave has been identi®ed in any of the Uranian rings; that identi®cation was for a density wave in the Delta ring detected in Voyager photopolarimeter data [5]. A rough estimate of the surface density i nthe Delta ri ng was made from measure- ments of the observed density wave; it yielded values of between 5 and 10 grams per square centimeter. The density wave, if it truly exists, must be due to an as-yet- undiscovered satellite near the Delta ring. The process of deriving surface masses from measurements of density waves requires the assumption of an extended, nearly homogenous disk, and occultation measurements of the Delta ring show that it is neither extended nor homogenous. Masses of the Uranian rings therefore remain essentially unknown, as indicated in the last column of Table 7.1. 7.3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE RING PARTICLES The Uranus ring data from Voyager 2 span the electromagnetic spectrum from ultraviolet to radio wavelengths. The data also cover a range of viewing and illumina- tion geometries. Intercomparison of the data sets provides information relevant to studies of the physical properties of individual ring particles, even though the particles themselves are too small to be resolved i nthe data sets. Voyager results are also descriptive of the environment experienced by the ring particles and are therefore 7.3 Physical properties of the ring particles 87 ] Sec. 7.3"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"useful for theoretical studies of ring evolution. Combined with the Earth-based results they provide a relatively detailed database from which to extract information on the physical properties of the rings of Uranus. 7.3.1 Ring-particle size distribution Particle sizes in Jupiter's Main ring are clustered near a radius of 1 micrometer. Those in the Halo ring are smaller still. Particles in the Saturn ring range from micrometer- sized to house-sized or larger. Much of the information comes from the observed dierences in transparency of the rings at dierent wavelengths. In radio and stellar occultation experiments, the ring particles tend to absorb radiation at wavelengths comparable with or smaller than their diameters and to pass without signi®cant absorption radiation at longer wavelengths. The nine Uranian rings ®rst seen from Earth seem to have nearly identical optical depths at all measuring wavelengths (ultraviolet to radio). The implications are clear: the vast majority of the ring particles must have sizes comparable with or larger than the longest observing wavelength (13 cm). A single long-exposure image of Uranus's rings at the highest possible phase angle (172.5 \u000e ) is show ni nFigure 7.1. I nthe image, taken from an article by Burns [6], the rings are seen to be almost continuous, but with a large amount of radial variation. The fact that all the rings seen at low phase angle (top half of image) are visible in the high-phase-angle image is an indication that a small fraction of the particle population in each of the narrow rings is composed of particles with radii of approximately 1 micrometer. In addition, there is a sprinkling of micrometer-sized dust between the narrow rings; the source of the radial structure in the dust bands, much like that of the narrow rings themselves, remains unexplained. The brightest of the dust rings is at the radial distance of the Lambda ring, which is very faint in backscattering and was not seen in radio science occultation data. Combined, these data indicate that the Lambda ring is dominated by particles in the size range of 1 micrometer radius or smaller. The equivalent depth of the Lambda ring measured by the ultraviolet spectrometer (wavelength 0.31 micrometer) was 0.31 km; that measured by the photopolarimeter (wavelength 0.27 micrometer) was only 0.13 km. These data suggest that more tha n60% of the particles i nthe Lambda ri ng are less tha n0.3 micrometers i nradius. The three broad rings of Uranus have not been detected in Earth-based stellar occultation measurements. All three have been seen in backscattered near-infrared light from Earth. They are probably dominated by micrometer-sized or smaller par- ticles, but, like the Lambda ring, they must have a tiny fraction of larger particles which enable them to be seen at low phase angles, especially when the tilt angle of the Uranus rings is small. Voyager radio occultation data are of high enough quality to identify faint companions of two of the rings of Uranus. The Eta ring has a faint companion ring at its outer edge; the Delta ring has a similar companion ring at its inner edge. These companions were seen in both ingress and egress measurements with similar size and radio optical depth i neach case, eve nthough the two cuts were separated by about 149 \u000e in ring longitude [7]. The Delta and Eta ring companions have also been seen in 88 Present knowledge of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 7"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Earth-based stellar occultations [8]. Their optical depths appear to be constant with both time and wavelength, implying again that these are not dust rings, but are instead dominated by particles larger than a few centimeters. 7.3.2 Ring-particle composition No high-resolution ultraviolet, visible, or infrared spectra of the rings of Uranus were obtained by Voyager 2. The rings were too dark, too narrow, and too optically thin to permit the collection of such data. Color images shuttered at dierent wavelengths in the visible range of the spectrum could potentially provide some composition informa- tion. The rings of Uranus were uniformly dark at all colors. The only cosmically abundant material which matches both the low re ̄ectivity and the uniformly gray color of the Uranus rings is carbon. The ®ve largest satellites of Uranus also have neutral colors, but their re ̄ection spectra indicate that there is water ice present on their surfaces. No indication of water ice is seen in Earth-based spectra of the rings, although the two recently discovered outer rings of Uranus (2003U1R and 2003U2R) appear to be blue and red, respectively [9].

By analogy, Mab could be the source of the ring's material, which is almost certainly dominated by tiny particles of water ice. The redness of 2003U2R is reminiscent of Saturn's G ring and may be indicative of a silicate composition. The source of the carbon in the main rings of Uranus is very possibly the decompositio nof metha ne (CH 4 ) ice through bombardment by energetic protons [10]. Methane is known to be abundant in the outer solar system, and energetic proton ̄uxes are suciently high to blacken most exposed methane in the inner magneto- sphere. It is also possible that part or all of the carbo nis i nthe form of origi nally elemental carbon from the breakup of carbonaceous meteoroids or asteroids captured into orbit around Uranus. 7.3.3 Ring-particle re ̄ectivity The low re ̄ectivity of the rings of Uranus against the background sky is evident both from Voyager 2 and from Earth-based observations. Re ̄ectivity of the Epsilon ring is estimated to be between 1.0% and 1.8%, making it one of the darkest natural structures known [11]. The other narrow rings have similarly low re ̄ectivity. The rings are not ®lled with particles, but their volume is probably about 1% occupied by particles. A ̄at sheet composed of the same material as the ring particles might have a re ̄ectivity of about 3.2%. For comparison's sake, the A and B rings of Saturn have re ̄ectivity of about 60%, and the darker C ring and Cassini Division re ̄ect between 20% and 30% of the sunlight incident upon them [12]. 7.4 RING INTERACTION SWITH SATELLITE S One of the ring science objectives of the Voyager 2 encounter was to study interactions between ring particles and the shepherding satellites most scientists expected to ®nd between the rings. Such interactions are responsible for some of the major features of Saturn's rings, such as the outer edges of the A and B rings and a large number of less prominent features spread throughout the rings. Small satellites are also thought to be the source of new ring material, either by tidal breakup as these satellites approach the planet too closely and are broken apart by unmatched gravitational forces, or in less catastrophic manner by countless micrometeoroid impacts with their surfaces. Undis- covered satellites with diameters of 5 to 10 kilometers may still await discovery near the orbits of the Uranus rings. Even smaller satellites could serve as sources for the material in the present rings. As matters presently stand, only the Epsilon ring seems to have satellites in the proper positions to possibly con®ne ring material within the variable width of the ring. Observations seem to show that the ring is optically denser near its inner and outer edges, typical of rings that are gravitationally con®ned. Ophelia, orbiting farther from Uranus than the Epsilon ring, completes 13 orbits of Uranus for every 14 orbits of particles at the outer edge of the Epsilon ring. Similarly, Cordelia orbits the planet 25 90 Present knowledge of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 7"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"times for every 24 orbits of ring particles at the inner edge of the Epsilon ring. The repetitive geometric alignment of ring particles and satellites can result in a slight retardation in the orbital speeds of particles at the outer ring edge and acceleration of particles near the inner edge. Those combined gravitational nudges may be the con®ning mechanism for particles in the Epsilon ring, which, due to mutual collisions between ring particles, would otherwise tend to spread radially both inward and outward. A 47 : 49 orbital resonance with Cordelia which falls near the center of the Epsilon ring may additionally account for that ring's relative minimum in optical depth near its center and for the larger number of particles con®ned to the outer half of the ring (see Figure 7.2). The interaction is complicated somewhat by the fact that the orbit of Ophelia is slightly elliptical (eccentricity of 0.010). The average eccentricity of the Epsilon ring is 7.4 Ring interactions with satellites 91 ] Sec. 7.4 Figure 7.2. Computer processing of one-dimensional radio science occultation data were used to produce this two-dimensional view of the Epsilon ring showing many internal details, including very abrupt termination of ring material at inner and outer boundaries. Also apparent in the image are the abrupt rise in brightness near the center of the ring and the higher concentration of ring material in the outer half of the ring. (Courtesy G. L. Tyler)"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"intermediate between the negligible eccentricity of Cordelia's orbit and the larger eccentricity of Ophelia's orbit; this may be related to the fact that the Epsilon ring is widest at its most distant point from the planet and narrowest at its closest approach to the planet. As successful as gravitational resonance theory with known satellites may be in explaining the major features of the Epsilon ring, it has thus far been singularly unsuccessful in explaining the ®ner details of the Epsilon ring or in explaining most of the boundaries of the other narrow rings of Uranus. The 23 : 22 resonance of Cordelia falls very close to the sharp outer edge of the Delta ring (but is not the cause of the Delta ring density wave mentioned above), and the 6 : 5 resonance of Ophelia is close to the outer edge of the Gamma ring [13]. Aside from these perhaps fortuitous matches, the satellites (or other mechanisms) responsible for ring con®nement are unknown. 7.5 DUST ENVIRONMENT AND POSSIBLE MAGNETIC FIELD INTERACTIONS Voyager 2 crossed the Uranus equatorial plane near a distance of 115,400 km from the center of the planet. That is about 14,400 km inside the orbit of Miranda and well exterior to any of the rings of Uranus. Two instruments aboard Voyager 2 (plasma wave and planetary radio astronomy instrumentation) were capable of detecting dust impacting the spacecraft. These instruments detected a maximum of 30 to 50 impacts per second very near the Uranus equator and extending more than 1,000 km above and below the equatorial plane [14]. From the measurements, estimated to be due to particles in the size range of a few micrometers or so, a maximum spatial density of about 1 dust particle per 1,000 cubic meters was calculated, dropping by a factor of 2 for every 100 to 150 km from the Uranus equator. One possible reason for the vertical spreading of this dust ring may be electrical charging of the dust particles by constant bombardment from positively charged ions or electrons. Because of the high tilt of the magnetic ®eld of Uranus, ring and dust particles are blasted by these plasma particles twice every rotatio nof Ura nus. The sole exception to that general rule is at the radial distance from Uranus where the rotation rate of the planet is equal to the orbital period of ring particles, which occurs near a radius of about 82,000 km, just interior to the orbit of Puck and about halfway between the two recently discovered rings of Uranus. The strongest perturbing forces tending to move particles out of the Uranus equatorial plane would be expected to occur where ring particles complete two orbits of the planet per single rotation of Uranus, and where ring particles complete one orbit of the planet per two rotations of Uranus. The former occurs just exterior to the Epsilon ring, possibly providing a mechanism for removing small particles from that ring. The latter occurs just beyond the orbit of Miranda, thereby providing a possible reason for the large vertical extent of the dust band observed by the two Voyager instrument packages. 92 Present knowledge of the Uranus ring system [Ch. 7"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"7.6 NOTE SAND REFERENCE S [1] The data in Table 7.1 are taken from tables 11.1 and 11.2 in Miner, E.

The only close-range data collected on Neptune's ring system were collected over a 2-week period surrounding that date of closest approach; Voyager 2 data are also the sole available data for phase angles larger than a few degrees. Only recently has Earth- based telescopic equipment achieved the sensitivity and resolution to begin additional low-phase-angle observations of Neptune's tenuous rings. Hence, the most compre- hensive treatise to date on the Neptune ring system is a compilation of pre-Voyager and Voyager observations and their interpretation included as a chapter by Porco et al. [1] in the University of Arizona Press text Neptune and Triton , edited by D. P. Cruikshank. A somewhat less formal and much shorter summary is given in chapters 3 and 11 of the book Neptune: The Planet, Rings and Satellites , writte nby two of the authors of this book [2]. Nearly 800 images of the Neptune ring system were returned by Voyager 2. A handful of observations were also carried out by other investigations aboard Voyager 2. These included a stellar occultation measured by the photopolarimeter and the ultraviolet spectrometer, in which the light received from the star sigma Sagittarii was carefully monitored by Voyager 2 as the spacecraft motion caused Neptune's rings to pass across the star, partially blocking the starlight. Voyager's very precise X-band and S-band radio signals were also monitored on Earth as the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"spacecraft passed behind the rings in what is known as a radio occultation experiment. Dust and plasma near the spacecraft were also measured by the Voyager plasma wave, planetary radio astronomy, cosmic ray, and low-energy charged particle instruments. All of these data assisted ring scientists to better understand the nature of the Neptune rings. However, it is clear that there remain many questions that may not be answered without additional data from a future Neptune-orbiting spacecraft similar to the Cassini Orbiter at Saturn or by far more sophisticated Earth-based observations tha nare possible today. 8.2 RING RADIAL CHARACTERISTICS Neptune is thirty times as far from the Sun as the Earth is. That translates to sunlight that is a scant 1/900th as bright as sunlight at Earth, or something akin to late twilight on Earth. Combine with that the fact that Neptune's rings are inherently dark (as well as being optically thin) and the problem of imaging Neptune's rings becomes some- thing like trying to image pieces of coal when the sole illumination is a full Moon. Because of the dust content of the rings, they become somewhat easier to see when back-lighted, so some of the best images of Neptune's rings come from phase angles (the angle between the Sun and the observer as seen from the target) of about 135 \u000e . Most of the images of the Neptune rings were shuttered either during approach to the planet, where the phase angle was about 15 \u000e , or during departure, where the phase angle was about 135 \u000e . Only a few images obtained about 6.5 hr before closest approach (phase angle \u0018 8 \u000e ) and 37 to 77 min after closest approach (phase angle \u0018 155 \u000e ) were appreciably dierent from the approach and departure phase angles. A table of the radial structure of the rings of Neptune was given earlier in Chapter 5 (Table 5.3). There are three continuous narrow rings (Adams, Le Verrier, and Arago), one faint and possibly intermittent narrow ring (which shares it orbit with the satellite Galatea), and two broad rings (Lassell and Galle). A radial scan of the measured brightness of the rings at 134 \u000e phase angle is shown in Figure 8.1 [3]. The radio science occultation experiment, which had yielded such a rich store of data for the Saturn and Uranus ring systems (no radio occultation of the Jupiter ring was attempted), yielded very little for the Neptune ring system. Tyler etal. [4] reported detecting no Neptune ring material down to the noise level of the radio signal, which corresponded to about 1% of the received signal strength for a radial resolution of 2 km. The team had three caveats on their non-detection: (a) only the Adams ring was probed on both the immerging and the emerging sides of Neptune and the Galle ring was not probed at all, (b) neither side probed the longitudes in the Adams ring that contained the denser ring arcs (see Section 8.3), (c) the radio data were aected by passage through Neptune's ionosphere, thus perhaps masking a weak ring signature. The stellar occultatio nmeasureme nts of sigma Sagittarii occurred as Voyager 2 was inbound toward the planet, about 5 hr from closest approach. The occultation covered a range of radial distances from Neptune of 42,414 to 76,056 km. The lower end of this range is unfortunately at the outer edge of the Galle ring, but the upper end of the range is well outside the Adams ring. The Adams ring was detected by both the 96 Present knowledge of the Neptune ring system [Ch. 8"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"photopolarimeter (with an eective wavelength of 0.26 micrometers) [5] and the ultraviolet spectrometer (with a neective wavele ngth of 0.11 micrometers) [6]. Both wavelengths are well below the range of visible light wavelengths in the far ultraviolet. The value of the radial distance depends somewhat on the inclination of the Adams ring, which is not well determined, but is close to 62,900 km, in reasonable agreement with the value of 62,932 give ni nTable 5.3. At this point, let us pause for a moment to remind our reader of the concept of equivalent depth introduced in Chapter 7 in the discussion of the variable-width Uranus rings. Equivalent depth is basically the optical depth (mathematically cor- rected to vertical viewing) times the physical width (in kilometers) and is a measure of the total material i na cross-sectio nof a ri ng. Optical depth (  optical thickness) is a measure of the amount of light absorbed in passage through a ring and is indicated as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the intensity of the incident light to that of the emerging light. In simple terms, a ring (or other semi-transparent sheet of material) is said to have an optical depth of 1 if the incident light is reduced by a factor of e (  2.718). The optical depth is 2 if the reductio nis a factor of e 2 (  7.389), and so forth. Vertical (or normalized) optical depth is the measured optical depth multiplied by the trigonometric sine of the viewing angle. (The viewing angle is the angle between the observing direction and the perpendicular to the ring plane.) Normalized optical 8.2 Ring radial characteristics 97 ] Sec. 8.2 Radius (km) Relative brightness Figure 8.1. This plot of relative brightness versus radial distance was produced by Mark Showalter by radially scanning a wide-angle image (FDS 11412.51) of the rings taken at a phase angle of 135 \u000e . The data are azimuthally averaged to reduce image noise. The six rings of Neptune are clearly seen in the plot, which appears as ®g. 3 of Porco et al. [1]."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"depth is therefore a napproximatio nof the optical depth of the ri ngs for vertical illumination and viewing. In mathematical terms, I  I 0 e \u0005 \u001c  or alternatively expressed as \u001c  ln  I 0 = I  ; where I 0 is the incident light intensity, I is the emerging light intensity, e is the base of natural logarithms, ln is the natural logarithm, and \u001c is the optical depth, \u001c n  \u001c sin B ; where B is the viewing angle just described and \u001c n is the normalized optical depth, and A  W \u001c n ; where A is the equivalent depth and W is the physical width. For the rings of Uranus, equivalent depth tends to be relatively constant around the narrow rings, even when their physical widths vary. Equivalent depth is, in a sense, a measure of the amount of ring material in a cross-section of the ring. Now back to our discussio nof the stellar occultatio nmeasureme nts of the Neptune rings by Voyager 2. To reduce the noise in the data, the photopolarimeter, with a sampling interval of 1.5 km, was smoothed to an eective resolution of 5 km. The equivalent depth of the Adams ring as measured by the Voyager photopolarim- eter [7] was determined to be 0.77 \b 0.13 km. The ultraviolet spectrometer, with a radial resolution of 2.3 km, measured an Adams ring equivalent depth [8] of 0.66 \b 0.12 km. The two numbers are statistically identical, an indication that there are few ring particles in a size range near 0.1-micrometer radius in that part of the Adams ring, which fortuitously corresponds to the leading edge of the Liberte Â arc withi nthe Adams ri ng. The Liberte Â arc is much brighter tha nthose portio ns of the Adams ring sampled by the radio occultation experiment (60 \u000e and 90 \u000e from the arc region); therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about the relative numbers of larger ring particles in the Adams ring. The ultraviolet spectrometer detected no Neptune ring features other than the Adams ring. A statistical analysis of the photopolarimeter data [9] indicated that the Adams ring occultation was the only unambiguous non-random event detected during the occultation experiment. However, there is a slight dip in the starlight intensity near the radial distance of the Le Verrier ring, which may indicate a near detection of that ring. Otherwise, the most useful data on the radial positions of the six Neptune rings listed i nTable 5.3 are those from the Voyager imagi ng data. Beyond the rings seen by the imaging system, Voyager detected dust particles near the ring plane both inbound and outbound. The detections were made by the plasma wave [10] and planetary radio astronomy [11] investigations. The inbound equatorial crossing of Neptune was at a radial distance of 85,290 km and the outbound was at a radial distance of 103,950 km [12]. On the inbound leg, both investigations found a maximum in the numbers of dust particles at a radial distance of 85,400 km and a vertical height above the ring plane of  146 to  160 km. The numbers of particles dropped o smoothly above and below that point, reaching half the maximum number density at a distance of about \b 140 km. The two investigations diered 98 Present knowledge of the Neptune ring system [Ch. 8"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"slightly in their derived numbers for the outbound ring crossing. The plasma wave investigation found the maximum numbers near a radial distance of 104,000 km and near a vertical distance of \u0005 948 km below Neptune's equatorial plane; the vertical width of the dust distributio nwas more tha n \b 500 km at half maximum.

The unnamed ring that shares its orbit with the satellite Galatea is not visible in most Voyager images of the rings; for those in which it is discernible, it appears to be discontinuous, but the existing data are insucient to quantify any azimuthal vari- ability. The only ring for which azimuthal variability is clearly and measurably present is the Adams ring. The primary azimuthal structure noted in the Adams ring is associated with the ring arcs. A radially averaged longitudinal scan of a Voyager 2 wide-angle image that includes all the arcs is shown in Figure 8.2, taken from Porco etal. [13]. The arcs, from leading to trailing, are Courage, Liberte Â , Egalite Â 1, Egalite Â 2, and Fraternite Â . Their relative positions and respective lengths were given in Table 5.4. Internal brightness variations within the ring arcs, clearly evident from Figure 8.2, are real and exist in each of the arcs. These variations are likely due to clumpiness within the arcs. They may be the result of accumulatio nof dust-sized particles arou nd larger tha naverage bodies withi nthe arcs. The larger bodies i ntur nmay be the source bodies for the smaller material i nthe arcs [14]. In addition to the ®ne-scale brightness variations within the ring arcs, the non-arc regions of the Adams ring seem to vary by about a factor of 3; the background ring is brightest near and between the ring arcs and faintest well away from the longitude of the arcs [15]. Recent observations of the Adams ring arcs from the Keck Telescope, utilizing its adaptive optics capability, show that there have been substantial changes in the ring arcs since the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989 [16]. The trailing arc, Fraternite Â , seems to be the only well-behaved arc within the ring. It continues to be essentially unchanged in appearance and to circle Neptune at the same rate measured during the Voyager era (820.1118 deg/day). Egalite Â 1 and Egalite Â 2 appear to have reversed in relative inten- sity, perhaps the result of material migrating between the two resonance sites. Courage appears to be approximately 8 \u000e ahead of its prior positio nrelative to Frater nite Â , perhaps an indication that it has shifted one resonance site ahead of its prior position. I nearlier data, Liberte Â seemed to be migrating between resonance sites; in the latest data it has all but disappeared. 8.3 Ring azimuthal variations 99 ] Sec. 8.3"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"8.4 SMALL SATELLITES NEAR THE RINGS Four known satellites orbit near or within the Neptune ring system (see Table 8.1). These include Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, and Galatea. Naiad, Thalassa, and Despina are all between the Galle and Le Verrier rings. Galatea seems to circle Neptune precisely 43 times for every 42 circuits of particles in the Adams ring. In scienti®c terms, that means that the Adams ring and its ring arcs are located at a 42 : 43 outer Lindblad resonance [17] of Galatea. Galatea may therefore be partly responsible for the narrowness of the Adams ring. It may also play a role in the azimuthal con®ne- ment of the ring arcs. Over time, its gravitational in ̄uence will create 42 nodes in the Adams ring which may inhibit the azimuthal motion of ring particles past those nodes, which would be separated by 8.57 \u000e of ring longitude. Six nodes would span a longi- tudinal range of about 42.85 \u000e , very nearly the same as the longitude span covered by the ®ve known arcs. 100 Present knowledge of the Neptune ring system [Ch. 8 Figure 8.2.

The center of the ring is only a few kilometers from the positio nof a pote ntial 53 : 52 outer Lindblad resonance, but the 54 : 53 resonance is only 13.1 km closer to the planet, and the Le Verrier ring has a width of about 110 km. Furthermore, the absence of azimuthal inhomogeneity or internal radial structure would seem to rule out substantial gravitational eects from Despina. If the Le Verrier ring's width is aected by a Lindblad resonance, it does not appear to be that of Despina. Galatea seems also to be subject to bombardment by meteoroids that have blasted material from its surface. That is probably the source of the tenuous and possibly intermittent ring that shares its orbit. Little more is known about this tenuous ring that has yet to garner an ocial name from the International Astronomical Union's Nomenclature Commission. 8.5 POSSIBLE ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS The presence of an extended disk of dust well beyond the visible ring system was discussed in Section 8.3. The plasma wave and planetary radio astronomy investiga- tions also detected dust particles at all latitudes, albeit at levels that were several orders of magnitude smaller than observed near the equator. Neptune's magnetic equator is highly tilted (by 47 \u000e !) with respect to Neptune's rotation equator, so if tiny dust particles i nthe exte nded dust disk become electrically charged, they ca nperhaps be rapidly moved out of the equatorial plane near Lorentz resonance positions, as 8.5 Possible electromagnetic eects 101 ] Sec. 8.5 Table 8.1.

Lorentz resonances occur at radial distances where the orbital period of the dust particles is a simple integer ratio of the rotation period of Neptune. Neptune's rotation period is 16.108 \b 0.006 hr [18]. By inspection of Table 8.1, it is clear that the co-rotation radius (where the natural orbital period is equal to the rotation period of Neptune) is well outside the rings. It falls at a radial distance of 3.22 R N (79,740 km) from Neptune's center, between the orbits of Larissa and Proteus. The 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance radial distance is outside the Adams ring and the 2 : 1 resonance is interior to the Le Verrier ring. Any electrically charged sub-micrometer-sized particles that wander planetward at those two radial distances will quickly be perturbed to high inclinations, possibly ending up as a part of the high- latitude dust populatio nobserved. Ring particles in the main rings and the dust disk, except at the co-rotation radius near 79,740 km, will have trapped radiation in the Neptune magnetosphere swept back and forth across them. The resultant collisions are expected to remove some of that plasma from the magnetosphere, resulting in reduced plasma levels above and below the rings. However, the passage of Voyager 2 over the pole of Neptune did not take the spacecraft through those portions of the Neptune magnetosphere that might enable such depletions to be measured directly. 8.6 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE RINGS The absence of a detection of the Adams ring (away from the arc region) implies that the material i nthat portio nof the ri ng is much smaller tha na few ce ntimeters i n radius. This is in sharp contrast to similar measurements of the rings of Saturn and Uranus, where dust-sized particles apparently constitute 1% or less of particle popu- lation. The brightness of the six Neptune rings at high phase angle in Voyager 2 images leads to a similar conclusion: that a high percentage of the particles in the rings must be micrometer-sized. Similarly, from the greater co ntrast betwee nthe arcs i nthe Adams ring and particles in the remainder of the ring in high-phase images, the ring arcs have a neve nhigher perce ntage of micrometer-sized particles tha nthe rest of the Adams ring. The Le Verrier ring particles are similar to those of the non-arc regions of the Adams ring. Looking at particle sizes in the broader Galle and Lassell rings, the Galle ring also appears to have high dust content. The Lassell ring, of comparable optical depth, appears signi®cantly less dusty (although still more than ten times as dusty as the main rings of Saturn or Uranus). One characteristic common to the rings of Uranus and Neptune is their low re ̄ectivity. Both are characterized by particles that re ̄ect less tha n5% of the light incident on their surfaces. This low re ̄ectivity is certainly uncharacteristic of water ice particles. Perhaps both ring systems have particles coated with black elemental carbon, possibly produced by the bombardment of methane by magnetospheric plasma. The masses of the rings of Neptune (listed as `??' in Table 8.1) were not deter- mined, but they are estimated to be 10,000 times less massive than the rings of Uranus. 102 Present knowledge of the Neptune ring system [Ch. 8"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"If dedicated searches for such rings had not been conducted, either from Earth or from Voyager 2, they might never have been seen in images taken for other purposes. Neptune has more satellites within its ring system (Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, and Galatea) than Uranus (only Cordelia resides within the ring system), so the smaller mass of the Neptune rings is not a consequence of less available source material. The reasons for the dierences between the two ring systems are not understood, but they imply signi®cant dierences in the evolution of these two ring systems. 8.7 NOTE SAND REFERENCE S [1] Porco, C.

[17] Lindblad resonances are named for Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad (1895±1965). He was the ®rst to recognize that galactic spiral structure could be attributed to the gravita- tional in ̄uence of a perturbing body on a disk of smaller bodies if the two orbited around a commo nce nter i nperiods that are related by relative small i ntegers. For the purposes of this chapter, the three bodies involved in Lindblad resonances are the planet, a perturbing satellite of sucient mass, and a ring. For example, if a satellite orbits a planet interior to a planetary ring and completes two orbits of the planet for every single orbit of some of the particles in the ring, and if the satellite is large enough to exert a measurable gravitational force from that distance, those particles in the ring will be perturbed by a 1 : 2 outer Lindblad resonance due to repeated gravitational tugs in the same direction. If the satellite is exterior to the ring and orbits the planet three times for every four orbits of the ring material, it might exert a perturbing force on the ring material at the 4 : 3 inner Lindblad resonance. In general, the smaller the satellite, the closer it must be to the ring and the higher the order of the Lindblad resonance. In the case of Galatea and the Adams ring, the latter is at a 42 : 43 outer Lindblad resonance radius of the former. [18] Zarka, P., Pedersen, B. M., Lecacheux, A., Kaiser, M. L., Desch, M.

In this chapter we will discuss the scienti®c analysis of the Voyager (and subsequent Earth-based data) up to June 1, 2004, a month before the insertion of the Cassini Orbiter and the attached Huygens probe into orbit around Saturn on July 1. In the next chapter (Chapter 10), we will discuss the early ®ndings of the Cassini Orbiter relative to Saturn's ring system. We purposely separate the two sets of observations, in part to emphasize the incredible rate with which understanding of the Saturn ring system (and indeed ring processes in general) is growing. As is often the case, Nature conspires against our complete understanding of the processes operative within the Saturn ring system. While additional observations improve our data set and answer many of our a priori questions, they also reveal myriads of details that call for new explanations. But then, such is the nature of scienti®c exploration. As unsettling as the thought might be to some readers of this book, we may never completely understand the processes operating within Saturn's rings, but we are certainly obtaining a more complete description of their physical characteristics and composition, and our under- standing, while meager, continues to grow. In Section 9.2 we summarize the radial dimensions, orbital speeds and orbital periods, and other radial characteristics of the rings. Vertical structure of the rings, including both physical and optical (including microwave) thicknesses is discussed in Section 9.3. Section 9.4 discusses the third dimension of the rings, namely their azimuthal structure. In Section 9.5 we discuss some of the gravitational mechanisms operating within the rings, along with the tangible outcomes of those interactions. Clear gaps within the rings and eccentric (non-circular) ringlets within those gaps are probably related to gravitational interactions, either with known or yet-to-be-dis- covered moonlets, but this interaction is not well understood; these are discussed in"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Section 9.6. In Section 9.7 we discuss the gases that surround the rings and form an extremely tenuous ring atmosphere. The rings, of course, are actually collections of particles of varying size and composition; while there are no data that resolve the individual ring particles, much can be inferred about individual particle characteristics from the scatteri ng properties of the ri ngs, as we discuss i nSectio n9.8. Sectio n9.9 covers other optical properties of the rings, including color variations and variations in ring brightness with solar phase angle. Thermal properties of the rings are discussed in Section 9.10. Voyager radio data and its implications are discussed in Section 9.11. Evidence for interactions of the rings with Saturn's magnetic ®eld is reviewed in Section 9.12. In Section 9.13 we discuss Earth-based observations of the rings since the Voyager encounters. We summarize in Section 9.14 some of the major remaining unanswered questions before consideration of Cassini data. Finally, in Section 9.15, we brie ̄y outline some of the major scienti®c objectives for ring observations by the Cassini Orbiter. 9.2 NOMENCLATURE AND RADIAL DIMENSIONS OF THE SATURNIAN RINGS In Chapter 2, the discovery of Saturn's rings was discussed in detail. A general qualitative description of the rings was included with that discussion, as was the nomenclature of the individual ring regions. In Table 9.1, adapted from Cuzzi etal. [1], the orbital characteristics and estimated masses of the rings are given. For compar- ison, we also include the inner eight satellites of Saturn known prior to Cassini. The narrow F ring was ®rst discovered by Pioneer 11 during its encounter with Saturn in 1979. The narrow rings of Uranus had been discovered two years earlier, so narrow rings were not entirely new, but their con®ning mechanisms were not yet well understood. So when Voyager 1 discovered two small satellites, Prometheus and Pandora, ̄anking the F ring, it was natural to assume their presence was somehow responsible for gravitationally con®ning the ring material between them to a very narrow radial range. They became the archetypical shepherding satellites (Figure 9.1). It was not long before ring scientists recognized that the gravitational interaction of these two shepherds with the F ring was not nearly as orderly as at ®rst supposed, for the F ring had many irregular structures, including kinks, brighter clumps, and what appears to be braiding (Figure 9.2). Aside from the irregularities at the outer edge of the B ring and in the F ring, the Satur nri ng system seems to have a relatively orderly radial structure. Three types of observations con®rm that general conclusion. In addition to the images from Voyagers 1 and 2, Voyager 1 conducted a two-frequency radio occultation scan of the rings, and Voyager 2 conducted a two-instrument stellar occultation scan of the rings. In its radio occultation experiment, Voyager 1 radiated S-band (wavelength 13 cm) and X-band (3.6 cm) radio signals toward Earth as the spacecraft passed behind Saturn's rings as viewed from Earth. The signals were received by large radio dish antennas on Earth. In each of the stellar occultation measurements, Voyager 2's photopolarimeter (a sensitive light meter) and ultraviolet spectrometer observed the 106 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"light of a star, which, due to the motio nof Voyager 2, appeared to pass behi nd the rings. These occultation pro®les are best displayed by calculating from the measure- ments the amount of ring material needed either to block a portion of the radio signal received at Earth or to reduce the apparent brightness of the starlight measured by the two Voyager optical instruments. Here it is useful to re-introduce the concept of optical depth. An object (or portion of a ring) that completely blocks the radio signal or starlight is de®ned to have an in®nite optical depth; if there is no reduction in the radio signal strength or the apparent star brightness, the object has zero optical depth.

If the optical depth q  0, then I  I 0 , and there is no reduction in the intensity of the signal. If q 1 , then I  0, and the signal is entirely blocked. If the optical depth q  1, the signal intensity is reduced by a factor of 1 = e , or to a level approximately 36.8% of the unblocked intensity. For an optical depth q  2, the signal intensity is reduced by a factor of 1 = e 2 , or to approximately 13.5% of the unblocked intensity, and so forth. One additional factor that must be taken into account is the angle the ray (from the star to Voyager 2 or from Voyager 2 to Earth) makes with the plane of the rings. A vertical ray path through the rings will encounter the fewest possible ring particles during its passage. An oblique ray that is tilted from the ring plane by only a few degrees will generally encounter more particles during its passage through the ring. Optical depth determinations are often corrected for this factor. The simplest correc- tion is to multiply the measured optical depth by the cosine of the angle between the ray and the vertical to the ring plane. The cosine of 0 \u000e is 1; the cosine of 60 \u000e is 1 2 . For the radio occultation experiment on Voyager 1, the radio beam was only 5 \u000e above the ring plane, which corresponds to 85 \u000e from vertical; the cosine of 85 \u000e is only 0.087. There are, however, two circumstances for which a simple cosine correction will not provide a good estimate of vertical optical depth. If the ring is essentially a single particle thick, the variatio nof appare nt optical depth with the a ngle from the vertical has a dierent form, allowing us to infer vertical structure from measurements at dierent opening angles. In such a situation, the projected area of an isolated ring particle does not change, but the projected area of the empty space between the particles is very dependent on the spatial density of the particles and on the ring tilt angle, especially for small tilt angles [2]. On the other hand, if the ring is not perfectly ̄at, but is, for example, corrugated due to the gravitational in ̄uence of a satellite in a slightly inclined orbit, it may not be possible to express the measured optical depths as vertical optical depths. Both of these circumstances may exist at places in the Saturn ring system. Corrugations (bending waves) have been observed in the A ring, and there is reason to believe that the C, B, Cassini Division, and A rings may not be markedly thicker than the diameters of the larger particles making up those rings (see Sectio n9.3). Typical measured optical depths (uncorrected for non-vertical viewing) in the C ring are about 0.1, with some of the narrow ringlets reaching optical depths of about 0.4. Ring gaps, including the Maxwell gap near a radius of 87,500 km in the C ring, the Huygens gap at the outer edge of the B ring (radius of about 117,680 km), the Encke gap centered near 133,570 km in the A ring, and the Keeler gap near 136,530 km radius in the A ring, have essentially 0 optical depth over most of their widths, which range from a few tens of kilometers to several hundred kilometers. Except for the inner third of the B ring, the entire B ring has an optical depth in excess of 1.0, and could not be easily distinguished from in®nite optical depth in many of the measurements.

The E-ring optical depth varies with radial distance from about 0.000 01 near its inner edge to much smaller values at greater distances. 9.3 VERTICAL STRUCTURE IN SATURN'S RINGS The rings lie in Saturn's equatorial plane. That equatorial plane is tilted by 26.7 \u000e to the plane of Saturn's orbit around the Sun. The tilt results in seasons on the ringed planet similar to those o nEarth. O nEarth, the appare nt path of the Su ncrosses our equator every six months, on or close to March 20 and September 20. These crossings are known, respectively, as the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. Saturn circles the Sun in 29.4 years; therefore, every 14.7 years, it also has equinoxes, during which times its rings are edge-on to the Sun. The orbital motion of the Earth is much faster than the orbital motion of Saturn, and the Earth's orbital plane is not exactly the same as Saturn's orbital plane; one consequence of these facts is that viewers on Earth can sometimes view Saturn's rings edge-on three times in relatively quick succession near the times of Saturn's equinox. A triple crossing occurred in the 1995±6 time period, as shown in Figure 9.4. As viewed from Earth, the 2009 Saturn ring plane crossings will be only a single event; the next triple crossing will occur in 2023.These edge-on presentations oer Earth-bound observers the opportunity to study a variety of phenomena at Saturn, including studies of small satellites swamped by the brightness of the rings at other times, studies of faint rings that are otherwise too faint to be seen, and studies of the vertical thicknesses of all the rings of Saturn. The thickness of the main rings cannot be directly observed from Earth, but if one plots their photometric brightness at a variety of tilt angles and extrapolates that brightness to zero tilt angle, the main rings have an eective photometric thickness of about 1 km [4]. This is probably an overestimate of their thickness, since there are several factors that might tend to make the eective photometric thickness much larger than their physical thickness. First, the photometric brightness includes con- tributions from the F, G, and E rings in front of and behind the main rings [5]. Also, as mentioned earlier, the corrugations (bending waves) in parts of the A ring due to the gravitational in ̄uence of Mimas in its inclined orbit make the apparent thickness larger than the actual thickness of the rings. These corrugations have peak-to-peak amplitude on the order of 1 km [6]. Another contributor to the apparent thickness of the rings is slight warping of the ring plane due to long-term gravitational eects of the Su na nd Satur n's largest satellite, Tita n[7]. In addition to the observations from Earth, there are some measurements from Voyager 2 that bear directly on estimates of the thickness of the rings. The Voyager 2 photopolarimeter measurement of a stellar occultation had a radial resolution of about 100 meters in the rings. The outer edge of the A ring cut o the starlight nearly instantaneously, and from that fact the photopolarimeter team were able to place an upper limit of 200 m on the thickness of the outer edge of the A ring [8]. The radio 9.3 Vertical structure in Saturn's rings 111 ] Sec. 9.3"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"occultation measurements of Voyager 1 utilized a coherent radio signal [9] at both the S-band and X-band. Because the signal was coherent, a sharp edge in the rings would create a diractio npatter n[10] that would sweep across the receivi ng statio no nEarth. The spaci ng of peaks i nthe diractio npatter ncould the nbe used to estimate the thickness of the rings at each point where they occurred. The radio science team used these measurements to come up with upper limits of 150 to 200 m on the thickness of the main rings at several sharp ring edges [11]. Furthermore, the additional (gravita- tional?) energy needed to maintain a sharp edge would cause the edge of a ring to be thicker than nearby interior areas [12]. Combining these results with some theoretical considerations associated with the characteristics of wave structures within the rings (see Section 9.5) lead to the conclusion that the thickness of the main rings, at least away from their edges, is betwee n10 a nd 100 m. The extremely low value for the ring thickness has renewed speculation about whether the main rings are essentially a monolayerÐthat is, they may only be a single particle in thickness. In such a situation, the particles, although consisting of a range of sizes, orbit the planet in very nearly a single plane at or near Saturn's equatorial plane. (More will be said about particle sizes and other particle characteristics in 112 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9 Figure 9.4.

Mo nolayer structure may eve nbe preserved i nthe localized corrugated regions where bending waves are found and in the large-scale warping of the ring plane, although in such circumstances the particles would leave the precise equatorial plane. There are several considerations which argue against a purely monolayer struc- ture for the main rings. First, even if the ring particles initially were all in circular, non- inclined orbits, their physical sizes, combined with the fact that particles closer to the planet move with higher velocity than those further from the planet, would lead to occasional interparticle collisions. These collisions will result in non-circular, inclined orbits for the involved particles, increasing the likelihood of future collisions, and a certain amount of randomization of velocities will be maintained by this process, formally known as Keplerian shear. Because of their smaller masses, smaller particles will have their velocities dispersed by larger amounts than larger particles. Thus, because of this Keplerian shear, the rings will tend toward a thickness that is several, but not many, particles in thickness [13]. It is possible that by this process the smaller particles will form a somewhat greater ring thickness than the larger particles [14]. Another consequence of Keplerian shear is that most collisions will also impart a spin to the involved particles that is preferentially in a direction opposite that of their orbital motion, but of about the same angular rate. Another observational fact that must be considered in this discussion is the opposition eect long seen in the rings, in which the rings become distinctly and non-linearly brighter as the phase angle approaches 0 \u000e . Phase angle is de®ned as the angular separation between the Sun and the observer as seen from the target. Earth's full Moon is so bright because of its strong opposition eect near zero phase angle, although a strictly zero phase occurs for Earth-bound observers only when the Moon is in Earth's shadow. This opposition brightening of Saturn's rings has been inter- preted as a reductio ni nshadowi ng, either at a large scale (particles cover their ow n shadows) or at a small scale (particle surface roughness) [15]. The latter is not as likely, especially for particles as re ̄ective as the icy particles in Saturn's ring. Mutual shadowing of ring particles requires that the rings be at least a few particles in thickness. However, other possibilities have recently been found more likely (see Chapter 10). The radio occultation results imply a thin, but not quite monolayer, structure for Saturn's rings [16]. Radar signals transmitted from Earth and re ̄ected by the rings of Saturn also display a tilt angle dependence that is inconsistent with a monolayer [17]. The wider open the rings are, the better they re ̄ect the radar signal back to Earth, and the dierence is larger than the projected area of the rings as seen from Earth. On the basis of the above considerations, it appears that the main rings are extremely thin, less than 150 to 200 m at measured sharp edges and more likely 10 to 100 m in thickness away from those edges. Nevertheless, the thickness is at least several times as large as the diameters of the most numerous ring particles. The thicknesses of the tenuous G and E rings, in contrast, are certainly much larger than 10 to 200 m. Earth-based observations during ring-plane crossings clearly establish the fact that the E ring has a vertical thickness of several thousand kilometers a nd may i nfact i ncrease i nthick ness with dista nce from Satur n[18]. These 9.3 Vertical structure in Saturn's rings 113 ] Sec. 9.3"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"measurements also seem to show a local depression in thickness and an increase in the brightness near the orbit of the satellite Enceladus. That, combined with evidence from the Voyager images of a geologically young surface for Enceladus, has fueled speculation that Enceladus may be the source of, or at least a primary contributor to, the material i nthe E ri ng (see Chapter 10). Pioneer 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 passed through portions of the E and G rings. Each had instrumentation that was able to sense impacts on the spacecraft of large numbers of the micron-sized particles that make up these rings. From the time history of several of these ring passages, investigators have been able to estimate the eective thickness of about 2,000 km for the E ring [19], in reasonable agreement with ground- based measurements, and of about 100 km near the outer edge of the G ring (at 2.88 R S ) [20]. The physical thicknesses of the D and F rings are not well determined. The orbits of Prometheus and Pandora, which ̄ank the F ring, are both slightly elliptical, and their interaction with the F ring leads to an irregular, non-circular shape. It is possible that both the D and F rings are of the same order of thickness as the A, B, and C rings, about 10 to 100 m, or they could be somewhat larger. 9.4 AZIMUTHAL NON-UNIFORMITY IN SATURN'S RINGS The particles in the main rings pass through Saturn's shadow every orbit of the planet, except when the rings are wide open (near the times of summer and winter solstices). Near Saturn's solstices, particles in the A ring are continuously illuminated (see Figure 9.5). The shadow of Satur no nthe ri ngs is dicult to view from Earth-based telescopes because is it generally hidden by the planet. Figure 9.6 shows a view from Voyager 1, when the rings had a very low tilt angle; note that the shadow of Saturn consequently hides a relatively equal portion of each of the main rings. Passage of ring particles through Saturn's shadow causes a drop in temperature of a few degrees. Temperature is one of the few characteristics of the rings observable from Earth that varies with ring longitude. Other thermal characteristics of Saturn's rings will be covered in Section 9.10. One other subtle longitudinally variable characteristic of the rings is easy to describe but much more dicult to explain. The two sides of the ring that extend outward (left and right or east and west) from Saturn are referred to as the ring ansae, a Latin word meaning cup handles. Each ansa (handle) has a near and a far part. Photometric brightness measurements show that the near portion of the left (east) ansa of the A ring is slightly brighter than its far portion. Similarly, the far part of the right (west) ansa of the A ring is slightly brighter than its near portion. This asymmetry was ®rst reported by Camichel [21] and later con®rmed by others [22]. Whatever is causing this asymmetry is apparently occurring at much smaller scales tha nare resolvable from grou nd-based or Voyager data. It seems to peak about 20 \u000e ± 25 \u000e before ring particles cross the observer-to-Saturn line, both on the near and far portions of the rings; the eect seems strongest near a ring tilt angle of about 12 \u000e [23]. Careful analysis of Voyager imaging [24] shows that the contrast between maximum 114 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"9.4 Azimuthal non-uniformity in Saturn's rings 115 ] Sec. 9.4 Figure 9.5.

The Voyager 1 radio occultation experiment also noted some strange behavior in the data from the A ring [25]; the data seemed to indicate the presence of very elongated, aligned structures within the ring. Salo et al. [26], using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, published a possible theoretical explanation of the phenomenon, which involves temporary formation of approxi- mately linear, tilted structures due to gravitational instabilities. Their results seem to be in reasonable agreement both with the positions of minima and maxima and with the dependence on tilt angle.

Some of the structure cannot be explained by the gravitational eects from the shepherding satellites, Prometheus and Pandora, which themselves undergo sporadic and rapid changes in their orbit parameters [28]. Additional data from the Cassini Orbiter were sorely needed to begin to understand this strange ring (see Chapter 10). One of the major surprises of Voyager's ring studies was the discovery of enormous, nearly radial structures (spokes) in the outer half of the B ring. Viewed from low phase angles (with the Sun at the observer's back), features such as those in Figure 9.8 appear as dark markings on an otherwise bright B ring.

They also appear bright against the dark unillumin- ated side of the B ring. But the most startling feature of the spokes is that they seem almost entirely unaected by Keplerian shear; that is, they maintain their shape in spite of the dierential rotation occurring in the underlying B ring. In fact, they rotate, at least initially, at the rate of rotation of Saturn's magnetic ®eld. They seem to appear almost instantaneously, generally (but not exclusively) in or near passage through Saturn's shadow, and last from less than one to as many as three times around the pla net. By i nspectio nof Table 9.1, it is easy to see that the period of rotatio nof Satur n ( \u0018 10.656 hr) is approximately equivalent to the orbital period of B-ring particles about three-quarters of the way out i nthe ri ng. The re ̄ective properties of the spokes are characteristic of tiny micrometer-sized particles. Perhaps these tiny particles are created by high-velocity meteoroid impacts with ring particles and soon become electrically charged (through the actio nof su nlight or by impacts with charged particles trapped in Saturn's magnetic ®eld?). If these particles have low enough mass and high enough charge, they could become (at least temporarily) ``frozen'' in the rotating magnetic ®eld, particularly if that diers only slightly from their normal orbital speed. In addition, electrostatic forces might tend to elevate these tiny particles above the mai nri ng a nd therefore make them more visible to Voyager's cameras. It is safe to say that we still have much to learn about the nature and origin of and the processes acting within and upon the B-ring spokes. Recent observations of B-ring spokes using the Hubble Space Telescope [29] and observations by the Cassini space- craft in orbit around Saturn (Chapter 10) are the ®rst steps in that direction. Other azimuthally variable features in the rings are in general due to gravitational eects. These include wakes at the inner and outer boundaries of gaps or rings, density waves , bending waves , and eects due to the self-gravity of the rings. These will be discussed in more detail in the following section, along with a number of other eects that may or may not be associated with gravitational eects, but cannot presently be associated with other known sources. 9.5 GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION SOF SATURN' SRING S AND SATELLITES Satur nhas more ``regular'' satellites tha na ny other pla net i nthe solar system. Although some of these regular satellites (i.e., satellites with prograde, low-inclina- tion, low-eccentricity orbits) may not be high-density, well-consolidated objectsÐ most of them interact gravitationally with Saturn's ring system. The regular satellites include the classical satellites Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyper- ion, and Iapetus. Prior to any new discoveries by Cassini, the set of regular satellites also included Pan, Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, Epimetheus, Telesto, Calypso, and Helene. The last three of these are co-orbital with Tethys and Dione, whose eects completely mask those of their small companions. Hyperion is also small enough and distant enough that no gravitational eects of Hyperion on the rings have been noted. That still leaves at least 13 satellites that have each made some contribution to the 118 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"structure of Saturn's rings. Apparently, Jupiter's ring structure is aected by only four satellites: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. Uranus has a total of 15 regular satellites, but gravitational interactions with the rings of Uranus have only been identi®ed for a handful of these. Only 6 of Neptune's satellites are regular, and their interaction with the rings of Neptune is, if anything, even more poorly understood than that of the Uranus system. Thus, if we are to understand ring±satellite interac- tions, it is the Saturn ring system that will bring about that understanding. It is not only the scienti®cally richest natural laboratory for ring studies, it is the sole available natural laboratory that will contribute signi®cantly to unraveling the enormously complex ®eld of ring dynamics and evolution. With the exceptio nof some of the smaller satellites which u ndergo some relatively sudde ncha nges to their orbits [30], all of the regular satellites of Satur nhave ®xed orbit periods (the time required for one circuit of Saturn). Even those which undergo changes have stable orbit periods between their brief chaotic episodes. Ring particles have orbit periods which vary with their distance from the planet's center, as can be seen by inspection of Table 9.1. When ring particles are at a distance where their orbit period is a simple fractio nof that of a regular satellite (i.e., 1 2 , 1 3 , 2 3 , 1 4 , 3 4 , etc.), the ring particles are repeatedly nudged in the same direction and at the same point in their orbit. These fractional matches in orbit period are called gravitational resonances . Over time, these resonances result in slight alterations of the ring particle orbits. Initially, the tendency is to change the orbits from circular to elliptical; however, that also increases the frequency of collisions with nearby particles which resists the departure from circular orbits. Several eects of these soft collisions can result: (1) the two colliding particles can stick together, forming loosely-bound larger particles; (2) if one of the particles is already a loosely-bound conglomerate, the collision can break it apart into smaller components; or (3) the collisions can be approximately elastic, with the two participat- ing particles emerging from the collision along slightly altered paths. All of these eects can be combined under the term viscosity , so called because of the similarities between these eects and that of the motions of a viscous liquid. The analogy becomes even more precise when one considers that the motions of the individual particles cannot be tracked, but only the resulting changes in the appearance of the ring. The most apparent result of gravitational resonances is the formation of spiral density waves , in which the outwardly nudged ring particles at a resonance position crowd closer to ring particles at a slightly larger orbital radius. The regions of denser ring population thus created exert a gravitational force on nearby ring particles, and the net eect is to propagate the disturbance in a direction outward from the reson- ance radius in a tightly wound spiral that gets weaker as the density wave gets farther and farther from the resonance radius. The distance between the density crests and troughs and the contrast in particle number density between the peaks and valleys is dependent on several factors, including the mass density (the mass per unit area of the ring material, integrated through the thickness of the ring) of the ring at the resonance radius, the mass and distance of the satellite causing the density wave, and the amount of variation in ring particle velocities near the resonance position. Thus, careful measurements of density waves can lead to a determination of the mass of the 9.5 Gravitational interactions of Saturn's rings and satellites 119 ] Sec. 9.5"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"perturbing satellite, the mass per unit area within that portion of the ring, and an estimate of the distribution of ring particle velocities near the resonance point. If the satellite responsible for the gravitational perturbations of the ring is inclined to the ring plane, a dierent kind of eect is noted. In this situation, the perturbed ring particles move above and below the ring plane, and a bendingwave is created. Bending waves involve vertical oscillations that have periods slightly longer than the orbital period (the oscillation periods of ring particles in density waves are slightly shorter than their corresponding orbital periods). In bending waves, the spiral wave (``corru- gation'') propagates inward toward the planet from the resonance radius, opposite the propagation direction of density waves. Of the close-in satellites, only Mimas, with an inclination of 1.572 \u000e , has a combined mass, distance, and tilt sucient to give rise to identi®able bending waves. Bending waves are thought to be the main contributor (or at least one of the primary contributors) to the visibility of the main rings when they are viewed edge-on. Examples of a density wave and a bending wave, both due to the 5 : 3 resonance with Mimas in Saturn's A ring, were shown earlier in Figure 1.5. Other eects from gravitational resonances are also apparent in Saturn's rings. The 7 : 6 resonance with Janus is responsible for con®ning ring particles at the outer edge of the A ring (compare periods in Table 9.1). The outer edge of the B ring is near the 2 : 1 resonance with Mimas. These two ring boundaries are consequently seven- lobed and two-lobed, respectively. The two-lobed shape of the outer B-ring edge is clearly see ni nimages from Voyager 2 (Figure 9.9), where a noset of about 50 km is seen in the radius of the outer edge of the B ring at two dierent azimuths. The gap at the outer edge of the B ring in Figure 9.9 is called the Huygens gap. Within the gap is (at least) one narrow elliptical ring, possibly presaging an as-yet-undiscovered satellite within the Huygens gap. Note also in the ®gure that ®ne structure in the outer B ring does not match well between the images, although the structure in the Cassini Division to the right i nthe ®gure does ®t well. The cause of the mismatched ® ne structure is unknown. The smallest features in the ®gure are about 7 km across. Embedded satellites ca nalso clear gaps withi nri ngs. I nfact, it is suspected that all clear gaps within the ring system are the result of particle sweeping by a satellite within the gap (see Section 9.6). Nevertheless, prior to Cassini's arrival at Saturn, only one such embedded satellite had been discovered in the Saturn ring system, namely Pan, which orbits Saturn in the center of the Encke gap in the outer half of the A ring. Pan also disturbs the material near the Encke gap, causing waves along its edges with a particular length, much like water ̄owing over a rock in a stream. These waves get longer in material further from the satelliteÐcausing ring material to bunch in radial structures called ``moonlet wakes''. Particles near the inner edge of the Encke gap circle Saturn in less time than Pan; the edge waves and wakes at the inner boundary of the Encke gap thus precede Pan in its orbit. Edge waves and wakes at the outer boundary trail Pan in its orbit. In fact, the wakes were seen before Pan itself (see Figure 9.10) and led to its discovery in Voyager images nearly 10 years after the Voyager encounters [31]. The discovery of at least one other embedded satellite has resulted from the observatio nof edge waves i nthe Keeler gap near the outer edge of the A ring (see Section 10.4).

Voyager and subsequent Earth-based observations of the F ring now seem to indicate substantial evolution of the F ring in both its character and its width. That in turn has led many ring scientists to question whether Pro- metheus and Pandora exert any appreciable forces on the F ring that con®ne its natural spreading; they may not deserve the appellation of F-ring shepherds. 9.5 Gravitational interactions of Saturn's rings and satellites 121 ] Sec. 9.5 Figure 9.9.

In fact, it is fair to say that there is far more structure in Saturn's rings that remains unexplained than there is that we fully comprehend. Examples of features not yet understood are the semi-regular banded structure of the C ring, much of the ®ne-scale radial structure seen throughout the A and B rings, and the irregular structure seen in the outer 1,000 km of the B ring. Some are possibly due to gravitational interaction with as-yet-undiscovered satellites, some may be a consequence of high particle volume density and frequent collisions between those particles, and some could be a consequence of frequent random impacts of interlopers (dust grains, meteoroids, etc.). Some of the structure persists for long periods of time and some is time-variable, but there is much still to be learned before we can claim to have a relatively complete understanding of Saturn's ring system. 9.6 GAP SAND NON-CIRCULAR FEATURE SIN SATURN' SRING S In the previous section, we mentioned the narrow gap at the outer edge of the B ring. There is at least one ringlet in that gap. As can be seen from Figure 9.9, the ringlet is eccentric. Multiple partial rings also exist in the Encke gap in the outer A ring, where Saturn's satellite, Pan, was discovered. In some ways, these partial rings have char- acteristics reminiscent of Neptune's ring arcs or the denser portions of the F ring. It is 122 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9 Figure 9.10. This view of the 325-km wide Encke gap has been stretched horizontally to emphasize the edge waves along the right (outer) edge.

Again, the Cassini Orbiter holds the key to a number of potential discoveries and better understanding of these gap features. There are very few clear gaps in Saturn's rings. Already mentioned are the Encke and Keeler gaps in the A ring and the Huygens gap at the inner edge of the Cassini Division. Additionally, the Maxwell gap in the C ring is a major clear gap within the rings of Saturn. Table 9.2 lists the clear gaps known prior to the arrival at Saturn of the Cassini spacecraft. The table has been adapted from table V of Cuzzi et al. [32]. Note that many of these gaps have one or more narrow, often discontinuous ringlets within them. It also seems likely that each gap has one or more moonlets within it that are in part responsible for clearing the gap. Each may additionally have narrow ringlets whose source may well be debris from the embedded moonlet. By analogy with the Encke gap, edge waves, now known to be gravitational wakes of the embedded moonlet Pan, may be present in each of the gaps. 9.7 RARIFIED GASES IN THE VICINITY OF SATURN'S RINGS It has long been known that water (H 2 O) ice is the primary constituent of the rings of Saturn. Various mechanisms should produce a tenuous atmosphere near the rings that re ̄ects this composition. The primary constituents of such an atmosphere were expected to be hydroge n(H or H 2 ) and hydroxyl (OH). The most direct way to measure such an atmosphere would be with instruments like those on the Cassini Orbiter designed to sense this very thin atmosphere as the spacecraft moved through 9.7 Rari®ed gases in the vicinity of Saturn's rings 123 ] Sec. 9.7 Table 9.2.

Indeed, that is exactly what happened during the Saturn Orbit Insertion time period o nJuly 1, 2004 (see Sectio n10.3) The most extensive pre-Cassini observations of a ring atmosphere were by the ultraviolet spectrometers aboard Voyagers 1 and 2 [33]. The only component meas- ured was Lyman-alpha radiation from atomic hydrogen (H). Because the solar system is full of hydrogen, the radiation from Saturn's rings was a small fraction of the total hydrogen observed, and the estimate of about 360 Rayleighs from Saturn's rings was more or less independent of whether the observation was of the illuminated rings or the unlit face of the rings. It was also independent of the tilt of the rings to the Sun, which was about 3.6 \u000e for Voyager 1 and 8 \u000e for Voyager 2. The hydroge nemissio n intensity dropped o very slowly with altitude above the rings, decreasing by a factor of 2.72 over about 6,000 km and was not observed at distances from Saturn greater tha nthe outer edge of the A ri ng. The source of the hydroge nmay be high-velocity meteoroid impacts on the ring particles [34], the only as-yet-proposed mechanism with high enough temperatures to produceÐfrom the rings themselvesÐthe amounts of hydroge nobserved. A source external to the rings may also be a possible source for the atomic hydrogen. It has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) from the outer portions of Saturn's atmosphere might be dissociated by electrons in Saturn's radiation belts into hydrogen atoms of suciently high energy to escape the planet's gravity [35]. The escaping hydrogen atoms would then lose energy as they encountered the cold ring particles and remain trapped near the rings. However, it is certainly conceivable that the observed hydroge nis simply part of the exte nded hydroge natmosphere of Satur n that surrounds the planet and its rings, and that these early measurements mistakenly identi®ed it as being a part of a ring atmosphere or aected by the rings. A more complete understanding of the ring atmosphere will require Cassini data, both the in-situ data mentioned above and additional remote sensing, and supporting theoretical analyses, most of which are still unavailable as this book goes to press. 9.8 RING-PARTICLE PROPERTIES The beginning of our understanding of the sizes of the ring particles came as a result of the discovery in 1973 that Saturn's rings are strong radar re ̄ectors [36]. Unless the ring particles were at least as large as the radar wavelength (12.6 cm), there would have been no re ̄ected radar signal detected. The rings were expected to be transparent to radar on the basis of failure to observe any passive radio signals from Saturn's rings prior to that date. The transmitted radar signal was polarized, but the re ̄ected signal was largely depolarized. That meant that the ring particles re ̄ecting the radar signal were moderately irregular [37]. The same radar measurements showed a re ̄ectivity for the rings that was inconsistent with silicate (rocky) composition for the rings. Such high re ̄ectivity was consistent only with metallic composition (which was highly unlikely) or with relatively pure water-ice composition. There is evidence in the Voyager and Earth-based data for Saturn ring particle sizes ranging from dust-sized particles of a micrometer or less in radius to embedded 124 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"satellites aki nto Pa nwith a radius of about 10 km. The primary pre-Cassi ni constraints on ring particle size are provided by the radio occultation and stellar occultation data, the observed light-scattering characteristics of the individual rings, analysis of data indicating particle hits on the Voyager spacecraft, and theoretical considerations. The radio occultatio ndata o nVoyager 1 [38] will be discussed i ndetail later (Section 9.12). The dierence in transparency of the rings at the 13-cm and 3.6-cm radio wavelengths provides a measure of the relative abundance of particles in the size range from 1- to 4-cm radius. That relative transparency varies greatly with location in the rings. There is almost no dierence between the X-band and S-band radio transpar- encies of the Cassini Division; this ring segment must have a large population of ring particles greater than 10 cm in radius. The C ring, on the other hand, shows signi®cant dierences and must therefore have many particles in the 1- to 4-cm size range. The B- ring noise levels are higher, and except for its innermost part, little useful data on particle sizes was obtained. Interpretation of radio occultation data, especially those of the B ring, was also made more dicult by the low tilt angle of the rings as viewed from the Earth in 1980. It appears that the greatest dierences between S- and X-band transparencies occur in the outer A ring, implying that it possesses an abundance of particles between 1 and 4 cm in radius. It is also noteworthy that the greatest dierences between optical and radio depths also occur in the outer half of the A ring, which must therefore also have a large fraction of particles under a centimeter in radius. It is possible that at least part of the dierence is due to the low tilt angle of the rings during the radio occultation measurements, combined with the likelihood that larger particles that block the radio signal occupy a smaller fraction of the total vertical thickness of the outer A ring. The D, G, and E rings were detected in neither the radio nor the stellar occultation experiments. The implication is that the D, G, and E rings are dominated by dust-sized particles. The core of the F ring was detected at X-band, S-band, and optical wave- lengths. The radio detections implied a much narrower ring than seen in visible-light images. The F-ring core must therefore contain large particles, but the more extended F-ring structure mainly comprises dust-sized particles, perhaps with a small popula- tio nof larger (but still sub-ce ntimeter) particles. Of course, the data do rule out eve n larger bodies (moonlets) widely separated in ring longitude. Now, lest our readers get the false impressio nthat the particle size distributio ni n the rings is well determined, consider a recent paper by French and Nicholson [39], based o na re-a nalysis of the stellar occultatio ndata by the Voyager photopolarimeter at three wavelengths: 3.9, 2.1, and 0.9 micrometers. In this analysis, instead of analyzing the directly transmitted starlight, they processed the data to calculate that portion of the signal due to the directly transmitted light and subtracted it from the total signal. The remainder was due to light scattered from the ring particles; the sharpness of the angular distribution is set by the largest particles and the breadth of the angular distribution re ̄ects the abundance of smaller, centimeter-sized particles. By assuming uniformity in particle size distribution across major ring regions, they found characteristic particle sizes in the A and C rings that are fairly consistent with 9.8 Ring-particle properties 125 ] Sec. 9.8"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"those derived from the radio occultation data. Their analysis of the B-ring data seems to indicate minimum characteristic diameters of about 30 cm and maximum characteristic diameters of about 20 m. Hopefully, Cassini data will provide better information on particle size distributions within all of Saturn's rings. Both Earth-based and Voyager measurements of color dierences within the main rings make it clear that there are at least small amounts of contaminant mixed i nwith the water ice, especially in (but not limited to) the C ring and the Cassini Division. However, it doesn't take much contaminant to cause the observed coloration, cer- tainly no more than 10% of the ring material and perhaps as low as 1% [40]. The D ring has not been seen in backscattered light (i.e., with the observer between the Sun and the D ring). It was imaged by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 in forward-scattered light (with the D ring between the observer and the Sun). The Voyager 2 image is reproduced in Figure 9.11. The D ring is the only one of the tenuous rings of Saturn (D, G, and E rings) with narrow ring structure, reminiscent of the Uranus dust disk observed by Voyager 2. The source of the radial structure is unknown. From the greatly enhanced visibility which occurs at large phase angles when the ring particles are comparable in size with the wavelength of the light, the particles are thought to be about a micrometer i nradius. The F ring is still somewhat of an enigma. It may be a recent, unusually large collisio nproduct [41]. Detectio nof its exte nded width i nstellar occultatio nmeasure- ments and of only its core in radio occultation measurements seems to imply that there are few centimeter-sized and larger particles away from its central core, but that larger particles exist within that core. The F ring is known to be highly variable on a range of timescales [42]. In particular, the brighter ``knots'' seen in Voyager 1 imaging are not correlated with those seen by Voyager 2, and one bright region in a series of Voyager 2 images generated several new clumps which orbited at dierent rates from the bright regio nitself [43]. I nformatio no nits compositio ncomes primarily from visual imag- ing; its redder color relative to the A ring suggests a larger fraction of silicate material, although that conclusion is somewhat tentative. A better understanding of the F ring needs repeated detailed measurements by an orbital spacecraft like Cassini (see Chapter 10). The G ring does not have the apparent ®ne structure of the F ring and it is much wider and more diuse in character (see Figure 9.12). Showalter and Cuzzi initially concluded that the G ring was composed of a broad (5,000 km) band of ®ne dust grains, which might contain a narrower core of large objects, as had earlier been suggested by Va nAlle n[44], which served as the source of the G-ri ng material. I nthe past, the closest counterpart to the G ring was thought to be the E ring. Several more recent (but still pre-Cassini) papers challenge this view. The G-ring material is con®ned to a narrow vertical layer across its entire width, unlike the vertically extended E ring [45]. It also has a reddish hue, in contrast to the distinct bluish color of the E ring [46]. Impacts on the spacecraft during passage through the edges of the G ring are also incompatible with the narrow size distribution which characterizes the E ring [47]. These results imply that there are larger ring particles across the entire G-ring width and that their composition is distinctly dierent from the water-ice grains that make up the E ring. 126 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The E ring extends from the orbit of Mimas (which orbits at a mean distance of 185,520 km) to a radial distance of at least 483,000 km from Saturn's center and perhaps nearly to the orbit of Titan (orbital radius of 1,221,830 km), as derived from Cassini orbiter data and depicted in Figure 2.14.

The energy absorbed by a ring particle is dependent on several factors: the amount of sunlight that is incident on the ring particle (either direct, re ̄ected, or scattered), the amount of thermal radiatio nreceived from other ri ng particles or from Satur nitself, the total re ̄ectivity ( bolometric Bond albedo , integrated over all directions and over all wave- lengths) of the ring particle, the spin rate of the ring particle, and the size of the particle. The amount of sunlight that reaches a particle is dependent on the tilt angle of the rings (from 0 \u000e to 26.73 \u000e ) and on the optical thickness of the ring region. As one might suspect, the greater the tilt angle, the more sunlight reaches any given ring particle, at least for optically thick rings like the A and B rings. The absolute temperature of the A and B rings is nearly twice as high (90 K to 100 K) when the ring tilt angle is at its highest compared with that ( \u0018 50 K) when the rings are edge-on to the Sun. Contrast that with the temperatures of the C ring and Cassini Division, where measured temperatures are between 80 K and 90 K and almost no temperature variation with ring tilt angle is observed [48]. The probable cause of the uniform temperatures with tilt angle for the C ring and Cassini Division is the low optical thickness of these rings, which probably means that interparticle eects are small. The C ring and Cassini Division particles also have lower re ̄ectivity at visible wavelengths than do the A- and B-ring particles and therefore absorb more of the radiation incident on them. This alone, however, is insucient to explain their higher measured temperatures. I nadditio n, the temperatures must be higher (as observed from Earth [49]) due to the presence of particles that are large enough and slowly rotating enough that little heat is conducted from their illuminated sides to their unilluminated sides. That conclusion seems to be borne out by Cassini observations; moreover, Cassini data may be starting to show us variations in the spin rate of particles from place to place (Chapter 10). The C ring and Cassini Division have essentially the same measured temperatures whether observed from the illuminated or unilluminated face of the rings. The dark faces of the A and B rings are considerably lower (about 56 K [50]) than their illuminated faces, except at very low tilt angles. Particles on the unilluminated face 9.10 Thermal properties of Saturn's rings 129 ] Sec. 9.10"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"generally transition to the illuminated face at least once each orbit around the planet. The lower temperatures imply that the ring particles can cool quickly and heat quickly in response to changing energy input (i.e., they are composed of material with low thermal inertia ) and that they also have highly insulating surfaces that do not allow heat to be conducted clear around or through the interior of the particles. This is also consistent with the observation of substantially lower temperatures in the A, B, and C rings after passage through Saturn's shadow than before shadow entry [51]. 9.11 EARTH-BASED OBSERVATIONS OF SATURN'S RINGS SINCE 1981 There are three primary types of observations of Saturn's rings that have provided additional information on the ring system since the Voyager encounters in 1980 and 1981. These include an occultation of the star 28 Sagittarii by Saturn and its rings in 1989, observations at the time of the ring plane crossings of the Earth and the Sun in 1995 and 1996, and radar observations of the rings from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico from 1999 onward. In addition, there was an extended series of color observations of Saturn's rings using the Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopic observations of the rings using the Infrared Telescope Facility atop Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii. There have also been improved passive radio interferometric measurements of Saturn's rings. Analysis of the 28-Sagittarii occultation is presented in three papers [52]. The apparent size of the star at the distance of Saturn was about 20 km, which represents a lower limit o nthe size of radial features that could be detected i nthe ri ngs. Several occultations by Saturn's rings of dimmer stars were also observed from the Hubble Space Telescope, providing some information on both radial and azimuthal variations i nthe ri ngs [53]. The motio nof Satur narou nd the Su ncauses the Satur nri ng pla ne to cross the Sun once every half-orbit (about 15 years). Depending on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun, the ring plane crosses through the Earth either once or three times near Saturn's equinox, when the ring plane is edge-on to the Sun. As of this writing, the most recent ring-plane crossings of Sun and Earth occurred in 1995 and 1996. Among other revelations, observations near the ring-plane crossing provided new insights into the time-variable nature of clumps in the F ring [54], a better de®nition of particle size distribution in the G ring [55], and discovery of the orbital changes of Saturn satellites Pandora and Prometheus [56]. Relatively high-resolution radar imaging of Saturn's rings was conducted annually, beginning in 1999. These ``images'' (see Figure 9.13) were constructed by plotting the returned radar signal delay time (distance) versus the signal frequency, which is spread out as a result of the orbital motion of the rings, due to an eect known as Doppler shift [57]. The results of several years of observations are discussed by Nicholson et al. [58]. The azimuthal asymmetry of the A ring (discussed in Section 9.4 and Figure 9.7) is even more apparent at radio wavelengths than it is at visible wavelengths, and the positions of maxima and minima are essentially identical in 130 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"both data sets. The radar data also show a similar, but less pronounced eect in the B ring. Hubble Space Telescope observations [59] succeeded in imaging radial spokes within the B ring similar to those seen in Voyager images (Chapter 2 and Section 9.13) and in determining the size of the particles making up the spokes. However, as the ring tilt angle became even higher, the B-ring spokes vanished. This has been puzzling (see Chapter 10).

The image at the top is a sum of 5 days of radar data i n1999. The image is constructed by displaying data in time-of- ̄ight increments, with time delay increasing from bottom to top. The left-to-right dimension is produced by the Doppler-shifted frequencies of the returned radar signal, with frequency increasing from left to right. Note thatÐalthough the A ring is exterior to the B ring (the C ring was not detected) at the top and bottom of the imageÐ since the B-ring particles move more rapidly than the A-ring particles, they have greater Doppler shifts and are exterior to the A ring at the left and right in the images. This leads to four bright ``crossover'' regions on either side where the signals from the two rings add together. Note that it also results i na left-to-right reversal of the ri ngs relative to visible-light images. A pronounced azimuthal asymmetry can be seen: the rings are brighter on the far quadrant on the receding (left-hand) ansa and on the near quadrant of the approaching (right- hand) ansa.

Passive radio-wavelength measurements of the temperature of Saturn's rings have bee ncarried out by several observers [61]. The measured temperature at 1-mm wavelength and longer is signi®cantly lower than that measured at infrared wave- lengths of a few micrometers. These lower measured temperatures are not real temperatures, but are the consequence of the low emissivity of ring particles at radio wavelengths. Emissivity is a measure of the eciency with which a body at a given temperature emits infrared and radio thermal radiation. Generally, the emissivity of a low-re ̄ectivity body is high; conversely, as the re ̄ectivity (albedo) of a surface or array of particles increases, the emissivity decreases. At mid-infrared wavelengths, the physical temperature and measured brightness temperature are essentially the same; the emissivity at those wavelengths is close to 1.0. At wavelengths of a few mm the emissivity and brightness temperature of Saturn's rings drops to about 10% of that at infrared wavelengths. 9.12 VOYAGER RADIO OCCULTATION DATA AND THEIR INTERPRETATION In the view of the general public, the radio observations of Saturn's rings generally came in a distant second to imaging observations. Yet in Voyager's observations, it was the radio occultatio nobservatio ns which provided the highest radial resolutio n data on the rings, which gave the most direct information on ring particle sizes, and which seemed to con®rm the suspected nature of the A-ring azimuthal asymmetry. Details of the Voyager 1 observatio ntech nique a nd theory are give nby Eshlema n et al. [62] and Marouf et al. [63]. Radio occultation observations of the C ring and the Cassini Division revealed dierences between S-band and X-band transparencies that are much smaller than those in the A ring. This is consistent with the observation that optical opacity and (adjusted) radio opacity are essentially identical in these regions. The adjustment is a reductio n(by a factor of 2) i nthe calculated radio depths (opacities), related to the coherency [64] of the radio beam; starlight used i nthe optical occultatio nmeasure- ments is non-coherent. A detailed discussion of ring particle size distributions from Voyager 1's radio occultatio nexperime nt is give nby Marouf et al. [65]. Within the rings, the radial resolution of the radio occultation measurements is approximately 15 km, but for those areas where the Earth-received signal is strong enough, phase matching can be used to remove the diracted part of the signal (which originates from portions of the ring away from the center of the beam), thereby improving the radial resolution to better than 1 km [66]. This higher radial resolution was not possible in the denser inner B ring, where the opacity was signi®cantly larger and the signal strength correspondingly weaker, but resolutions on the order of a few kilometers were achieved. The rings were sampled by the Voyager 1 radio occultation experiment over a radial range that spanned from inside the C ring to beyond the F ring. The ring tilt 132 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"angle (as seen from the radio receivers on Earth) was 5.9 \u000e at the time of the experi- ment. Practically, this small tilt angle limited the sensitivity of the experiment to radio depths from about 0.005 to about 1.0. In the outer half of the B ring, derived X-band radio depths exceeded i nseveral places a value of 1.0, very near the upper limit of sensitivity. For that reason, the Voyager 1 outer B-ring radio opacities are not as reliable as those for the inner B ring and for the other rings; the S-band sensitivity in the outer B ring was much worse. The radio occultatio ndata have also bee nprocessed i nsuch a way as to provide some information on sub-centimeter-sized particles in the A and C rings and Cassini Divisio na nd the distributio ni nparticle sizes i nthose same ri ngs for particles i nthe 1- to 10-meter radius size range [67]. The sharp de®nition of the density waves from radio science data, especially in the A ring, have provided the best values for ring density per unit area and for the masses of the perturbing satellites which give rise to the density waves. I nshort, the radio occultatio nexperime nt produced a wealth of data o n Saturn's rings that not only helped to de®ne the rings but provided a strong basis for the follow-on studies of Saturn's ring system by the Cassini Orbiter. 9.13 INTERACTION SBETWEEN SATURN' SRING SAND MAGNETIC FIELD Gravitational forces by seen and unseen satellites and by Saturn itself probably generate the majority of Saturn's ring features. Saturn's gravity, with the help of meteoroids from outside the Saturn system and mutual collisions between the ring particles themselves, is responsible for the breakup of larger bodies that approach within the Roche limit (see Chapter 1). The oblateness (polar ̄attening) of the planet also keeps the rings and the satellites which interact gravitationally with the rings close to the equatorial plane, thereby increasing the opportunity for particle±particle col- lisions. Particle collisions in turn work toward the circularization of ring-particle orbits and the viscosity eects discussed brie ̄y in Section 9.5. It is also the gravity of Satur nthat creates Kepleria nshear (Sectio n9.3) as ri ng particles closer to Satur n orbit at faster speeds tha nthose farther from the pla net. Nevertheless, there are observed phenomena within the rings that seem to defy the behavior dictated by gravitational forces alone, and it is those we discuss in this section. Pioneer 11 was the ®rst spacecraft to reach Saturn. The spatial density of ions and electrons was measured by Pioneer 11 as it probed to within a range from Saturn's center that corresponded to the middle of the C ring. Inward of about 8 Saturn radii (i.e., just interior to the orbit of Rhea) Pioneer 11 found a plasma that increased in density as one approached the planet and co-rotated with the planet. The charged particles in that ``cold'' plasma were essentially frozen into the magnetic ®eld of the planet, circling the planet around an axis parallel to Saturn's rotation axis in the same amount of time as the planet's rotation, approximately 10 hr 39.4 min. While these charged particles were constrained to revolve around Saturn at the same rate as Saturn's rotation and were further constrained not to move radially inward or 9.13 Interactions between Saturn's rings and magnetic ®eld 133 ] Sec. 9.13"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"outward, their motion in a north±south direction (along magnetic ®eld lines) was less restricted. As Pioneer 11 reached the radial distance of the A and B rings, scientists noted that there was a sudde ndecrease i nthe spatial de nsity of these plasma particles. Apparently the north±south motion of the plasma resulted in its absorption by ring particles, creating a plasma ``vacuum'' above and below the rings. Pioneer plasma scientists also noted somewhat diminished plasma densities near radial distances of about 140,000 and 170,000 km from Saturn's center [68]. These were the radial distances of the F and G rings. Although spin-scan images of the F ring were obtained by Pioneer 11 [69], thus verifying the existence of ring material near 140,000 km, the G ring was not imaged until Voyager 1 obtained an image in 1980. The only evidence for its existence prior to that image was the observations of depleted plasma density at that distance. In spite of the sharp decrease in plasma density inward of the outer edge of the A ring, there are detectable levels of protons and electrons within that region. It is suspected that these protons and electrons come from the impingement of cosmic rays on ring material [70], a conjecture that is consistent with the presence of water ice as the primary chemical constituent of the rings. B-ring spokes (Figure 9.14) are believed to form as meteoroids strike and shatter B-ring particles, spreading the debris across tens of thousands of kilometers [71]. These collisions seem to prefer the shadow region of the rings, which is the region where the highest velocity impacts would occur from Sun-orbiting meteoroids with high eccentricities and inclinations [72]. By some mechanism, possibly the impact of magnetospheric plasma or by the action of sunlight on these tiny particles, they apparently obtain an electrical charge large enough that the dust grains in the spokes are partially frozen in the magnetic ®eld and thus revolve around Saturn without losing their shape for a time. It is interesting to note that ring particles about 3 4 of the way out in the B ring have Keplerian velocities that equal the co-rotational velocities at that distance, so the electromagnetic forces needed to perturb B-ring spoke particles to co-rotatio nare relatively small. The spokes appare ntly dissipate a nd disappear as the particles lose their charge (perhaps as they pass through the ring plane twice each orbit) or adhere to larger particles, and assume normal Keplerian orbits. The correspondence of the position in the outer B ring where Keplerian velocity equals the co-rotatio nvelocity is k now nas a Lorentz resonance . Tiny ring particles slightly inward or outward of the Lorentz resonance radius experience small forces that tend to push them away from the resonance radius. Over time, that should deplete that region of the B ring of dust-sized particles, were they not replenished by other processes. Lorentz resonances also occur at other small-number fractional relation- ships between the ring orbital periods and Keplerian orbital periods. Lorentz forces play a major role i nthe structure of Jupiter's ri ngs (see Chapter 6). Another important electromagnetic eect within Saturn's rings is known as Poynting±Robertson drag. Technically, this is an eect that is due to the absorption and re-emission of sunlight by dust-sized particles, but because light is an electro- magnetic radiation, Poynting±Robertson drag is included in this section. Tiny ring particles orbiting Saturn absorb sunlight from one direction and re-emit that energy in 134 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"a slightly dierent direction, resulting in a net force that, over time, causes the particle to spiral inward toward the planet. Eventually the particle will enter Saturn's atmo- sphere and be lost to the ring system. This process becomes more and more ecient at smaller and smaller ranges from the planet and for tinier and tinier particles, and it is an important factor in determining the eective lifetime of Saturn's (or any other planet's) ring system. 9.14 SUMMARY AND MAJOR UNANSWERED QUESTIONS BEFORE CASSINI The purpose of this chapter has bee nto set the stage for the spectacular data o n Saturn's rings returned by the Cassini Orbiter.

Hopefully, the data we include in this book will whet the appetites of interested readers suciently to cause them to search for the later results that will already have appeared or will shortly appear that further expand on our understanding of the Saturn ring system. The rings of Saturn have been observed for centuries; none of the other ring systems was even known to exist prior to 1977. They have progressed from ignominy to passing familiarity, primarily as a consequence of the Voyager 1 and 2 encounters in 1980 and 1981. By the time the Cassini ring data are fully absorbed and digested, they will be old friends, but like the best of our friends, there will remain many things about them that are still strange and seemingly idiosyncratic. In part, it is the diculty associated with delving into their complexity, and the thrill of recognition that they are slowly but surely helping us to understand the ways of Nature, that endear them to us. The Saturnian rings are evolving on a number of timescales ranging from days to eons. Those changes are not apparent to observers with small to intermediate telescopes, where the bejeweled planet is sometimes seen to have atmospheric storms that come and go, but appears to be surrounded by an unchanging set of rings. But, to a trained observer using Earth-orbiting telescopes or large ground-based telescopes equipped with resolution-enhancing adaptive optics or sophisticated robotic space- craft that carry our eyes and ears to Saturn, the changes in the rings are unmistakable. It is the understanding of those changes that will eventually enable space scientists to extend that understanding to the asteroid belt, to the trans-Neptunian Kuiper Belt, to protoplanetary disks around other Milky Way stars, to spiral structure in the Milky Way Galaxy and other galaxies, and possibly even to clusters of galaxies. Now let us examine brie ̄y each of Saturn's rings, summarizing some of the known and unknown characteristics of each. We know the radial location of the outer edge of the D ring, but its inner edge is indistinct, and the forces which maintain those boundaries are poorly understood. We see radial structure within the D ring, but we do not know what causes that structure, and Voyager and Earth-based data are insucient to show us changes in that structure. Dust-sized particles likely dominate its population, judging by its brightness in forward scattering, but we do not know the thickness of the ring or whether its particles are aected by Lorentz resonance. The mass of the ring is also unknown. The C-ring inner and outer boundaries are known, but the processes which give rise to the sharp drop in ring brightness and optical depth in the B-ring to C-ring transition are unknown. Semi-regular radial structure within the ring remains unex- plained, and the vertical thickness is apparently comparable with that of the A and B rings. The ring appears to have a preponderance of particles in excess of 10 cm in radius, and the fractional abundance of water ice is much smaller than for the A and B rings. Within the C ring are ®ve known gaps, and two of those gaps, named Colombo and Maxwell, contain eccentric ringlets, possibly associated with undiscovered satel- lites. The ring mass is estimated to be about 0.000 000 002 times that of Saturn. Saturn's densest, brightest, and most massive ring is its B ring. It is also the most extensive ring radially other than the tenuous and dusty E ring. While the con®ning 136 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"mechanism at the inner boundary is unknown, the outer boundary is caused by a 2 : 1 resonance with the satellite Mimas, which also gives that boundary a two-lobed shape which turns at the orbital rate of Mimas. There are no clear gaps within the B ring, although the Huygens gap, which contains an eccentric ringlet, is at its outer edge. Water ice is the dominant constituent of the ring, but other material provides coloration. The outer half of the ring is denser and brighter than the inner half for unknown reasons. Before Cassini, there were no complete, high-resolution optical depth pro®les for the outer half of the ring. In the middle of this B-ring outer half, ghostly radial spokes occasionally form, possibly as a result of meteoroid impact with ring particles. Material in the spokes becomes electrically charged, and they appear to be electrostatically suspended above the main ring and rotate at the rate of the magnetic ®eld for a time period of from less than one Saturn rotation to nearly three rotations. The outer half of the B ring also contains a myriad of radial structures of an irregular nature, the cause of which is yet to be deciphered. From the sharpness of the ring's outer edge, its thickness has been estimated to be as small as 10 meters! The ring mass is estimated to be 0.000 000 05 times that of Saturn. Between the B and A rings is the Cassini Division, once thought to be empty, but now known to be ®lled with material totaling about half the mass of the C ring. It contains six known gaps, the innermost (Huygens gap) and outermost (unnamed) of which are more than 200-km wide and contain ringlets. Its inner boundary is con- trolled by a 2 : 1 Mimas resonance, but the source of the sharp increase from the outer Cassini Division to the A ring is not well understood. Like the C ring, the Cassini Division appears to be more polluted with non-icy material than the A and B rings. The outermost of Cassini's main rings is the A ring. Its outer boundary is at the radial distance of a 7 : 6 Janus resonance and is seven-lobed. There are two gaps within the A ring, the 325-km wide Encke gap and the 35-km wide Keeler gap. Pan and several partial ringlets (arcs?) occupy the Encke gap. Most of the known density waves and bending waves lie within the A-ring boundaries. Like the B ring, its dominant chemical constituent is water ice. Between the Keeler gap and the outer edge of the A ring, the structure is irregular, both radially and longitudinally. While some of that structure may be related to the gravitational resonance with Janus that is responsible for the seven-lobed outer A-ring edge, the reasons for and detailed processes operative within that irregular structure are not well understood. Saturn's mysterious F ring is time-variable, both radially and azimuthally. Although the whole width of the ring was seen in stellar occultation data, only the central core was detected by the radio astronomy occultation experiment, implying that there are few particles more tha n1±10 cm i nradius away from that core, at least at the longitude sampled by that experiment. Bright knots within the F ring may be larger bodies that serve as sources for the F-ring material. At one time, it was thought to be radially con®ned by the two satellites which ̄ank it, Prometheus and Pandora, but that now seems unlikely. Its mass and vertical thickness are unknown. The G ring, about 13,000-km wide, does not have well-de®ned radial boundaries or small-scale radial structure. Its mass is unknown, but its vertical thickness is estimated to be between 100 and 1,000 km. Spacecraft data are not consistent with a narrow range of particle sizes, and the ring has a reddish hue, so the G ring is unlike 9.14 Summary and major unanswered questions before Cassini 137 ] Sec. 9.14"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"the E ring in thickness, particle sizes, and composition. Beyond these facts, very little is known about the G ring, including, among other things, its source and its age. The tenuous and extended E ring has been found to have a bluish color, a very narrow range of particle sizes, and a vertical extent that varies with distance from the planet. Its inner edge is near the orbit of Mimas, but it is both densest and thinnest in vertical extent (about \b 1,000 km) near the orbit of Enceladus, which is believed to supply the icy material of which it is composed. The volume density of particles diminishes with increasing radial distance beyond Enceladus. The vertical thickness also increases, reaching a vertical half-thickness of at least 15,000 km near the radial distance of Dione. Although they become optically undetectable before it reaches the orbit of Rhea (about 8 R S ), E-ring particle concentrations centered near Saturn's equatorial plane may possibly exist nearly to the orbit of Titan (about 20 R S ). Estimates of the age of the Satur nri ng system vary from the 4.5 \u0002 10 9 -year age of Saturn to as little as a few tens of millions of years. It is dicult to understand how a ring system as massive as the satellite Mimas could be so ®nely divided through natural processes in time periods from tens to hundreds of millions of years, particu- larly in the absence of an interplanetary meteoroid ̄ux that is thought to have been almost depleted well before that time period. Meteoritic bombardment has other consequences that aect the present composition and structure of the Saturn ring system as well as estimates of its age and evolution. If such bombardment has been ongoing for a large fraction of the age of the solar system, then the composition of the rings should be similar to that of the meteorites, which are not composed of water ice. Eve nfor a moderate ri ng age, it seems likely that the water-ice particles which largely compose the A and B rings should have been coated with dark meteoritic material, but they remain bright and highly re ̄ective. Meteoritic bombardment should also scatter debris across the ring system, yet there remain what appear to be signi®cant radial variations in the colors of the rings. Other processes also act to deplete the rings of material, either ejecting it from the Saturn system, or, alternatively, causing it to fall into the planet. These and other considerations are discussed in Chapter 10 in light of preliminary ®ndings from the Cassini Orbiter. 9.15 CASSINI SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR SATURN RING OBSERVATIONS Cassini ring scientists outlined their primary objectives for Cassini as follows [74]: (1) Study the con®guration of the rings and the dynamic processes responsible for ring structure. (2) Map the composition and size distribution of ring material. (3) Investigate the interrelation of rings and moons, including embedded moons. (4) Determine the distribution of dust and meteoroid distribution in the vicinity of the rings. (5) Study the interactions between the rings and Saturn's magnetosphere, iono- sphere, and atmosphere. 138 Pre-Cassini knowledge of the Saturn ring system [Ch. 9"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Without being speci®c about the observational or analytical methods involved, Table 9.3 outlines which investigations provide a major contribution to the achievement of each of these objectives.

[9] A coherent radio signal is one that is composed of a tightly controlled frequency (from an ultra-stable oscillator). Generally, there are also other controlled factors, such as the phase and polarization of the signal. A coherent radio signal is the radio equivalent of a laser beam i noptics. [10] Diraction is a phenomenon that occurs when a coherent radio or optical beam passes a sharp opaque edge, like a knife edge. The radiation is ``scattered'' in a way that creates (in the case of optical diraction) a pattern of alternating dark and light bands near the edge of the shadow. [11] Marouf, E. A., Tyler, G.

[30] Prometheus and Pandora, which ̄ank the F ring, undergo sporadic and almost instanta- neous changes to their orbit parameters. The precise cause is unknown. This behavior is discussed in the following three articles: French et al. , 2003 [27]; Murray, C. D., Giuliatti- Winter, S. M., 1996, ``Periodic collisions between the moon Prometheus and Saturn's F ring'', Icarus 129 , 304±316; Goldreich, P., Rappaport, N., 2003, ``Chaotic motions of Prometheus and Pandora'', Icarus 162 , 391±399. Janus and Epimetheus very nearly share the same orbit. However, the slight dierence in their orbital periods means that the inner moon will eventually lap the outer moon. The gravitational interaction that occurs when they approach each other slows the inner moon, causing it to move outward, and speeds up the outer moon, causing it to move inward. A recent such exchange was observed by the Cassini Orbiter in January 2006, when Janus's orbital radius decreased by about 20 km and Epimetheus's orbital radius increased by about 80 km, thereby exchanging their designa- tions as the inner or outer member of the pair. The orbit of Janus is aected less than that of Epimetheus because Janus is approximately four times as massive as Epimetheus.

Doppler, who showed that motion of a light-, radio-, or sound-wave source toward (or away from) an observer will cause the observed waves to be shifted to higher (or lower) frequencies. He also showed that the magnitude of the shift was directly proportional to the speed of the source relative to the observer. The Doppler eect is responsible for the apparent reduction in pitch in the whistle of a rapidly moving train as it passes by a stationary listener standing at a railroad crossing. It is also by means of the red-shift (Doppler shift toward longer wavelengths) of light received from distant galaxies that astronomers know that our universe is expanding. [58] Nicholson, P.

A., Tyler, G. L., Eshleman, V. R., 1982, ``Theory of radio occultation by Saturn's rings'', Icarus 49 , 161±193. [64] The amount of radiation received at a radio or optical detector after transmission through Saturn's rings (or other similar particulate target) is a combination of directly transmitted light and diracted (scattered) light from adjacent regions. For non-coherent light (like starlight being viewed through a ring) the two eects are essentially indistinguishable, and the ring appears less opaque than it actually is. For coherent radiation (like Voyager's or Cassini's radio beams or like an optical laser), the diracted light is shifted in frequency or phase relative to the directly transmitted light and thus can be distinguished and removed. For targets with relatively low optical (or radio) depth, the diracted or scattered signal is equal in strength to the direct signal (for both coherent and non-coherent radiation), so the true optical (or radio) depth calculated for the coherent radiation (with diraction eects removed) is twice that of the non-coherent radiation, a fact that must be kept in mind when comparing optical depths derived from non-coherent light to radio depths derived from coherent radio signals. For optically thick rings, multiple scattering or diraction (in which a single ray of radiation ``bounces'' o more than one particle on its way to the detector) may become more important, and the ratio between derived coherent radio and non- coherent optical depths deviates from a two-to-one ratio by some unknown amount.

For the more than two decades since, the Voyager images have remained ®xed in our minds as if frozen in a lightning ̄ash, and it hasn't been until recently that Cassini has shown that these observations represent snapshots of a very changeable, dynamic systemÐwith many features in the rings varying on timescales of years, months, and even days. Cassini has made a number of other new discoveries as well, concerning the ring-particle composition and size distribution, and how they vary from place to place. As this chapter goes to press with less than half of Cassini's planned ring observations being completed, many surprises are yet to come and many puzzles will be resolved. The interaction between the rings and nearby moons includes the physics of spiral waves driven at orbit resonances with moons (see Section 9.5). Cassini has garnered many new observations of these waves (Section 10.3). Related to the interaction between distant moons and rings that causes spiral waves is the case where a smaller, but closer, moonlet aects ring material. The moonlet may even be embedded within the ri ngs (Sectio n9.5), i nwhich case it ca nclear a nempty gap. Detailed a nalysis during the decade after the Voyager encounters did lead to the discovery of one moonlet in the Encke gap, and Cassini observations have now revealed another (Sectio n10.5). The same physicsÐby which the gravity of a local moo nlet actually pushes ring material away from itÐwas once thought to explain how narrow ringlets were con®ned or prevented from spreading out. The term ``shepherd moons'' was applied to moons that straddled and con®ned a ringlet, such as the narrow, stranded and kinky F ring lying just outside Saturn's main rings, because they were thought to act like sheepdogs con®ning an unruly ̄ock of sheep [1]. However, over the years we have realized that the so-called shepherds' mutual interactions make their orbits ``chaotic'', undergoing occasional glitches and jumps [2]. It is likely that the entire"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"region between these moonlets, including the F ring itself and any little shards and small objects that populate the region, is also permeated by orbital chaos rather than stable con®nement. Do these chaotic orbits lead to occasional collisions and new ringlets [3]? Some tantalizing hints have been provided by analysis of old Voyager data, showing formation of new clumps on weekly or monthly timescales [4], and from Hubble Space Telescope observations of new clumps, observed ̄eetingly when Saturn's rings turned edge-on to the Earth in 1995 [5]. Some new Cassini observations are already reveali ng dramatic time evolutio ni nthe e ntire F-ri ng regio n(Sectio n 10.5). Most of the known structure in the rings remains a puzzle; for example, structure having no clear pattern or preferred length-scale ®lls Saturn's B ring and inner A ringÐthe most optically thick parts of the ringsÐand is known as irregular structure . It is only found in the optically thicker parts of the rings; current theories may be able to explain some of it, but certainly not all or even most of it. How opaque is it? What kinds of structures or perhaps buried moonlets lurk in its depths? How does it vary with angle around the rings? Cassini has now conducted nine optimized radio occultations that penetrate nearly all of the densest parts of the rings, revealing new kinds of structure. Moreover, Cassini has observed several stellar occultations that also penetrate this structure along various lines of sight. These results will be discussed i nSectio n10.3. A dierent kind of structure is too minuscule in scale to be directly observed even with Cassini's instruments, but manifests itself indirectly in several ways which are now under study. Section 9.4 describes how the brightness of the A ring varies with orbit longitude; this appearance is thought to result from transient streamers or ``gravity wakes'' [6], formed whe nclumps of particles bega nto collapse u nder their ow nself-gravity but were just as quickly sheared out by their diere ntial rotatio n[7]. These shearing clumps have about the same scale as the ring thicknessÐtens of meters. This dynamical clumping into temporary ``superparticles'' creates small-scale local variances that confuse the issue of what the ``typical'' packing density, or the size distribution, of the actual ring particles are. However, Cassini observations are now starting to constrain the properties of the wake eect, the vertical thickness and packing density, and the underlying ring-particle size distribution, in detail, as we discuss i nSectio n10.3. This gravity-wake eect is connected to the fundamental dynamical question of the collisional or random velocity of the ring particles, which is at the heart of all the dynamics that causes their structure. The collisional velocity is manifested in the ring vertical thickness (Section 9.3) and packing density of the particles, which can, in principle, be constrained in several ways by remote observations. Interparticle col- lisions give the rings a viscous nature (Section 9.5), which enters into all the physics of spiral waves, shepherding, ring spreading, etc. Indirect determinations of the particle random velocities come from a variety of dierent Cassini observations (Section 10.3). Besides deciphering the structure of the rings, we also need to understand the composition of the underlying ring particles. As described in Section 9.8, water ice is the main constituent of the rings [8]. However, the general tawny color of the rings tells us that other materials, i nadditio nto ice, must be widespread, eve nif o nly i ntrace 148 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"amounts. Also, the brightness (albedo, or re ̄ectivity) of the ring particles, as well as their color, does vary from place to place in the rings, indicating that their composition also varies with location [9]. Cassini carries several new capabilities for measuring composition remotely, and its extended tour presents the variety of geometrical opportunities needed to separate out compositional variations from variations in, for instance, abundance or optical depth (Section 10.4). How ring-particle composition varies from region to region can tell us whether the rings formed of material with a uniform composition, or in several possibly over- lapping bands of dierent composition, but we need to understand ®rst if there has been blurring and spreading of material from one place to another. Particles can swap material in collisions, and so parcels of matter with dierent composition can slowly diuse through the rings. More important, probably, is spreading around of material ejected by high-speed impacts onto the rings by interplanetary meteoroids [10] (Sec- tio n10.6). Models suggest this is to be expected a nd is pote ntially a diag nostic of the ring age. These models of the process of meteoroid bombardment ®nd it to be potentially of great importance, but dependent on several poorly known parameters. The impor- tance comes from the fact that the rings have such an enormous area for their relatively puny massÐthe area/mass ratio for the rings is about a million times larger than for, say, Earth. We don't really know what the meteoroid mass ̄ux is at Saturn, unfortunately, but estimates have been made which indicate that the rings might have swept up their ow nmass i nmeteoroids over the age of the solar system! This would obviously change both their dynamics and their composition dramatically. No icy particle could absorb a nequal mass of dark, carbo n-rich meteoroid material without becoming nearly as dark as charcoal (such as the Uranus and Neptune ringsÐSection 11.4). Thus, the fresh, icy surfaces of most of Saturn's ring particles might be telling us that Saturn's rings aren't as old as the solar system after all. In Section 10.6 we review other ways in which Cassini observations will help us understand this process better. A young age for the rings, implied by both their dynamical interactions with nearby moons (Section 9.5) and their evolution under meteoroid bombardment, remains controversial because of many uncertainties in both lines of argument. The arguments are independent, and they both give about the same result, but perhaps this is a coincidence. There are diculties with envisioning just how such a massive ring system could have formed so recently, after all the heavy bombardment of the very early solar system had long since died down. Cassini will help to resolve this issue in several ways, helping to bring the age and origin of Saturn's rings into sharper focus (Sections 10.6 and 10.7). 10.2 CASSINI SPACECRAFT AND MISSION The Cassini Orbiter carried and deposited ESA's Huygens Probe into Titan's atmo- sphere on January 14, 2006, and is the home for all the instruments doing ring observations. The Orbiter is 11 m long and its high-gain telemetry antenna is 4 m across (Figure 10.1). All of its science instruments are fastened to the spacecraft, 10.2 Cassini spacecraft and mission 149 ] Sec. 10.2"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"although some have internal scanning capability. The main investigations for ring observations are the four optical remote sensing (ORS) instruments fastened to the side of the spacecraft, and the high-gain antenna itself. The ORS instruments include the narrow-angle (high-resolution) and wide-angle cameras of the imaging science subsystem (ISS), which ca ntake pictures i nup to 16 diere nt sets of color ®lters; the visible and near-infrared mapping spectrometer, or VIMS, which scans portions of the rings to return relatively coarse images in hundreds of spectral bands at once; the thermal infrared instrument (CIRS), which measures the temperatures of the ring particles as they move from day to night and the lit face of the rings to the unlit face; and an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph (UVIS). UVIS and VIMS are also designed to conduct dozens of stellar occultations by the rings (and planet), in which the brightness of a star is monitored every few milliseconds as it is covered up, or occulted, by the rings or some other target. Because of the tiny eective size of the star, we measure the structure of the rings it shines through on ultra-®ne scales (tens of meters) in this manner. Cassini's four-meter radio antenna not only conducts similar occulta- tions (except that the radio source is on the spacecraft and the receiving equipment is 150 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.1.

Other instruments also contribute to ring science goals in important ways. The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) detects the mass and composition of dust grains in the micron-size range which happen to hit it, especially important for the diuse E and G rings where many of the particles are detectable primarily this way. Moreover, it is hoped that CDA can contribute to determining the mass ̄ux of meteoroids into the Saturn system. While able to measure the velocity, direction, and composition of particles that hit it, the CDA has a very small collecting area, so it tends not to detect many particles. Another instrument makes use of the much larger area of the entire spacecraft as a collector, by measuring a voltage pulse from each pu of charged gas that results when a tiny grain hits the spacecraft at high speed [11]Ðthe radio and plasma wave spectrometer (RPWS) instrument. Finally, several of the other instru- ments on board can infer the presence of nearly-invisible clumps and clusters of centimeter-and-larger size ring particles by the depletions they create in Saturn's Van Allen belts of protons and electrons, and can even measure the faint breath of gaseous atmosphere enveloping the rings when the spacecraft approaches close enough (so far, only once in the mission, as described below and in Section 10.3). The cameras give us the most detailed images of the rings in their full spatial glory; the spectrometers tell us the most about the ring composition, and the occultations give us the ®nest scale samples of ring structure (but only along linear cuts through the rings). It's left to the scientists to put all these bits and pieces together into a coherent story of the rings. Data have only recently started to ̄ow to the science community, and this story is only beginning. Launched in October 1997, Cassini spent its ®rst two years in the inner solar system, during which time it encountered Venus twice and the Earth once to gather the extra orbital energy needed to make it all the way out to Saturn. Cassini passed Jupiter [12] in December 2000, getting a ®nal gravity ``slingshot'' from the giant planet to send it outwards to Saturn. On July 1, 2004, after a nearly 7-year cruise, Cassini arrived at Saturn [13]. Plans went into action which had taken years to develop, in which commands occurring nearly every second of a complex, several hour long, series of events had to unfold in perfect sequence. The spacecraft crossed through the ring plane at a location deemed to be as safe as possible, and reoriented itself into the burn attitude. The burn commenced on time and the engines steered themselves along programmed paths to remain optimally oriented, as Cassini's trajectory was slowly de ̄ected by Saturn's gravity (Figure 10.2). A ``smart'' algorithm monitored the 90- min burn on board, shutting o the engines when it determined that enough energy had bee ndelivered to slow the spacecraft a nd allow Satur nto capture it i nto orbit. All this was done while the spacecraft was out of contact with Earth, with no possibility of ground-based intervention if anything went wrong, and while over a thousand scientists and engineers waited anxiously. This period was the Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) period. The burn was planned to end just after Cassini's closest approach to Saturn. If it was successful, the spacecraft would know it (ground-based scientists still would not) and a carefully pre-planned 10.2 Cassini spacecraft and mission 151 ] Sec. 10.2"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"series of unique science observations would be conducted. During this time the spacecraft would be seve ntimes closer to the ri ngs tha nat a ny other time i nthe mission, so it was an opportunity to conduct unique studies of the rings and the local environment so close to the planet. If something went wrong, the carefully planned science would be scrubbed and recovery activities would begin, to prevent Cassini from sailing right past Saturn and ending the mission. Everything went like clock- work, a credit to years of careful planning by JPL engineers. Cassini entered orbit exactly as planned, beginning its 4-year tour of the Saturn system [14]. The tour is a series of elliptical orbits, all planned years in advance, which carries the spacecraft around to all corners of the Saturn system, allowing the planet, the rings, moons, and magnetosphere to be observed from a wide variety of angles and distances. Viewed from Saturn's north pole, the series of orbits looks like a ̄ower (Figure 10.3a, color section), and indeed each revolution (or rev) is sometimes referred to as a petal. I nFigure 10.3b (color sectio n), we see how the tour petals look whe n viewed from Saturn's equatorial planeÐmany of them are inclined to the equator and 152 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.2. Cassini Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI). Firing Cassini's main engine ``backwards'' slows the spacecraft down, letting Saturn capture it into orbit to begin its 4-year tour of the system (see Figure 10.3, color section). The spacecraft at this time is passing immediately above the huge ring system. After the 90-min burn, the spacecraft turned to make unique closeup observations, looking downward at the rings and sning their atmosphere of faint vapor."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"extend both to the north and to the south. This is necessary to observe the rings, which lie in the equatorial plane, and to study both the north and south poles of the planet. This complex three-dimensional trajectory is made possible by frequent encounters with Saturn's large moon TitanÐlarger than several planets and itself a prime goal of study by Cassini (and of course Huygens). Passing close to Titan provides gravita- tional slingshot impulses which change the orbit trajectory signi®cantly. Small correc- tions are then made using onboard fuel to be sure the next rendezvous with Titan occurs as planned, allowing the next orbit adjustment. All this takes very careful planning and celestial navigation, an astonishing feat by JPL's navigators and mission planners. It took the assembled scientists of the project over two years of discussions and trade studies to select the speci®c con®guration of petals that make up the tour, and another four years of weekly teleconferences by ®ve groups working in parallel, with constant o-line preparation and homework, to debate and decide just what science observations would be the most critical to be done during every hour of every petal, and how much data would be allocated for storage of each onboard until the space- craft could turn to Earth, about once a day, and send it down. This task was complicated because dierent instruments have dierent goalsÐoften to look in dierent directions at the same time, and the total amount of onboard data storage is limited. Several times since the tour was decided on, adjustments have been required for various reasons, requiring scientists to scramble and rearrange the science accord- ingly. As of the publication of this book, the tour was about half complete in duration. One series of inclined orbits occurred in the spring and late summer of 2005, providing most of the ring observations described here; then the spacecraft went into about a year of elongated, equatorial orbits. The ®rst of two ®nal bursts of inclined orbits started in summer 2006. Ring observations, of course, account for only a fraction of Cassini's science return (see http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov for some of the other specta- cular results on the icy moons, the planet, and Titan). 10.3 MAIN RING STRUCTURE Radial structure As mentioned above, one of the major uncertainties about Saturn's main rings has been: Just how much material do the thickest parts contain? For example, during Voyager, the tilt angle of the rings was only a few degrees as seen from Earth and the Sun, so neither sunlight nor Voyager's radio transmission could penetrate the densest regions, and the single observation of a star shining through the rings was limited by noise [15], so we have remained largely ignorant of its properties in many locations. Cassini was planned to arrive when the rings were tilted nearly wide open to the Sun and Earth for two reasons. First, sunlight is more easily able to penetrate the dense B ring, so images and spectra can be obtained from its unlit side. Second, the large opening angle relative to the Earth means that Cassini's radio occultationsÐpassing its radio transmissions at three wavelengths through the ringsÐalso can penetrate the thickest portions of the B ring. Figure 10.4 gives a sense of the very dense central core of the B ring. This same structure is revealed in 10.3 Main ring structure 153 ] Sec. 10.3"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"much greater detail by still-unpublished radio occultation observations. That is, the central region of the B ring is just as opaque to the probing radio waves, and the same slightly more transparent channels are seen within and around it. The meaning of this structure will need to await further analysis. We can also look directly at the unlit face of the rings as revealed in Cassini images, such as shown in Figure 10.5. This image was taken of the north (unlit) face of the rings, and shows how the dense B ring blocks most of the sunlight, which at this time was falling on its southern face, from getting through. The moderate optical depth A ring is of intermediate brightness, and the least optically thick ringsÐthe C ring and Cassini DivisionÐappear the brightest because they are optically thin e nough for us to see through them to the lit particles o nthe souther nface. Spiral density and bending waves One of Voyager's most important discoveries about the rings (see Chapter 9) was how moons create spiral waves which propagate slowly 154 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.4(a). Image of Saturn's northern hemisphere, covered by the shadows of the main rings. (See next page for a dierent enhancement of this image.)"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"through the rings. Each moon has a well-de®ned orbit periodÐthe time it takes to orbit Saturn. In the rings, the orbit period changes continuously with distance from the planet; material closer to the planet orbits in a shorter time. Thus, there is a large, but countable, number of places where the ring-particle orbit periods are a simple integer fraction of some moon's period; these locations are called orbit resonances [16]. At resonances, the small gravitational forces from a moon act repeatedly on the same ring material, and after some number of orbits cause noticeable disturbances in its behavior. These disturbances create condensations of ring material, and the tiny gravitational forces from these condensations generate further disturbances in particle motions which propagate away from the resonance in a tightly coiled spiral that looks like a watchspring (Figure 10.6). Spiral density waves, where the wavelength decreases outwards, are common; moreover, for moons which are also inclined relative to the rings, the resulting up-and-down forcing creates spiral waves of vertical motionÐ corrugated or ̄apping structures called spiral bending waves, where the wavelength decreases inwards (Figure 10.6 shows examples of both). The wave patterns are ®xed 10.3 Main ring structure 155 ] Sec. 10.3 Figure 10.4(b). A brightness-enhanced and stretched view of the same image, showing a very dense central core of material in the B ring, which seems to be cut by a few lower density channels."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"in the frame of reference rotating with the moon which causes them, so ring material, which moves more quickly tha nthe moo ns, actually moves through these wave crests and troughs. The spirals can have multiple arms, depending on the order of the resonance (the number of orbits of ring and moon needed for them to become aligned again). Much of the theory of spiral waves is i nfairly good shape (Sectio n9.5), so their observed properties ca nbe used as powerful tools to measure the properties of both the moon that causes them and the local ring material through which they move. For instance, the local wavelength, or distance between crests, is a measure of the local surface mass density of the rings (grams per square centimeter), which tells us the total mass of the rings. Knowing both this property, and the optical depth of the rings, tells us the typical particle size (because larger particles have more mass per unit area). Or, if we have independent information on the particle sizeÐfor instance, from a radio occultationÐwe can infer the density of the particles and thus something about their composition. Moreover, the amplitude of the waves (their contrast or strength, from 156 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.5. Saturn's main rings from the northern (unlit) face. The dense B ring appears the darkest. The A ring, at left, contains two empty gaps; the most noticeable is the Encke gap. The Cassini Division lies between the A ring and the very dark, and dense, B ring.

From this a nd images of the moon which give us its volume, we can determine the density of the moon (Sectio n10.5). Density waves damp out as they propagate, because their energy of motion is dissipated in collisions between particles at the small random velocities discussed later in this section. The damping length of a wavetrain can thus tell us something about the 10.3 Main ring structure 157 ] Sec. 10.3 Figure 10.6. Spiral density and bending waves in Saturn's rings.

Emerging from the dense crests, these plugs of ring materialÐas long as a freight train and thicker in diameterÐeventually scatter apart as they collide with other particles. Understanding this eect will help us understand the physics that transpires in the dense crests of density waves. 10.3 Main ring structure 159 ] Sec. 10.3 Figure 10.7(b)"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Main ring irregular structure Give nthe complexity of the irregular structure [18] a nd the variety of data required to unravel it, much of which is still under analysis, it's a little early for speci®c advances to be evident. Theoretical advances in this general area have been substantial since Voyager, however. A number of studies have converged on a process called the ``pulsational instability'' or ``overstability'' as an explanation for irregularly spaced, ®ne-scale structure in the rings [19]. This process relies on a combination of viscosity and self-gravity of the ring material, acting in opposition. Self-gravity tends to make dense structures become denser, depleting surrounding regions, but if viscosity increases with increasing density faster than gravity does, viscous diffusion spreads the dense material out again, causing the adjacent regions to become denser in their turn. A number of theoretical models show that very ®ne scale structure can indeed develop if the optical depth is suf®ciently high. The length-scale of the structure is very ®neÐsome tens of ring thicknesses in size, or perhaps a few hundred meters. Also, the models show a transient structure, sloshing back and forth without ever forming a permanent, ®xed patternÐbut always present. In fact, Voyager observations (Chapter 9) had already shown that the ®nest scale structure in the B ringÐthat seen at its outer edgeÐwas not azimuthally symmetric but varied with longitude. Whether this longitudinal variation also implies temporal variation is still not known, and more observations and analysis are needed. It has been suggested that, over time, larger-scale structures might grow or ``anneal'' from the ®ne-scale structure, but models show that the ®ne-scale structure always remains underneath. Cassini observations don't con®rm all these predictions, but there are some interesting correspondences. Figure 10.8 compares two moderately high-resolution images of the lit face of the B ring, showing the irregular structure in much better detail and higher sensitivity than seen by Voyager. The images have the same resolution, and it is readily apparent that there is abundantly more very ®ne scale structure near the outer edge of the B ring than in its center. Moreover, Cassini ISS images taken at SOI, having a resolution of 200 m/pixel, do show ®ne-scale structure in abundance, in several placesÐand preferentially where the ring optical depth is the largest (Figure 10.9, two right panels). At locations only a few hundred km away (Figure 10.9, two left panels), the familiar irregular structure is see nwith a scale of 100 km or more, which e ntirely lacks this ultra® ne structure. So, i nsome ways the data are i naccord with theoretical predictions that viscous overstability (pulsational instability) will occur in only the most optically thick regions; however, we still seem to need a dierent mechanism to generate the longer (few hundred km) scale irregular structure that permeates the B and inner A rings where the optical depth is only a little bit lower. Furthermore, we need to understand why the optically thickest regions of allÐin the middle of the B ringÐdon't seem to show as much of this ®ne-scale structure as regions in the outer B ring and inner A ring, where the optical depth is actually smaller. Cassini radio occultatio ndata a nd stellar occultatio ndata will ultimately co ntribute heavily to unraveling this story, providing higher spatial resolution and multiple cuts across the rings at dierent longitudes and times. However, these data remain in the early stage of analysis. 160 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"10.3 Main ring structure 161 ] Sec. 10.3 Figure 10.8.

In manyÐif not mostÐways, the C ring most closely resembles the Cassini DivisionÐwhich is not at all empty but a ring, of sorts, in its own right. Their similarities are evident in plots of their optical depth as a function of radius (Chapter 9). Both regions contain several empty gaps, and otherwise empty gaps containing eccentric, sharp-edged ringlets. A few of the empty gaps in the C ring are identi®ed with known satellite resonances, but just as many are not. The C ring also contains several ®ne examples of spiral density waves which have no assigned cause [20]. Moreover, the C ring presents us with a quite beautiful and simple, but completely unexplained, series of moderate optical depth ``plateau'' features that are nearly regularly spaced and nearly symmetrically placed about its outer (unexplained) Maxwell gap (Figure 10.10). This structure is also evident in Figure 10.19 [21]. Cassini has obtained a number of images of these regions, has taken several surveys for small embedded moonlets (none have as yet been found), and is starting to do full azimuthal studies to search for telltale structure that might provide evidence for moonlets too small to see directly. Radio and stellar occultations have also begun to sample the region, again with no speci®c conclusions as yet released regarding the cause for this intriguing structure. 10.3 Main ring structure 163 ] Sec. 10.3 Figure 10.9.

Cassini's many stellar and radio occultations, and even the structure in the ring temperature variations, are showing these differences in wonderful new detail, although no results have yet been published. Figure 10.11 illustrates how this works. Occultation traces passing through the rings at different longitudes result in different apparent optical depths, because the ring structure is not uniform. As more occultation traces are made at different longitudes and elevation angles, it is becoming possible to model the horizontal and even the vertical extent of these structures, and ultimately more will be learned about the particle size distributions which make them up as well [22]. 164 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.10.

Even what we see here, imaged from Cassini in an equatorial orbit, is light scattered from rippling vertical structure in the ringsÐspiral bending waves a few km thickÐand vertically inclined rings such as the F ring.

The upper shadow is from the A ring, showing light coming through the Encke gap."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"realized that even other forms of vertical structure in the ringsÐspiral bending waves, inclined ringlets, and so onÐmask the local ring thickness in edge-on observations. The true local thickness of the rings is determined by the small vertical velocities of particlesÐthe larger these are, the higher particles wander in their orbits, the thicker the rings are, and the lower is the volume or packing density of the particles. Theoretical models which include inelastic collisions between particles imply that the ringsÐespecially the opaque rings where collisions are commonÐcan't be more than a few times the size of the largest particles in vertical thickness, and thus that the packing density of particles can't be extremely low. For decades, these dynamical expectations have been hard to reconcile with the opposition eect of the rings (Chapter 9) in which the ring brightness increases sharply when the Sun and Earth line up and sunlight is scattered directly backwards to the Earth (also known as the zero-phase eect). This was originally attributed to a shadow-hiding process, and implied that the particles were widely separated in a low-volume density ring. Another theory emerged, based on laboratory observations, in which the opposition eect is caused by interference of photons which travel along opposite but identical trajectories, which implies that shadow hiding plays no role and thus that the ring volume density does not need to be extremely low [23]. The predictions of these two theories were quite dierent regarding how the eect should vary with the re ̄ectivity of the ring particles. Cassini observations of this eect were planned in order to resolve this diculty. Figure 10.13 illustrates these observations. In Figure 10.13, we see a Cassini ISS image of the rings taken by the spacecraft with the Su nimmediately behi nd it, so the light is directly scattered backwards. This geometry allows photons from the Sun to traverse slightly dierent paths having the same total distance between the rings and the camera, allowing them to add coherently together when the phase angle (the angle between the Sun and the camera as see nfrom the ri ngs) becomes extremely small (i.e., at the bright spot). The test of this eect was whether it would behave the same for particles of high and low albedo, and for rings of high and low optical depth. The VIMS team observed the same geometry simultaneously, and while their spatial resolution is not as good as that of Cassini's cameras, they have a broader coverage i nwavele ngth a nd particle re ̄ectivity which has allowed them to co nclude that hiding of shadows is not, after all, responsible for this eect and, instead, coherent backscattering apparently is ([24]). This reconciles the observations with dynamical expectations, but leaves us with one less way to measure the actual volume density of the rings. Diffuse rings Saturn's diffuse, outlying rings have never been in the spotlight, lacking the exotic structure of the main rings. Yet, they are of profound importance because Cassini spends a considerable time simply crossing through them, and we need to understand the nature and abundance of their particles. Furthermore, these modest structures have become ever more interesting because of their time variations. The E ring : This, for example, is dominated by tiny and short-lived grains; this aspect, plus its association with the unusual moon Enceladus, which Voyager showed to have ̄ow-like structures on its surface, were clues that something perhaps unusual 166 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"was occurring in and around this ring (Chapter 9). Cassini found, months before even getting to Saturn, that the E ring had new surprises in store. The UVIS instrument routinely maps the entire Saturn system for ̄uorescence from atoms which might be degassed from various rings or moons. Between the end of 2003 and March 2004, the UVIS instrument saw a huge increase in the abundance of atomic oxygen in and around the E ring ([25], Figure 10.14). Now that Cassini has discovered active jets and plumes of dust and ice being degassed from the near-surface of Enceladus [26], it becomes easier to understand such time variation as merely a consequence of sporadic eruptions from Enceladus. This is an idea that actually goes back several decades, butÐin the absence of any hard observations of EnceladusÐwas regarded as some- what speculative at the time [27]. Other odd and uncon®rmed features have been seen 10.3 Main ring structure 167 ] Sec. 10.3 Figure 10.13. The ``opposition eect'' is apparent in this Cassini ISS image of the main rings, with the C ring at lower left and the Cassini Division and A ring at the top right. The Sun is directly behind the spacecraft, and the bright spot in the B ring is the directly backscattered light from the Sun. Its small angular size (less than a degree) is an indication of ``coherent back- scattering'' in the grains of the ring particles rather than a measure of their spacing. Images like this were taken to track this bright spot as it moves across the face of the entire ring system. When their analysis is complete we will have a better understanding of exactly how the opposition eect varies from one location to another."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"in or near the orbit of the E ring [28]; perhaps Cassini will be able to con®rm such features during its 4-year tour. G ring arc : Orbiting between the huge, broad E ring and the main rings is the G ringÐthought to be rubble left over from disruption of a former moonlet [29]. Actually discovered by Pioneer 11 from its in ̄uence on Saturn's Van Allen belts, it was ®rst imaged by Voyager (Chapters 2 and 9). Cassini has been watching the G ring carefully prior to encounter, as scientists and mission planners carefully chose and monitored a trajectory for Cassini to avoid being sandblasted by ring particles on our ®rst approach to Saturn. Since that time, the G ring has been observed in a number of geometries. It remains a diuse band of material, in about the same place as see nby Voyager, but seems to have give nbirth to a new featureÐa nazimuthally incomplete arc of debris, concentrated at certain longitudes (Figure 10.15). Probably, whatever still-unseen moonlets remaining within the G ring's diuse coreÐproviding 168 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.14.

The D ring : Lying even closer to Saturn than the C ring, the D ring was glimpsed only once during each Voyager ̄yby. It is composed of a number of faint ringlets, each somewhat reminiscent of the G ring (Figure 10.16). However, Cassini observations 10.3 Main ring structure 169 ] Sec. 10.3 Figure 10.15.

The bright material in the lower image is the inner edge of the C ring.

Moreover, a new kind of regular pattern, which has no explanation, has been seen at the very outside edge of the D ring, just inside the C ring. The particles making up the D ringlets don't contain much mass, so it's not implausible for some impact to have simply blow napart a big boulder i nto rubble that has spread and become eroded to produce dust; however, understanding how the previously dominant ringlet could just vanish so quickly is more dicult. Modeling of absorptio nby local boulders is needed to see if it ca nremove dust i nthe two decades since Voyager, while remaining invisible today. 10.4 RING COMPOSITION AND PARTICLE PROPERTIES Ring composition The composition of the rings is one of their oldest puzzles, and perhaps the most important for establishing their origin (Section 10.7). It has long been known that water ice is abundant in the rings, from near-infrared spectra and microwave observations (Chapter 9). Cassini's VIMS instrument measures spectra at wavelengths from visible through 5 micrometers in the near-infrared; it is at these near-infrared wavelengths where the strongest absorptions due to water ice are found. These observations, most of them still under analysis, clearly show the diagnostic water-ice bands, now in much greater detail than before and with spatial resolution that can show how the ring composition varies with location. In Figure 10.17 [30], we clearly see the diagnostic water-ice absorption bands at 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 micrometers. Laboratory analysis of water ice at low temperatures indicates that pure water ice has a spectrum that looks very similar to the A ring (Figure 10.17a). That is, another weak water absorption feature appears at 1.06 micrometers, and the brightness continues to rise towards shorter wavelengths. However, notice that the other three spectra in Figure 10.17, while also dominated by strong water absorptions, differ at the short wavelengths, with the 1.06-micrometer band disappearing and the spectrum sloping downwards from 1.4 micrometers towards shorter wavelengths. The effect is especially noticeable in the Cassini Division and C ring, regions which had been known to have darker and less-red colors at visible wavelengths (see below). While much more analysis needs to be done, initial indications are that this distinctive spectral shape is evidence for iron, probably in the form of silicates, being more abundant in the Cassini Division and C ring than in the A or B rings. The F ring shows evidence for a carbon±nitrogen-based organic material similar to that seen by Cassini's VIMS instrument on Saturn's irregular moon Phoebe, which is a very dark, comet-like objectÐapparently a refugee from the Kuiper Belt, an ensemble of primitive comet-like objects orbiting outside Neptune [31]. Care must be taken with this sort of analysis, because scattered light from Saturn, having its own spectral properties, can confuse the interpretation. For example, Figure 10.18 (color section) shows a VIMS map of Saturn where the planet's telltale methane absorption features have been colored a reddish pink. The intrinsic ring spectrum at longitudes in the rings which are illuminated by the hulking bright planet (left side) or where sunlight 170 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"traversing the upper atmosphere of the planet along the edge of the shadow is corrupted by atmospheric absorptio n(right side, alo ng edges of shadow). Figure 10.17(c) shows how the strengths of these water-ice absorption features vary with radius near the inner edge of the B ring, which tells us how the ring composition and/or surface grain size varies with location. This variation can be compared with Figure 10.17(b), which shows the ring structure measured by VIMS as a function of radius. These observations (in the SOI time period), showed the unlit face of the rings, thus the inner B ring (outwards of 92,000 km) appears to be about the same brightness as the C ring. Notice that although the ring brightness varies dram- atically from place to place as the amount of material varies (middle panel), the strength of the water-ice features varies only smoothly (lower panel) and, in particular, there is no dramatic change at the boundary between the B ring and C ring. This indicates the composition varies smoothly across this very dramatic boundary in optical depth. Small osets appear to be associated with the C ring plateaus. The new color images obtained by Cassini also contribute to this story. It has been known for about a decade, from Voyager and Hubble Space Telescope observations, that the spectrum of the rings at visible wavelengths rises steeply from the blue to green range, and remains ̄at out through the red, giving them a tan, taupe, color [32]. That is, they are not white, as pure water ice would be. Notice, for example, Figure 10.19 (color section), where Cassini captured both the rings and the nearly pure water-ice surface of Enceladus in the same image. Even to the naked eye, the dierence is noticeable. Whatever it is that gives the rings this tan color can't be a major con- stituent, but it doesn't take much colored material mixed into pure ice to give it a detectable color. Some work has suggested that reddish organic molecules, common in the outer solar system, give the rings their reddish hue. Neptune's large, icy, probably captured moon Triton, for example, appears quite pink [33]. Careful inspection of the full color mosaic i nFigure 10.20 (color sectio n) reveals some areas i nthe ri ngs which look less red than others. Analysis of Voyager and HST observations has previously shown that the ring color varies smoothly across ring boundaries [10], much like VIMS has now shown the strength of water-ice absorption to do. The Cassini UVIS instrument has also mapped the ring spectrum in the ultra- violet, where water has a strong UV absorption edge. Their measurements of the re ̄ectivity of the rings tend to show the ring brightness increasing outwards all through the A ring, which might imply brighter ring particles [25], but must be considered together with inferences from VIMS data where the outermost piece of the A ring appears to be richer in the iron-based silicate ``mystery material''. This is thus an interesting situation, which will require more sophisticated modeling of both observation sets, including the eects of ring-particle packing density and surface grai nsize o nre ̄ectivity i nthe two diere nt wavele ngth regimes. Ring particle sizes A perennial question, as discussed in Chapter 9, has been ``what are the sizes of the particles in the rings?'' The inability to detect the rings in microwave emission during the 1960s and early 1970s led to a belief that the particles were microscopicÐtoo small to emit radio waves. However, their strong radar return ruled that possibility out, and the combination of these two observations implied that they 10.4 Ring composition and particle properties 171 ] Sec. 10.4"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"172 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 (a) Figure 10.17.

The great value of radio observations of the rings derives from this prop- ertyÐthat the scattering behavior of particles at wavelengths close to their size is strongly variable and highly diagnostic. The relative abundance of particles between a centimeter and 10 meters in radius is a key aspect of local ring dynamics and the evolution of ring composition (Sections 10.3 and 10.6). Cassini's Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) observations of the rings were designed to provide this information on a ®ne radial scale. The main antenna transmits pure tones at three dierent radio wavelengths (2-, 4-, and 13-cm wavelength) to Earth when the spacecraft goes behind the rings, or is occulted by them. These radio occultations also study the planet's ionosphere and atmosphere. Small particles block or scatter the shortest radio waves better tha nthe lo ngest waves, so relative dierences in radio opacity between wavelengths can be interpreted as particle size dierences. To date, 12 separate cuts through the rings have been successfully observed, each at three radio wavelengths. Sample results from just one of these are seen in Figures 10.21 and 10.22 (color section), where a single occultation trace through the rings at one longi- tude has been stretched around to resemble a ring; the radial variations and structure are real but only at one longitude. In these ®gures, the opacity of the rings at the longest wavelength is colored red and that at the shortest wavelength is colored blue. Thus, regions appearing red have the most abundant large particles, and regions appearing blue have more small particles. Figure 10.21 shows a global view of the entire main ring system, the white bands represent the dense core of the B ring, which was opaque to radio waves at two of the three wavelengths, so no size information is yet obtainable; further analysis is underway. Notice the similarity of this white (opaque) region to the global view of the densest ring regions seen in their shadow (Figure 10.4). Also notice how the C ring, Cassini Division, and outer parts of the A ring (green- and blue-colored) have the smaller particles. Figure 10.22 focuses on the Cassini Division and A ring; notice how the particle size distribution changes from place to place, with small particles becoming especially dominant towards the outer edge of the rings (increasingly blue color in this ®gure). Rings in the thermal infrared Cassini's CIRS instrument measures thermal infrared emission from the rings across a wide range of wavelengths. At the shorter wave- lengths of tens of microns, the grainy particle surface is a good emitter and the actual temperature of the particle ca nbe directly measured. Figure 10.23 shows how the ri ng- particle temperature varies with locatio ni nthe ri ngs i nseveral differe nt geometriesÐ lit and unlit faces, at low and high phase angles [34]. At a given phase angle, the unlit face is, naturally, cooler than the lit faceÐespecially for the dense B ring. Note also how the C ring and Cassini Division are noticeably warmer than the A and B rings (at low phase angle). This testi®es to the fact that the C ring and Cassini Divisio nparticles are darker. The smooth bumps a nd dips i nthe CIRS data, which illustrate its fairly low spatial resolution, are connected to large-scale variations in the ring optical depth in ways that remain to be modeled, but will help us understand the dynamics of how particles move from one face of the rings to the other. At high phase angles, there is little dierence between the particle temperatures in the C ring and 174 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Cassini Division, and those of the A and B rings; this seems to imply that the particles spin at rates not too dierent from their orbit periods. The fact that the A ring shows the least variatio nacross geometries might suggest that the most rapidly rotati ng particles are found there. Observations of this nature will continue as the Sun sets on the rings, giving us more insights into their vertical structure and local dynamics. Another observation that comes from the CIRS instrument is the emissivity of the particles. At CIRS's longest wavelengths of 0.5±1 mm, the grainy ring-particle sur- faces are no longer guaranteed to be good emitters.

Figure 10.24 is a very preliminary result from the ®rst few observations of this type [35]. Understanding the meaning of the emissivity drop towards longer wavelengths (here plotted as ring brightness temperature) will require more sophisticated models of the ring-particle surfaces. Because CIRS observations of this type, and VIMS observations of the depths of the water-ice features, both depend on surface grain size in dierent ways, it will be possible to distinguish between grain size eects and compositional eects. Because CIRS operates at a longer wavelength than VIMS, it samples more deeply beneath the ring-particle surfaces to see how the abundance of the non-icy material varies with location. The ring atmosphere Even though most of Cassini's observations of the rings must be made remotely, the period near SOI did provide a brief opportunity to sense the ring material in situ , even if indirectly. Cassini carries several instruments designed pri- marily to sample the magnetosphere of Saturn and measure the abundances of different elements in it. As Cassini skimmed across the unlit face of the rings, just after the main burn was complete, a number of these observations were made.

Models of the environment have been developed which explain this interesting result. O 2 is produced by sunlight breaking apart water molecules, but once made, doesn't stick to solid ice very well and is thus exhaled into a ring atmosphere. There might ultimately be some implications for ring composition of such an increase in O and O 2 abundance. 10.5 RINGMOON SAND RINGLET S As discussed in Chapter 9 and Section 10.3, moonlets are intimately intermingled in all planetary ring±moon systems. Those orbiting within and just outside Saturn's main rings are responsible for exciting a large number of spiral density waves, such as those in Figures 10.6 and 10.7, which may be used to determine their mass. Since we now have very good images of these moons giving their volume, we can easily determine their density. All the close-in ringmoons of Saturn have a density about half that of solid ice, indicating they are likely to be loose rubble piles rather than solid icebergs [37]. The multi-stranded F ring : Lying just outside the main rings, the F ring is where the direct interactions between moonlets and ringlets are most evident. ``This is at the top of the list of things we didn't expect to see,'' said Voyager imaging team leader Brad Smith when the kinky, apparently braided or criss-crossing strands of Saturn's F ring were ®rst imaged (Chapters 2 and 9; [38]). The F ring was originally thought to be a ``shepherded'' or con®ned ring, because of the two 100-km moonlets Voyager found to straddle it, a con®guration that had been proposed to explain the narrow, but dense, 10.5 Ringmoons and ringlets 177 ] Sec. 10.5 Figure 10.25.

However, time and new discoveries have chal- lenged this belief (Chapter 9; Section 10.1 [39]). Cassini observations have already revealed that the entire F-ring region is indeed very dynamic and has changed since Voyager. For example, Voyager saw the F ring to be composed of two or three (and sometimes only one) narrow strands, plus a diuse halo that extended out a few hundred kilometers and a faint belt of material that extended inwards, but not outwards, of the strands. Cassini sees at least ®ve strands, with total radial range several times larger than Voyager, and a diuse halo that extends to a full width of nearly 2,000 km (Figure 10.26). 178 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.26.

The suspect object, originally called 2004S6, or S6 for short, was hardly visible at all when ®rst spotted [41], but on subsequent sightings seems to have become a formidably bright clump with a noticeable trail of debris (Figure 10.27 [42]). 10.5 Ringmoons and ringlets 179 ] Sec. 10.5 Figure 10.26 ( cont. )"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Moreover, its orbit seems to be highly eccentric, causing it to careen through the entire F-ring region from its inner to its outer perimeterÐcrossing through the strands in the process and, apparently, colliding with something.

With the occasional glitches seen in the orbits of Prometheus and Pandora being explained by orbital chaos [43], and with dynamical models suggesting even more chaos in the region between them, it's not surprising to see this kind of behavior. How many more of these moonlets are there? Is the entire F-ring region something like a mini-asteroid belt, with constant collisions generating clumps of material which are subsequently swept up by other moonlets? [44]. Its presence right at the edge of the Roche zone makes it possible that accretion might be proceeding, at least until one growing moonlet has an unfortunately violent encounter with another. As time goes by, the inner ringmoon Prometheus, on an eccentric orbit, comes closer to passing right through the F-ring strands itself. This will happen in 2010, but even now it is getting close enough to cause signi®cant changes in the orbits of F- regio nparticles i nits vici nity. For example, Figure 10.26 (left) shows a nexample of ``drapes'' or ``gores'' i nthe F-ri ng regio n(top of image) caused by massive Prometheus merely passing nearby. Dynamical models of this structure are in excellent agreement with the observations [45]. Figure 10.26 (left) also clearly shows Prometheus tearing a strand of material from the F-ring strands. This is not the behavior expected of a moon which is shepherding, or con®ning, a ring. Figure 10.26 (right) and Figure 10.28 show the outer ``shepherd'' Pandora.

Embedded moonlets Late in the planning stages of the Voyager 2 encounter, it became a concern to some members of the imaging team that inadequate attention had been paid to looking for moonlets actually embedded in the rings. An attempt was made to address this, but was concentrated only on two gaps in the Cassini Division which, to this day, have shown no evidence for moonlets [46]. Not until three years after the Voyager encounters was the ®rst key evidence found which led to the discovery of Pan in the Encke gap [47], and Pan itself was not found until 10 full years after the images i nwhich it was discovered had bee ntake n[48] (see Chapters 2 a nd 9). Cassini repeated that sequence of observations in its ®rst few hours in orbit (Figure 10.29). Moreover, after a few months, Cassini discovered another embedded moonlet 182 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10 Figure 10.29.

A small but steady increase in wavelength of perturbations that occur with increasing distance from Pan leads to the fan-shaped ``moonlet wake'' structure inward of the gap, appearing very dierent from the more tightly wrapped spiral density waves nearby [49]. The very same ki nd of edge wave structure is see ni nFigure 10.30, a nd i nfact here the moo nlet Daphnis (arti®cially elongated) is visible in the gap. The direction of orbital motion here is from top to bottom, so material inwards of Daphnis, closer to Saturn, is moving faster and passes Daphnis by, and we ®nd the inner edge wave to lead the moon. Conversely, for the outer edge, material where the waves are seen is actually lagging behind Daphnis and was just passed by it recently. Thus, the edge waves always lie ``downstream'' of the moonlet that causes them; the physics (Chapter 9) is very much like water in a stream ̄owing over a rock, making a ripple pattern that remains ®xed to the rock even as water ̄ows merrily through it. In movies made from images like these, the entire moon±wave pattern is seen moving together [50]Ðthus, at the speed of the moon. The Keeler gap edge waves are more ``peaked'' because Daph nis is o na necce ntric orbit [51]. Notice the several faint ringlets in the Encke gapÐone in the center, at or very near to the orbit of Pan. These contain clumps and kinks that come and go on timescales of days and weeks, and are surely related to bodies orbiting at these locations that are too small to have yet been seen. Several incomplete arc-like ringlets were also seen by VoyagerÐone in the center, as here, and one at a dierent radial location than any of these. Temporal changes are therefore common and frequent in the Encke gap, at least, where no doubt a small family of mountain-sized objects orbits, perhaps chaotically because of their proximity to each other. Searches are underway for similar phenomena in all of the other ``empty'' gaps in the main rings. Even smaller embedded chunks and shards The questio nquickly arises as to what other objects may exist in the rings, with sizes between the largest ``ring particle'' and the smallest embedded moonlets capable of clearing a gap, such as Pan, Daphnis, and their as-yet-undetected cohorts. It was suggested in the Voyager era that such moonlets might perturb the material around them, accounting perhaps for some of the irregular structure in the B ring [52]. The perturbations that even smaller moonlets would exert on surrounding ring material were calculated more recently, and show small local disturbances called ``propellors'' [53]. These structures are, essentially, greatly shrunken versions of the edge wave pattern shown for the Keeler gap moonlet Daphnis in Figure 10.30; simply imagine the moonlet to shrink in size until the gap closes around it, leaving only local perturbations inside (leading) and outside (trailing) the object. The Cassini ISS team has recently discovered precisely such small structures (Figure 10.31, left) and thus inferentially the 100-m size objects responsible for them [54]. The Cassini discoveries were made in two separate images of the unlit face of the A ring in a single set of four of the highest resolution images taken by Cassini, during the SOI time period (Figure 10.2). That even this tiny sample of the rings revealed four 184 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"such objects implies that there are many of them present, on statistical grounds, but unfortunately there are no further Cassini observations planned with resolution approaching that of these images (50 m/pixel). Figure 10.31 (right) indicates that the statistical abundance of these 100-m diameter objects is consistent with a con- tinuous distribution ranging all the way from the largest ring particles (10-m diameter) to the known embedded moons Pan and Daphnis. The distribution is so steep that these shards do not represent a signi®cant fraction of the total mass of the rings, which resides i nthe largest ri ng particles. 10.6 EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES AND TIME VARIATIONS Rings evolve structurally and compositionally. The evolution processes are both intrinsic (viscous spreading, gravitational wakes and possibly radial drift of large objects, and growth and disruption of large particles) and extrinsic (spiral wave torques at resonances with external moons, meteoroid bombardment, and loss of charged grains to the planet). These processes have been reviewed in Chapter 9 and elsewhere [55]. Here we merely sketch how Cassini (and very recent Earth-based) observations have changed our views or opened up new perspectives. Torques between the rings and ringmoons were originally calculated to give a characteristic timescale of tens of million years [1] for reaching the current con®g- uration if the ringmoons started at the edge of the rings. The newly calculated low density for these ringmoons increases these timescales by about a factor of 2. It was once thought that careful measurements of the orbit period of the ringmoons, between Voyager and Cassini, might allow this recession rate to be determined; however, evidence for chaotic interactions between the ringmoons seems to preclude this poss- ibility [2]. Some dynamical models [56] raise the possibility that dierential evolution leads to resonant interactions between ringmoons. The ensuing strong orbital per- turbations lead to mutual collisions and disruption, after which re-accretion would have to occur before the rubble could once again act dynamically as a moon. Alternatively, resonances could tie these evolving ringmoons to more massive, outer moons, halting their evolution. These studies estimated a frustration of outward evolution of the inner ringmoons by some extra tens of millions of years, but this estimate is uncertain and seems unlikely to increase evolution lifetimes to the age of the solar system. Moreover, even if resonant trapping can halt the outward evolution of the ringmoons, there is nothing comparable to halt the associated inward evolution of the ring material, so the presence of the A ring, at least, where most of the density waves lie, remains a puzzle. Meteoroid bombardment A constant hail of interplanetary meteoroids bombards the rings at velocities of tens of km/s, carrying more energy per unit mass than TNT. Ring particles are cratered or destroyed i nthese impacts (so we expect their compositio nto be well mixed), but the impact ejecta don't escape the rings, so material merely gets redistributed. This process is potentially important for both structural and compo- sitional evolution of the rings.

The current observa- tions of the meteoroid ̄ux in the environment of Saturn, by Pioneer 10 and 11, and by Ulysses [57], lie very close to the mass distributio nmeasured at 1 AU, which covers a wider mass range (Figure 10.32 [58]). If the same form of the mass distribution prevails at Saturn (which is uncertain, and the goal of the observations described below), the huge collecting area of the rings means that they absorb their own mass over the age of the solar system. If this is true, it provides a second ``young ring'' constraint as described in Chapter 9, and below. Of the several uncertainties associated with this process, the inbound mass ̄ux is certainly the most profound. Note in Figure 10.32 that the observations don't sample the likely peak of the mass ̄ux. Because of the pointing requirements of Cassini's outbound cruise to Saturn, its CDA instrument wasn't able to improve on past measurements of the interplanetary mass ̄ux [59]. There are several other possible ways to measure this ̄ux, albeit somewhat less directly. All involve observing the consequences of impacts by dierent sized particles in dierent ways, and thus require some process modeling to interpret the observations.

These observations will need to be made late in Cassini's nominal mission, or in its extended mission [60]. An uncertainty here is the mass of dust particles of measurable sizes that are ejected by a give nprojectile mass, a nd their ejectio nvelocities (which determine the fraction that escapes the surface of a moon of arbitrary size); these will depend on the nature of the moon's surface. Also, some Voyager observations suggested that the optically thin F ring itself might be a suciently large target that large bursts of particles might be seen, caused by impacts of 10-cm meteoroids [61]. A number of remote-monitoring observations have been taken to address this goal, but more time and analysis is needed for their study. Spokes : Impacts o nthe ri ngs have bee nadvocated as a trigger for ``spokes'' (Chapter 9). As described in Chapter 9, spoke observations have diminished as the ring opening angle to the Earth and Sun has increased. Both Voyager 1 and 2 encoun- ters, when spokes were prominent, occurred when the rings had a small opening angle. Hubble Space Telescope observations over nearly a decade have clearly shown that the abundance of spokes drops sharply as the ring becomes more open as seen from the Sun and Earth [62]. Cassini approach observations followed this same trend. One suggestio nwas that a vertical distributio nof spoke particles which is thicker tha nthe main ringsÐmaybe only by several timesÐcould explain the observations [52]. However, this hypothesis predicted the reappearance of spokes when Cassini ®rst observed the rings from a small elevation angle in October 2004, and this did not occur. Another suggestion [63] involves the seasonal charging of the rings by sunlight, perhaps (or eve nprobably) i nadditio nto a vertically exte nded layer. Whe nsu nlight hits the rings, electrons are boiled o their surface into a surrounding layer. Thus, the main rings are positively charged and a net electric ®eld exists between them and the surrounding electron cloud. If tiny dust grains are ejected above the rings, perhaps to form a spoke, they become charged by the electrons and pulled back down to the positively charged ring by the net ®eld. This electrostatic vacuum may prevent spokes from becoming visible until the ring opening angle to the Sun is small, weakening this photo-charging process. Cassini has now seen a few faint spokes, at high phase angle on the unlit face of the ring (Figure 10.33). Shortly after this observation in September 2005, the spacecraft bega na lo ng series of equatorial orbits from which it had just emerged as this chapter was written, and a few more spokes have been seen. As time goes on, the solar elevation angle will decrease further, and we will probably see more spoke activity. Surely by the end of the mission, when the opening angle to the Sun will be similar to Voyager geometry, spokes will again be frequent and prominent. By counting spokes (once we start observing them again, and if we can convince ourselves that they are related to impacts) we might be able to infer the impact rate of meteoroids of some sizeÐbut it is not known what size projectile creates a spoke of a give nsize. The curre ntly most popular theory [64] does give such a nestimate (roughly meter-size), but this theory has been challenged recently [65], and thus the whole process connecting an impact with an observed spoke remains controversial. An alternative, but less widely read, model has been proposed for spoke formation 188 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"[66], which ca nalso be triggered by meteoroid impacts. Certai nly, more theoretical work needs to be done to resolve these issues before we can even be convinced that spokes are caused by meteoroid impacts, or use their properties to derive a nimpact rate. Impact ̄ashes : Cassini had also planned a number of observations of a dierent sort, related to impacts, that would not depend on seeing the shadowy, ̄ickering spoke features themselves, but instead detecting the impacts directly. The UVIS instrument is designed for rapid sampling of very hot, ultraviolet light-emitting stars as they are occulted by the rings and planet. It was planned to use this same capability, staring for hours into Saturn's shadow on the rings, where impacts are expected to be the most energetic, to detect ̄ashes of light coming from the hot gas associated with these rather violent explosions. For example, ̄ashes of light have been observed from impacts of Leonid meteors on the Moon [67]. Although over 100 hours of observing time were devoted to these observations, nothing has been seen resembling an impact ̄ash. Furthermore, new modeling of the impact process has found that the hot gas 10.6 Evolutionary processes and time variations 189 ] Sec. 10.6 Figure 10.33.

Plasma waves : A unique and intriguing observation of a new phenomenon was made by the RPWS instrument during the SOI time period, as Cassini ̄ew immedi- ately above the rings. During the 30 minutes or so it took Cassini to traverse the rings, dozens of nearly pure ``tones'' of radio waves with dierent, but well-de®ned, fre- quencies were heard, each for only a few seconds. It has been suggested that these tones are a form of plasma wave, excited by the hot, expanding, ionized plasma of the impact event (remember this hot gas has a temperature of 10,000 K), and traveling along well-de®ned paths that vary with frequency [69]. Counting these events and estimating the areal coverage of the spacecraft's sensitivity, one can derive an impact rate. What is missing is a theory which connects the size of the projectile to the strength of the wave; without such a connection we can't say what meteoroid size is associated with the observed event rate. This is another excellent problem for the future. Ultimately, making use of one, or hopefully several, of these necessarily indirect approaches, we hope to obtai na ®rmer grasp o nthe mass ̄ux of meteoritic material bombarding the rings. Eects of meteoroid bombardment : Meteoroid bombardment has both structural and compositional implications, as discussed in Chapter 9. The primary eect of relevance to Cassini observations thus far is the evolution of ring composition. It was noted [70] that, because meteoroids at Saturn are likely to be rich in carbon and silicate material, only a small fraction of a ring mass, if mixed uniformly into the ring material, could make the particles much darker than they actually are: cosmic ``pollution''. Indeed the ring particles at Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune do appear to be quite dark (see Chapters 6, 7, and 8). This was the second indication of a short ring timescaleÐor young ageÐand is independent of the density wave arguments men- tioned in Section 10.3. Subsequent detailed modeling of how ejecta are absorbed and redistributed withi nthe ri ngs [10] showed that certai ncharacteristic radial pro®les of ring composition would resultÐin particular, the optically thinner, less massive rings such as the C ring and Cassini Division should be more polluted, more closely resembling dark, neutral-colored cometary material (as is the case), and ring composi- tion should vary smoothly across even abrupt ring optical depth discontinuities. These models focused on the characteristic inner edge of the B ring, which is very similar in appearance to the inner edge of the A ring (both structures are also candidates for being maintained by redistribution of meteoroid ejecta [71]). Initial comparisons were with radial pro®les of ring color, which indeed seemed to vary smoothly as the models predicted. Cassini observations by VIMS seem to be supporting this eect. VIMS observes not only a color, but compositional variation associated with speci®c spectral features. Indeed, the C ring and Cassini Division do seem to contain a larger fraction of iron- rich, plausibly silicate, material, and the optically thin F ring shows evidence for C±N- based organics associated with dark material on Phoebe (a primitive, comet-nucleus- like object) [72] and thus also plausibly with interplanetary debris. In Figure 10.17 we showed some radial pro®les of the strength of water-ice bands as measured by VIMS. 190 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The smooth variatio nof these pro®les agrees well with the smooth variatio nof color seen previously. Other VIMS metricsÐsuch as the strength of the iron-(silicate?) featureÐalso vary smoothly across these abrupt boundaries in a similar way. There are a number of parameters in these modelsÐsuch as the mass-to-optical-depth ratio as a function of radiusÐof which Cassini observations of dierent types can ulti- mately improve our understanding. Yet another short timescale It has been suggested that tiny grains, once charged by a number of processesÐperhaps impact events, perhaps photosputteringÐcan quickly spin down magnetic ®eld lines into the planet's upper atmosphere and be lost [73]. This loss process primarily affects the C ring and inner B ring, rather than the A ring as do density wave torques. Like all previous models, it has uncertain parameters, but the best estimates indicate that the entire C ring can be lost this way in some few tens of millio nyears. 10.7 RING ORIGIN The origin of Saturn's rings remains an unsolved problem. It's not so hard to imagine how the ring systems of the other three gas giants formedÐmaybe are re-forming even todayÐbecause none of them represents much mass, so could be created by easy disruptio nof small moo nlets. Moreover, all of their particles are thoroughly as dark as anything else in the outer solar system, so there is no need to create them recently. Saturn's main rings are fundamentally unlike the other three known ring±moon systems in their mass and generally unpolluted icy brilliance. Because of the diculty of retaining their current con®guration for the age of the solar system in the face of several proposed removal and evolutionary processes, the question of origin takes on a modern, rather than a primordial, context. This tends to raise eyebrows and questions, because by several hundred million years ago, the solar system is thought to have left behind the cataclysmic, violent, collisional formation environment of its youth behind and settled down into a calm maturity. The rings have the mass of Mimas, a moon with radius of about 200 km. To break something that size down into rubble, of which Pan and Daphnis may represent the largest fragments, takes an unusually energetic event, and doing it recently is even more dicult because of the rarity of such events. We believe that the large craters seen on heavily cratered solid surfaces in the solar system are ancient, representing a ®nal sweepup of the plane- tesimals, embryos, and minor planets that created the Earth and its family. We expect very few of such large impacts to have happened in ``modern'' times of ``only'' 400±500 millio nyears agoÐthe Age of Fishes here o nEarth. There are two fundamentally dierent parentages one can imagine for the rings, presuming them to be of secondary origin (the debris of a destroyed parent, rather than direct and primordial nebula condensates). Some locally formed moon like Mimas, for example, might have been destroyed by a collision with some incoming projectile [74]. Alternatively, some interloper from beyond the Saturn system might have grazed by Satur ntoo closely, a nd bee ntor napart by its tides [75]. I neither case 10.7 Ring origin 191 ] Sec. 10.7"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"the parent would need to be fairly largeÐprobably larger than the amount of mass currently found in the ringsÐboth to allow for capture ineciency, and to allow it to have dierentiated prior to being destroyed. More speci®cally, Saturn's irregular moon Phoebe is very dark, and looks not at all like the rings. It probably represents a truly primitive objectÐcontaining a mix of primordial water ice, silicates, and carbon-rich tarry organics in roughly equal proportions [76]. Such a primitive object would need to melt, to separate its water ice (along with perhaps some light, reddish organics) into an icy outer shell, with its dark silicate and organic material settling into a denser core perhaps. Saturn's regular icy moons generally look this way. Even Iapetus, under its one soot-covered face, seems to be primarily a bright, white, object with a density very close to that of pure water. As another example, Neptune's major moon Triton is thought to be a captured Kuiper Belt object, and indeed has an extremely bright, icy surfaceÐbut this could perhaps have bee nproduced by heati ng associated with its capture. However, i n recent years, several large, Sun-orbiting Kuiper Belt objects have been discovered which are much brighter tha nthe normally assumed 4% re ̄ectivity [77]. The fact that most of Saturn's icy moons, like the rings, are already very water-rich, for reasons also not well understood, might seem to favor an intrinsic origin. However, a dierence that has been noticed previously but becomes more obvious with Cassini observations (e.g., Figure 10.20) is that the rings are not the same color as the icy moons of Saturn; they are much redder. Is this a hint of a dierent formation environment? Triton is quite pinkÐits visual spectrum in fact is fairly similar to that of the rings. With additional Cassini observations of the composition of the rings, and of Saturn's moons, these dierences will be characterized more carefully. For fun, we note one speculative possibility raised by the Cassini observations of abundant O and O 2 i nthe ri ng atmosphere: Is O 2 recycled again and again in the rings until it ®nally encounters one of the few iron atoms there, and is the ring redness simply rust? 10.8 SUMMARY As of this writing, Cassini observations of Saturn's rings are less than one-third complete. Seven optimized orbits have been devoted partly to ring studies, and approximately thirty-eight more orbits remain in the tour, of which rings observations represent a decent fraction. Furthermore, if all goes well, Cassini is planning an extended mission which will continue until after the Sun crosses the edge-on rings and the north face of the rings is once again lit. Even a moment's thought reveals the depth of return which will bene®t future ring scientists; the two Voyager encounters contained perhaps a few weeks worth of data each, of which the day or two near closest approach of each spacecraft represented the richest part. Each periapse pass of Cassini contains as much data as one Voyager encounter, taken with more and better instruments. Voyager had a single radio occultation (Cassini will have 14) and a single stellar occultatio n(Cassi ni will have about 80). Analysis of the two Voyager encounters required nearly 20 years to complete, and the Cassini data set is nearly 100 times as large and complex. This is partly because 192 Early results about Saturn's rings from Cassini [Ch. 10"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Cassini has entirely new instruments and partly because of the extended and complex orbital tour. The ring scientists responsible for planning these observations are a small and dedicated crew, but the necessity for assuring that the proper observations get designed, taken, and calibrated has taken priority over the fun of analyzing and publishing results once they arriveÐa situation which continues as this chapter is written and will continue for several more years, because ongoing updates to the mission pro®le require ongoing changes in observing plans. It's reminiscent of a line from a popular song relating to poker: ``Never count your money while you're sitting at the tableÐthere'll be time enough for counting when the dealing's done.'' Gen- erations of ring scientists will be playing with the cards dealt by this remarkable mission, still in its early days. 10.9 NOTE SAND REFERENCE S [1] See, for example, Goldreich, P., Tremaine, S., 1982, ``The dynamics of planetary rings'', Annual Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics 20 , 249±283.

[7] Because ring particles closer to the planet experience a stronger gravitational force than their neighboring particles just slightly farther from Saturn, they orbit at higher speeds. This steady variation of orbit velocity with distance from the planet is called dierential rotation, and it leads to collisions which stir the particles. [8] Esposito, L. W., Cuzzi, J.

The images a nd other data from Voyager were a s napshot i ntime of rings whose features vary over intervals of years, and in some cases over months or even days. Occasional observations of these ring systems by the Hubble Space Telescope and other Earth-based observatories provided the ®rst evidence of this variability, and data from the Cassini Orbiter have provided ample evidence of that variability in Saturn's ring system. I nprior chapters, we have made a neort to provide with every major ri ng characteristic an estimate of similar conditions within the ring systems of the other gas giant planets. Because much can be learned about each ring system from such ``comparative planetology of the giant planet ring systems'', we have chosen to gather together in one chapter all such comparisons. These comparisons are organized below under the topics of ring dimensions, ring azimuthal structure, ring-particle character- istics, gravitational interactions of rings with satellites, electromagnetic interactions of rings with magnetic ®elds, ring creation, evolution and age, and unanswered ques- tions. Most of the comparisons will be in text form, although tables and ®gures will be used where they tell the story more clearly. 11.2 RING DIMENSIONS With the exception of the only known blue-tinted rings (Saturn's E ring and Uranus's recently discovered 2003U1R ring, both of which appear to be composed of water-ice particles derived from satellites Enceladus and Mab, respectively), all of the known planetary rings are found within 3.2 planetary radii of the centers of their respective"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"planets (Figure 11.1). Well exterior to these rings whose radial positions and dimen- sions are catalogued in Table 11.1, Uranus and Neptune have dust disks detected by plasma pulses created as they impacted Voyager 2 during and near ring-plane crossing times. All of the rings and dust disks are centered near the equators of their respective planets, or, more precisely, near their local Laplace planes [1], which dier from the equatorial planes due to the combined gravitational eects of the Sun and of large satellites in inclined orbits. Exceptions to this general rule include several of the narrow rings of Uranus which have measurable non-zero inclinations. The inner and outer Gossamer rings of Jupiter derive their material from satellites with inclined orbits, but the ring material is rapidly spread into two disks with zero inclination, a thickness equivalent to the maximum north±south excursions of the source satellites (Amalthea and Thebe), and a higher spatial density of ring particles near the upper and lower boundaries of the two disks. Only a handful of the narrow rings of Uranus and some of the ringlets within gaps in Saturn's rings have non-zero eccentricities, and except for the Uranus Epsilon ring (with an eccentricity of about 0.008), none of these eccentricities exceed 0.002. The outer edges of Saturn's A and B rings are not eccentric, but they are also non-circular. The A ring has seven lobes, and the B ring has two lobes. 11.3 RING AZIMUTHAL STRUCTURE If one discounts the eccentric shape and corresponding width variations of Uranus's narrow rings, only the Saturn and Neptune ring systems show marked azimuthal variations in ring properties. For the Neptune ring system, the primary azimuthal structure is associated with the ring arcs in the Adams ring. As discussed in Chapter 8, the Adams ring arc structure has changed substantially since the Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune in 1989. Saturn's F ring and, to a lesser extent, the G ring show azimuthal variations indicative of the possible presence of ring parent bodies. Several of the narrow rings and ringlets seem to exhibit clumpiness. The enigmatic radial spokes in the outer half of Saturn's B rings are another example of azimuthal ring structure. They will be discussed agai ni nSectio n11.6. 11.4 RING-PARTICLE CHARACTERISTICS The Jupiter ring particles seem to be composed of silicate dust. There may be a few larger particles in the two Gossamer rings, but the Main ring and Halo ring particles are predominantly micrometer and sub-micrometer in radius. Saturn's rings appear to be mainly water ice, with the possible exception of the G ring. The percentage of non- water constituents is somewhat larger in the C ring and Cassini Division than in the A and B rings. Micrometer-sized particles appear to dominate the D and E rings and the B-ring spokes and are present in smaller amounts in the other Saturn rings. The re ̄ectivity of particles in the A and B rings is close to 60%; that of the C ring and Cassini Division is between 30% and 40%.

The two recently discovered rings of Uranus do not follow that general mold. 2003U1R had a distinct blue tint, making it similar only to Saturn's E ring in that respect; its composition may also be water-ice particles blasted from the surface of Mab, which is centrally located in that ring. 2003U2R is redder and more reminiscent of Saturn's G ring, presumed to be mainly silicate in composition. Neptune's narrow rings and arcs are also very dark, again a possible indication of carbon composition, at least of the ring-particle surfaces. The narrow rings of Uranus, the Lambda ring excepted, seem remarkably void of particles smaller than a few centimeters in radius, although a dust band consisting of micrometer-sized particles which permeates all the space between the narrow rings was clearly seen in a single high-phase-angle image obtained by Voyager 2. Radial structure within that dust band is plentiful; the causes for that structure are unknown, as are the mechanisms for con®ning the narrow rings of Uranus. One possibility is that both the con®nement mechanism for particles within the narrow rings and some or all of the radial structure in the dust band are due to small satellites that have not yet been discovered. 11.5 GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION SOF RING SWITH SATELLITE S Orbital resonances between rings and satellites are responsible for features in all four ring systems, with the possible exception of the Jupiter ring system. These resonances occur whe nthe orbital period of a give nsatellite a nd the orbital period of the ri ng particles it aects have a simple, generally low-number fractional relationship to one another. The outer edge of Saturn's A ring occurs at a point where the ring particles complete seve norbits of Satur nfor every six orbits of the satellite Ja nus; that outer ring edge is consequently seven-lobed in shape. Similarly, ring particles at the outer edge of Saturn's B ring complete two orbits of Saturn for each orbit of Mimas, and that ring edge is two-lobed. These strong resonances are known as 7 : 6and2 : 1 inner Lindblad resonances, respectively. Ring particles at the inner and outer edges of Uranus's Epsilon ring are prevented from escaping that ring by a 24 : 25 outer Lindblad resonance of Cordelia and a 14 : 13 inner Lindblad resonance of Ophelia, respectively. A 42 : 43 outer Lindblad resonance of Galatea may not only radially con®ne particles in Neptune's Adams ring, but the 42 lobes caused by that orbital resonance may additionally impede longitudinal spreading of material in the ring arcs from one 8.57 \u000e cell to the next. Three other types of gravitational interactions between ring particles and satellites are noted. Density waves are initiated by orbital resonances that are somewhat weaker than the ring-con®nement mechanisms of the previous paragraph. More than 50 such density waves have been identi®ed in Saturn's A and B rings. A tentative identi®cation was also made of a density wave in Uranus's Delta ring. Vertical tugs by Mimas, whose orbit is inclined to Saturn's equator by 1.51 \u000e , cause so-called bending waves or local corrugations in rings. Thus far, the only identi®ed bending waves in any of the planetary ring systems are located in Saturn's A ring and are caused by Mimas. The 11.5 Gravitational interactions of rings with satellites 205 ] Sec. 11.5"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"third type of i nteractio noccurs whe na satellite is imbedded withi na notherwise continuous ring. If the satellite is massive enough, it can actually clear a gap, such as the Encke gap in Saturn's A ring, which is caused by the satellite Pan. In addition, Pan also gives rise to satellite wakes at the inner and outer edges of the Encke gap. Because of dierential rotation, the wakes on the inner edge of the Encke gap precede Pan in its orbit; those at the outer edge trail Pan. As discussed in Chapter 10, a new moonlet (Daphnis) found in the Keeler gap in the outer A ring also creates wakes along the edge of that gap. Furthermore, there are a number of other structures at the limits of visibility in the A ring that may be wakes of even tinier moons. It now seems likely that all of the empty gaps seen in Saturn's rings are due to clearing by moonlets not yet discovered. 11.6 ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTION SOF RING SWITH MAGNETIC FIELDS Each of the giant planets generates a magnetic ®eld that is populated with ions and electrons which are swept along with that ®eld as it rotates at the same rate as the interior of the planet. The planetary ring systems occupy that portion of space where that magnetic ®eld is generally stronger, but the ring particles orbit at speeds dictated by Kepler's laws, not at the planet's rotation rate. As the ions and electrons ``frozen'' in the magnetic ®eld sweep past the ring particles, there are two results. First, much of the charged particle populatio ni nthat part of the mag netosphere is absorbed by the ring particles, thereby reducing the number density of charged particles. That reduc- tion has at times been noted before the ring itself was visually detected, as in the case of Pioneer 11's discovery of Saturn's G ring. Second, if the ring particles are small enough, their charge-to-mass ratio can become large enough that electromagnetic forces begin to be stronger than gravitational forces, and strange results can occur. Such is the case for Jupiter's Halo ring, where the sub-micrometer ring particles are lifted vertically out of the ring plane, especially at radii which correspond to low-order Lorentz resonances. Such resonances occur where the ratio between the ring-particle orbital period and the rotation period of the planetary magnetic ®eld are related by low-order integers, such as 4 : 3, 3 : 2, 2 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 3, etc. The outer edge of the Halo ring is at the 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance radius for Jupiter; the inner edge is at the 2 : 1 Lorentz resonance radius. As particles in Jupiter's Main ring migrate slowly planetward, they accumulate charge, are broken into smaller and smaller pieces, and then encounter the 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance, where the magnetic ®eld begins to carry them vertically out of Jupiter's equatorial plane. As the particles continue to migrate inward, they eventually reach the stronger 2 : 1 Lorentz resonance and are removed from the ring system entirely. For this mechanism to work eectively, the magnetic ®eld needs to be tilted with respect to the rotatio naxis. I nthe case of Satur n, the tilt of the mag netic ®eld is very nearly 0 (Jupiter's is about 10 \u000e ), and little evidence for vertical accelerations is seen. However, in the outer B ring, the orbital period is very nearly the same as the rotation period of the planet. As clouds of dusty debris are created by meteoroid impacts with 206 Comparative planetology of the giant planet ring systems [Ch. 11"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"ring particles, those micrometer-sized particles can become electrically charged, either by the freeing of electrons through the energy imparted from sunlight (photoelectric eect) or by collisions with and absorption of electrons and ions in the adjacent magnetosphere. The radial ``spokes'' formed by such collisions often follow the rotation rate of the magnetic ®eld for a time, maintaining their radial structure until they lose their charge and are destroyed by Keplerian shear. Keplerian shear occurs because ring particles closer to the planet orbit the planet at faster speeds and in less time that those slightly further out. Uranus's magnetic ®eld is highly tilted to its rotation axis. It is possible that the consequent frequent sweeping of the magnetic ®eld through the rings may, over time, remove a major fraction of the dust and small particles from the ring system. In such a scenario, the dust band seen in the single high-phase-angle image may be dusty debris from relatively recent impacts, and that the dust had not yet acquired sucient charge to be strongly aected by the magnetic ®eld. The highly tilted magnetic ®eld of Neptune ought to have a similar eect on that planet's ring system, but sunlight levels are lower and the magnetosphere there is populated by a much lower spatial density of charged particles. Whatever the reason, the rings do not seem as devoid of small particles as those of Uranus. Another electromagnetic eect operative in all four systems is Poynting± Robertson drag, or Poynting±Robertson eect. Ring particles, especially tiny par- ticles, absorb sunlight from the direction of the Sun and re-emit it in all directions, creating a net acceleration on the particles. This acceleration eventually causes tiny particles to spiral into the planet's atmosphere. The presence of Poynting±Robertson drag is one of the reasons that the present ring systems are believed to be younger than the age of the solar system, perhaps eve nless tha n1% of that age. 11.7 RING CREATION, EVOLUTION, AND AGE The Jupiter ring system is perhaps more completely understood at present than any of the other three ring systems. With its enormous mass, Jupiter's gravitational pull attracts a large number of meteoroids and micrometeoroids. The four inner moons (Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe) appear to be almost constantly bombarded by these objects, and the debris from this bombardment is almost certainly the source of the ring material for the known rings. Much of the material from the larger moonlets Amalthea and Thebe falls back to their surfaces, creating a soil covering (regolith) and slowly burying evidence of older impacts. However, some of it remains in orbit around Jupiter. The more vertically extended Outer (or Thebe) Gossamer ring comes from Thebe, whose inclination is slightly higher than that of Amalthea, which feeds the Inner (or Amalthea) Gossamer ring. As the debris is broken into smaller and smaller pieces by continuing bombardment, they begin to reach sizes small enough that Poynting±Robertson drag begins to move them inward toward Jupiter, thereby creating extended disks, more heavily populated near their upper and lower surfaces because the orbital motion of Thebe and Amalthea causes these moonlets to spend more time near those surfaces.

Like the Gossamer rings, its particles are broken into smaller and smaller pieces by continued bombardment, but because the Main ring is more densely populated, the resultant particles begin to attain charge from Jupiter's magneto- spheric plasma. For most of the particles, Poynting±Robertson drag remains the dominant perturbing force for these small particles, but when they reach the radial distance of the 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance, electromagnetic forces from Jupiter's inclined magnetic ®eld begin to act repeatedly on the particles, vertically forcing them to orbits that are above and below the equator, and a Halo ring is formed. Poynting±Robertson drag continues to push the particles planetward, and they continue to accumulate electrical charge. Whe nthey eve ntually reach the radial dista nce of the 2 : 1 Lorentz resonance, electromagnetic forces completely dominate over gravitational forces, and the tiny particles are either ejected from the Jupiter system or they are propelled into the atmosphere, where they become part of the planetary mass. The relative simplicity and low mass of the Uranus and Neptune rings make their explanations somewhat easier to fathom, although we have not yet identi®ed either their sources nor their con®nement mechanisms (other than a likely con®nement mechanism for the Uranus Epsilon ring). The source bodies may be buried within the rings themselves, hidden by the ring particles, perhaps in much the same way as for Saturn's F ring after the Voyager encounters. In the case of the recently discovered blue-tinged ring of Uranus, 2003U1R, the source of the ring is very likely Mab, which is likely an icy body, bombardment of which has created a relatively unconstrained ring of tiny ice particles. The unnamed ring that extends around (or partially around) the orbit of Neptune's Galatea may be of the same nature as the narrow rings of Uranus, but younger, less well developed, and emanating from a somewhat larger satellite. They are also reminiscent of the tiny moons found in the Encke and Keeler gaps in Saturn's A ring, forming complete or partial ringlets within those gaps. If, as suggested by the occultation data, the Uranus rings are de®cient in small particles, it is possible that the wildly tilted and oset magnetic ®eld of Uranus has aided in sweeping them almost clean of small particles. The lower levels of sunlight and sparser magneto- spheric plasma population at Neptune might combine to reduce signi®cantly the amount of charging of small ring particles and thereby explain why the Neptune rings still retain a more substantial population of tiny ring particles than Uranus. The story for Saturn's rings is even more enigmatic. The extended E-ring is likely generated by water-ice eruptions from the active satellite Enceladus. The particles move inward and outward from Enceladus, and the tiny particles are not nearly as tightly constrained to the equatorial plane of Saturn as are the inner rings. As the ring thickness increases with distance from the planet, its spatial density of particles decreases, and although the ring may extend nearly to the orbit of Titan, it has not been visually detected beyond about half that radial distance. The F and G rings are probably generated from bombardment of and mutual collisions between tiny moons resident within these rings. The Cassini Orbiter has already discovered three such moonlets orbiting within the F ring. Prometheus and Pandora, which at one time were thought to shepherd and prevent radial spreading of 208 Comparative planetology of the giant planet ring systems [Ch. 11"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"F-ring particles, probably assist in gravitationally stirring up the ring particles and perhaps inducing additional collisions, but they apparently do very little to constrain radial spreading of the F ring. The source of material in Saturn's D ring may be dust particles being moved planetward from the A, B, and C rings primarily by Poynting±Robertson drag, but like Uranus's dusty disk of particles, seen only at high phase angles, there is as yet no workable explanation for the very organized radial structure which exists in these two tenuous rings. Saturn's A, B, and C rings contain about the same amount of mass as the 400-km diameter moon Mimas. Dynamic processes occurring within these rings argue for a lifetime that is much shorter tha nthe 4.5-billio n-year age of the solar system, perhaps less than 1% of that age. They are therefore unlikely to be unorganized material left over from the time of Saturn's formation. Furthermore, their intrinsic brightness bespeaks a relatively recent origin. The most likely explanation, particularly for the more massive A and B rings, is the catastrophic breakup of a parent body about the size of Mimas. However, the spectrum of the rings is unlike that of any of Saturn's satellites; the rings appear signi®cantly redder. The origin of the parent body (or bodies) is therefore unknown, with nearly equal numbers of proponents for an exterior origi n(perhaps from the Kuiper Belt beyo nd Neptu ne) or a norigi nfrom a body formed within the Saturn system. The source of the parent body is only one of the major problems facing ring scientists. Neither the unbalanced tidal forces experienced by a Mimas-sized or larger body (to allow for ring-particle capture ineciencies), nor collisions with Sun-orbiting bodies within the past 100,000,000 to 500,000,000 years or so (whe nthe ̄ux of large impactors is thought to have already been depleted), are capable of easily breaking up the parent body into ring-particle- sized debris. 11.8 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS It has been very nearly 400 years since Saturn's rings were ®rst sighted. The other three giant planet ring systems have all been discovered since 1977, a scant 30 years ago. While these more recently discovered ring systems are far from completely under- stood, they present less of a challenge to ring scientists than the A and B rings of Saturn. Mechanisms for generating and shaping and replenishing those ring systems can be envisioned, even in the absence of speci®c observations of the satellites needed to con®ne the narrow rings of Uranus and Neptune. Unless we have badly misjudged the structures and dynamics of these rings, future observations from more capable Earth-based observatories or from properly equipped man-made probes sent to these giant planets will eventually ®nd large numbers of moonlets, some in precisely the right orbits to gravitationally constrain or otherwise shape the known or yet-to-be- discovered rings. While we are beginning to understand these latecomer rings, we have not yet accomplished much more than to scratch the surface of understanding Saturn's ring system. 11.8 Unanswered questions 209 ] Sec. 11.8"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Many of the ``big picture'' problems in Saturn's rings that faced us before the 1980 and 1981 Voyager encounters remain unanswered. For example, what is the origin of the rings, and why are they still unique among known planetary ring systems? Cassini has provided enough insight to enable us to start asking such questions on a more sophisticated level and with greater clarity. However, the new details also require us to understand the present structure better before we can delve into the question of ring origin. At the most basic level, as we have described i nthe foregoi ng chapters, the story of the rings is the story of gravitational interactions between ring material, nearby satellites, and the parent planet. In all four gas giant systems, one ®nds more numerous, more closely spaced, and smaller satellites as one approaches their parent planet, merging into ring systems very close to the planet. Very small satellites (moonlets) are even found sprinkled within the ring systems themselves. This basic characteristic is related to the so-called Roche limit of the planet, discussed in Sectio n1.5. Most of the interaction between Saturn's rings and nearby satellites is tied to the physics of resonant spiral waves, discussed in Section 10.3 and elsewhere in this book. These spiral wave patterns are each driven by repetitive forces from a particular satellite, forces which become signi®cant near speci®c locations (known as orbital resonances) in the rings where the orbit period of the ring material is a simple fraction of the orbit period of the satellite. The tiny self-gravity of the ring material ampli®es these perturbations by the satellite, and a wave is set up which has the shape of a tightly wrapped spiral, whose structure is intimately related to the physics which creates the arms of spiral galaxies. Smaller, but closer, moonlets aect ring material in a related, but somewhat dierent manner. The moonlet may even be embedded within the rings. The in ̄uence of a nearby moonlet comes almost entirely as it passes by a section of a ring, and is often described as a gravitational impulse. The eect of these gravitational impulses on the ring is to create patterns which transfer angular momentum between the moonlet and the ring material, and in this case the ring material recedes from the moonlet, causing a nearly empty gap to form. As of this writing, two such moonlets have been identi®ed; Pan is responsible for the Encke gap in the A ring, and a smaller moonlet by the name of Daphnis has cleared ring material from the narrower Keeler gap near the outer edge of the A ring. Still smaller moo nlets, all less tha na kilometer i ndiameter, are appare ntly imbedded within the A and B rings. While these moonlets do not have enough mass to clear gaps within the rings and are not large enough to be resolved in images, they do create local disturbances which can be seen in the highest resolution images of the rings. In the same way that gap-clearing moonlets create nearby wakes at the edges of the gaps they clear, these smaller moonlets create short-lived wakes that move ahead of the moonlet on the planetward side of the moonlet and others that trail the moonlet o nthe outward side. The ring particles, all orbiting Saturn at speeds faster than a ri ̄e bullet, move only very slowly with respect to their neighbors; they are essentially ̄ying in formation.

Just as the viscosity of a ̄uid determines how it ̄ows, the viscosity of the rings determines how they evolveÐit enters into all the physics of spiral waves, shepherding, ring spreading, etc. The ring viscosity is most closely related to the random velocity between particles. Determina- tion of this important local property is of great importance, but it can only be determined indirectly, because it is highly unlikely that we will ever measure the millimeter-per-second random velocity of any individual ring particle directly. Some indirect determinations of the particle random velocities have been possible, as discussed i nSectio n10.3. There are numerous other features in the ring systems whose structure, evolution, and/or history are not understood. The causes of the so-called irregular structure, found primarily in the inner half of Saturn's B ring, are not understood, although at least one somewhat esoteric explanation has been attempted [2]. The ®ne-scale radial structure in Saturn's D ring and the dusty ring disk of Uranus has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Most of the radial structure in the C ring is unexplained. For that matter, the unexplained features in the A and B rings far outnumber those for which a clear explanation exists. Certainly, some of the structure is due to small moonlets not yet discovered in the rings. At present, there is no de®nitive dividing line between embedded moonlets and large ring particles, and indeed there may be a continuum of sizes from Pan and Daphnis all the way down to sub-micrometer ring particles. It would be helpful to have a better understanding of ring-particle size distribution and interaction, especially in the optically thick A and B rings. It is clear that the remaining years of the Cassini Orbiter mission (including a likely extended mission) will provide enormous quantities of ring data that bear on the unknowns in Saturn's ring system; some of those data will shed light on the unanswered questions about structure, evolutionary processes, and ages of the ring system, and we will be much wiser about it tha nwe are at this time. It is equally clear that, eve nafter decades of analysis of Cassini ring data, there will remain mysteries in what is observed that will beg for more data, both observational and theoretical. Perhaps you, dear reader, will be one of those whose ̄ash of insight will lead to a breakthrough in understanding these beautiful, but unfathomably complex jewels of the solar system. 11.9 NOTE SAND REFERENCE S [1] The local Laplace plane, as applied to ring material, is the near-equatorial plane as altered by the gravitational eects of the Sun and large satellites (such as Saturn's Titan). For an inclined ring (such as the 4, 5, and 6 rings of Uranus), ring precession keeps the ``average'' plane of each ring at the local Laplace plane. Very near the giant planets, the local Laplace plane is essentially identical to the planet's equatorial plane. Farther out, the local Laplace plane generally departs from the equatorial plane in the direction of the planet's orbital plane.

It has been, in a sense, a labor of love for us to produce the book. All three of the authors have been intimately involved in the NASA space program for essentially the duration of our professional careers. Although only one of us is a recognized expert on planetary ring systems, as those of you who have browsed through the lists of authors in the cited references at the end of each chapter have undoubtedly already realized, all three of us have a love of the space program and a desire to communicate these ®ndings to both general and scienti®c audiences. In this ®nal chapter, we glance toward the horizon to see what lies ahead in the way of observations and theoretical studies that may help scientists to further unravel the complexity of planetary ring systems. The realm of many-body dynamics is not limited to planetary ring studies, of course, and signi®cant inputs can be expected from researchers in galactic studies and the other ®elds mentioned in Chapter 1. One interesting implication for spiral structure in galaxies has come from a better understanding of density waves in Saturn's rings. Like water in waves at the seashore, individual ring particles (and, by analogy, stars in a galactic spiral arm) do not move at the same rate as the spiral density waves seen in the images. Density waves in a planetary ring move around the planet at the same rate as the satellite whose gravity generates the density wave; the individual ring particles circle the planet much faster. It is possible that stars i na spiral galaxy similarly circle the galactic ce nter at velocities greater tha nthat of the spiral arms i nwhich they temporarily reside. If that were not so, dierential rotation would eventually destroy both the spiral density waves in rings and the spiral arms in galaxies. In a similar fashion, continued theoretical and observational ring studies (and studies of more extensive disks elsewhere in the solar system, the Milky Way Galaxy,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"and the universe) will with time bring more complete understanding of the dynamics of and other physical processes operating within celestial disks. That in turn will bring insights into disk origins and evolution, perhaps including the origin and evolution of the protoplanetary disk that once surrounded the Sun and from which its planets formed. By far the most signi®cant in ̄ux of new data within the next few years will be the continued data return of the Cassini Mission from Saturn orbit. As mentioned in Chapter 10, Saturn ring studies will continue to be an important part of the Cassini objectives and data return, especially during the next few years when Cassini moves from near-equatorial orbits to near-polar orbits, where better ring viewing will be available. Of particular interest will be the next Saturn equinox, where the rings will transit through zero tilt as seen from the Sun and the northern face of the rings will be illuminated by the Sun for the ®rst time in nearly 15 years. That transition will occur on August 10, 2009, about a year into a Cassini extended mission (assuming an extended mission is approved). 12.2 FUTURE TELESCOPIC OBSERVATIONS AND THEORETICAL STUDIES Normally, a Saturn ring-plane crossing is a time of intense ground-based telescopic observation. However, at the time of the next crossing of Saturn's ring plane across the Earth (September 4, 2009), Satur nwill be at a poor positio ni nEarth's sky, a sca nt 11 \u000e from the Sun. The following crossing of Saturn's ring plane through the Earth will be March 23, 2025, and the Earth and Saturn will again be on opposite sides of the Sun, although Satur nwill be slightly farther from the Su ni nEarth's sky tha ni n2009. Hence, no reasonably good Saturn ring-plane crossings will be observable from Earth until about 2040. Following completion of the Cassini Mission at Saturn, there will be a body of ring and related data that will require decades to digest. As these data lead to conclusions, undoubtedly those conclusions will spawn countless theoretical and observational campaigns and perhaps even follow-on space missions. B. A. Smith [1] attempted i n1984 to predict the types of Earth-based observatio ns that would contribute to improved knowledge of the known planetary ring systems (Neptune's ring system was still a matter of speculation). He accurately predicted that the Hubble Space Telescope would be an invaluable tool for such studies. His statement that ``The principal problem with groundbased observations of ... rings is the limited resolution imposed by the terrestrial atmosphere ... '' did not foresee the development of adaptive optics [2]. Such optics now routinely achieve imaging resolutions comparable with and sometimes better than that of the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. Learning from his experience, we will not attempt to outline in detail what can and cannot be observed about Saturn's rings from ground-based telescopes, nor what theoretical studies will be pursued, but it is certain that there will be many such observations and studies over the coming decades. 214 Anticipated future observations of planetary ring systems [Ch. 12"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Stellar occultations viewed from Earth continue to be the primary means of studying the narrow rings of Uranus. Stellar occultations also provide useful data on the rings of Saturn and on the arc regions of the Adams ring of Neptune. When the rings of Uranus were discovered in 1977, and when they were imaged by Voyager 2 in 1986, they were essentially concentric rings surrounding the planet. However, as Uranus continues in its orbit around the Sun, its ring system, like that of Saturn, is edge-on to the Sun twice each 84-year orbit. The next Uranus ``equinox'' occurs o nDecember 7, 2007. Associated with that equi nox, the Earth will cross the Uranus ring plane three times within a 10-month period, on May 2 and August 16, 2007, and on February 20, 2008 [3]. These times will be very useful for observations of the tenuous dusty rings of Uranus, including the two recently discovered rings 2003U1R and 2003U2R. 12.3 EARTH-ORBITING TELESCOPIC OBSERVATIONS The Hubble Space Telescope (Figure 12.1, [4]) continues to operate as of this writing and will continue to do so for several years.

Imagery of the Neptune ring arcs at comparable resolutions recently revealed changes in the relative brightness and pos- itions of several of the arcs [5]. The Hubble Space Telescope orbits Earth at a naltitude of 600 km. A newer infrared telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope (Figure 12.2 [6]), is actually in orbit around the Sun rather than around the Earth. It follows the Earth in its orbit, at a distance that increases about 15,000,000 km each year. While its main goals are associated with astronomy beyond the solar system, it also studies the giant planets circling our own star, the Sun, and could provide temperatures, images, and other data on planetary ring systems.

A repeated gravitational force on a ring particle in the same direction and at the same point in its orbit. This force occurs on ring particles that are at a radial distance such that their orbit period is a simple fractio nof that of a nearby satellite. Keplerian shear Shearing motion of an ensemble of particles, each on a nearly circular, Kepleria norbit. Orbital velocity decreases as orbital radius i ncreases, yield- 222 Glossary"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"ing shear. Viscousdrag on such shear, due to ring-particle collisions, plays a key role in ring processes. Kirkwood gaps Gaps i nthe semimajor-axis distributio nof mai n-belt asteroids, located at solar distances where their orbital periods are simple integer fractions of Jupiter's orbital period. Lagrangian points Five gravitationally stable points (relative to a planet orbiting the Sun) where a small third body can orbit the Sun at the same rate as the planet. L1 is between the planet and the Sun, L2 is along the Sun±planet line, but exterior to the planet, and L3 is at the same planet±Sun distance, but on the opposite side of the Sun. The L4 and L5 points, respectively, lead and trail the planet by 60 \u000e i nits orbit. Laplace plane The near-equatorial (ring) plane as altered by the gravitational effects of the Sun and large satellites. Close to a giant planet, the local Laplace plane is essentially the planet's equatorial plane. Distant satellite orbital inclinations are generally referred to the local Laplace plane rather tha nto the pla net's equatorial plane. Lindblad resonance (  gravitational resonance ) A repeated gravitational force on a ring particle in the same direction and at the same point in its orbit. This force occurs o nri ng particles that are at a radial dista nce such that their orbit period is a simple fractio nof that of a nearby satellite. InnerLindbladresonances occur whe nthe satellite is exterior to the give nri ng. Outer Lindblad resonances occur whe nthe ri ng is exterior to the satellite's orbit. Lorentz resonance A repeated electromagnetic force on an electrically charged ring particle, nudging the particle in the same direction and at the same point in its orbit. Lorentz resonances are especially important for tiny ring particles whose charge-to- mass ratio is high and whose orbit periods are a simple integer fraction of the rotational period of the planet's magnetic ®eld. Mass density The mass per unit area of the ring material, integrated through the thickness of the ring. Sometimes called s urface density. Moonlet wakes Local disturbances in the ring structure caused by the gravitational in ̄uence of embedded satellites. If the satellite (moonlet) is large enough to clear a gap i nthe ri ngs, the moo nlet wakes become edge waves that precede the satellite o nthe inner edge and trail the satellite on the outer edge. For smaller satellites, the ``gap-less'' wakes have bee n nick named propellors. Nodal regression For a ring inclined to the planet's equator, the points at which the ring crosses the equator (nodes) slowly move around the planet (regress) in a direction opposite to that of the ring's orbital motion. Glossary 223"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Occultation The passage of one celestial body in front of another. For stellar ring occultations, the ring passes in front of a star as seen by the observer; for radio ring occultations, the radio transmitter passes behind the rings as viewed by radio antennas o nEarth. Opposition effect Abrupt increase in brightness of a body or ring near zero phase angle. Also known as the zero phase effect or opposition surge. Optical depth The ratio of the intensity of radiation (light or radio waves) incident on a ring to that emerging from the opposite face of the ring, expressed as a natural logarithm. If the reduction in intensity is by a factors of e (  2.718), the ring is said to have a noptical depth of 1. Normal (or normalized) optical depth is optical depth corrected for oblique (non-vertical) viewing. In ring studies, the terms optical depth and opticalthickness are generally used interchangeably. These terms generally refer to a particular wavelength. Optical oblateness (polar ̄attening) The ratio of the difference between equatorial and polar diameters to the equatorial diameter. A sphere has an oblateness of 0; an in®nitely thin disk has an oblateness of 1. Phase function The variatio ni nbright ness of a target as the phase angle (the angle betwee nSu na nd observer as see nfrom the target) varies betwee n0 \u000e and 180 \u000e . The directional distribution of re ̄ected (or scattered) radiation. The phase angle is the supplement of the scattering angle (the angle between the incident ray and the emerging ray); in other words, the sum of the phase angle and the scattering angle is always 180 \u000e . Photoelectric effect Ejection of electrons from a substance by the energy contained in incident electromagnetic radiation, especially by sunlight. Poynting±Robertson drag A loss of orbital angular momentum by tiny ring particles associated with their absorption and reemission of solar radiation. Also known as the Poynting±Robertson effect. Pulsational instability A term used to describe irregularly spaced, ®ne-scale structure in optically thick rings. The process relies on a combination of viscosity and self- gravity of ring material to produce this ®ne structure. Also known as overstability. Radial spokes Short-lived (generally lasting less than 24 hours) radial features that periodically appear over the outer half of Saturn's B ring, when the ring tilt angle is small. These features revolve at the same rate as the planet's magnetic ®eld and maintain their shape over much of the course of their existence even though they extend tens of thousands of kilometers across the rings. It is believed that the tiny particles that make up these spokes are electrically charged and temporarily ``frozen'' into the planet's magnetic ®eld. 224 Glossary"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Resonance Selective response of any periodic system to an external stimulus of the same frequency as the natural frequency of the system. Ring particles can have a resonant response to the periodic driving force of a satellite's gravity. Roche limit The minimum distance at which a zero-strength satellite, in ̄uenced by its own gravitation and by that of the planet it orbits, can exist. Such a satellite, with the same mean density as its planet but much smaller in size, will break up at 2.44 times the radius of the planet. Shepherding satellite A satellite in orbit near the edge of a planetary ring, that exerts a gravitational torque and thus maintains the integrity of the planetary ring by pre- venting it from spreading. Thermal inertia The tendency of a body to resist a change in temperature. A body with a low thermal inertia requires very few calories to change its surface temperature. A low thermal inertia material tends to be thermally insulating, so that the surface temperature changes readily, but those changes are not conducted to depth within the material. Tidal forces The mutual gravitational forces between a small body and the larger body it orbits. The Moon's tidal forces produce high and low tides on the Earth; in turn, the Earth's tidal forces deform the Moon, elongating its diameter along the Earth±Moo ndirectio n. Viscosity The resistance that a ̄uid system offers to ̄ow when it is subjected to a shear stress. For a dense ring (like Saturn's A or B ring), interparticle collisions create effects that mimic viscosity in ̄uids, reducing relative velocities, damping out spiral wave motion, and resisting non-zero inclinations in ring-particle orbits.
