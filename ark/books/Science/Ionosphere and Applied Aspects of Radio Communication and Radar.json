engineers, and graduate or postgraduate students who are concerned with the practical aspects of ionospheric radio propagation, over-horizon and above- horizon radars, and ionospheric stations used for investigating nonregular phenomena occurring in the ionosphere, as well as with land – satellite and satellite – satellite communications. The phenomena treated include transport processes and photochemistry reactions occurring in the regular homogeneous ionosphere, nonlinear phenomena, and instabilities in the inhomogeneous disturbed ionosphere caused by various ambient natural and man-made (e.g., artificial) sources, and the corresponding plasma irregularities, natural and artificially induced, associated with these plasma instabilities. In previous books [1 – 3] written in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Romania, the reader was introduced to radiophysical and optical methods of observations of artificially induced plasma irregularities, such as ion clouds and beams injected from the geophysical rockets into the background ionospheric plasma [1] or heating-induced irregularities generated in the field of strong pump waves transmitted to the ionosphere from powerful ground-based facilities [2,3]. Unfortunately, all discussions at that time concentrated on techniques used by the Soviet Geophysical Society from the 1960s through the 1980s and only on man-made phenomena, completely ignoring the effects of numerous natural plasma inhomogeneities occurring in the nonregular disturbed ionosphere at various latitudes from the polar cap to the equator. Furthermore, completely absent in previous books were the main aspects of the influence of different plasma irregularities, small-, moderate-, and large-scale, on radio wave propagation through the inhomo- geneous ionosphere, and on diagnostics of long-distance communication channels created in the ionosphere at various altitudes. These aspects necessitate additional requirements for the prediction of the main characteristics of ionospheric communication links by using modern radiophysical methods based on different vertical and oblique radar systems, pulse and continue-wave (CW) ionosondes, radiometers, and so on, only several examples of which were presented later in Ref. [3]. Furthermore, in the past two or three decades, a rapidly increasing demand for improving the efficiency of land – satellite and satellite – satellite communication networks, as megacell wireless service systems, was observed. This aspect is strongly related to improvement of the efficiency of wireless networks beyond the third generation (3-G), and, foremost, with the purposes of positioning and localizing of any subscriber located in the area of service of each desired satellite. To design such systems successfully, it is important to predict strictly propagation characteristics of land – satellite communication links passing the irregular ionospheric plasma perturbed by various natural phenomena such as solar activity and penetration of high-energy particles of solar wind into the ionosphere at high latitudes and the polar cap, and perturbation of the Earth ’ s magnetic field Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C000 Final Proof page ix 14.4.2008 6:17pm Compositor Name: MSub ramanian ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(called ‘‘ magnetic storms ’’ ) due to close coupling of the magnetosphere and ionosphere, as well as by strong coupling between high- and middle-ionosphere and the equatorial ionosphere, etc. The precise study of these phenomena, and the corresponding various instabilities (plasma waves) and irregularities caused by these phenomena in the disturbed ionosphere, allows us to obtain a stable prediction of the key parameters of ionospheric radio links and of the information data stream transmitted and received by the two-end terminal antennas of the land – satellite link. An initial effort to describe a few of these main aspects was recently pointed out in a book [4] by one of the authors. This book presents the reader with pertinent aspects of the diagnostics of irregular plasma structure of the ionosphere by using both well-known standards and modern (e.g., developed recently) radiophysical and optical methods, as well as algorithms of how to predict key parameters of ionospheric communication links, signals, and data streams. The more current aspects have not been described until now in such a complete way, even the best guides to ionospheric communi- cation having suffered from wide information gaps in describing more current ionospheric phe- nomena, its influence on the key parameters of the channel and signal — such as pass loss, slow and fast fading, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) — and, finally, the relationships between key parameters of the channel and the information data stream, such as capacity, spectral efficiency, and bit error rate (BER). Another problem that also stimulated creation of this book, in the authors ’ opinion, is that up to the end of the 1970s to the mid-1980s scientific groups investigating ionospheric phenomena in countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and those in the western countries worked independently and separately without close relations among them. Finally, during perestroika in the former Soviet Union the boundaries opened and comparing theoretical and experimental studies carried out by the two sides showed that there was much overlapping between theoretical frameworks and experimental technologies and the methodology of measurements of ionospheric phenomena and diagnostics of ionospheric radio channels using the same or close facilities created over 30 – 50 years. While being involved in some principal projects carried out in the former Soviet Union during the 1970s – 1990s, the authors then investigated theoretical and experimental data obtained by different research groups over the world, mostly in the United States (where investi- gations of ionospheric communication links have been carried out more intensively compared with other western countries). As a result, they tried to create some ‘‘ virtual bridges ’’ between existing frameworks, theoretical and experimental, to find correlations between different data through the existing theoretical frameworks and experimental data concerning the corresponding ionospheric phenomena and radio communication through the ionosphere, and, finally, to obtain optimal descriptions of the ionospheric phenomena, diagnostics of ionospheric communication channels, and key parameters of signals and information data, based on a whole spectrum of studies carried out by different scientific groups around the world, including their own theoretical and experi- mental investigations. Of course, the authors did not review all existing approaches; they have systematically described most adapted theories proved experimentally and the corresponding modern technologies and methods of diagnostics of ionospheric communication links, land – ionosphere – land and land – satellite passing through the disturbed ionosphere, as well as various signals and data passing through such channels. The material and chapter sequence in the book ’ s text are organized into nine chapters. Chapter 1 introduces a description of a quasi-regular layered ionosphere, based on a brief review of plasma content, the main characteristics of ionospheric plasma, transport processes, diffusion, thermo- diffusion and drift, which predominate at altitudes of the upper ionosphere, as well as on ionization – recombination reactions prevalent at altitudes of the low ionosphere.

Chapter 3 introduces the reader to the main parameters of the ionospheric channel and different presentations of signals, pulse, and CW, within such types of channels. Chapter 4 describes the statistical aspects of multipath propagation phenomena by introducing key parameters of channel and signal, such as path loss, slow and fast fading, and their statistical description using different presentations of the probability distribution function (PDF), from Gaussian to Ricean and Rayleigh, as well as their combinations. In Chapter 5, the authors discuss various kinds of ionospheric irregularities, natural and artificially induced, associated with the whole spectrum of instabilities occurring at different latitudes from the polar cap to the equator. Chapter 6 deals with radiophysical and optical methods of investigating ionospheric irregularities of various origins, their dynamics, structure and lifetime, using standard and modern methods and the corresponding equipment. In Chapter 7, the authors describe classical and modern methods of the diagnostics of the ionospheric radio communication channels and radiotraces with complex radio propagation geometry, which differ from those usually passing in the quasi-regular ionosphere along the great circle, using standard and modern radars and ionosondes. Chapter 8 introduces the reader to different optical and radio devices and apparatus, such as lidars, optical cameras, radiometers, radars, and ionosondes, utilized for diagnostics of the key parameters of radio communication ionospheric channels and the information data inside them. Finally, in Chapter 9, we show how different kinds of plasma irregularities, small-, moderate- and large-scale, occurring at various altitudes of the ionosphere can affect radio signals passing through the corresponding land – satellite channel, depending on the position and elevation of the satellite antenna with respect to the ground-based subscriber antenna. Here, the main parameters of the information data stream, such as capacity, spectral efficiency, and BER, are introduced and, as an example, show how to predict these parameters within the multipath ionospheric communication link with fading caused by the ambient magnetic storm.

First, this book would never have seen the light of day had Professor Nicolae Filipp not initiated us both into the study of the ionosphere and conditions of radiowave propagation through middle- latitude traces using vertical and oblique sounding of the ionosphere, and their corresponding long- path ionospheric channels. He was not only our inspiration but also the first of our future colleagues and supervisors, who introduced both of us to the study of the ionosphere and the field of ionospheric radio propagation, and for which we express our thanks. His contributions to Chapters 6 and 7 on the description of the effects of meteor trails and H E irregularities on radio propagation through the ionosphere are invaluable. I would like to mention that without the immense help of a group of scientists at IZMIRAN (Academy of Sciences, Moscow), especially, Dr. Jacob Dimant, Elena Tsedilina, Victor Vas ’ kov, and Genadii Bochkarev, led by Professor Alexander Gurevich, and Professors Lev Tsendin and Vladimir Rozhansky at the Leningrad Polytechnic University (USSR). Without their unwavering support, I would not have obtained the knowledge that has enabled me to conduct investigations in plasma physics, especially on nonlinear phenomena occurring in the ionosphere disturbed by different natural and man-made sources. I have had the honor of publishing with these distin- guished peers, and also individually, several articles concerning the wide spectrum of the corre- sponding processes, also described in Chapters 2, 5, and 6, for which I am ever grateful to them. Many thanks to my colleagues at IZMIRAN, especially Drs. Yurii Ruzhin, Victor Oraevsky, and Eugeny Mishin with whom I investigated the evolution of ion clouds and plasma beams in the ionosphere and published several articles and a book. Some of the results of our collaborative research are described in Chapters 6 and 7. We also thank our colleagues at NIRFI (Gorky, USSR) and State University (Yoshkar-Ola, USSR), where we were involved in investigations of heat-induced ionospheric irregularities using radar and ionosondes, described in Chapters 6 through 8. Among our colleagues at NIRFI and Mari State University, those deserving special mention include Professors Lev Erukhimov, Valerii Uryadov, Vladimir Ivanov, and Dr. Vladimir Shumaev, with whom we have published several articles and two books during recent decades. My appreciation for my coauthor, Eugeniu Plohotniuc, professor at the Moldova State University (Beltsy, Moldova), who took over middle-latitude ionosphere research first from Professor Filipp, and then from me, and who is also involved in the further development of the Radiophysical and Geophysical Observatory in Moldova, working closely with several research groups all over the world, including groups from Romania, Russia, Japan, and Israel.

It is only in recent decades that practical applications were developed, both for long-range land – land radio communications by using the ionosphere as a ‘‘ reflected screen, ’’ as well as for satellite – land and satellite – satellite links. The basic theories of radio wave propagation through the ionosphere, known as the magneto-ionic theories (see Ref. [13]), were established in the middle of the twentieth century, giving a great impetus to investigations of possibilities of ionospheric radio communication by reflection and scattering from ionospheric layers. The ionosphere had been defined by Plendl [8], and then by Kaiser [12] as a part of the upper atmosphere of Earth, which stretches from 50 km to about 500 – 600 km. This region is filled with ionized gas, called plasma . The upper bound of the ionosphere is determined as the altitude at which the concentration of charged particles of plasma, the electrons and ions, exceeds that of neutral molecules and atoms. At these altitudes the ionosphere transforms continuously into the magneto- sphere , which consists of only strongly ionized plasma (i.e., in the absence of neutral molecules and atoms) and strong ambient electric and magnetic fields. The ionosphere is rising as the result of the influence of solar ionized waves and high-energy particles on different gases in Earth ’ s atmosphere [8,13]. The structure and properties of the ionosphere depend essentially on processes occurring in the sun (called solar activity [14]), on variations of Earth ’ s magnetic field (called the geomagnetic field effect [11]), movements of neutral ‘‘ wind ’’ in the upper atmosphere due to Earth ’ s rotation, on the effects of electrical current and ambient electrical fields [15 – 18], on the density and the content of the atmosphere at different altitudes and geographical latitudes [19,20], and so on.

The bottom one, from 50 to 80 km, is called the D layer ; from 80 to 130 km is the E layer ; and above 150 km is the F layer . The latter region is usually separated at the F 1 layer , from 130 to 200 – 250 km, and the F 2 layer is above 250 km. Apart from these layers, at 90 – 120 km, the sporadic layer E s is observed, whose thickness in the vertical plane along the height is small. Its occurrence is usually explained by the influence of a neutral wind of atmospheric gases on the charged particles of plasma, resulting in exchange of plasma accompanied by stratified wind structure along the height (for more detailed information, see Refs. [21,22]). Now, taking into account the geomagnetic line structure as well as the irregular distribution of variations of the geomagnetic field above Earth and its influence on the ionosphere, the latter can be categorized as the high-latitude ( j F j > 55 8 \u0001 60 8 ), middle-latitude (30 8 \u0002j F j\u0002 55 8 ), and lower-latitude ( j F j < 30 8 ) ionosphere, with a special zone of geomagnetic equator with j F j\u0002 5 8 \u0001 10 8 , where F is the magnitude of the geomagnetic latitude [21 – 26]. Note that in the physics of magnetosphere – ionosphere interactions, the definition ‘‘ geomagnetic latitudes ’’ relates to the dipole distribution of Earth ’ s magnetic field when the magnetic dipole is located at the center of Earth and the magnitude of F ¼ tan \u0001 1 1 2 tan I \u0001\u0002 , where I is the angle of the magnetic field inclination. The corpuscular solar radiation penetrates at the altitudes of ionosphere mainly at the high latitudes called the polar ionosphere . In the middle-latitude and lower-latitude ionosphere, the properties of plasma are determined by solar wave radiation, mostly for the D layer, because the ionization occurs here only in the diurnal periods. 1.1 Ionosphere Content As is well known [21 – 26], in the neutral atmosphere in conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and in the isothermal case ( T m ( z ) ¼ const , where z is the altitude of the atmosphere from Earth ’ s surface), the deviation of concentration of the neutral molecules and atoms in the ionosphere along height z is described by the barometric formula: N m ¼ N m 0 exp \u0001 z \u0001 z 0 ðÞ H m \u0003\u0004 (1 : 1) where N m ¼ P b N b , where b is the type of neutral particle; N m 0 is the concentration of neutral particles at the height z ¼ z 0 of pressure equilibrium; and H m ¼ T / M m g is the height of the homogeneous atmosphere, where T \u0003 T m is the temperature of neutral particle content in energetic units, M m ¼ P b m b N b = N m , and g is the gravitational acceleration ( g ¼ 9.81 m/s 2 , and m b is the mass of the particle b ). Equation 1.1, as with all macroscopic gas laws, is valid for the ionosphere only under conditions such that the number of interactions between atoms and molecules is sufficient to establish a statically physical balance between them. In the case of Earth ’ s ionosphere, Equation 1.1 is valid up to altitudes of z e \u0004 1000 \u0001 1200 km [23,24]. For z \u0005 z e , the length of the free path, l b , of gas particle b between interactions exceeds the height of the regular atmosphere H m , i.e., l b \u0006 H m , and neutral particles can move freely without collisions between them, and finally leave Earth ’ s atmosphere. The region with altitude z \u0005 z e , in which this phenomenon occurs, is called the exosphere [25,26].

The growth and the degree of these deviations with altitude depend on the intensity of the solar radiation, e.g., on the wave radiation in the lower- and middle-latitude ionosphere, and on the corpuscular radiation in the polar zone at higher latitudes. Therefore, the parameter H m in Equation 1.1 increases with altitude and depends strongly on latitude. The change of atmospheric temperature with height in the middle-latitude ionosphere for moderate solar activity, both for diurnal and nocturnal conditions, is shown in Table 1.1 [27,28], which also presents the molecular content of the ionosphere. It is seen that at altitudes below 100 km the atmosphere contains mainly molecules of nitrogen N 2 and oxygen O 2 .

At the altitudes of the exosphere, hydrogen is predominant, and for z \u0005 1500 km hydrogen is the main component of the neutral gas in Earth ’ s atmosphere (see also Figure 1.1). As for the concentration of charged particles, the same processes that influence the neutral content of the ionosphere and create its structure are important for creation of charged particle content of ionospheric plasma. Again, they are solar wave radiation, its spectrum and intensity, energy of corpuscular solar radiation, cosmic rays, the content of the atmosphere, chemical processes of ionization and recombination of plasma electrons and ions, and so on [23,24,29 – 32]. In Table 1.2, the temperature, T e , and concentration N e \u0003 N of electrons versus the height are presented, as well as the temperature of ions T i and the relative concentration of ion content in plasma n ¼ N i / N . It is seen that the concentration of electrons and ions increases up to altitudes of 300 – 400 km and for z > 400 km it gradually decreases. The degree of ionization of ionospheric plasma is determined by the ratio of concentration of charged particles in plasma (considering plasma as a quasi-neutral medium, N e \u0004 N i \u0003 N ) and the neutral component of plasma N m , i.e., by N / N m . Comparing N from Table 1.2 and N m from Table 1.1, we can conclude that the degree of ionization of plasma at the lower ionosphere is minimal ( N / N m \b 10 \u0001 8 \u0001 10 \u0001 6 ), and increases with height z (for z \u0005 300 km, N / N m \b 10 \u0001 4 ). At altitudes of exosphere ( z \u0005 1000 km) the degree of ionization reaches 10 \u0001 1 and at altitudes of the magnetosphere, plasma becomes fully ionized, with N / N m \u0005 1. In the D layer of the middle-latitude ionosphere the main ions are NO þ and O þ 2 ; in the E and F layers, the main ions are O þ up to 300 km; beyond these altitudes and up to the heights of the exosphere the ions He þ ,H þ ,N þ , and N þ 2 are also observed, the concentration of which is small with respect to O þ . However, such types of ions may play an important role in the process of generation of charged particles in the ionosphere. At the same time, the temperature of electrons T e and ions T i is not particularly dependent on the time of day and increases smoothly with the height.

Near the polar cap, the total ion content in the ionosphere decreases sharply with altitude. More details about the structure and properties of the ionosphere, including its neutral and charged particles, can be found in many excellent books [13 – 15,19,20]. 1.2 Major Characteristics of the Ionospheric Plasma Parameters of the ionospheric plasma such as the concentration and temperature of neutral and charged particles, mentioned earlier, mostly define the content of the ionosphere and its global structure. Apart from these plasma parameters, there are other important characteristics, functions of the main parameters, which are usually introduced to describe physical processes and phenomena occurring in the ionospheric plasma. All these characteristics have their own physical interpretation and can be considered separately. First, we consider the frequencies of collisions between all neutral and charged particles contained in the ionospheric plasma, the lengths of free path between interactions for each plasma component, the plasma frequency and gyrofrequencies of electrons and ions, the rate of rotation of charged particles around magnetic strength lines, the coefficients of diffusion of neutral and charged particles, the conductivity of plasma components, and so on. One important parameter of the ionospheric plasma that influences dynamic processes occur- ring in it and radio wave propagation in the ionosphere is the frequency of electron – neutral Table 1.2 (continued) Ionospheric Structure z (km) Night Relative Concentration of Ions, n ¼ Ni/N N (cm \u0001 3 )T e (K) T i (K) NO þ O þ 2 O þ H þ e H þ N þ N þ 2 120 2.1 \u0007 10 3 360 360 0.39 0.60 0.01 ———— 130 2.2 \u0007 10 3 480 470 0.42 0.55 0.02 ——— 0.01 150 2.4 \u0007 10 3 670 650 0.45 0.41 0.13 ——— 0.01 200 3 \u0007 10 3 900 850 0.045 0.045 0.90 —— 5 \u0007 10 \u0001 3 5 \u0007 10 \u0001 3 250 10 4 1000 910 6.10 5.10 0.98 —— 6 \u0007 10 \u0001 3 3 \u0007 10 \u0001 3 300 10 5 1200 930 —— 0.99 —— 0.01 — 400 3 \u0007 10 5 1400 950 —— 0.97 5 \u0007 10 \u0001 3 0.01 0.02 — 500 2 \u0007 10 5 1500 1000 —— 0.90 0.015 0.03 0.06 — 600 1.3 \u0007 10 5 1600 1020 —— 0.84 0.02 0.06 0.08 — 700 8 \u0007 10 4 1700 1100 —— 0.75 0.04 0.11 0.10 — 800 5 \u0007 10 4 1800 1200 —— 0.61 0.06 0.21 0.12 — 900 3 \u0007 10 4 1900 1300 —— 0.41 0.09 0.40 0.10 — 1000 2 \u0007 10 4 2000 1400 —— 0.28 0.14 0.51 0.07 — Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C001 Final Proof page 7 26.3.2008 7:30pm Compositor Name: VBala mugundan The Regular Ionosphere: Main Characteristics and Processes & 7"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"collisions, n em .

[25], the effective frequency of electron – ion collisions, n ei , can be presented as a function of the ion concentration and electron temperature: n ei ¼ 5 : 5 N i T 3 = 2 e ln 220 T e N 1 = 3 i (1 : 3) The effective frequency for ion – neutral collisions (i.e., ions with molecules and atoms) can be presented approximately as [25,27]: n im ¼ b 0 im T i þ T m ðÞ 1 = 2 N m (1 : 4) where the coefficient b 0 im takes into account the mass difference of molecules and the negligible effects of nonelastic ion – neutral collisions, related to polarization of molecules and their over- charged distribution. Real parameters of the plasma in the middle-latitude ionosphere at altitudes of 90 – 600 km are shown in Table 1.3 [31 – 33]; measurements were taken during both the day and night, at moderate solar activity. Here, to deduce formulas and their relationships, as well as the number of parameters presented in the major formulas, we introduce (for future computations and experimental data description) the following notations: q H ¼ v H / n em , Q H ¼ V H / n em , g ¼ mv em / M i n im , where m and M i , v H and V H , n em and n im are the mass, gyromagnetic frequency, and the frequency of collisions with neutrals for electrons ( a ¼ e ) and ions ( a ¼ i ) in plasma, respectively (we assume that ions, like electrons, have unit charge and only differ from electrons by the sign of the charge). As seen from Table 1.3, with increasing ionospheric altitude h , the degree of magnetization of the ionospheric plasma also increases, and is determined by the inequality v H V H \u0006 n em n im . For h < 150 km, v H > n em , whereas V H < n im ; i.e., the electrons are magnetized, but the ions are only weakly magnetized. When h > 150 km, v H \u0006 n em and V H > n im ; i.e., for middle and higher ionosphere altitudes both electrons and ions are strongly magnetized. As was mentioned earlier, the degree of ionization of the ionospheric plasma is usually determined by the ratio of concentration of charged particles, electrons, or ions (plasma is quasi-neutral, N e \u0004 N i ¼ N ) to that of neutrals, i.e., N / N m .

Despite the fact that ionospheric plasma is usually at low temperature, the cross section of collisions between electrons and ions significantly exceeds the cross section of collisions of electrons with neutral molecules and atoms. Therefore, electron – ion interactions are essential even when N / N m \t 1, but p \u0005 1. As follows from Table 1.4 (see also Figure 1.2), where the parameter of ionization p for h ¼ 90 – 700 km is shown, in the real ionosphere the parameter of ionization can reach high values, though, in the original sense the ionospheric plasma is weakly ionized (i.e., N \t N m ). At altitudes under consideration ( h ¼ 90 – 600 km), N m > N e or N i provides the condition of stability of a full plasma pressure necessary for the transport processes of diffusion, thermodiffusion, and drift in the ionosphere.

Hence, the parameter of ionization of plasma also increases in relation to the altitude increase. Thus, the nocturnal ionosphere is weakly ionized ( p \t 1) up to h \b 250 km, and the diurnal ionosphere is weakly ionized up to h \b 150 km. At altitudes beyond 350 km, the growth of the degree of ionization of the nocturnal ionosphere exceeds the degree of ionization of the diurnal ionosphere (see Figure 1.2). At the same time, as mentioned in Refs. [31,33], from h > 500 km, the growth of the ionization parameter p decelerates with the height, while the degree of plasma magnetization increases monotonically with increase of ionospheric altitudes above 500 km. Therefore, while analyzing the physical processes and phenomena occurring in the real iono- sphere for h > 150 – 160 km, as well as in meteor trails or ion clouds, we have to account for the collisions between the charged particles and degree of magnetization of ionospheric plasma, conditions that are not usually taken into consideration by some existing models when comparing them with real ionospheric experiments. This is one of the reasons for the ambiguous interpretation of experimental data particularly with meteor trails or barium clouds; see Chapters 5 and 6 and also Refs. [38,39] and the references presented there. Furthermore, according to the empirical models of the ionosphere [31,33], at noon in the ionosphere during periods of low solar activity, the mean free path of charged particles for electrons, l e , changes from 30 cm to 12 km for h ¼ 90 – 500 km and that for ions, l i , is from 0.5 cm to 2 km for the same altitude range of 90 – 500 km. Larmor ’ s radius of electrons, r eH , at the altitudes under discussion, changes from 1 to 4 cm, and the Larmor ’ s radius of ions, r iH , at the same altitudes (of 90 – 500 km) changes from 0.4 to 7.4 m [30 – 33].

In the following text we will consider both these aspects separately. To separate the phenomena mentioned earlier, we need first to compare initial scales and dimensions of irregular plasma structures and turbulences in the plasma at the altitudes discussed with the characteristic scales and dimensions of plasma presented at the end of the previous section. As mentioned before, such a comparison allows stating the problems and choosing the method for their solution. The qualitative analysis carried out earlier has shown that all characteristic scales of plasma are less than the dimensions of plasma irregularities. Moreover, at altitudes beyond 150 – 160 km, the transfer processes, diffusion, thermodiffusion, and drift prevail compared with the chemical processes of ionization and recombination. Therefore, for a description of transfer processes beyond altitudes of the upper E layer (i.e., at altitudes of more than 150 – 160 km), we can use a system of magnetohydro- dynamic equations for all components of the ionospheric plasma, electrons, and ions to describe evolution of irregular structures of ionospheric plasma of various types, both artificial and natural. As had been mentioned in the pioneering works, such processes can be fully described by the continuity equation of charged particles and neutrals, by equation of motion and the equation of heat energy conservation [15 – 21]. As shown by later investigations [22 – 39], usually concerning the solution of the problems of dynamic inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma at altitudes of the upper E layer and higher, the absence of processes of ionization, attachment, detachment, and recombination is assumed, as well as the unification between electrons and ions with unit charge and between the ions of plasma irregularities and those of the background ionospheric plasma. In this case a full system of transfer equations of plasma components (denoted by indexes a ¼ e , i ) and neutral components (denoted by index a ¼ m ) can be presented in the following form [27,28,33,39]: @ N a @ t þr\u0007 j a ¼ 0(1 : 5a) @ N m @ t þr\u0007 U m N m ðÞ¼ 0(1 : 5b) j e ¼\u0001 ^ s e e E þ 1 c U m , B 0 ½ \u0003\u0004 \u0001 ^ D ee r N e \u0001 ^ D Te N e T e r T e þ N e U m (1 : 6a) j i ¼ ^ s i e E þ 1 c U m , B 0 ½ \u0003\u0004 \u0001 ^ D ii r N i \u0001 ^ D Ti N i T i r T i þ N i U m (1 : 6b) M m N m @ U m @ t þ U m , r ðÞ U m \u0007\b ¼\u0001r N m T m ðÞ ^ s e e \u0001 h U m \u0001 1 3 h ( U m ) \u0001 m ^ n em ( N e U m \u0001 j e ) \u0001 M i ^ n im ( N i U m \u0001 j i )(1 : 6c) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C001 Final Proof page 13 26.3.2008 7:30pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan The Regular Ionosphere: Main Characteristics and Processes & 13"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"In the ionosphere, when there is any plasma irregularity it always arises in the electrical field and then in the magnetic field closely related to this irregularity.

In Equation 1.10a and b, d ei \u0004 2 m / M i , d em \u0004 10 \u0001 3 , and d im \u0004 1 are, respectively, the fractions of energy lost by electrons in collisions with ions and neutrals and also by ions in collisions with neutrals. An external source of heating is associated with high-energy photoelectrons forming in the ionosphere in the process of ionization of the neutral component by solar ultraviolet radiation. As an example, the altitudinal dependence of the coefficients of diffusion is shown in Figure 1.3a and b calculated according to Equation 1.11 for diurnal and nocturnal models of the middle- latitude ionosphere for moderate solar activity, respectively, all parameters of which are presented in Tables 1.3 and 1.4. Here, the results of computation for the virtual case of p \u0004 0 are also presented. It is seen that the real coefficients of diffusion (i.e., estimated for the case of the real ionosphere for p > 0) change with ionosphere altitude nonmonotonically compared with the nonrealistic (virtual) case. Thus, for D e jj and D i ? the wide maxima are observed at 200 and 150 km, respectively; for D e ? a wide minimum is observed at altitudes of 200 – 250 km and a maximum at altitude of about 300 km. As for the coefficient of ion diffusion along the magnetic field, D i jj , it grows monotonically as ionospheric altitude increases. Moreover, if we use a virtual model of the ionospheric plasma presented by dashed curves in Figure 1.3 without accounting for the real degree of plasma ionization (i.e., setting p ¼ 0 in Equation 1.12a), then the difference between D e jj and D i jj , D e ? and D i ? , becomes greater with increase of ionospheric altitude (i.e., with increase of q H and Q H ). Diffusion in the corre- sponding directions to B 0 is determined not by the minimal ( D i jj and D e ? ), but by the maximal ( D e jj and D i ? ) coefficients of unipolar diffusion of charged particles. Accounting for the real degree of ionization of the ionospheric plasma ( p > 1), which increases with altitude, the limit of D e jj is D i jj and that of D e ? is D i ? (see Figure 1.3), and the character of diffusion fundamentally changes. This aspect will be analyzed in detail in Chapter 5. We have to point out that the additional evaluations carried out in Refs. [38,39] have shown that components of the tensor of conductivity, s e ? , s i ? , s i jj , and s e jj , have maxima at altitudes of Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C001 Final Proof page 16 26.3.2008 7:30pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 16 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"100, 150, 250, and 300 km, respectively. The same tendency of nonmonotonically height dependence with local maxima was observed for other transport coefficients [38]. Hence, apart from the macro-scale regular distribution of plasma, in the ionosphere there occur naturally and artificially created nonregular distributions of plasma concentration, the so-called macroscopic plasma irregularities, having dimensions ranging from hundreds kilometers (macro-disturbances) to tens and fewer meters (micro-disturbances), the evolution of which can be described by the self-matching system of diffusion, thermodiffusion and drift (Equations 1.5 through 1.10). At the same time, the peculiarities of the processes of relaxation of such plasma irregularities are determined by coefficients of transfer (e.g., diffusion, drift, and thermodiffusion) of electron and ion components of inhomogeneous plasma according to Equation 1.12. 1.4 Ionization – Recombination Balance in the Ionosphere At the range of altitudes of the E layer of the ionosphere from 90 to 150 km, the effects of ionization and recombination are predominant and must also be taken into account in analysis of transport processes occurring in the background ionospheric plasma.

As is well known [21 – 23], for the lower ionosphere at altitudes less than 120 – 130 km (i.e., at the lower E layer and at the D layer), the temporal changes of concentration of electrons N (or ions, because plasma is quasi-neutral, N e \u0004 N i ¼ N ; see Equation 1.9a) are determined by processes of ionization and recombination, and Equation 1.5a can be reduced to @ N @ t ¼ q i \u0001 a N 2 (1 : 14) Here, q i ¼ q iO þ q iO 2 þ q iN 2 is the total intensity of ionization of atoms O, O 2 , and N 2 ; a is the effective coefficient of dissociative recombination. Equations 1.14 and 1.13 describe the balance of number of charged particles in the ionosphere (without and with their transport by diffusion and drift processes, respectively), and determine in the general case (Equation 1.13) ion – molecule reactions between the basic components of the ionospheric plasma and the processes of dissipative recombination [27]. Dissociative recombination is the main chemical reaction in the lower ionosphere and is characterized by attachment of the molecular ion M þ with electron e \u0001 , which is accompanied by the dissociation of the molecular ion into two excited neutral atoms A * 1 and A * 2 [27,28]: M þ þ e \u0001 ! A * 1 þ A * 2 (1 : 15) For example, for the molecular ion of oxygen O þ 2 or the oxide of nitrogen NO þ , we have, respectively, reactions of the following type: O þ 2 þ e \u0001 ! O * þ O * ,NO þ þ e \u0001 ! N * þ O * (1 : 16) Therefore, for dissociative recombination, the number of electrons attached to ions in a volume of 1cm 3 during 1 s can be described in Equation 1.13 by the term R ¼ a N 2 . Taking into account reactions of (Equation 1.16), we can finally present the effective recombination coefficient as [28,33]: a ¼ a 1 n NO þ þ a 2 n O þ 2 (1 : 17) where n NO þ ¼ N NO þ = N and n O þ 2 ¼ N O þ 2 = N are the relative (to electrons) concentrations of ions of NO þ and O þ 2 , respectively; a 1 and a 2 are reaction coefficients of dissipative recombination of these ions, described by Equation 1.16. The interactions between main ions of plasma and the neutral molecules such as N 2 and O 2 are determined by the following reactions: N 2 þ O þ 2 ! NO þ þ N, O 2 þ O þ ! O þ 2 þ O(1 : 18) Such reactions are characterized by the coefficients of ion – molecular reactions, b 1 and b 2 , respectively.

[21 – 24,27 – 32]. We will present in the following text only a brief analysis of the main parameters of the recombination and ionization reactions and will estimate their importance for different layers of the ionosphere. Apart from the main reactions of dissociative recombination described by Equations 1.16 and 1.18, there are additional reactions of ions N þ 2 with molecules O 2 and O, such as N þ 2 þ O ! N 2 þ O þ ,N þ 2 þ O 2 ! N 2 þ O þ 2 ,N þ 2 þ O ! N þ NO þ (1 : 19) which are characterized by the corresponding coefficients g 1 to g 3 . These reactions are very fast because the coefficients g 1 \u0001 g 3 are sufficiently large [27,28], and the reactions (Equation 1.19) lead to dissipation of N þ 2 ions in the ionosphere (see also Table 1.2). At the same time, the reactions lead to the creation of additional ions of O þ ,O þ 2 ,NO þ , which is accounted for by the coefficients of these ions ( q 0 iO , q 0 iO 2 , and q 0 iNO ) creation in the equations of ionization balance. However, the total intensity of ionization remains constant, i.e., the number of ions O þ ,O þ 2 , and NO þ created by reactions (Equation 1.19) in a volume of 1 cm 3 during 1 s equals the number of ions of O þ ,O þ 2 , and NO þ before the reactions, and thus a total ionization balance occurs: q 0 iO þ q 0 iO 2 þ q 0 iNO ¼ q 0 iO þ q 0 iO 2 þ q 0 iNO ¼ q i (1 : 20) It should also be noted that apart from the dissociative recombination in the ionosphere, there also occurs radiative recombination, related to the attachment of the electron by the atomic ion, and radiation of the photon. At the D layer of the ionosphere, the attachment of the electron to the molecule with the creation of the molecular ion and the dissipation of electrons in the D layer of the ionosphere ( e \u0001 þ M 0 ! M \u0001 ) play an important role. The following estimations, carried out in Refs. [27,28], have shown that at the E layer and beyond, these reactions can be ignored. Moreover, in the E layer, the coefficients of dissociative recombination described by Equation 1.16 are a 1 ¼ 10 \u0001 7 cm 3 /s, a 2 ¼ 2 \u0007 10 \u0001 7 cm 3 /s, whereas those described by Equation 1.18 are b 1 \u0004 b 2 \u0004 10 \u0001 13 cm 3 /s. At the same time, in the F layer of the ionosphere a 1 ¼ (3 7 5) \u0007 10 \u0001 8 cm 3 /s and a 2 ¼ (2 7 5) \u0007 10 \u0001 8 cm 3 /s, whereas for dissociative reactions (Equation 1.18) they are equal: b 1 ¼ 3 \u0007 10 \u0001 12 cm 3 /s and b 2 ¼ 2 \u0007 10 \u0001 12 cm 3 /s. The coefficient of radiative recom- bination, \b a R N 2 e ,is a R \u0004 10 \u0001 12 cm 3 /s. These estimations show that events in the ionosphere above the D layer are mainly governed by Equation 1.16, which is characterized by the coefficients of dissociative recombination, a 1 and a 2 . They are also important at altitudes of the E layer comparable to those in the F layer. The radiative recombination is less effective, compared with the dissociative reactions, even at the altitudes of the E layer of the ionosphere. The temperature dependence of coefficients a 1 and a 2 (in Kelvin) can be defined, according to Refs. [27,28], by the following formulas: a 1 \u0004 5 \u0007 10 \u0001 7 300 = T e ðÞ 1 : 2 , a 2 \u0004 2 : 2 \u0007 10 \u0001 7 300 = T e ðÞ 0 : 7 (1 : 21) From Equation 1.21 it follows that with increase of temperature of plasma (e.g., caused by heating of the ionosphere), the coefficients of recombination decrease, whereas the electron concentration increases in the E layer with increase of temperature of electrons. All formulas obtained for this layer characterize the local balance of ionization because they are correct only when ignoring the transfer processes with respect to chemical processes. However, in the F layer, the transfer processes, such as diffusion, thermodiffusion and drift, prevail and, in accounting these processes, we can find the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C001 Final Proof page 19 26.3.2008 7:30pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan The Regular Ionosphere: Main Characteristics and Processes & 19"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"region of maximal plasma density beyond which the transfer processes prevail and below which the reactions of recombination and ionization prevail. Further, for the computations of plasma concentration and temperature in the inhomogeneous ionosphere, a more general expression for the coefficient of recombination R was evaluated to cover the altitudes below and above the critical range of 150 – 160 km, where the process of plasma transfer prevails over chemical processes [39]: R ¼ N b 1 N N 2 þ b 2 N O 2 ðÞ 1 þ b 1 N N 2 a 1 N þ b 2 N O 2 a 2 N \u0005\u0006 (1 : 22) Here, we take again into account the quasi-neutrality of the ionospheric plasma, i.e., N e \u0004 N O þ þ N NO þ þ N O þ 2 \u0003 N . Then, the densities of the molecular ions can be found by the local balance equations of the ions: N O þ ¼ N 1 þ b 1 N N 2 a 1 N þ b 2 N O 2 a 2 N \u0005\u0006 (1 : 23a) N NO þ ¼ N O þ b 1 N N 2 a 1 N (1 : 23b) N O þ 2 ¼ N O þ b 2 N O 2 a 2 N (1 : 23c) For h > 200 km Equation 1.22 reduces to the simple formula R ¼ a N 2 , with a defined by Equation 1.17 obtained in Refs. [27,28], which describes quite closely the actual ionization – recombination balance at altitudes h ¼ 200 – 500 km in the ionosphere. Equation 1.22 is more general and correctly describes chemical reactions in both the lower and higher ionosphere; if this formula is substituted in Equation 1.14 or Equation 1.13, instead of the term R ¼ a N 2 presented in the right-hand side of these equations. Hence, Equation 1.13 or Equation 1.14 fully determines the balance of ionization and recombination in the ionosphere at altitudes beyond the D layer, but the latter equation only up to altitudes of the upper E layer. Finally, we can conclude that during analysis of the process of formation and further evolution of ionospheric plasma irregularities of either natural origin — such as meteor trails and sporadic H E plasma structures — or artificial origin — such as heating of the ionosphere by powerful radio wave or injection of chemical active substances (we will discuss these aspects in Chapters 6 and 7) — it is necessary to account for the whole complex of physical – chemical and transport processes that form large-scale, average-scale, and small-scale regular and irregular plasma structures in the nonuniform ionospheric background.

In the real ionosphere, plasma is not in an equilibrium state, and strong deviations from its equilibrium (also called the steady state regime in the literature) lead to formations of plasma wave perturbations, which create different kinds of instabilities in the ionosphere. The physical processes that accompany nonlinear phenomena in the disturbed nonregular ionosphere, and the corresponding plasma instabilities, may be caused by natural environmental sources, such as magnetic storms or solar and seismic activity [1 – 5], as well as by human activities resulting in the interaction of powerful radio waves (called pump waves ) sent from the Earth ’ s surface into the ionosphere, using ground-based facilities [6 – 8], and those related to active space experiments involving injection of electron beams and fluxes [9] and ion clouds [10 – 11] into the ionospheric plasma and excitation of fields, acoustic waves and currents in the ionosphere [2,4,12], and so on. Nonlinear phenomena in the real ionospheric plasma can be classified as weak and strong, depending on how strong ambient electromagnetic effects are and on how the spatial and temporal characteristics of interactions between plasma particles, electrons, and ions, with electromagnetic fields passing through the ionospheric plasma, are coupled. Nowdays, weak and strong nonlinear- ity, described correspondingly by linear, quasilinear, and nonlinear theories, cannot be differentiated [1 – 4]. The existence of even weak ambient electric and magnetic fields can generate instabilities in plasma, and the related strong intrinsic electric fields and plasma density disturbances, which essentially change the dispersion properties of plasma.

In this case, the equations of movement (Equation 1.6), thermoconductivity (Equation 1.10), and continuity (Equation 1.5) of plasma electrons and ions take into account linear and quadratic dependences of currents induced in plasma on ambient electric field E 0 of various origins. Correspondingly, the Ohm law, j ¼ s E 0 , consists of terms proportional to E 0 , disregarding terms containing E 2 0 , E 3 0 , and higher degrees of E 0 [1 – 4,13 – 15]. For example, if the field of the probing alternate radio wave passing through the ionosphere, E v , is weak enough and fluctuations of plasma density (electrons and ions, as plasma is quasineutral) are weak or have other origins, the induced current, j \u0001 E v , and effects of attenuation, scattering, and transformation of wave energy into plasma waves are weak, and do not depend on the field strength E v \u0002j E v j . Thus, probing radio waves usually used for radio communication weakly change properties of ionospheric plasma, and the wave characteristics within the ionospheric channel can be described by using linear theory. Where the electromagnetic wave is strong enough to essentially change the parameters of plasma, its density, frequencies of collisions between plasma particles, their movement velocities, and so on, the currents induced in such a plasma become proportionate to terms with higher degrees of E v . The existence of terms with quadratic, cubic, and higher degrees of E v in the Ohm law leads to nonlinear effects related to nonlinear terms existing in the equations mentioned previously. That is, the existence of nonlinear terms in the equation of thermoconductivity leads to a change in the temperature of plasma electrons and ions. This occurs if the powerful high-frequency electromagnetic wave heats the plasma electrons in the ionosphere. The corresponding ‘‘ heater ’’ is proportional to E 2 v . This type of nonlinearity is called in the literature the thermal or heated nonlinearity [1 – 5,13 – 15]. As shown in the following text, this nonlinearity is caused by dissipative processes taking place when the characteristic time of nonlinear interaction of strong waves with plasma exeeds the characteristic time of interactions between charged particles n \u0003 1 e ¼ n em þ n ei ð ) \u0003 1 \u0001\u0002 , and the characteristic spatial scales of wave – plasma interactions, L , significantly larger than the free path of plasma electrons (in isotropic plasma, when ambient magnetic field is weak, B 0 ! 0) or than the longitudinal scale, ‘ jj (along B 0 )of plasma disturbances (in anisotropic plasma, B 0 > 0). As also shown subsequently, heating of plasma electrons leads to a change in plasma pressure in the heated area of the ionosphere. Moreover, high- energy electrons after heating leave the heated area and, interacting with ions due to the creation of polarization intrinsic electric fields in plasma, called ambipolar fields [6,7], generate plasma disturb- ances in the ionosphere. These plasma disturbances are responsible for nonlinear effects occurring during propagation of probing radio waves through the heated ionospheric regions, such as self- focusing and self-defocusing effects, nonlinear refraction, scattering and transformation of plasma modes, generation of high-order plasma modes, and so on, the effects of which will be described in Chapters 6 and 7. We also consider in the following paragraphs the so-called the striction nonlinearity, which occur only in the collisionless plasma, even if the ionospheric plasma is the collisional plasma. This is discussed because it is usually generated by artificial heating of ionospheric plasma by electromag- netic pump waves from powerful ground-based facilities. This nonlinearity appears because of the modulation of movements of plasma particles in the oscillatory field of pump waves. The appearance of striction nonlinear forces displaces the circular trajectory of electrons and ions with the radius, r v , proportional to the oscillatory high-frequency component of the alternate wave field E v ; i.e., r v \u0001 E v . As shown further, this striction nonlinearity is described by new nonlinear terms in Equation 1.6, such as ( u e v r ) u e v and u e v \u0004 B v , where u e v is the oscillation velocity of plasma Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 24 26.3.2008 9:18pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 24 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"electrons in the field of powerful high-frequency waves and B v is the strength of the magnetic field in the high-frequency wave. The corresponding nonlinearities are closely related with instabilities created in plasma under ambient forces of various origins. There is a wide spectrum of plasma instabilities which can be generated in the ionosphere by natural geophysical and artificial manmade phenomena. In our description of ionospheric instabilities as a source of plasma irregularities of various scales and degrees of perturbations, which affect the propagation of probing radio waves through the real ionosphere, we will limit this spectrum of instabilities to only those that are important to researchers in understanding the nature of the creation of plasma irregularities responsible for multiray propagation caused by multiscattering, multidiffraction, and multireflection occurring in the ionospheric radio channels (see Chapters 6 and 7). Therefore, we will not enter into the subject of beam instability generation and the corresponding Cherenkov radiation (or Landau damping) occurring in the collisionless laboratory plasma. In a further description of instabilities under consideration, we will focus mostly on linear and quasilinear theoretical approaches and thereby establish only linear conditions for the generation of plasma instabilities and the initial stages of evolution of the corresponding plasma density per- turbations associated with these instabilities. Despite this fact, the results presented here allow for the finding of initial growth rates of instabilities in the space and time domains, defined as increments (or decrements) of plasma turbulences [1 – 5]. As for nonlinear theory, until now the basic concepts of this theory have not yet been formulated. Some analytical nonlinear solutions have been obtained only for the description of weak turbulences and for collisionless plasma. However, using such approximate theories, some positive information can be obtained about further evolution of plasma instabilities in the partly ionized ionosphere (i.e., taking into account interactions between charged and neutral particles). This can be done using some specific mathematical methods with elements of statistical and quantum mechanics. In other words, based on some idealized analytical approaches in nonlinear theory, we will briefly explain experimentally observed interactions of plasma waves in the collisional ionospheric plasma. A full analysis of the evolution of plasma irregularities in the nonhomogeneous ionosphere, taking into account its real properties and electrical coupling between the main regions, E and F , of the ionosphere, will be presented in Chapter 5 based on 2-D and 3-D numerical analysis. Now, let us classify the main instabilities associated with those plasma disturbances affecting radio propagation in the ionospheric communication channels and, therefore, sufficiently interest- ing to expand on. As mentioned previously, during propagation of strong electromagnetic or electrostatic waves in the ionospheric plasma (called pump waves ), the nature of creation of plasma waves (instabilities) can be understood by the oscillatoring movements of the plasma particles (electrons and ions) within the strong electromagnetic field of pump waves. The corresponding instabilities are called the artificial parametric . In specific conditions, some mentioned previously and others described subsequently, artificial striction instabilities can be created by strong electromagnetic waves entering into the ionospheric layer. Natural plasma instabilities, which have a macroscopic character and can be simply described, by movements of plasma, as a liquid, are usually called hydrodynamic instabilities. For a description of these instabilities, magnetohydrodynamic equations are usually used. Because in the ionosphere there are dissipative processes due to the real conductivity of plasma, the processes of diffusion and recombination, the so-called dissipative hydrodynamic instabilities, occur.

Taking into account the altitudinal redistribution of plasma density in the ionosphere and the height dependence of transport coefficients in plasma (see Chapter 1), we find that gradient-drift instabil- ities are usually generated. Another group of instabilities occurs in the nonequilibrium ionospheric plasma with non- Maxwellian distribution of charge particles (mostly of plasma electrons). In this case, plasma waves can be amplified due to interactions with highly energetic electrons or ions, or both. These interactions lead to redistribution of energy in plasma to the so-called Landau damping and, finally, to an increase of attenuation of probing radio waves passing through the disturbed ionospheric region. Such instabilities are usually called kinetic instabilities because they can be described only by using the kinetic theory and the corresponding kinetic equations with collisional integrals described by using elements of statistical and quantum mechanics. In the theoretical analysis of the processes involved in the formation of plasma instabilities, a general problem is whether to present plasma waves as (1) monochromatic plane waves or (2) wave packets (signals). In both cases of plasma wave field presentation, the main mathematical difficulty is to obtain a dispersion equation as a strict relation between the plasma parameters and the frequency and phase velocity of plasma waves. As mentioned in the Refs. [1 – 4], there are two ways to take into account the collisional absorption and analyze the corresponding instabilities in plasma. In the first approach, the wave vector k is assumed to be real but the wave frequency v is assumed to be a complex value, v ¼ Re( v ) þ j Im( v ) ¼ ˆ þ j g . Here, for g > 0, where g is defined as the increment of growth (excitation) of plasma waves, the corresponding exponential growth of plasma wave with increment j g j occurs in the time domain according to the law \u0001 e j g j t . In the inverse case, g < 0, an exponential damping of plasma waves in the time domain ( \u0001 e \u0003j g j t ) occurs. Here, g is defined as a decrement of damping of plasma waves. We have to note here that some authors define the excitation of plasma wave (instability) by g < 0, and its damping by g > 0, taking into account the law e \u0003 g t . To unify different definitions in our further description of the problem, we introduced the absolute value of g in the exponential law and inserted the corresponding sign which finally determines the character of the process, either excitation ( \u0001 e j g j t ) or damping ( \u0001 e \u0003j g j t ). In the other limited approach, the wave frequency v is assumed to be a real value, but the wave number k is assumed to be a complex value, k ¼ Re( k ) þ j Im( k ) ¼ k 0 n r þ jk 0 n i , where k 0 ¼ 2 p l ¼ v c is the wave number in free space, c is the light speed, l is the wavelength, and n r and n i are the real and imaginary components, respectively, of the refractive index in plasma. In this approach, plasma is not stable even if it exists in one part of the interval of the wave numbers, D k ¼ k 2 \u0003 k 1 , and the increment will be negative, i.e., g ( k ) < 0. The main question is how to describe the character of evolution of those unstable waves in real time, t . Could one present plasma instability as a plane monochromatic wave or is there another mathematically stricter description of the problem? As mentioned in the Refs. [1 – 4], a more precise mathematical approach dictates ‘‘ dealing ’’ with wave packets (i.e., signals). In such a mathematical description, the wave field will be a function of the coordinate vector r and time t ; i.e., E v ¼ E v ( r , t ). Expanding this field using Fourier ’ sintegraloverthe real k and complex v ( k ), where v ( k ) can be found from the corresponding dispersion equation [1 – 4], and assuming that the Fourier transformance inside this expansion, ~ E v ðÞ¼ g r , t ðÞ e i v k ðÞ t , is a limited function for all values of the wave number k , one can find that each component of the field strength E ( r , t ) approaches zero when r !1 . This means that the wave packet is spatial-localized . If, in this case, localization in time does not exist, the instability is called absolute . Because of absolute instability the field amplitude, E v ¼ ~ E ( v )willgrowintime t at every point r according to the law \u0001 e j g j t ,and Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 26 26.3.2008 9:18pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 26 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"self-excitation of plasma waves will be observed. The question of the statement of plasma, contain- ing such self-excited waves (e.g., instabilities), can only be resolved by using nonlinear approaches [1 – 4,11 – 15]. In contrast, if the instability generated, i.e., a wave packet in the previous discussion, is localized both in the space and time domains, such instability is called convective . Mathematically, using linear approximation, this means that each component of the field strength E v ( r , t ) tends to zero when r !1 and t !1 . At the same time, because the processes grow at each point of the space domain for every point in time, such a plasma system has amplifier properties for these kinds of instabilities. We have to note here that a strict differentiation of instabilities between absolute and convective needs a very complicated mathematical tool based on corresponding theoretical deriv- ations carried out in the literature [1 – 4]. Therefore, we do not enter into a detailed analysis of the problem, but only recomend the reader to these exellent books. Because the most complicated physical mechanisms are generated in the presence of powerful alternate high-frequency electromagnetic waves, creating plasma instabilities there due to the heating of regular ionospheric plasma, we will start our description of plasma instabilities with those that are accompanied by heating phenomena in the ionosphere. 2.1 Physical Aspects of Nonlinear Phenomena in the Artificially Heated Ionospheric Plasma In ionospheric plasma under interaction with powerful alternate radio waves, an oscillatory speed of plasma electrons (ions — plasma is quasineutral; see Section 1.2), v v , is generated in the field of the high-frequency radio wave (we consider here the HF = VHF frequency band), where the angular frequency of the wave v ¼ 2 p f . The radiated wave frequency f essentially exceeds the characteristic plasma frequencies such as the gyrofrequency of electrons, v H , or the plasma frequency, v p , defined in Chapter 1. Then, for the incident field presented in the form of the plane wave [6], E t / E v exp i ( v t \u0003 kr ) fg (2 : 1) and, by following its relations with the amplitude of the oscillatory field and the frequency, we can obtain for the magnitude of the oscillatory speed as v v jj ¼ e E v jj m v (2 : 2) Here, as earlier, e and m are the charge and mass, respectively, of the plasma electron. Conse- quently, the probability distribution function (pdf) of electrons f ( v 0 ) becomes dependent on v v ; i.e., f ( v 0 ) ) f ( v 0 þ v v ), and its main momentums, N ¼ Ð f ( v 0 )d v 0 , N v ¼ Ð f ( v 0 ) v 0 d v 0 , and NT \u0005 Ð f ( v 0 ) v 0 ðÞ 2 d v 0 , are also changed. The changes of the first three momentums, for concen- tration, impulse, and temperature (energy), lead to hydrodynamic effects in plasma. At the same time, the deformation of the corresponding pdf is responsible for the occurrence of kinetic effects in plasma. All these effects can be illustrated by new hydrodynamic and kinetic equations, differing from those presented in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 for the description of processes occurring in regular, nondisturbed ionospheric plasma. Following Ref. [6], we will present them with illustrations of the specific role of each term in the description of different nonlinear phenomena occurring in the field of powerful alternate radio waves in the ionosphere.

In hydrodynamic approximation, the first term in Equation 2.3 describes heating effects caused by collisions between electrons and ions and neutral molecules and atoms. It is an additional source of a new type of nonlinearity occurring in the ionospheric plasma, caused by the ambient alternate electric field of radio waves perturbing the regular ionospheric plasma. The nature of this kind of nonlinearity, defined earlier as thermal nonlinearity , is easy to understand if one takes into account that the mass of electrons is less than that of ions and atoms (see Section 1.1). Thus, electrons cannot transfer the energy of heating to ions and atoms during their mutual collisions. Finally, the electron mean free path becomes equal to the mean path between collisions, during which it can be heated, even in a weak electrical field of the wave. In this case, the permittivity and conductivity of plasma become dependent on the field strength magnitude; i.e., e ¼ e ( E v ) and s ¼ s ( E v ). In this situation, the Ohm law does not satisfy the well-known relation between the current density j and the vector of electric field of the wave, j ¼ s E v , and becomes dependent on the field strength magnitude. As a result of such dependence, thermal nonlinearity occurs in plasma [6,13,14], changing electromagnetic processes in plasma and, therefore, influencing the propagation of probing radio waves through the thermally perturbed ionospheric regions. Consequently, all this leads to generation of nonlinear disturbances of plasma density and changes of plasma permittivity, which can be estimated as [13,14]: D e T / E v jj 2 E 2 p (2 : 7) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 28 26.3.2008 9:18pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 28 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"where E 2 p ¼ 3 m k T e d 0 ( v 2 þ n 2 e a ) e 2 \u0005 17 : 6 \u0006 10 \u0003 10 \u0006 T e d 0 ( v 2 þ n 2 e a )(2 : 8) is the intensity of the plasma intrinsic field caused by penetrating alternate electric fields of the powerful radio wave with the radiated frequency f ¼ v = 2 p and with the plasma temperature determined by electrons, T e (in degrees); d 0 is the average fraction of energy lost by each electron during one collision; n e a ¼ n em þ n ei is the effective frequency of electron collisions with ions ( a ¼ i ) and neutrals ( a ¼ m ). Estimations presented in Refs. [13,14] have shown that in the ionosphere at altitudes from 100 to 400 km, with an increase in the frequency of carrier signals from 5 to 100 MHz and in the effective radiated power of radio waves from 10 2 to 10 6 kW, the parameter of plasma permittivity variations, D e T , can change its magnitude from 10 1 to 10 3 at the lower ionosphere ( h < 150 – 160 km) and from 10 \u0003 5 to 10 1 at the upper ionosphere ( h > 250 – 300 km), respectively. At the same time, nonlinearity in hydrodynamic approximation occurs due to the pressure of light, called the striction force and described by the second term in Equation 2.3. Usually, this force plays an important role in the upper regular, nondisturbed ionosphere in the rare collisionless plasma. In the disturbed ionosphere, under the powerful field-heating conditions, this force prevails in conditions in which the characteristic scales of field-perturbed plasma irregularities are less than the electron mean free path. This force is called a light pressure because the inhomogeneous ambient, alternating electric field of the wave compresses the plasma due to pressure on its electron component [15,16]. Consequently, the plasma density and, therefore, the dielectric permittivity of plasma become dependent on the amplitude E v of this wave field — i.e., N ¼ N 0 þ d N ( E v ) and e ¼ e 0 þ D e ( E v ) — finally, causing the nonlinearity of the electrodynamic processes occurring in the ionospheric plasma. This nonlinear mechanism is frequently called striction nonlinearity , which occurs in plasma in the field of powerful radio waves. The corresponding striction force can be found after averaging the intensity of the radio wave, E v E * v , over the high frequency [6]: F st jj ¼ e \u0003 1 8 p r E v jj 2 (2 : 9) The corresponding striction nonlinearity leads to local disturbances of plasma permittivity [16]: D e st / e 2 E v jj 2 8 mT e v 2 (2 : 10) In a couple of studies [13,14], such plasma permittivity perturbations were estimated for different magnitudes of radiowave power and radiation frequencies. Thus, at ionosphere heights beyond 150 – 160 km for radiated frequencies of 5 to 100 MHz, D e st varies in the range of 10 \u0003 2 to 10 \u0003 7 , respectively. Hence, with an increase in radiated frequencies of powerful radio waves penetrating the ionospheric plasma, deviations of plasma permittivity become indispenable. A comparison between these two kinds of plasma nonlinearity showed that in the ionospheric plasma at altitudes under consideration, h ¼ 50 – 400 km, thermal nonlinearity significantly exceeds striction nonlinearity and plays a major role in the description of most nonlinear processes accompaning plasma heating by a powerful radio wave. Therefore, in our subsequent discussions, Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 29 26.3.2008 9:18pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 29"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"we will pay special attention to the thermal collision processes causing thermal nonlinearities in the perturbed ionosphere. However, we have to point out that striction nonlinearity is adequate not only in the rare upper ionospheric plasma, at altitudes beyond 400 km, but also in nonstationary processes of short pulses propagation in plasma [17], the duration of which is less than the time of the electron-free run between collisions with ions and atoms. The last term in Equation 2.3, containing the gradient of temperature, r T e , describes a pressure force, F T ¼\u0003 N r T e , caused by heating of plasma in the field of a powerful alternate radio wave penetrating into the depth of the ionosphere. As for Equation 2.4, it contains the additional term \u0001 ^ s e E v E v *, which determines plasma nonlinear heating in the field of powerful alternate radio waves, due to electron collisions with ions and atoms of plasma, described by the second term of Equation 2.4, where d e a ¼ ( d ei n ei þ d em n em ) = ( n ei þ n em ). Associated with the gradi- ent of temperature, D T e , thermodiffusion occurs in plasma, which is described by the third term of Equation 2.4, where k is the thermoconductivity. Together with thermodiffusion and cooling, due to the relaxation of electron temperature during collision, the effect of further heating by high- power waves changes the balance of charged particles in the ionospheric plasma, finally, causing the generation of nonlinear current through plasma ( \u0001 j N ¼\u0003 eN v v v ), as described by the terms in the left-hand side of Equation 2.5 for conservation of charge particles in plasma. In this equation, apart from the electron temperature dependence of thermo-ionization, q ( T e ), and of the recombination rate, a ( T e ), a nonlinear current, j N , may introduce a sufficient contribution to the development of artificial ionospheric turbulence (AIT) at lower ionospheric altitudes due to the occurrence there of longitudinal plasma waves ( N v ¼ k v \u0006 v v N = v ) [18,19]. The heating process, following from Equation 2.5, decreases the rate of dissociative recombin- ation, a d ( T e ) / T \u0003 n , where n ¼ 0.7 – 1.2, and, consequently, increases plasma concentration in regions perturbed by powerful radio waves, mostly at heights of 130 to 180 km, where this recombination process is predominant. The first conclusion that follows from the qualitative analysis of only those hydrodynamic effects in which the changes of pdf described by the kinetic Equation 2.6 do not play any special role is that the existence of thermal nonlinearity leads to further heating of the ionospheric plasma and, in turn, to the redistribution of plasma density caused by the heating. This effect is more evident in the lower- and middle-latitude ionosphere. The same effects, but for the high- latitude ionosphere, can be observed due to the gradient of pressure of light \u0001j E v j 2 ,wherethe striction force causes striction nonlinearity [18,19]. At lower ionospheric altitudes ( h < 100 km), changes of the recombination coefficient a ( T e ) in Equation 2.5 relate to temperature dependence of the coefficient of attachment of electrons to molecules and atoms, b ( T e ), and the creation of negative ions [7]: b ( T e ) ¼ b 0 ( T e 0 ) \u0006 T e 0 T e exp 700 T e 0 \u0003 700 T e \u0004\u0005 (2 : 11) Here, T e 0 is the nondisturbed temperature of electrons in the regular ionospheric plasma, and T e ¼ T e 0 þ d T , the perturbed electron temperature caused by the heating process of plasma in the field of alternate high-power electromagnetic wave. Furthermore, heating of electrons by powerful alternate radio waves leads to change in frequency of collisions between electrons and ions, n ei ( T e ) / T \u0003 3 = 2 e , and between electrons and neutrals, n em ( T e ) \u0005 n em ( T e 0 )( T e = T e 0 ) 5 = 6 [6]. It is clear that the first frequency decreases with an increase in electron temperature at altitudes above 150 km, where this type of collision prevails, whereas the second frequency increases as the electron temperature rises at altitudes Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 30 26.3.2008 9:18pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 30 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"below 120 to 130 km, where this type of collisions is predominant. Such temperature dependences of collision frequencies change the absorption of probing radio waves propagating through the heat- perturbed regions of the ionosphere. This effect depends on the relationship between the frequen- cies of probing waves, f pr ¼ v pr = 2 p , and the collision frequency, n e ¼ n ei þ n em . Thus, for v pr > n e , absorption increases sharply with an increase in the energy of heating (i.e., temperature T e ). When a strong wave penetrates into the ionospheric plasma (e.g., its strength E 0 exceeds the plasma field E p defined by Equation 2.8), the wave cannot do so deeply due to strong absorption of its energy. As shown in the Refs. [13,14], a saturation of the field intensity is produced in the interior of the plasma layer, where the wave amplitude ceases to depend on the heating power of the wave incident at the boundary of this plasma layer. In the other limiting case of v pr > n e , the absorption decreases with an increase of power in the wave field. In this limiting case the ionospheric plasma may become transparent to the high-power radio waves. Moreover, the changes in times of power of strong radio wave, as a heater of plasma, modulate the amplitude of probing radio wave passing through the perturbed heated plasma layers, finally changing its own modulation. This means that if a high-power wave with frequency v 1 affects the ionospheric plasma and then some probing wave with frequency v 2 passes through the perturbed ionospheric area, the law of its absorption and propagation is changed according to the modulation effect of the powerful wave. This effect can be considered as an interaction of two waves in the same area of plasma. For E p \u0007 E 0 , this change of modulation, which induces a large absorption of the probing wave and leads to a cross-modulation effect between waves, can be significant and is defined in the literature as the Luxemburg-Gorky effect [13,14,19]. This nonlinear interaction also leads to the generation of new radio waves with combining frequencies of v 2 \b v 1 , v 2 \b 2 v 1 , and so on, and is often used for investigation of parameters of the lower ionosphere by analyzing waveforms of radio pulses reflected from the D and E layers of the ionosphere. At the same time, for E p \u0007 E 0 ,a strong radio wave can suppress other radio waves propagating through the perturbed heated ionospheric regions. The dependence of n em on T e can be an additional source of temperature dependence of the friction force F c / n e a ( T e )( v \u0003 v a ), which causes changes in the electron-speed component oriented perpendicular to the lines of the geomagnetic field, B 0 , with unit vector b ¼ B 0 = j B 0 j . The source of such electron movements may be either the ambient electric field E 0 or interactions between plasma electron (ions; plasma is quasineutral) and neutral molecules moving with the speed U m of the neutral gas; i.e., v a \u0002 U m , a ¼ e,i [20,21].

Further, v a H ¼ e a B 0 jj m a c (2 : 13b) gives the hydromantic frequencies of electrons ( a ¼ e ) and ions ( a ¼ i ), where the corresponding sign ( ‘‘ \u0003 ’’ for electrons and ‘‘ þ ’’ for ions) must be taken into account.

As a result, an artificial low-frequency radiation of the ionosphere is recorded by the ground-based facilities during experimental heating of the ionosphere by strong radio waves [22] and is success- fully used for diagnostics of currents occurring in the modified ionosphere [23]. In the literature, this is also called the detection effect of the ionosphere [13,14]. Generally speaking, nonlinear interactions between powerful and probing waves can explain the generation of other types of electromagnetic (namely, whistlers), magnetohydrodynamic, electro-acoustic, and ion-acoustic waves in the perturbed ionosphere by powerful radiowaves, called nonlinear wave transformation in the literature [7,8,13,14]. If the heating region of the ionosphere is so extensive that one can eliminate processes of thermoconductivity, thermodiffusion, and runaway of plasma electrons, the local heating effects described previously are predominant. Conversely, in the limiting case of small heated areas, the effects of nonlocal heating become predominant, causing spatial distribution of plasma density. The effect of nonlocal heating stems from analysis of Equation 2.4 for the electron temperature T e , the simple solution of which can be obtained in the form of its spatial Fourier component [6]: T e k ¼ 2 e 2 3 m e v 2 d T 1 \u0003 e \u0003 d T n e t \u0001\u0002 \u0006 E v jj 2 (2 : 14) where d T ¼ d þ k 2 ? r 2 He þ k 2 jj L 2 e (2 : 15) and r He ¼ v Te = v He is the Larmor radius of electrons in the ambient magnetic field, v Te , the thermal velocity of electron, L e , the length of the free path of the electron between collisions with ions and atoms, v He , the hydromagnetic frequency of the electron, d , the fraction of energy trans- mitted by electrons during their nonelastic int eractions with other components of plasma, k k ¼ 2 p =‘ k and k ? ¼ 2 p =‘ ? , ‘ k and ‘ ? are the characteristic scales of temperature plasma inhomogeneities in the direction of the magnetic vector B 0 , normal to the plane containing vector B 0 .

The role of the chemical recombin- ation process is predominant if the time of this processes, t ch , is less than the time of diffusion, i.e., t ch < t D .

We will now consider another interesting phenomenon which is determined by the wavelength l of the powerful radio wave, i.e., by the minimum scale of the field of this wave, l . This phenomenon is related to the occurrence of the standing electromagnetic wave created by inter- ference of the direct radio wave and the wave reflected from the ionosphere (see Figure 2.1). For example, if a probing radio wave with a frequency of 6 MHz is reflected from the ionosphere, the characteristic scale equals l ¼ l = 2, or 25 m, at the altitude where the refractive index equals unity, i.e., n ( f ) \u0005 1. In the proximity of the reflection level due to the decrease of refractive index n caused by the heating process, the scale l can be increased. Simultaneously, the amplitude of the wave field is also increased because of temporal compression of the wave packet, i.e., according to the decrease of the group velocity of the wave. Due to a run of heated plasma from regions of maximum of the wave field in the ionosphere, a new kind of plasma perturbation, the periodical structures of plasma density, are generated, which strongly scatter probing radio waves sent from a diagnostic ground-based transmitter. Using this scattering effect, it is easy to measure the major parameters of such artificial periodical irregularities (API) [24 – 30]. The nonlinear effects occurring during interference of the direct and the reflected radio waves from the ionosphere can be a good example and a good illustration of the propagation phenomena discussed previously and presented schematically in Figure 2.1.

At altitudes of h \u0005 70 – 95 km the main contribution to the disintegration of API is determined by turbulent diffusion of the neutrals, and at altitudes h \u0005 95 – 130 km the process is controlled by ion laminar diffusion along magnetic field lines (mostly for h > 100 km, i.e., at the heights of turbopause ) [7]. Finally, at altitudes of the higher ionosphere where the length of free path of plasma species significantly exceeds the dimensions of API, the main process of generation and disintegration of periodical plasma structures is the runaway of plasma along magnetic field lines under the influence of striction forces described by Equation 2.3. Because the noncollision regime describes the existence of ion-sound waves, the nonstationary API can excite these waves [24]. The efficiency of excitation of ion-sound waves by API depends on collision or noncollision damping (called Landau attenuation [13]) of these unstable waves (for details see Ref. [24]). 2.2 Interaction of Probing Radio Waves with Heating-Induced Plasma Instabilities Generated by Strong Radio Waves It is important to note that near the level of reflection of the powerful radio wave from the ionosphere some new effects occur under its interaction with ionospheric plasma [31 – 56]. Here, a wide spectrum of waves can be generated, such as slow plasma waves with the frequency close to the frequency of radio wave. Therefore, it is possible to observe experimentally a mutual transformation of these waves and the electromagnetic radiation from the ionosphere. Let us briefly describe such effects and the corresponding instabilities occurring in the perturbed ionosphere. In plasma consisting of different kinds of disturbances, the absorption of additional energy from powerful radio waves at the frequencies which are in resonance with the plasma frequencies, the energy from the waves can be transferred to plasma disturbances to increase their density. Finally, the so-called resonance instability in regions where such resonances take place is generated in the field of strong radio waves. As shown in Ref. [40], such kinds of instabilities stimulate the generation of small-scale plasma irregularities elongated along the geomagnetic field lines in the region of reflection of the ordinary wave. Such inhomogeneities can be detected by observation of the scattering of probing waves at VHF and UHF frequency bands from the perturbed regions of the ionosphere (see Chapter 7). To understand this phenomena, we depicted schematically in Figure 2.2 at the plane z , n 2 z \u0006\u0007 the dispersive curves for high-frequency ordinary ( O ) and non- ordinary ( z -mode) electromagnetic waves in the ionosphere, as well as the quasilongitudinal component (with respect to geomagnetic lines) of the O -mode (dashed curve).

From Figure 2.2 it can be seen that in the height region, where v uh \u0007 v \u0007 v e 0 , it is possible to transform the probing wave to other types of waves without adequate changes in frequency (jumping from one dispersive curve to another along the vertical line). For such a transformation it is necessary that in the medium of the first wave (powerful one) the alternate current is excited with the frequency v \u0005 v e 0 and the wave number k \u0005 k jj \u0002 k l . From laws of conservation of energy and impulse in the approximation of interaction of three waves, it follows that for this case v e ¼ v þ V and k ¼ k l \b k , where k is the wave vector, V and k are the frequency and the wave spectrum, respectively, of the Fourier component of the plasma wave (instability) polarized in the field of the powerful wave. Transforming a radio wave to a plasma wave with n l \u0002 n z 1, we have k l k and k \u0005 k l . The latter means that for such transformation in plasma the instabilities, having scales ‘ ¼ 2 p = k significantly less than l , can be easily generated. Therefore, in plasma nonlinear phenomena with the characteristic scales of the field essentially less than l can be generated, because in the case of a strong plasma wave the spatial structure of interaction will be determined by l l \u0005 f = cn l , f ¼ v = 2 p [36,37]. The plasma waves that generate strong plasma inhomogeneities can be sufficiently intensive even when the comparably small transformation of radio waves into plasma waves occurs. Thus, in the homogeneous ambient plasma the field strength of plasma waves in the region of their interaction equals E l \u0005 E v d N v = n e , where d N is the relative amplitude of plasma inhomogeneities responsible for such wave trans- formation. The characteristic length of induced plasma (nonordinary) waves can be changed from l 0 ¼ f = c up to units of a few centimeters, i.e., close to the Debay radius of electrons r De ¼ v Te = v eo , which, in the ionosphere, changes from 1 cm to few centimeters. In the inverse case of k l r De > 1, a strong collisionless absorption of plasma waves at the thermal electrons is observed [56]. The longitudinal waves with k l jj b have scales much less than the length of the free path; therefore, their effects on plasma are caused exclusively by the striction force F st .

What is important is that the plasma wave created by the transformation of a radio wave in natural plasma fluctuations or in the sharp regular gradients of plasma concentration can, due to interference with the ‘‘ mother ’’ radio wave, create the quasistanding structures, which can be considered as a generator of the forces F T and F st , by averaging them at the high frequency. Finally, the intensity of these plasma perturbations is r E v jj 2 /r \t ( E l E t * þ E t * E l ) / k e \t ( E l E t * þ E t * E l ) (2 : 17) As a result, due to runaway of plasma under the action of F st or due to plasma thermodiffusion under the action of F T , new disturbances of plasma density are created, which amplify the wave transformation. This is called parametric instability , if the striction mechanism is predominant, or thermal parametric instability , if thermodynamic processes are predominant. Both instabilities are upper limited. However, their upper limit does not depend on contrast of perturbations, because F st and F F are proportional to E l , i.e., proportional to d N linearly and increases linearly with increase of ionospheric height. At the same time, the process of relaxation of such plasma structures deter- mined by the gradient of pressure is also proportional to d N . In this case, the upper limits of instability excitation are defined by other dissipative processes. First, we will consider the nondissipative parametric instability, which occurred in the plasma- resonance regions due to the striction effect. The time of generation of such instabilities is less than the electron ’ s free-path time and leads to the absorption and attenuation of plasma waves. Taking into account Equation 2.2 with v ¼ v e 0 , the constraint F st > F T ¼ ( T e þ T i ) r N , and the fact that the longitudinal electric field of plasma waves equals E l / N N 0 v n e h 1 = 2 , we finally get: E 2 0 8 p N 0 ( T e þ T i ) > n e v \u0002 (2 : 18a) Here, the parameter h is introduced to take into account the inhomogeneous plasma effects; N 0 is the concentration of background nonperturbed ionospheric plasma. Strict kinetic calculations made in Ref. [18] lead, for h ¼ 1, to the existence in the right-hand side of (Equation 2.18a) of a product \u0001 4 in the dominator. Note that one of the solutions for nondissipative parametric instability in plasma is the ion-sound waves generation due to transformation of radio waves to plasma waves. The ion-sound waves lead to nonlinear generation of noise and additional absorption of wave energy in plasma [7,8]. However, in plasma, with an increase of T e = T i , the attenuation of ion-sound waves, due to collisions of electrons with ions, is decreased, and the level of instability is decreased compared with Equation 2.18a. For T e = T i > 7, in the right-hand side of this inequality, exists the small term \u0005 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 p m e = M i p [6]. For thermal parametric instability, following from relation between F T and F st (2.16), F T / N r T e / F st = d , and from the condition F T F st / ( T e þ T i ) r N , we get [6]: E 2 0 8 p N 0 ( T e þ T i ) > dn e v \u0002 (2 : 18b) The increment of parametric instability is easy to estimate from the following assumptions.

For h ¼ 1, Equation 2.20 for g is the same, with an accuracy of the coefficient \u0001 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 = p p , as that obtained strictly in Refs. [14,52]. In the same manner we can obtain the expression for the increment of thermal parametric instability . The difference is that in this case the ion velocity in plasma v i \u0005 F T \u0003 ( T e þ T i ) r N ½\t M i N 0 (2 : 21) is determined by the corresponding regime of diffusion (defined either by the longitudinal-to- magnetic-field coefficient of ion diffusion in the lower ionosphere or by the perpendicular- to-magnetic-field coefficient of ion diffusion in the upper ionosphere [10]). It should be noted that the increment of thermal parametric instability is essentially smaller compared with the increment of parametric instability; the latter can achieve 10 2 \u0003 10 3 s \u0003 1 . The plasma waves generated in such a manner are scattered at the inhomogeneities of plasma density in the directions k ¼ k e \u0003 k 0 e ,where k 0 e is the wave vector of the scattered plasma waves. The scattered waves must satisfy the corresponding dispersion equation, which, ignoring electromagnetic effects ( k l k 0 ), is the following: v 2 e ¼ v 2 e 0 þ v 2 He sin 2 a þ 3 v 2 Te k 2 l , v He \u000b v e 0 (2 : 22) In general, the dispersion equation for plasma waves has the following form [57]: 3 uwk 4 l \u0003 (1 \u0003 u \u0003 w þ uw cos 2 a ) k 2 l þ [2(1 \u0003 w ) 2 þ uw cos 2 a \u0003 u (2 \u0003 w )] k 2 0 ¼ 0 (2 : 23) where u ¼ v 2 He = v 2 , w ¼ v 2 e 0 = v 2 , k 0 ¼ v = c : Therefore, during scattering from the ionospheric plasma region with n l > 1 containing stationary inhomogeneities (i.e., without changes of plasma frequency v e 0 ), a decrease in the absolute value of the wave vector is accompanied by an increase in the angle of scattering a . In the region of v \u0005 v e 0 , where E v k b and plasma waves with small a are excited intensively, a further scattering process with an increase of a leads to the occurrence of plasma waves with small wave numbers k l . Consequently, the plasma waves generated first must be with ‘‘ short-lengths, ’’ i.e., k l r He > 1 = ffiffiffi 3 p [38], to orient the vector of scattering wave k l to be perpendicular to B 0 .

This change is related to the inhomogeneous character of the field and its amplification near the level of reflection. The existence of waves with a \u0005 p = 2 near the level of reflection can lead to the existence of small-scale thermal scattering from ionospheric plasma. Such inhomogeneities of heat propagate with the velocity of longitudinal electron diffusion to magnetic field lines in the region of upper-hybrid resonance (UHR), accelerating in this region the transformation of the probing radio wave in plasma waves. In the region of UHR scattering of plasma waves occurs with decrease of angle a and with increase of k l . Here, scattering can lead to a tendency for k l to be isotropic in the plane orthogonal to B 0 . When the amplitudes of plasma waves achieve magnitudes for which E l \u0005 h 1 = 2 E v d N v = n e > E v , the forces F T and F st will be fully determined by the interference of longitudinal plasma waves. Here, new effects occur, such as the explored fast increase of the amplitude of small-scale instabilities of plasma, where @ N @ t / N 2 v E 2 v [36], and the disintegration of plasma wave on the same wave but with a lower frequency ( v e ¼ v 0 e þ V ), i.e., on the ion-sound waves with V ¼ k v s , where v s is the sound speed, the attachment of waves, and so on [39 – 55]. As mentioned previously, waves due to scattering at the plasma inhomogeneities are transformed into radio waves, which leads to the existence of artificial electromagnetic radiation (AER) of ionosphere, the frequency of which differs from that of the exciting wave [19,42 – 44]. In some ionospheric heating experiments AER was decoded at frequen- cies f ¼ 100 \u0003 300 kHz [43,44]. High-frequency plasma instability with k l k b , having phase velocities close to velocities of photo-electrons, can lead to their acceleration up to energies corresponding to the energy of ionization of atmospheric neutral atoms (molecules) at the altitudes of F layer of the ionosphere and the lightness of the ionosphere [45]. However, such effects cannot be described by the hydrodynamic Equations 2.3 through 2.5 and we need to use the strict kinetic approach based on Equation 2.6. We should also mention other interesting effects accompanied by active modification of the ionosphere by powerful radio waves, such as the oblique sounding of waves [46 – 49], effects of high-frequency waves, effects related to sporadic E layer [50,51], and so on (see Chapter 7), each of which is based on physical phenomena described previously at the qualitative level to understand the major nonlinear effects occurring in the ionospheric plasma perturbed by heating processes. The preceding explanation is enough to illustrate to the reader the fact that under the influence of high-power alternate electromagnetic waves a complex of new phenomena and corresponding instabilities can be generated in the ionosphere. Investigations into these allow us not only to obtain information about the parameters of plasma but also to perform ionospheric experiments that can excite such phenomena in the ionospheric plasma, which either do not exist or are not observed in the pristine natural conditions of the ionosphere [39 – 56]. 2.3 Plasma Instabilities of Natural Origin Generated in the Irregular Ionosphere We will now put the question, can the same heating-induced or current-induced plasma instabil- ities having a natural origin be generated by natural phenomena occurring in the ionosphere, and what types of instabilities are responsible for the creation of plasma irregularities observed from the equator to the polar cap in the real ionosphere? The problem here is that there is a wide spectrum of Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 38 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 38 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"small-, moderate-, and large-scale natural plasma structures (turbulences) observed experimentally in the real ionosphere at different altitudes of regions E and F [20,59 – 79], covering all regions from the equator to the polar cap [80 – 96]. This fact excludes the possibility of describing their creation and further temporal and spatial evolution by any unified physical mechanism or universal theoretical approach. Following from previous sections, heating-induced plasma irregularities can be generated by local heating of the ionosphere with powerful radio waves, which finally generates parametric and striction instabilities in plasma. The same effects can be observed in the real ionosphere in other natural conditions, so that nonisothermal conditions occur in the ionospheric plasma [58] during heating of plasma particles by electric fields (due to fluctuations of the ambient electric field as a local heater of ionospheric plasma [59,60]). Plasma instabilities can also be generated by the wind of neutral molecules (atoms) [61], by drift in crossing ambient electrical and magnetic fields (usually denoted as E \u0004 B drift [70 – 76]), and by other current-induced two-stream instabilities [97 – 101]. At the same time, most natural small-, moderate-, and large-scale plasma structures observed experimen- tally in the auroral and equatorial ionosphere can be explained by the existence of plasma waves caused by convergent-current and gradient-current instabilities [20,65 – 79,98,102 – 118]. All these phenomena can be unified as the natural sources of plasma instabilities in the regular ionosphere. We now briefly discuss heating-induced (or thermal) and current-induced instabilities as the main sources of the small-, moderate-, and large-scale plasma density perturbations, d N , which can be either positive or negative compared to non-disturbed background ionospheric plasma density N 0 . Usually, a case in which d N > 0 is called plasma density enhancements , and one in which d N < 0 is called plasma density depletions [70 – 77]. Before describing different kinds of instabilities of the ionospheric plasma caused by a wide spectrum of morphological and dynamical processes occurring in the ionosphere, we will first give some physical examples. As suggested in Refs. [71 – 74], in the equatorial ionosphere, the electrojet region is unstable for gradient-drift processes, when E \u0006r N 0 > 0. The gradient-drift instability generates long-length perturbations (e.g., waves) with wavelengths of 100 m and more, up to 10 km, when the diffusion relaxation process (which usually decreases growth of such instabilities) is sufficiently weak. Such large-scale plasma perturbations as primary waves observed in the equatorial electroject can generate small-scale secondary gradient-drift waves propagating at large flow angles to the ambient E 0 \u0004 B 0 drift. Thus, the nonlinear cascade wave interactions can be assumed to be the main mechanism of generation of small-scale plasma irregularities usually observed in the equatorial ionosphere [71 – 74]. As for the high-latitude ionosphere, because of a strong electric field and neutral winds that are sharply height-structured, plasma perturbations with scales from thousands of kilometers to tens of centimeters are observed experimentally, and can be explaind also by the interaction of large-scale and small-scale plasma waves, i.e., by the cascade mechanisms of plasma instability generation [70,75 – 77]. Plasma perturbations (i.e., waves) of a large range of scales, from tens to hundreds of kilometers creating diffuse spread-F traces observed by ionosondes in the middle-latitude ionosphere [78,79], are also evidence of a complicated nonlinear mechanism of plasma waves interaction. The unstable processes mentioned previously cannot be understood using linear theory alone [80 – 101]. Based on nonlinear phenomena and the corresponding physical models, the effects of the generation of small- scale plasma perturbations in the background of large-scale plasma disturbances may finally be explained by strict physical phenomena [98,100 – 118]. We will later discuss both linear and nonlinear approaches to these phenomena and deal with the analysis of plasma instabilities growth, interactions, and dumping.

Here, as in Section 2.1, we have to differentiate between the phenomena and effects that can be described by a purely hydrodynamic approach based on Equations 2.3 through 2.5, and by an approach based on kinetic equations, such as Equation 2.6 for the distribution functions of electrons and ions. At the same time, as shown in Refs. [20,65,66], the methodology of hydrodynamic and kinetic description of waves in the ionospheric plasma produces approximately the same physical results if the spatial dimensions of plasma instabilities along and across the geomagnetic field B 0 exceed the free-path length, ‘ a ¼ v T a = n \u0003 , and the Larmor radii, r H a ¼ v T a = v H a , of plasma electrons ( a ¼ e ) and ions ( a ¼ i ), respectively. All these parameters are introduced in Section 1.1. Furthermore, some limits for temporal scales of plasma parameter deviations must be satisfied. Thus, for plasma waves with frequency v p and wave vector k p , a condition to use only the hydrodynamic approach based on the systems (Equations 2.3 through 2.5) can be written as [20,65]: v p \u0003 k p V a 0 \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b n a \u000b 1(2 : 24a) Here, for a ¼ e , n e ¼ n em þ n ei , and, for a ¼ i , n i ¼ n im þ n ei , V a 0 are the nondisturbed velocities of plasma electrons ( a ¼ e ) and ions ( a ¼ i ) in the quasi-uniform nondisturbed ionosphere. Com- parison between results of purely kinetic and purely hydrodynamic analysis of instabilities caused by natural sources in the ionosphere showed that near the threshold of instability of plasma, the limitation (Equation 2.24a) corresponds to weaker [67] and even still weaker equations [68], respectively: v p \u0003 k p V a 0 \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b n a \u0007 0 : 1or v p \u0003 k p V a 0 \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b n a \u0007 1(2 : 24b) We will now start to investigate thermal instabilities for which Equation 2.24 are valid, and we can describe the processes of their generation based on a purely hydrodynamic approach. It is obvious that during local heating of the ionosphere we first observe fluctuations of temperature and concentration of the ionospheric plasma, as the first-order parameters of plasma (see definitions introduced in Chapter 1). These deviations create changes of the second-order parameters of plasma (see Chapter 1) such as collisional frequencies of the plasma-charged particles, n a ( a ¼ e,i ), and the coefficient of recombination b ¼ a eff N 2 (where a eff denotes the rate of recombination of charged particles).

They are simply related with usually used tensors of conductivity of charged particles (see Chapter 1): ^ s e ¼ eN ^ m e and ^ s i ¼ ZeN ^ m i (2 : 28) Presented before the system of Equations 2.26 and 2.27 is the basic system in our further analysis of heating-induced plasma instabilities. Mathematical derivations used for this analysis, are very complicated (see Refs. [57 – 67]). Therefore, we will deal with the final results of various researches [57 – 67] and discuss only the physical mechanisms of generation of nonisothermal plasma oscillations. 2.3.1.1 Recombination Instability We start with the recombination instability, which creates the small-scale plasma disturbances in the ionosphere [63,64]. As shown in Refs. [63,64], such instability develops due to heating of plasma electrons by intrinsic (polarized) electric fields and, therefore, due to a decrease in the rate of recombination of plasma-charged particles within the areas of heating of the low (usually E region) ionosphere. We will now present the plasma wave frequency in the complex form, by introducing the increment of instability growth, g , i.e., v ¼ v r þ i g . Then, following the solutions of the dispersion equation of plasma wave obtained in Refs. [63,64], we obtain the corresponding expressions for the nondisturbed frequency v r and for the increment of recombination instability g R of the disturbed ionospheric plasma: v r ¼ kV i 0 k ^ m e k þ kV e 0 k ^ m i k k ^ m k (2 : 29a) g R ¼\u0003 3 2 d b 0 d t m Pe kE 0 kU 0 d em n em k ^ m k \u0003 b 0 \u0003 D 0 B Q H k ^ m i kk ^ m e k k ^ m k (2 : 29b) Here, U 0 ¼ V i 0 \u0003 V e 0 is the difference between the nondisturbed velocity of plasma ions and electrons, D 0 ¼ C 2 s = n i is the coefficient of ion diffusion, n i ¼ n im þ n ei , the total frequency of ion – neutral and ion – electron collisions, C 2 s ¼ ( T e þ T i ) = M i , the velocity of ion sound waves, m Pe ¼ e \u0012 p þ (1 þ Q 2 H ) \u0013 = m e n em \u0012 (1 þ p 2 ) þ q 2 H (1 þ Q 2 H ) \u0013 , the Pedersen component of the mobil- ity of electrons (other components can be obtained from relation 2.28 and the corresponding expressions of components of the tensor of conductivity of electrons and ions presented in Section 1.1). Recombination instability can be developed in the region of high-latitude ionosphere caused by ambient electric fields, as heater, of E 0 > 40 mV = m [61]. Thermal instabilities occur due to increase of the polarized field at the sites of plasma depletion and its heating by polarization electric fields [59,60,62,64]. We now consider the source of the free energy of plasma as a heater equaling the difference between the full energy and the internal plasma energy, as its source nonisothermally Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 42 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 42 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"(e.g., T e 0 > T i 0 \u0005 T m 0 ). Then the condition of plasma instability in the absence of ambient electric fields can be simplified as [59] 3 2 þ 2 T e 0 T e 0 þ T i 0 \u0003 T e 0 T e 0 \u0003 T i 0 > 0(2 : 30) From the solution of this inequality (Equation 2.30), it follows that thermal instability develops for T e 0 = T i 0 > 1.58 [59]. When longitudinal electric fields exist in the ionosphere, they heat electrons and can generate instability of isothermal plasma if the strength of the longitudinal field exceeds the threshold that equals [60] E 0 kr jj ¼ T 2 e 0 e 2 1 þ k 2 ? k 2 jj 1 q H Q H ! k 2 jj þ 2 3 d em m e n em (1 þ p ) 2 q H Q H ! \"# 1 = 2 (2 : 31) For the small-scale inhomogeneities strongly stretched along the geomagnetic field B 0 (for which k ? = k jj > ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Q H q H p ), the magnitude of this critical longitudinal field was estimated as E kr jj \u0005 3 \u0006 10 \u0003 4 mV = m [58 – 60]. Now analyzing the Pedersen component of ions ’ mobility that is easily obtain from Equation 2.28, and formulas presented in Section 1.1, we get m Pi ¼ Ze [1 þ p þ q 2 H ] = M i n im [(1 þ p ) 2 þ q 2 H (1 þ Q 2 H )]. Comparing this with that obtained from the electron component of plasma introduced earlier, one can find that m Pi exceeds m Pe at altitudes above 100 km (see also Section 1.1). This effect leads to the heating of ions by the perpendicular ambient electric fields occurring in the ionosphere. In this case, if the vector k ? is oriented along the ambient electric field E 0 , the condition of development of the thermal instability has the following form [60]: E 0 kr ? \r T 2 i 0 Z 2 e 2 1 þ q H Q H k 2 jj þ k 2 ? k 2 ? ! k 2 ? þ 2 3 r 2 Hi \f\r \"# 1 = 2 (2 : 32) where, as in Section 1.1, r Hi is the gyroradius of ions. Moreover, at altitudes of the E layer of the ionosphere, the wind of neutral molecules and atoms orients them along the geomagnetic field B 0 because of interactions with plasma ions, and causes additional polarization of plasma disturbances. In the sites of depletions (i.e., with the negative deviations of concentration, d N < 0), the polarization field increases the temperature of plasma. Finally, by action of thermodiffusion forces, plasma is pushed out from the depletion areas [64]. The threshold of values of the neutral wind, starting from where the increase of plane plasma waves (e.g., instabilities) is observed orthogonal to B 0 with k ? \u0007 2m \u0003 1 at altitudes h > 110 km equaling 80 – 140 m = s [58 – 64]. In the foregoing discussion, thermal instabilities were described by using a pure hydrodynamic approach. Unfortunately, in the nonequilibrium, nonstationary, high-latitude ionosphere small- scale plasma disturbances (turbulences) can be generated, with perpendicular (to B 0 ) dimensions less than, or at the same order of, the gyroradius of plasma ions. The hydrodynamic description is not valid for analyzing such plasma disturbances, and we need to use kinetic equations such as Equation 2.6 for distribution functions of plasma electrons and ions. The kinetic approach was used by many authors regarding the analysis of current instabilities [65,66], of ion-cyclotron Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 43 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 43"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"instability in the E layer of the ionosphere for waves with both k > r \u0003 1 Hi and k \u0007 r \u0003 1 Hi [67,68]. In the following text we discuss briefly such kinds of instabilities for which the hydrodynamic approach is not valid. 2.3.1.2 Kinetic Instability As mentioned previously, when the drift velocities of plasma exceed the thermal velocities of plasma ions, i.e., V d > v Ti , reaction of interactions between the ions with neutrals leads to anisotropy of velocity of ions, and their distribution function becomes anisotropy [69] f i ( v ) ¼ 1 2 \u0004 v 2 Tm \u0001\u0002 3 = 2 I 0 v ? V d v 2 Tm \f\r exp \u0003 v 2 jj þ v 2 ? þ V 2 d v 2 Tm () (2 : 33) We took into account here the following approximate relations [69,80]: T ? = T jj \u0005 1 þ V 2 d = 2 v 2 Tm . In Equation 2.33 I 0 ( . ) is the Bessel function of zero order. As shown in Refs. [69,80], the temperature anisotropy leads to the generation of so-called the Post – Rozenbluth plasma instability (defined by names of the corresponding researchers of [80]). The condition of creation of such a thermal instability is [80] ð @ f i ( v ) @ v ? d v ? v ? > 0(2 : 34) Introducing Equation 2.33 into this inequality (Equation 2.34) gives V 2 d v 2 Tm \u0003 2 \u000e\u000f I 0 V 2 d 4 v 2 Tm \f\r > V 2 d v 2 Tm I 2 V 2 d v 2 Tm \f\r (2 : 35) where I 2 ( . ) is the Bessel function of second order. From the constraint (Equation 2.35) it follows that V d = v Tm > 1.8 [69]; i.e., the instability can be generated for drift velocities of V d \r 1000 m = sin the ionospheric plasma. This electrostatic instability has frequency v 0 and increment g of the order of low-hybrid frequency of ions V Hi and a wave number of k / v 0 = V d ; i.e., a wave length of l \u0001 0.1 m. Here, the ratio of k ? = k jj \u0005 1 = 100; i.e., the high-anisotropic plasma inhomogeneities can be created from the generation of Post – Rozenbluth plasma thermal instabilities. Despite the fact that two-stream instability was fully investigated by using simple [98 – 100] and rigorously consistent [101,102] kinetic theory, physical conditions of its generation are not the same as mentioned earlier. Therefore, we will consider the two-stream instability growth and damping separately. In the following paragraphs, we will analyze a kind of kinetic instability differing from two-stream instability. 2.3.1.3 Kinetic Drift-Dissipative Instability If in the ionosphere the sharp small-scale gradients of plasma density are presented with the scale l < 100 m, then the drift-dissipative instability can be developed [81 – 83]. In this case the frequency of excited plasma waves v 0 is in the order of low-hybrid frequency of ions, and the increment of such plasma instability g CD can be presented in a more complicated form [81 – 83]: g CD ¼\u0003 v 2 0 kV di \f\r ffiffiffiffi p p v 0 \u0003 kV di ðÞ Y 0 kv Ti þ T i ( n em þ n ei )(1 \u0003 Y 0 ) T e v 0 1 þ T e kV di T i v 0 \f\r \u000e\u000f (2 : 36) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 44 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 44 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"where V di ¼ v 2 Ti = v Hi l is the drift velocity of ions, Y 0 ¼ I 0 k 2 r 2 He 2 \u0010\u0011 exp \u0003 k 2 r 2 He 2 hi . This instability can be developed only if the following condition takes place: V di v Ti \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b > ( n em þ n ei ) ffiffiffiffi p p v Hi m e M i \f\r 1 = 2 (1 \u0003 Y 0 ) k r He (2 þ k 2 l 2 Di \u0003 Y 0 )(2 þ k 2 l 2 Di ) 2(1 \u0003 Y 0 ) þ k 2 l 2 Di \"# (2 : 37) where l 2 Di ¼ v 2 Ti = 2 v 2 Pi . Such instability generates waves with a wavelength less than that of gyroradius of plasma ions. The threshold of such instability development defined by inequality (Equation 2.37) depends essentially on the plasma concentration because l \u0001 N \u0003 1 = 3 0 and, for N 0 ¼ 10 4 cm \u0003 3 , l \u0005 100 m. Plasma irregularities of such scales with j d N = N 0 j\u0005 1 have often been observed in the F region of the auroral ionosphere [84]. 2.3.2 Current-Induced Natural Plasma Instabilities In the analysis of thermal instabilities presented in the previous section, we assumed that plasma oscillations are nonisothermal. Now we will put the question, what kinds of isothermal instabilities can be created in the real ionosphere, and what are the natural sources of such instabilities. As mentioned elsewhere [20,65,66], such low-frequency electrostatic instabilities, which can then be associated with small- and moderate-scale plasma perturbations, can be created by different types of currents and their convergence, as well as by gradient-drift mechanisms. To analyze these phenomena, we will use both the hydrodynamic and kinetic approaches. Let us start with a general presentation of the problem. We use the full system of linear Equations 2.25 through 2.27 obtained for weak plasma disturbances and small perturbations of velocities of plasma particles and ambient electric fields, which have a form of plane waves; i.e., d N , d E , d V a \u0001 exp i kr \u0003 v t ðÞ fg (2 : 38) These conditions are valid for ionospheric altitudes up to 250 – 300 km (see Chapter 1). Moreover, the components of tensor of mobility of electrons ^ m e and ions ^ m i do not depend on spatial coordinates. For linear analysis of current-based instabilities occurring in the ionospheric plasma, we use the coordinate system ( x , y , z ) with z -axis oriented along the geomagnetic field B 0 . We also suggest that the ambient electric field E 0 and the gradient of plasma density k ¼r ln N 0 lie at the plane ( x , y ). There is also the longitudinal current j 0 jj along z -axis (along B 0 ), created by thermal electrons. From Equations 2.26b we can find that d V e ¼ e ~ ^ m e d E \u0003 i D e B q H ~ ^ m e k d N N 0 (2 : 39a) d V i ¼ Ze ~ ^ m i d E \u0003 i D i B Q H ~ ^ m i k d N N 0 (2 : 39b) where the tensors of mobility ~ ^ m a of charged particles, electrons ( a ¼ e ), and ions ( a ¼ i ) can obtain from the corresponding tensors ^ m a , defined earlier, by changes of real frequencies of collision n a on complex frequencies; i.e., ~ n a ¼ n a \u0003 i ( v \u0003 k \u0006 V a 0 )(2 : 40) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 45 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 45"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"As we showed previously, v \u0003 k \u0006 V e 0 n em þ n ei \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b v \u0003 k \u0006 V i 0 n im þ n ei \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b (2 : 41) and in most cases we must assume that ~ ^ m e \u0005 ^ m e , i.e., ~ n e \u0005 n e . Elimination of the imaginary term in ~ n i , according to Equation 2.40, is equivalent to the rejection of the ion current (two-stream) instability in the general dispersion equation [20,58]. Taking into account that v \u0003 k \u0006 V i 0 n im þ n ei \u000b 1, and from Refs.

Introducing Equation 2.39 in Equation 2.26, rewritten for ions taking into account Equations 2.38 and 2.42, we can after some straightforward derivations obtain the dispersion equation (not presented here due to its complexity), the frequency of plasma density oscillations, v 0 , and the increment of plasma current-generated instability, g .Thus, v 0 ¼ kV i 0 k ^ m e k þ kV e 0 k ^ m i k k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k (2 : 43) describes the dispersive properties of plasma waves created by current-generated instabilities in the real ionosphere.

From Equations 2.44 and 2.45, the validity of inequality 2.24 follows, and this finally differentiates between the two main approaches, the hydrodynamic and the kinetic.

However, it can be shown that the contribution of the term, proportional to v e = n e , in the increment of the current-generated instability is smaller than the term, proportional to v i = n i . As for the increment of the total current-generated instability, and following Refs.

Equation 2.47 is more general for an increment (decrement) that describes generation (dissi- pations or damping) of the electrostatic low-frequency plasma waves occurring in the ionosphere. The first term in Equation 2.47 describes the contribution of convective-current instability, which can be created by longitudinal currents when gradients of plasma density are an essential feature in the ionosphere [88,107]. Such instabilities generate collisional ion-cyclotron waves in the iono- spheric plasma [89,90]. The second term in Equation 2.47 describes effects of gradient-drift instability, which is usually generated when drift of ions and electrons in the ambient electric field occur in the inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma, parameters of which, as well as the transport coefficients, have complicated height dependence [91 – 97]. The third term in Equation 2.47 describes the contribution of two-stream instability, usually called Farley – Buneman instability [67,68,98 – 102]. During the generation of this kind of instability, both hydrodynamic and kinetic effects must be taken into account [98 – 102]. The fourth term takes into account redistribution of plasma density due to convergence of velocities of charged particles, which leads to negative divergence of electron and ion current [20,103,104]. The fifth term describes the existence of drift-dissipative instability in plasma, which also depends on the existence of an ambient electric field of sufficient magnitudes in the ionosphere [95,108 – 113]. The sixth term describes the development of the so-called Rayleigh – Taylor instability, occuring in the ionosphere in the presence of sharp and strong plasma density gradients [104,105,114 – 118]. The last two terms describe dissipation of plasma waves due to diffusion and recombination [58,61,64]. To all these electrostatic instabilities we can also add those having an electrodynamic nature, when drift in crossing electrical and magnetic fields is developed and, instead of electrostatic polarized electrical fields in the plasma, the rotated electrical field is observed [98,106]. Such instabilities are significant for plasma perturbations with scales more than 20 – 30 m. Results presented by numerous researchers of ionospheric plasma have shown that nonequilibrium pro- cesses occur in the ionospheric plasma leading to generation of low-frequency electrostatic and electrodynamic plasma waves. Their excitation is determined by the ambient electrical and Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 47 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 47"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"magnetic field, and the velocity of their movement is determined by the existence of cumulative effects of several kinds of instabilities, which gives the same contribution to cumulative increment g . Therefore, we will briefly discuss each of the previously mentioned instabilities in the following paragraphs. 2.3.2.1 The Current-Convective Instability This plasma instability and the corresponding plasma waves occur in the ionospheric regions where the ‘‘ run-in ’’ and the ‘‘ run-out ’’ longitudinal currents (along B 0 ) are observed with the existence of sharp gradients of the plasma density [107]. The increment of such kind of instability equals (here, as in the general case, the z -axis is elongated along B 0 ): g CC ¼ k jj V e 0 jj k \u0004 k ½\t z k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k \u0005 V e 0 jj k q H k ? k jj \u0002 V e 0 jj k q H l jj l ? (2 : 48) This increment depends strongly on the intensity of the longitudinal current and on plasma density. Thus, for j 0 jj \u0005 3 \u0006 10 \u0003 6 A = m 2 , N 0 ¼ 10 11 m \u0003 3 , and, for the parameter of anisotropy l jj = l ? ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi q H Q H p > 10, the increment g cc ¼ 10 \u0003 3 s \u0003 1 . As mentioned elsewhere [104], in the turbulent ionospheric plasma at high (polar) latitudes, it is possible to generate plasma disturbances with smaller anisotropy than at the middle latitudes. At the same time, in Ref. [88] it was shown that the longitudinal current with density j 0 jj > j 0 jj kr \u0005 3 \u0006 10 \u0003 6 A = m 2 generates the ion-cyclotron waves (ICW) in the upper ionosphere. The possibility of generation of ICW at maximum altitudes of the F layer and below was investigated in a couple of studies [89,90]. Following one of these [90] and, based on linear Equations 2.26a through b, we obtain the dispersion equation for ICW: v 2 Hi \u0003 v 2 þ C 2 s k 2 þ i m e ( n em þ n ei ) M i k 2 k 2 jj v \u0003 k jj V e 0 jj \u0001\u0002 ¼ 0(2 : 49) which yields v 2 0 ¼ v 2 Hi þ C 2 s k 2 (2 : 50a) g CC ¼ m e ( n em þ n ei ) 2 M i k 2 k 2 jj k jj V e 0 jj v 0 \u0003 1 \f\r (2 : 50b) From Equation 2.50a, it follows that the wave frequency v 0 is bigger than the gyrofrequency of ions; i.e., v 2 0 v 2 Hi . As also clearly seen from Equation 2.50b, the increment of instability of ionospheric plasma is positive; i.e., g > 0, and the phase velocity of waves, V ph ¼ v 0 = k jj , along the ambient magnetic field B 0 , is smaller than the electron velocity V eo jj ¼\u0003 j 0 jj = eN 0 . 2.3.2.2 Gradient-Drift Instability In the real ionosphere, for strongly elongated plasma structures where the longitudinal (along B 0 ) scale of plasma structure exceeds the scale of height of neutral atmosphere H m (see definitions in Chapter 1), the inhomogeneity of background plasma density N 0 ( z ) and its main parameters along the height of the ionosphere significantly influence the creation and further evolution of plasma Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 48 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 48 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"structures of various origins. Finally, in the ionosphere there exist excited plasma waves, depending on the altitude of their generation, which in the literature are called gradient-drift instabilities (GDI) [91 – 97]. We also need to differentiate the effects of such instabilities generation at altitudes of the E region from those occurring at altitudes of the F region of the ionosphere. It was shown both theoretically and experimentally [91 – 97] that in the E layer of the ionosphere gradient-drift instability occurs when plasma density disturbances, d N , are converted to the direction of r N 0 by the perturbation drift with velocity d V ¼ d E \u0004 B 0 = j B 0 j 2 . As shown in Chapter 1, the first-order (density and temperature), the second-order (collision frequencies between particles) and the third-order (transport and recombination coefficients) parameters of ionospheric plasma are functions of the ionospheric altitude h (usually denoted by the coordinate z ). From general equations of continuity (Equation 2.3 or 2.26b) and taking into account (Equation 2.39), it follows that, for plasma disturbances with dimensions that exceeded the standard height H m along B 0 , i.e., for l jj > H m \u0005 10 \u0003 50 km ( k jj > H \u0003 1 m \u0005 10 \u0003 1 \u0003 2 \u0006 10 \u0003 2 km \u0003 1 ), and for l ? \r 10 km ( k ? < 10 \u0003 1 km \u0003 1 ) across B 0 , we get l jj = l ? \u000b ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi q H Q H p ¼ 10 \u0003 100 (2 : 51) The parameters of GDI can be obtained as [91 – 97]: v 0 ¼ kV i 0 k ^ m e k \u0003 kV e 0 k ^ m i k k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k \u0003 D i H m k jj k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k (2 : 52a) g GD ¼ [ k \u0004 k ] k \u0006 U 0 \u0003 D i H m k jj \u0010\u0011 B 0 jj \u0006 k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k \u0003 ( v \u0003 kV e 0 ) m i jj k jj H m \u0006 k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k \u0003 D e Q H H m q H k jj k ^ m e k k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k \u0003 D 0 B 0 jj Q H k ^ m e kk ^ m i k k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k (2 : 52b) For the waves, which Equation 2.51 satisfies, we have k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k \u0005 q H k 2 jj = B 0 jj (2 : 53) Then, from Equation 2.52, we get v 0 \u0002 ( v \u0003 kV a 0 ) \u0005 kU 0 \u0003 D i H m k jj (2 : 54) where, again, U 0 ¼ V e 0 \u0003 V i 0 and D 0 is the coefficient of ion diffusion as defined earlier; all other parameters have also been introduced previously.

The last term in Equation 2.55 describes the relaxation of diffusion spreading of plasma inhomogeneities for waves with arbitrary direction of longitudinal wave vector component k jj . At the same time, from expression 2.55 it follows that, for plasma waves propagating downward ( k jj < 0) in the ionosphere, inhomogeneity of the background ionospheric plasma increases the velocity of growth of plasma waves and decreases their attenuation due to the diffusion process ( \u0001 D i ). For plasma waves propagating upward ( k jj > 0), the effect of altitudinal dependence of parameters of plasma is the opposite: their dependence on the height decreases the velocity of growth of plasma waves and increases their attenuation due to diffusion process. This occurs because of changing of waves ’ phase velocity, V ph \u0005 V i 0 ¼ V d þ U 0 , with altitude z . At the lower altitudes of the ionosphere, the phase velocity is greater and plasma waves grow faster, and their diffusion relaxation is slower. From Equation 2.55 it can also be seen that dissipation of waves due to the diffusion process is minimum when k jj ! H \u0003 1 m ( l jj ! H m ). However, for plasma disturbances with l jj \u0005 H m , the application of local approximation becomes incorrect. In a study [92], for a description of GDI-induced plasma perturbations the quasilocal approach was used. It has been suggested that plasma density perturbation, d N , has a form of plane wave with the wave vector k ? orthogonal to B 0 and with amplitude N k depending on the height coordinate z , which again was directed along B 0 ; i.e., d N ¼ N k ( z ) exp i k ? r \u0003 i v t ðÞ (2 : 56) In the same study [92] it was shown that along B 0 the diffusion is unipolar ( j e ¼ j i ), whereas across B 0 diffusion is ambipolar ( r j e ¼r j i ¼r j ). We use here the unified definitions introduced in Chapter 1, in which diffusion spreading of plasma disturbances was analyzed. Following the analysis [92], we suggest that k ¼r ln N 0 ( z ) \u0001 10 \u0003 1 km \u0003 1 and the large-scale gradients of plasma density become weaker with height at distances of order of H m \u0005 30 \u0003 50 km. Based on assump- tions made in the study [92], we can present the equation for the amplitude of plasma waves generated due to GDI, in the following form: @ N k @ t þ ( b \u0003 g k ) N k \u0003 @ @ z D 0 @ N k @ z þ g jj n im N k \f\r (2 : 57) where, as earlier, j g j¼ 9.81 m = s 2 , D 0 ¼ C 2 s = ( n im þ n ei ) is the coefficient of ion diffusion, the increment of plasma waves can be presented as [92] g k ¼ k \u0006 E 0 [ k \u0004 k ? ] z k 2 ? \u0003 C 2 s k 2 ? V H (2 : 58) Equation 2.57 was obtained with the assumption that in the real high-latitude ionosphere k ? < 10 \u0003 1 m \u0003 1 and the second (negative) term in Equation 2.58 is small enough. Then, in the first-order approximation it can be assumed that g k does not depend on the coordinate z . In Refs. [93,94] the same analysis, but for a simpler case of g k ¼ 0, was carried out. We will not enter into mathematical solutions of Equation 2.57 obtained in Ref. [92], but will only point out that since in the high-latitude ionosphere g \u0003 1 k \u0005 10 2 \u0003 10 3 s, the height profile of growth plasma waves differs from that of electron concentration of regular ionospheric plasma.

Here, L ¼ N 0 ( @ N 0 =@ z ) \u0003 1 is the scale length of the plasma disturbance in the steady-state (equilibrium) regime, and k is the wave number of the perturbed plasma wave (e.g., GDI). In Ref. [93], the GDI was analyzed using nonlocal linear approximation for the description of type II irregularities associated with such instability, which were o bserved experimentally in the E and F equatorial ionospheric regions (details in Chapter 6). The authors of Ref. [93] in their study took into account the altitudinal dependence of ion – neutral ( n im )andelectron – neutral ( n em ) frequencies, as well as the altitudinal dependence of mobilities of plasma electrons ( m e ) and ions ( m i ). Then, the global eigenmodes of the GDI were investiga ted using realistic profiles of the Pedersen ( s P ) and Hall ( s H ) conductivities of plasma with the framework of a physical model of the daytime equatorial electrojet. Considering the complexity of the expressions for oscillation frequency v r and growth rate g , they are not presented here; we only present a simple qualitative analysis of the phenomena under consideration. The corresponding computations of these two main parameters of the GDI have shown that the growth rate parameter has sharp diffusional damping at large wave numbers (where the horizontal component of wave vector k jj > 0.2 m \u0003 1 ), i.e., for the wave modes with wavelengths less than about 30 m. Its preferential range of waves excitation varies from 60 to 600 m, which corresponds to 0.01 < k jj < 0.1 m \u0003 1 . Its negative values described the damping process of unstable waves lying at the range of wavelengths larger than 3 km (i.e., for modes with k jj < 2 \u0006 10 \u0003 3 m \u0003 1 ). The kilometer wave structures, similar to most unstable modes, were often observed as wave packets composed of a few, or several, oscillations. Presenting such GDI as wave packets, it was found in a study [93] that the localization and main characteristics of plasma modes are not sensitive to details of the steady-state plasma density profile N 0 ( z ). What is also important to note is that the nonlocal growth rates obtained for plasma disturbances with a wavelengths of 1 km (or a few kilometers) are still smaller than those for wavelengths of the order of tens or hundreds of meters. This effect can explain the predominance of long wavelengths in the electrojet spectrum observed in the study mentioned [93]. In another study [94], the analysis of nonlocal approximation mentioned previously was continued, and it was shown that many features observed experimentally can find their physical explanation only in the framework of full nonlocal nonlinear equations. As the task of evaluating nonlinear equations nowadays is a complicated issue, it was proposed in the study [94] that the following approach gives a good explanation for the main features of the large number of experimental observations. It is based on introduction into the formulation of the long-wavelength problem of the additional electron mobility and diffusion caused by short-wavelength turbulence occurring in the plasma background. Introducing such a procedure, the authors retained all the relevant nonlocal effects and analyzed analytically and numerically the linearized version of the renormalized large-scale equations. The corresponding oscillatory frequency and increment of GTI excitation and growth were derived for wavelengths typically of the order of 1 km, i.e., for wave numbers of the order of k 0 ¼ ( s H = s P ) \u0006 L \u0003 1 , through the Hall s H ¼ eN 0 ( m iH \u0003 m eH ) and Pedersen s P ¼ eN 0 ( m iP \u0003 m eP ) conductivities of plasma, the vertical component (i.e., along z -axis) of the total field, E z , and the background (equilibrium) plasma density N 0 ( z ): v r ¼\u0003 m eH E z k jj 1 þ m eP m iP \u0003 m eP 1 þ k 0 m eH = m eP Lk 2 jj 1 þ ( k 0 = k jj ) 2 \"# (2 : 59a) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 51 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 51"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"g ¼\u0003 m iH \u0003 m eH ( m iP \u0003 m eP )(1 þ & ) m eH E z L 1 þ ( k 0 = k jj ) 2 \u0012\u0013 \u0003 2 a N 0 (2 : 59b) Here, as earlier, § ¼ 1 = q H Q H , and a is the coefficient of the radiative recombination (see Chapter 1, in which all additional parameters presented in Equation 2.59 are also defined). The long- wavelength unstable modes described by Equation 2.59 appear to be dispersive. As the quadratic term is presented in the denominator of Equation 2.59b, the increment of plasma modes growth decreases as the magnitude of k k becomes comparable to or smaller than k 0 . Finally, at even longer wavelengths, all the modes will eventually be stabilized due to the effects of recombination. Additional analysis carried out in the study [94] has shown that the dispersive nature of the kilometer-wavelength plasma modes depends critically on the value of k 0 , i.e., on the scale length of the equilibrium plasma density gradient, L , and the ratio of the Hall and Pedersen conductivities. The authors of Ref. [94] have finally obtained the same principal result as was obtained in Ref. [93] that the localization and qualitative properties of the unstable modes do not depend on the type of height profile of the background ionospheric plasma N 0 ( z ) or on its derivative @ N 0 ( z ) =@ z . Finally, we have to point out that because the long-wavelength nonlocal modes in the framework of the linear approach demonstrate growth rates monotonically decreasing with k k and are smaller in magnitude than those of the moderate- or small-wavelength modes (which is in contradiction with long-wavelength experimental observations), the nonlinear approach has to be used to explain all features observed experimentally. This will be done in the next section by introducing into the framework of nonlinear theory the anomalous (turbulent) mobility and diffusiuon coefficients in the nonlinear transport equations of plasma species, electrons, and ions. 2.3.2.3 Two-Stream Instability The physical concept of how such instabilities are generated in the ionosphere is based on the existence of high relative velocities of electrons and ions, i.e., strong currents (even in the homogeneous plasma) caused by strong ambient electric field or winds of neutral molecules (atoms). In the ionospheric plasma, under a strong ambient electric field of E 0 \r 30 \u0003 50 mV/m, a two-stream instability is mostly created in the high-latitude ionosphere, in the perturbed middle- latitude ionosphere, and in the equatorial electrojet [67,68,98 – 102]. Such an instability is the main source of plasma disturbance generation in the ionosphere (associated with irregularities of type I; see Chapter 6), and we will analyze it more consistently compared with other kinds of ionospheric instabilities. The two-stream instabilities are usually called the Farley – Buneman (FB) instabilities because Buneman first analyzed the conditions of current instability formation in the collisionless adiabatic plasma in the absence of an ambient magnetic field [99] and, then, Farley found the criteria for formation of such current instabilities in region E of the equatorial and polar ionosphere [71,98], assuming the existence of magnetized (where electrons are magnetized and the ions are not) and isothermal plasma ( T e \u0005 T i ¼ T ). In another study [100], the two-stream instability was analyzed based on the fluid theory extending Buneman ’ s model by considering both electron and ion waves in the dispersion equation, i.e., taking into account different temperatures for electrons and ions. According to all these criteria, in the isothermal plasma ( T e \u0005 T i ¼ T ) the appearance of two-stream instability (defined also as ion-acoustic wave ) occurs if the relative electron stream (compared with the ion stream) exceeds the ion-sound velocity, C s ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi T = M i p , and, in the nonisothermal plasma ( T e 6¼ T i ), it exceeds the thermal velocity of ions v T i [71,98 – 100].

Before entering into the problem using Equations 2.43 and 2.47, we will outline briefly the main aspects of pioneer theories described in Refs. [98 – 100]. Thus, Farley, using Boltzman ’ s kinetic equation and Maxwell ’ s electromagnetic equation, has analyzed weakly ionized (when n ei \u000b n im < n em ) and magnetized ( B 0 6¼ 0) plasma instability excitation, where plasma perturba- tions are strongly stretched along B 0 , taking into account the conditions of ionospheric plasma at altitudes in region E of the ionosphere and assuming isothermality of plasma ( T e \u0005 T i ¼ T ). Despite the fact that Farley used isothermal approximation, his theory treats the dynamics of both the electron and ions. As for Buneman, he used in his investigation the hydrodynamic approach based on the Navier – Stokes (fluid) equations for electrons and ions and analyzed the nonizothermic case, where T e > T i . Despite all the differences in the two approaches, the results obtained were roughly the same. Some additional coefficients obtained by Buneman in dispersive equations (in the order of \u0001 5/3), compared with coefficients derived by Farley, are significant in relation to the Buneman ’ s statement that the plasma electron perturbations are adiabatic in contrast to the isothermal perturbations of plasma ions considered by Farley. It should be noted that Buneman ’ s adiabatic approximation for plasma electrons is usually true when high-collision frequency approximation is valid, because for the plasma isothermality effect about \u0001 10 3 collisions between particles are required to obtain a significant exchange between plasma electrons and neutral molecules (atoms) in region E of the ionosphere. Furthermore, all computations made by Farley [98] were based on the simplified kinetic approach, in which the Boltzmann collisional integral in the kinetic equations was derived using the Maxwellian distribution function for plasma electrons. In Buneman ’ s simplified hydrodynamic approach, the behavior of the ion component of plasma was described in terms of a simple fluid model for the same ambient conditions as in Farley ’ s model. Therefore, both approaches gave close results in evaluating the threshold value of an ambient electric field for two-stream instability excitation, and both authors obtained roughly the same results in the theoretical analysis of two-stream (i.e., for the relative electron-ion current) instability, now called in the literature Farley – Buneman (FB) instability. In the analysis of FB instability, we follow Equation 2.43 for the frequency, v 0 \u0002 v FB , of such plasma instabilities and Equation 2.47 for their increment of growth, g \u0002 g FB , assuming, as did Farley and Buneman, that plasma disturbances strongly stretched along B 0 , that is, l jj = l ? > ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi q H Q H p \u0005 10 \u0003 100. In this case Equation 2.43 yields v FB ¼ q H Q H 1 þ q H Q H k \u0006 V d (2 : 60a) and Equation 2.47 is reduced to g FB ¼ 1 n im 1 þ q H Q H \u0001\u0002 v 2 0 \u0003 k 2 C 2 s \u0012\u0013 (2 : 60b) where V d is the drift velocity of plasma electrons; all other parameters are as defined and introduced in Chapter 1. From Equation 2.60b it follows that with an increase in the wave number k of plasma waves the increment of FB instability increases proportionally to k 2 . This occurs only for small values of k , because for large enough k values the hydrodynamic approach is not valid for the description of Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 53 26.3.2008 9:19pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 53"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"plasma instabilities, and we need to use the kinetic approach. According to Refs. [65,100], Equation 2.60b for the increment of two-stream instability can be modified as g FB ¼ 1 n im 1 þ q H Q H \u0001\u0002 v 2 0 1 \u0003 6 k 2 v 2 Ti n 2 im \f\r \u0003 k 2 C 2 s \u000e\u000f (2 : 61) where v Ti is the magnitude of thermal velocity of plasma ions.

From Equation 2.62 it also follows that the maximum of the increment shifts to the range of large wave numbers with an increase of drift velocity, V d , of plasma electrons. It is important to point out that as shown by many researchers dealing with FB instability [67,68,98 – 100], the hydrodynamic and kinetic descriptions of this kind of instability give the same result only for 0 < k < k max . With an increase in the ambient electric field E 0 , the drift velocity increases and becomes predominant (compared with n Ti ), and k max also increases, broadening the applicability of the hydrodynamic approach. In Ref. [12] it was shown that, observed experimentally, small-anisotropic meteor-induced plasma inhomogeneities in the middle-latitude ionosphere can be explained by the generation of FB instabilities. For such meteor-induced inhomogeneities with a relatively small degree of anisotropy ( l jj = l ? \u000b ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi q H Q H p \u0005 10) we can show that v FB ¼ k \u0006 V d 1 þ q H Q H ðÞ q H Q H þ q H k 2 jj Q H k 2 ? (2 : 63) That is, with a decrease in anisotropy of plasma disturbances, the frequency, v 0 , and the phase velocity, V ph ¼ v 0 = k , of plasma waves decrease correspondingly, according to standard models [98,99]. For conditions V d < C s , two-stream instability is not generated in the homogeneous plasma. Furthermore, with the existence of altitudinal dependence of the parameters of plasma (i.e., in the inhomogeneous ionosphere) and of gradients of plasma density, k ¼r ln N 0 , orthogonal to ambient magnetic field B 0 and parallel to ambient large-scale electric field E 0 , plasma waves can grow due to the joint effect of gradient-drift and two-stream instability. The frequency of these waves will be described by the same equations, either Equation 2.60a or 2.63. The increment of such complex GDI-FB instability can be presented as [58,65]: g S ¼ 1 n im (1 þ q H Q H ) v 2 0 þ v H n im n em 1 þ p ðÞ k \u0006 E 0 jj B 0 jj \u0003 C 2 s k 2 \u000e\u000f (2 : 64) where, p ¼ n ei = n em is the parameter of ionization introduced in Chapter 1.

The horizontal gradients of such plasma structures were observed in the polar ionosphere [108].

As pointed out by the authors [101,102], this can be done only by using consistent kinetic theory for the description of low- frequency ( v \u0005 kV d \u000b n em ) cross-field ( E 0 \u0004 B 0 ) two-stream instability in collisional weakly ionized plasmas, dominated in the E layer of the ionosphere. In Ref. [101] the threshold of FB instability excitation was obtained more precisely using rigorous kinetic theory only concerning the linear stage of growth of two-stream instabilities based on a short-wave asymptotic limit, i.e., analyzing plasma waves with wavelengths less than approximately 10 m. At the same time, it was shown [101,102] that for the long-wave limit (i.e., for unstable plasma waves with wavelengths varying from tens to hundreds of meters) the perturbed electron distribution function is close to the Maxwellian, so that rigorous kinetic theory fully covers, in this long-wave range the simplified standard Farley kinetic model. Generally speaking, some essential corrections were effected in the theory of temporal evolution of FB instabilities in Refs. [101,102] based on a self-consistent kinetic theory developed [13,14], where it was shown that the parameters of plasma can change dramatically because the electron distribution functions are essentially subject to non-Maxwellian perturbations, which can only be described on the basis of rigorous theory. Thus, using the consistent kinetic theory developed in Refs. [101,102], a significant increase (up to 100%) of the threshold value of the ambient electric field E 0 , needed for excitation of plasma instabilities, was obtained with respect to the results of the standard FB theory. This is only the first correction effected from the consistent theory, which is valid when plasma waves propagate in directions close to those of electron drift velocity V d . Another correction relates to excitation of waves (instabilities) propagating in directions near the bisector between the direction of drift velocity V d and the ambient electric field E 0 . Furthermore, according to rigorous kinetic theory, the excitation of combined FB – GD long-wave instabilities occurs in the direction near the bisector between the directions of the ambient electric field E 0 and the E 0 \u0004 B 0 drift, and this new, exciting mechanism is related to the perturbed electron current caused by the Pedersen conductivity discussed previously. All these features cannot be explained on the basis of the standard FB theory framework. We are not entering into complicated mathematical descriptions of the problem and the results obtained using the consistent kinetic theory because this subject is beyond the scope of our book. It is more important to give the reader a qualitative explanation of the physical mechanism of the generation of FB instability and show under what ambient conditions of the ionospheric plasma such instability can be excited or damped. First, it was shown in the studies mentioned [101,102] that the growth of FB instability occurs when the following restriction is valid: V d jj \u0006 cos q > C s 1 þ 1 1 þ cos u C ( u ) \u000e\u000f (2 : 65) where cos u ¼ k jj k ¼ k jj ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi k 2 jj þ k 2 ? q , cos q ¼ k ? \u0006 V d k ?

When analyzing the total electron and ion flux densities it was found in a study [102] that the intrinsic polarization field occurring between moving electrons and ions consists of two different parts, i.e., d E ¼ d E 1 þ d E 2 (2 : 67) The greater part, d E 1 ( d E 1 > d E 2 ), which determines the phase velocity of the plasma wave (instability) is responsible for acceleration and deceleration of electron and ion streams necessary for the constancy of flux densities associated with large velocities of the two fluids in the electron- ion comoving coordinate system (see corresponding Equations 2.13 and 2.14 in Ref. [102]). The smaller part, d E 2 , provides the equality of small diffusive fluxes (defined as the ambipolar diffusion) caused by the pressure gradients. Rejecting this term in the original equations, the authors [101,102] have found that d E 1 is related to the electron and ion Pedersen current associated with the corresponding Pedersen conductivity of charged particles. Then, the corresponding phase velocity can simply be associated with the drift velocity which we present in our unified notation as V ph \u0005 q H Q H 1 þ q H Q H V d (2 : 68) and the corresponding frequency of plasma modes oscillations is v r \u0005 1 1 þ C ( u ) k \u0006 V d (2 : 69) It can be seen that in this case the plasma waves propagate strictly along the electron drift velocity V d , because the components perpendicular to the wave vector k do not affect the density perturbations. It was shown in Refs. [101,102] that if the vector k has even a small component along the magnetic field lines (along B 0 ) the situation becomes more complicated and the term d E 2 , which is associated with ambipolar diffusion, leads to additional ‘‘ pressure ’’ associated with the ion ’ s kinetic energy \u0001 M i v 2 iT = 2. Because the ion flux velocity is maximum at the sites of minimum plasma density (and, conversely, minimum where the perturbations of plasma density are max- imum), the gradient of the additional pressure is directed oppositely to the gradient of pressure of plasma associated with the thermal (chaotic) motion of plasma ions with velocity v iT . This fact, shown in Refs. [101,102], stimulates excitation of two-stream instability with a growth rate of g \u0005 C ( u ) 1 þ C ( u ) v 2 r \u0003 k 2 C 2 s n im (2 : 70) At the same time, and as shown in Ref. [102], the situation is not so simple even in the framework of the consistent kinetic theory developed in Ref. [101]. Thus, with regard to Equation 2.70, the term in the numerator \u0001 k 2 C 2 s , which is responsible for chaotic thermal motion, undergoes a change.

These are the principal results observed experimentally, which do not have any physical explanation when the standard FB model is used. Moreover, the authors [101,102] investigated the regions in the frequency domain in which such instabilities can be generated and, conversely, in which they have a tendency to damp. Briefly speaking, when the frequency shift G v , k \u0002j D v v , k j and the frequencies of electron – electron collisions are smaller than those for electron – neutral collisions, i.e., for G v , k , n ee < d em n em (2 : 71) the situation is entirely Maxwellian and leads to isothermality of plasma, and thus we return to the simple Farley – Buneman model of growth of instabilities in the isothermal plasma. As shown in Ref. [102], this situation is valid only for the altitudes of the nocturnal ionospheric region E. However, the actual velocity dependence of the electron – neutral collisions shown in Refs. [13,14] can dramatically change the conditions of FB instability growth and excitation. Following Refs. [13,14], it was shown [101,102] that when the constraint G v , k < d em n em < n ee (2 : 72) or, especially, d em n em < G v , k < n ee (2 : 73) is valid, the electron temperature T e undergoes noticeable plasma wave perturbations, similar to electron density waves. In such conditions, distributions of plasma species are far from the classical Maxwellian, and all additional features found in the strict consistent analysis made in the study mentioned [101,102] now have a clear physical and distinct explanation. Thus, in the consistent linear kinetic theory framework, Dimant and Sudan [101,102] analyzed precisely the conditions of excitation and damping of two-stream instabilities in the ionosphere responsible for plasma irregularity generation in the E layer of auroral and equatorial zones where ambient electromagnetic fields are sufficiently strong to create plasma perturbations (turbulences). 2.3.2.4 Convergence Instability The convergence or negative divergence of velocities of charged particles in the ionospheric plasma leads to the redistribution of plasma density and to the growth of amplitude of plasma waves [20,103]. The increment of convergent instability (CI) can be found as follows [103]: g CI ¼ r\u0006 V i 0 k ^ m e k þr\u0006 V e 0 k ^ m i k k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k (2 : 74) For strongly anisotropic plasma perturbations, when l k = l ? \r ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Q H q H p , g CI ¼\u0003 r\u0006 V i 0 Q H q H þr\u0006 V e 0 \f\r (2 : 75a) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 57 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 57"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"and for weakly anisotropic plasma perturbations, when l k = l ? \u000b Q H = q H g CI ¼\u0003 r\u0006 V e 0 Q H q H þr\u0006 V i 0 \f\r (2 : 75b) Such an increment depends weakly on the anisotropy of plasma disturbances. It was shown in Ref. [103] that the CI can be related to changes in the frequency of ion – neutral collisions and, for n im \u0005 0.3 s \u0003 1 and H m \u0005 30 km, r\u0006 V i 0 \u0005 g = n im H m \u0005 10 \u0003 3 s \u0003 1 . Convergence of V e 0 can also be related to the height dependence of velocity of thermal electrons transferring the longitudinal current. It follows from the relationship V e 0 jj ¼\u0003 j 0 jj = eN 0 that for j 0 jj ¼ const [58]: r\u0006 V e 0 jj ¼\u0003 V e 0 jj k jj (2 : 76) It can be seen from Equation 2.76 that in regions of run-in longitudinal currents, the divergence r\u0006 V e 0 jj will be negative above the maximum of F layer but in the region of run-out longitudinal currents it will be negative below this maximum. In Refs. [58,103] an estimation is presented of CI for j 0 jj ¼ 10 \u0003 6 A = m 2 , N 0 ¼ 10 10 m \u0003 3 , and H p ¼ 10 2 km, which equals r\u0006 V e 0 jj \u0005 6 \u0006 10 \u0003 3 s \u0003 1 . Accordingly, a more convenient scenario for development of convergence instability is the existence of longitudinal currents in regions with lower plasma density. 2.3.2.5 Dissipative Instability The last two negative terms in Equation 2.47 for the total increment of instabilities occurring in the ionosphere represent the attenuation of plasma waves due to the recombination process and diffusion. As numerous researchers [20,58,65] have shown, at altitudes in the range of 200 – 450 km, where Q H \r 10 3 and q H \r 10 4 (see Chapter 1), as a rule, the coefficient of recombination is less than b kr \u0005 10 \u0003 9 m 3 = s, and the recombination process in computations of the increment of instability generation described by Equation 2.47 is not accounted for. As for the negative term of diffusion in Equation 2.47, we can present it as follows [20,58]: g D ¼ D 0 B 0 k ^ m e kk ^ m i k Q H k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k ¼ 2 D 0 Q H q H k 2 ? , k 2 ? \r Q H q H k 2 jj D 0 k 2 jj , k 2 ? < Q H q H k 2 jj ( (2 : 77) For strongly anisotropic plasma structures with k ? ¼ p \u0006 10 \u0003 2 m \u0003 1 and D 0 ¼ 10 6 m 2 = s, we find that g D \u0005 2 \u0006 10 \u0003 4 s \u0003 1 , which is sufficiently strong. In such scenarios, the redistribution of plasma by the electrostatic (e.g., potential) field is not sufficient to compensate for diffusion of plasma and, therefore, relaxation of plasma perturbations is observed at an increasing rate. 2.3.2.6 Drift-Dissipative Instability GDI leads to the growth of plasma waves close to the orthogonal direction of the geomagnetic field B 0 [95,98,104 – 109]. At the same time, as shown in pioneer reseach [95,98], in low-density weakly collisional ionospheric plasma when dissipative processes such as diffusion and recombin- ation are predominant (in conditions of region E of the ionosphere, see Chapter 1), instabilities Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 58 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 58 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"called drift-dissipative , should still occur. Therefore, the development of GDI has to be considered together with drift-dissipative instability (DDI). The corresponding plasma waves have a phase velocity in the same order as a drift speed perpendicular to the geomagnetic field B 0 . Such instability can be generated by even small electric currents flowing perpendicular to B 0 . In such a situation, the growth rate of DDI exceeds the loss rate caused by diffusion and recombination processes. In Ref. [98] also it was considered that in weakly ionized plasma (with n em n ei and n im > n ei ) DDI occurs at low frequencies in a plasma containing a density gradient, linearly changed with altitude. Then, in Ref. [95], this assumption of linear density gradient was extended to exponential variations of plasma density with altitude, and the conditions necessary for DDI generation in E and F regions of the ionosphere were found. To explain the generation mechanism of plasma DDI responsible for ionospheric F layer, Cunnold [95] generalized the results obtained for weakly magnetized ionosphere of region E to those that deal with the magnetized ionosphere of the F region by introducing magnetohydro- dynamic (MHD) effects. It was found that MHD effects determine the electric-field component in the direction of B 0 . However, this component ’ s contribution to the redistribution of plasma ionization is weak. A more important mechanism of DDI generation occurs in a case in which the gradient of plasma density possesses a component in the B 0 direction. In this case a different instability mechanism appears, in which a component of the ambient electric field in the direction of B 0 (denoted by E 0 jj ) causes plasma electron transport. This effect will be considered later when the so-called MHD instabilities are analyzed. We do not examine in depth the results obtained in Refs. [58,65,95,104], but only point out that the results allow the description of the amplification mechanism for the production of the plasma perturbations responsible for the sporadic E layer at equatorial latitudes observed experi- mentally in the 120 – 130 km region, as well as the F spread sporadic structures observed in the nocturnal ionosphere (see Chapters 6 and 7). The joint increment of DDI equals [95] g DDI ¼ [ k \u0004 k ] z k \u0006 U 0 ðÞ k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k þ D 0 Q H B 0 jj [ \u0005 \u0004 k ] 2 k ^ m e þ ^ m i ðÞ k (2 : 78) In Ref. [104], the development of the DDI was connected to phase velocity of waves generated in the inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma in the absence of ambient currents. Therefore, the estimations of phase velocity, V ph < 0.5 m = s [104], give the impression that with such low phase velocities DDI cannot be generated. However, as shown by other researchers [58,65], in the ionospheric plasma, the phase velocity of plasma waves is determined not by the gradient of plasma density (i.e., plasma inhomogeneity), but mostly by an ambient electric field (see Equation 2.43). Drift waves are transferred by moving plasma, and the development of modified instability is a real event. In Equation 2.78, the first term is positive for gradients k directed toward the drift velocity of plasma V d ¼ E 0 \u0004 B 0 ½\t = B 2 0 and is negative in the opposite direction. The second term in Equation 2.78 is always positive. So, toward V d the GDI and DDI together cause growth of plasma waves, whereas in the direction opposite to V d DDI causes growth of plasma waves and GDI causes their attenuation. The increment (given in Equation 2.78) is maximum when the ambient electric field E 0 and the wave vector of plasma waves k are orthogonal and equal: g DD max ¼ k \u0006 V d þ C 2 s k 2 n im þ n ei (2 : 79) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 59 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 59"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Estimations show [58,65] that, for V d ¼ 10 3 m = s, C s \u0005 800 m = s, n im ¼ 0.3 s \u0003 1 ,and k ¼ 5 \u0006 10 \u0003 5 m \u0003 1 , this maximum equals g max \u0005 5 \u0006 10 \u0003 3 þ 5 \u0006 10 \u0003 3 (s \u0003 1 ) ¼ 10 \u0003 2 (s \u0003 1 ).

Such plasma structures were observed both in the polar and the equatorial ionosphere at region F, called spread F layer [58,105,114 – 118]. When gravity is dominant, such an instability is defined as the collisional Rayleigh – Taylor (RT) instability [116 – 118]; otherwise, it is defined as the E \u0004 B instability or gradient-drift instability described earlier. Taking into account the angle of inclination of the geomagnetic field denoted by I , we can present the increment of RTI by the following equation [58,105]: g RT ¼ g jj k n im cos I (2 : 81) Estimations presented in Ref. [105] state that g RT \u0005 (7 7 8) \u0006 10 \u0003 3 s \u0003 1 . At altitudes higher than the maximum of F layer, RT instability causes growth of plasma waves at altitudes of 500 – 700 km where n im \u0005 10 \u0003 2 s \u0003 1 [105]. Later, several authors [114,115], on the basis of the linear theory of instability generation in the equatorial ionospheric plasma of the Rayleigh – Taylor type, investigated the creation of large- and moderate-scale plasma depletions, called bubbles , in the F region of the equatorial ionosphere which form the equatorial spread F observed experimentally. The evidence of such plasma structures follows from numerous radar observations, for example, those presented in Ref. [118] using an Altair radar scan (this aspect will be discussed in more detail in Chapters 6 and 7 regarding equatorial F spread and bubbles). Then, by a generalization of this theory to the nonlinear case [116 – 118], the existence of experimentally observed small-scale plasma structures during continuous ionosonde and radar observations [119 – 122] was proved. According to Ref. [117], such small-scale plasma waves can be explained by the generation of the so-called interchange instability that includes both RT and E 0 \u0004 B 0 or GD instabilities. 2.3.2.8 Hydrodynamic Instabilities Instabilities considered previously are low-frequency electrostatic instabilities. In the real iono- sphere, plasma waves can be considered as electrostatic only as a ‘‘ first approximation, ’’ because during the development of plasma instability, the fluctuations of current, d j , lead to oscillations of the magnetic field, d B , and to the generation of rotating electric field, E c ; i.e., pure electrodynamic effects are caused. Therefore, the total electric field can be presented as the sum of the electrostatic ( E p ) (i.e., potential) and rotating ( E c ) electric fields; i.e., E S ¼ E p þ E c , where E p ¼ k ( k d E ) = k 2 and Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 60 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 60 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"k 2 d E \u0003 k ( k d E ) ¼ v 2 c 2 d E þ i m 0 vd j (2 : 82) Thus, in the F region of the ionosphere, for waves with k ¼ 10 \u0003 3 m \u0003 1 , the longitudinal component of the curled field E c jj exceeds the corresponding component of the potential field E p jj by two orders of magnitude.

We will now describe some important aspects of the generation of nonpotential or electro- dynamic waves in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous ionosphere, following results obtained elsewhere [95 – 97]. As in Ref. [95], we direct the z -axis along wave vector k and the x -axis orthogonal to B 0 . The angle between k and B 0 will be denoted by q .

For k ¼ 0, this expression is limited to that for nonpotential waves obtained in Ref. [96]. From Equation 2.83 it follows that the nonpotential waves corresponding to inequality q < tan \u0003 1 ( q H Q H ) in the homogeneous ionosphere can be developed from orthogonal (to B 0 ) currents, when ( v \u0003 kV e 0 ) sin q kV e 0 y cos q , and from longitudinal currents, when ( v \u0003 kV e 0 ) sin q \u0007 kV e 0 y cos q . In the study cited [96] it was shown that the orthogonal current can generate weakly ionized plasma perturbations only in the lower part of F region, where the condition ( C 2 s = V 2 d )( c 2 k 2 = v 2 Pi ) Q 2 H cos 2 q < 1 is satisfied. As for longitudinal currents, the generation of nonpotential waves by these currents is possible only when V 2 e 0 jj C 2 s v 2 Pi c 2 k 2 sin 2 q > 1(2 : 84) In cases where the preceding condition (Equation 2.84) is satisfied, the creation of plasma perturbations with l jj = l ? \u0007 10 is possible for the ionosphere with lower plasma density (i.e., for higher altitudes). Thus, estimations made in Ref. [96] showed that inequality 2.84 is satisfied for j 0 jj ¼ 4 \u0006 10 \u0003 6 A = m 2 and N 0 ¼ 10 10 m \u0003 3 .

At the same time, the authors of these approaches have pointed out that a wide spectrum of features and phenomena accompanying experimentally observed plasma irregularities in the real ionosphere, from the polar to the equatorial, cannot be explained by using only linear physical models and the corresponding linearized mathematical equations. In particular, in pioneer research [95 – 107], the authors found that the linear theory of plasma wave growth cannot predict the intensity of plasma perturbations, their scales, and the shape of their spectra observed experimentally by using linearized equations describing evolution of the two- stream, E 0 \u0004 B 0 , and gradient-drift instabilities, as the main instabilities associated with type I and type II irregularities observed in the ionospheric plasma (see details in Chapter 6). It was shown that such features can be understood only by using a nonlinear description of plasma species dynamics. Thus, in their analysis of two-stream instability, Farley [98] and Buneman [99], in the course of explaining the occurrence of two-stream instabilities in a weakly ionized plasma with strongly magnetized elecrtrons and weakly magnetized ions (i.e., for E layer conditions of the ionosphere), have found that the threshold for the generation of an instability defined by V d jj ¼ C s (where V d jj ¼ E 0 \u0004 B 0 ½\t jj = B 2 0 is the absolute value of drift velocity of electrons relative to the ions and C s ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi k B ( T e þ T i ) = M i p ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi m e = M i ðÞ u 2 e þ u 2 i p \u0005 u i ) is the acoustic velocity, which approximately equals the velocity of ion-acoustic waves because m e = M i \u000b 1. The existence of a physically explained threshold of unstable wave excitation in plasma was shown independently by Simon [106] and Ried [108], who analyzed instabilities generated by plasma density and electric potential gradients called gradient-drift instabilities (see Section 2.2). Later [73], using linear low-pressure two-fluid (electron and ion) collisional models for the plasma, linearized expressions for the eigenfrequency v k r ¼ Re( v k ) and the increment of growth (or decrement of damping) g k ¼ Im( v k ) of the mode with wave vector k were obtained: v k ¼ v k r þ i g k (2 : 86) and v k r ¼ k \u0006 V d (1 þ z ) ¼ kV d cos u (1 þ z ) (2 : 87a) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 62 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 62 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"g k ¼ z (1 þ z ) Q H cos 2 u L (1 þ z ) \u0003 k 2 C 2 s ( n im þ n ie ) \u000e\u000f (2 : 87b) Here, z ¼ ( q H Q H ) \u0003 1 , z \u0007 1 for E layer, and z \u000b 1 for the F layer of the ionosphere; L \u0003 1 ¼ (1 = N 0 ) (d N 0 = d h ) is the vertical plasma density scale height (plasma is quasineutral; N e \u0005 N i ¼ N 0 ); u is the angle between the wave vector k and the plasma drift velocity V d ; all other parameters and unified notations have been introduced earlier in this chapter. Farley [98] and then Sudan et al. [125,127,128] found that there are threshold conditions for unstable wave growth, depending on oscillation frequencies, and on the orientation of wave vectors with respect to ambient electric and magnetic fields and currents in plasma beyond which linearized kinetic equations for electrons and ions become incorrect. In this case, the nonlinear effects have to be taken into account — such as interactions between waves, the particle – wave interactions, etc., which can significantly change the Maxwellian distribution functions of plasma electrons and ions and disturb their orbits and trajectories and, as a result, perturb ambient fields in plasma [123 – 137]. Therefore, to determine the course of plasma wave growth in real time, it is necessary to include nonlinear processes in a complete picture of the evolution of plasma instabilities. For example, in an analysis of drift waves, ion-acoustic waves or ion-cyclotron waves in plasma, i.e., waves having a narrow spectrum both in the phase velocity and in the wave frequency domains, the theory of ‘‘ weak turbulence ’’ based on linear [123] and quasilinear [124] approaches becomes inapplicable. However, a strict nonlinear theory, applicable to the description of temporal and spatial evolution of ‘‘ strong turbulence, ’’ has as yet not been established. There exist some models based on results obtained for collisionless plasma, which have been modified to describe the nonlinear processes occurring in the strongly disturbed collisional ionospheric plasma. Among these are models that describe the effects of nonlinear transformation of the energy of linear increasing waves into that of the linear damping waves, the wave – wave interactions, the cascade Kolmogorov effects observed in the turbulent atmosphere, the perturbation of trajectories of charged plasma particles, and so on. In the following text we will discuss the effects of wave – wave interactions, and the effects of particle – wave interactions based on results obtained in various studies [123 – 137]. We will then analyze natural phenomena that lead to nonlinear stabilization of plasma instabilities in the ionosphere on the basis of previous research [138 – 145]. Finally, we will analyze some general results concerning growth of instabilities in the ionospheric plasma [146 – 165] based on results of numerical simulation of the nonlinear phenomenon of instability excitation in the ionospheric plasma. 2.4.1 Nonlinear Wave – Wave Interactions in the Ionospheric Plasma As shown in Refs. [123 – 131], nonlinear interaction of plasma waves leads to transfer of energy from the region of generation of plasma waves (defined by positive increment of growth, i.e., by g k > 0) to the region of linear damping of plasma waves (defined by g k < 0). So, at the nonlinear stage of instability evolution, the amplitude of linear damping waves can grow in the time domain. Sudan et al. [125,127 – 129] have extended the Kolmogorov ’ s theory of ‘‘ weak turbulence ’’ [123], which is valid only for collisionless plasma [124], to the case of partially ionized plasma (e.g., taking into account collisions between neutral and charged particles) and have analyzed the possibility of nonlinear amplification of growth of damping waves at the linear stage of their evolution due to gradients of plasma concentration and polarization fields of large-scale plasma waves, growing Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 63 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 63"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"linearly in the time and space domains.

This nonlinearity (i.e., ‘‘ strong turbulence ’’ ) now deals with strong disturbances of wave amplitudes n k , at the same time conserving a linearity of the real part, v k r , of eigenfrequencies ( v k ¼ v k r þ i g k ) and of wave modes spectrum width, D v k , which is proportional to the linear growth (damping) rate g k . In other words, even in the presence of strong turbulence, there are no changes in v k r ¼ k \u0006 V d (because z ¼ 1 = q H Q H from Equation 2.87a is usually smaller than a unit).

Thus, it was obtained that in region E of the ionosphere secondary waves can grow if the relative amplitude of plasma concentration in the primary waves, n k , achieves 5% – 10% and G k exceeds g k [125,127 – 130]. In this case, the wave vectors of secondary waves, k 0 , are oriented orthogonally (or close to that direction) to the wave vectors of primary linear growing waves, k . Generally speaking, nonlinear interactions of waves occur if the conditions of synchronism, which are satisfied between two waves, three waves, and so on, are satisfied [124]: k ¼ k 0 þ k 00 , k ¼ k 0 þ k 0 þ k 000 , ... (2 : 88a) v k ¼ v k 0 þ v k 00 , v k ¼ v k 0 þ v k 00 þ v k 000 , ... (2 : 88b) Such low-frequency (or long-wavelength) waves for which Equation 2.43 is valid cause excitation of plasma waves in the ionosphere in the definite interval of wave numbers k and frequencies defined by Equation 2.88b, and for definite orientation of vectors k, defined by Equation 2.88a relative to vectors of ambient electric E 0 and magnetic B 0 fields and drift velocities for electrons V e 0 and ions V i 0 (or to their relative velocity U 0 ¼ V e 0 \u0003 V i 0 ). On the other hand, as shown in Refs. [125,127 – 129], for low-frequency (long-wavelength) waves in the ionospheric plasma, where the related plasma density disturbances, d n ¼ d N = N 0 , do not exceed 10%, the four- (and more) wave interactions render a smaller effect in the total process of instability temporal evolution compared with that for triad-wave interactions. In the real ionosphere, a triad-wave interaction is the main process of nonlinear interaction of plasma waves, and, for description of such interactions, a theory of ‘‘ not strong turbulence ’’ [124 – 126] with some modifications [125,127 – 130] is valid. Therefore, we will review those works in which a triad-wave interaction was fully analyzed. In these studies [125,127 – 130] a two-step mechanism of wave interactions was proposed, according to which primary long-wavelength instability generates additional secondary short-wavelength instabilities caused by the gradients of the primary wave orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the primary wave. It was found that plasma becomes strongly turbulent through the nonlinear interaction of a triad of waves k , k 0 ,and k 00 allowing validation of the constraint in Equation 2.88a with k \u0005 k 0 \u0005 k 00 . Such a process, during its evolution in the time domain, leads to isotropization of waves and generates additional waves in the linearly stable region of the wave number domain. In the approximation of triad-wave interactions, the system of equations for the relative amplitude n k ¼ N k = N 0 ( N 0 is the concentration of the background ionospheric nondisturbed plasma) can be described as follows [125,127 – 130]: @ n k @ t \u0003 g k n k þ X k 0 V k , k 0 n k 0 n k \u0003 k 0 ¼ 0(2 : 89) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 64 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 64 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"where g k is the linear increment of the wave with the wave vector k , and V k , k 0 , the coefficient of a nonlinear triad-wave interaction, which can be complex [131].

Moreover, the authors [125,127 – 130] found that a triad-wave interaction leads to nonlinear growth (or damping) of waves, and in this case the increment (or decrement) G k , v has to be added to (or subtracted from) the term ( v \u0003 v k \u0003 G k , v ) for the intensity of plasma waves, I k , v ¼ N k = N 0 jj 2 \t , described by the system of equations; i.e., v \u0003 v k \u0003 G k , v jj 2 I k , v ¼ 1 2 X k 0 ð V e k , k 0 \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b 2 I k 0 , v 0 I k \u0003 k 0 , v \u0003 v 0 d v 0 (2 : 90) where G k , v ¼\u0003 X k 0 ð V e k , k \u0003 k 0 V e k \u0003 k 0 , k I k 0 , v 0 v \u0003 v 0 \u0003 v k \u0003 k 0 \u0003 G k \u0003 k 0 , v \u0003 v 0 d v 0 (2 : 91) and V e k , k 0 ¼ V k , k 0 þ V k , k \u0003 k 0 . The difference between notations introduced in works referred to [125,127 – 130] and those presented here is that, instead of integration over vector k 0 ,we introduced summation over all wave vectors k varying from \u00031 to 1 , and also took into account that k 00 ¼ k \u0003 k 0 . We do not introduce here complicated formulas describing coefficients V k , k 0 ;we only give their estimations separately for regions E and F of the ionosphere.

Relations between these effects depend on orientation of wave vectors in the ambient geomagnetic field B 0 . Here also it has taken into account that at the region E electrons are strongly magnetized ( q H 1) but ions are weakly magnetized ( Q H \u0007 1). In region F where both electrons and ions are magnetized (see Chapter 1), we find, corres- pondingly, that V k , k 0 ¼\u0003 i k \u0004 k 0 ½\t\u0006 k 0 u 0 B 0 jj k 0 ^ m k 0 þ O k \u0004 k 0 ½\t ,( k 0 ^ m i k 0 ),( k 0 ^ m e k 0 ) ðÞ (2 : 93) Here, as earlier, ^ m a is the tensor of mobilities for electrons ( a ¼ e ) and for ions ( a ¼ i ), ^ m ¼ ^ m e \u0003 ^ m i .

The system of Equations 2.90 through 2.91 determines a spectrum of plasma turbulence caused by nonlinear instabilities following Kraichnan ’ s approximation of direct inter- action of waves [126].

Formulas 2.94 through 2.96 were obtained on the assumption that G k g k jj , where g k is the linear growth (damping) of the wave modes. Presented in a simple form (Equation 2.96), the nonlinear frequency spread parameter, G k , can now be interpreted in terms of the mixing length theory of Kolmogorov [123] as the inverse of the eddy turnover time t \u0001 l = d V , where l is the eddy scale size, and d V is the eddy velocity. As, according to Refs. [128,129], the electron velocity can be presented in a simple form as V k jj ¼ V d Q H (1 þ z ) N k N 0 h \u0004 k jj k 2 (2 : 97) where h is the vertical axis defining the height of the ionosphere, we can now estimate G k from the other side, using Ref. [123] and Equation 2.97.

In other words, the theory developed [123,124] based on ‘‘ weak coupling ’’ equations, which describe the interaction between eddies, is equivalent to Kaichnan ’ s approximation [126] of ‘‘ direct interactions of plasma waves ’’ generated in the ionosphere under natural ambient phenomena. Additionally, it was shown [128,129] that there exists the possibility of transferring the energy of linear growing modes to nonlinear damping modes due to triad-wave interactions. Thus, for two-stream instability occurring in the E layer of the ionosphere, for V d = C s \r (1 þ z ) \u0005 1.4 \u0003 1.5, i.e., roughly above the critical level V d ¼ C s , obtained by Farley [98], the direct linear mechanism of wave excitation and the quasilinear mechanism described in linear theory are not sufficient to bring plasma to a steady-state regime. Therefore, as shown in Refs. [128 – 130], there is a single mechanism, which has clear and simple Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 66 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 66 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"physical explanation. This is the nonlinear transfer of energy from waves with shorter k (or longer wavelengths) to waves with higher k (or shorter wavelengths), as mentioned previously. What is important, the steady-state regime can now be established in the region \u0002 k g k jj . In this case, with a wave number interval of size k , D k 0 \u0005 k ; it was found [128] that k 2 I k \u0005 const and I k \u0001 k \u0003 2 (2 : 99) Further estimations [128 – 130] give the steady-state level of wave intensity in the order of I k \u0005 10 \u0003 5 \u0003 10 \u0003 4 . The inverse limited case where V d = C s < (1 þ z ) \u0005 1 was analyzed [128] using the quasilinear approach for evaluation of instability growth rate and wave intensity. It was found that in a range of k numbers in which damping and growth are absent, the energy flux from waves with longer wavelengths to those with shorter wavelengths is conserved as the energy cascades to shorter wavelengths. In this regime, a new condition k 4 I k \u0005 const is valid, which finally yields I k \u0001 k \u0003 8 = 3 (2 : 100a) G k \u0001 k 2 = 3 (2 : 100b) In the region k > k c of the k -domain in which wave modes with short wavelengths are damped, where k c can be written as k c ¼ q H ( n im þ n ie ) (1 þ z ) L V d C 2 s \f\r 1 = 2 (2 : 101) it can be shown that g k ¼\u0003 (1 þ q H Q H ) \u0003 1 k 2 C 2 s = ( n im þ n ie ) and, according to Refs.

Now, following Refs. [128 – 130], we can present a breakpoint k ¼ k *, at which the polynomial dependence of wave intensity I k is changed from \u0001 k \u0003 8 = 3 for k < k *to I k \u0001 k \u0003 2 for k > k *, in the following manner: k * ¼ k 0 (1 þ z ) 2 k 2 0 L Q H ( n im þ n ie ) V d \u000e\u000f 3 = 4 1 \u0003 2 C 2 s V 2 d (1 þ z ) 2 ! \u0003 3 = 4 (2 : 103) In Ref. [131], following the results obtained in the investigations mentioned [128 – 130], the possibility of transferring energy in triad – wave interaction was investigated based on the general relation between the nonlinear increment (decrement) of wave – wave interaction, the wave inten- sity, and the coefficients of triad-mode interaction: G k 0 \u0005 V e k 0 , k \u0003 k 0 V e k \u0003 k 0 , k \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b 1 = 2 I 1 = 2 k (2 : 104) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 67 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 67"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Here, the energy of a linearly growing wave with wave vector k , propagating in a direction approximately orthogonal to B 0 (with k 2 ? = k 2 jj > q H Q H ), is transferred, as a result of triad – wave interactions, into energy of two linear damping wave modes with vectors k 0 and k 00 ¼ k \u0003 k 0 (with k 0 2 ? = k 0 2 jj \u000b q H Q H ). In this case, the decrement of linear damping, g k 0 , of these two wave modes is controlled by the longitudinal (to B 0 ) diffusion, i.e., g k 0 \u0005\u0003 D jj k 0 2 k (2 : 105) At the steady-state level, linear damping is fully compensated for by nonlinear wave interactions; i.e., G k 0 ¼ g k 0 jj (2 : 106) Now substituting Equation 2.93 into Equation 2.104, we can, for region F of the ionosphere, estimate the nonlinear increment of wave excitation: G k 0 \u0005 k \u0003 k 0 ½\t jj k \u0006 E 0 ðÞ = B 0 k 2 ?

These estimations explain the existence of weakly anisotropic plasma disturbances observed experimentally in the high-latitude F layer ionosphere [131]. We should stress here that these estimations were obtained on the assumption of a random phase of complex coefficients V k , k 0 and a steady-state level of plasma turbulence. Finally, we should note that a full analysis of equations for amplitudes of three interacting waves have shown that the phases of complex coefficients of wave interactions, V k , k 0 , determine the character of nonlinear instability growth (damping), whereas the steady-state level of wave intensity (amplitude) is defined by modules of these coefficients, i.e., by V k , k 0 \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b . It was also shown that in the ionospheric plasma the imaginary parts of V k , k 0 , defined by Equations 2.92 and 2.93, are predominant compared with their real parts. Therefore, the steady state level (if it exists) is determined by the imaginary parts of V k , k 0 , but the character of the nonlinear process of instability growth and the time of instability saturation (i.e., time of steady-state level achievement) is defined by the real parts of V k , k 0 . 2.4.2 Particle – Wave Interactions in the Ionospheric Plasma As mentioned previously, for V d > C s , k > k *, yielding some other saturation mechanism leading from steady-state conditions.

Such a wave-generated anomalous diffusion of charged particles in plasma is equivalent to an increase in the effective collision frequency which can essentially change the dispersion relations of waves in the perturbed plasma. The nonlinear particle – wave interaction leads to modification of the electron collisional frequency, n e , to a new value, n e þ n e *. As shown in the following text, the additional term n e *, depending on the amplitude of the wave spectrum, finally leads to faster vanishing of increment g k in the saturated state. This process has been investigated in detail by Dupree [132], who estimated the influence of turbulent diffusion on the evolution of plasma instabilities. His approach was then applied [133,134] in an analysis of the nonlinear stage of ionospheric plasma instability and in describing the saturation process of plasma instabilities in the ionosphere. Sudan [128] has modified the results obtained [133,134] by a stricter investigation of the expressions for the dispersion relations. We will present an outline of the methods of perturbed orbits and discussions on the final results. We recommend that readers interested in further details of this method address themselves to the original research [128,132 – 134]. If fluctuations of the electric fields of plasma turbulence have a random and isotropic character, the interaction of waves and plasma species has the character of turbulent diffusion [132], which was used [133,134] for the analysis of the nonlinear stage of FB and GD instabilities of the ionospheric plasma based on the method of perturbed orbits of plasma species, electrons, and ions, called in Ref. [132] particle trapping . The later nonlinear effect for drift waves (e.g., for GDI) was found [132] predominant for waves of the ion-acoustic type, particularly for two-stream instabil- ities. Based on the theory developed in Ref. [132], it was shown [133,134] that both the wave – wave interactions and perturbations of plasma particle trajectories due to these waves are the dominant nonlinear effects exciting plasma waves, and govern wave growth. Thus, it was found [133,134] that the trajectory r ( t ) of the plasma species a ( a ¼ e , i ), after interacting with waves generated by a perturbed electrostatic electric field ( d E ¼\u0003r w , where w is the potential of this field) at moment t , can be defined as r ( t ) ¼ r 0 þ V 0 t \b ð t 0 d t 1 ð t 1 0 d t 2 ^ m a d E r ( t 2 ), t 2 ðÞ (2 : 109) where r 0 is the radius of the initial trajectory of the plasma species, d E , the perturbed electric field, ^ m a , the mobility of species a ¼ e , i , and V 0 , the minimum drift velocity at which plasma is not damped. It should be noted that Equation 2.109 was analyzed [132 – 134] in the weak coupling approximation where the nonlinear terms proportional to ( d E ) 2 and higher-order have been neglected. The last term in Equation 2.109 takes into account the influence of plasma turbulence on charged-particle movements. Accounting for random fluctuations in the field and its influence on the movement of plasma particles, we can present wave oscillations of charged particles by the following exponent: exp[ i kr ( t ) \u0003 v t ] ¼ exp[ i ( kr 0 \u0003 v t )] exp[ i k D r ( t )] (2 : 110) Here, all notations are as introduced earlier; D r ( t ) equals the last term on the right-hand side of Equation 2.110, and describes random deviations of the particles ’ orbits.

The corresponding plasma disturbances (irregularities) associated with such nonlinear instabilities will be analyzed in Chapter 5. Here, we will only stress that estimation of plasma disturbances, d N = N 0 , which can be obtained from the saturation condition of GDI, g NL ¼ 0, carried out in Ref. [135], gives d N N 0 \f\r 2 *+ \u0005 \u0006 2 k 2 jj DE (2 : 114) where, as earlier, x ¼ (1 = N 0 )(d N 0 = d z ) is the longitudinal (to the vertical axis) plasma density gradient.

In studies [136 – 138] based on the quasilinear theory of plasma instability excitation, the limits of accuracy of method of the perturbed orbits were analyzed, and it was shown that the method is useful only for the description of weak turbulences with a wide spectrum in the wave-number domain when the spatial and temporal correlation of electric field perturbations is small enough. The authors [136 – 138] obtained considerably lower amplitude of plasma perturbations associated with such instabilities — about 1% – 2%. As was also shown [139], in a wide spectrum of plasma turbulence ( D k > k ) plasma particles, moving in the wave field with the wave vector k , are scattered in the waves with wave numbers k 0 > k , and the wave field with the wave numbers k 00 < k affects Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 70 26.3.2008 9:20pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 70 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"them as an ambient field. In the repeated cascade method developed in Ref. [139], the plasma concentration N and the velocities of charged particles V a are presented in the form of sum of sets (cascades) of order b (defined as ranks of randomization of the process). For each definite rank b , the parameters N ( b 0 ) and V ( b 0 ) a with ranks b 0 > b can be considered as fluctuations leading to randomization (chaotization) of the process, and those with ranks b 0 < b can be considered as deterministic parameters changing in a regular manner. Based on the cascade theory for analysis of turbulence of weakly inhomogeneous plasma (particularly, for GDI), it was shown [140] that cascades with higher ranks ( b þ 1) limit growth of perturbations in the definite cascade of rank b due to turbulent (anomalous) diffusion, whereas cascades with lower ranks ( b \u0003 1) increase the rate of wave growth. For GDI occurring in the ionospheric plasma, the influence of the cascade ( b \u0003 1) on growth of perturbations in cascade b can be of the same order as in the case of the initially nonequilibrium plasma with a one- dimensional spectrum of turbulence of U N \u0005 k \u0003 p , with p < 2 [140]. As we noted previously, in Ref. [128] following Ref.

The corresponding eigenmode oscillatory frequency and the increment of mode growth in such a nonlinear (NL) case can be written as v NL k ¼ kV 0 cos u 1 þ § þ § T (2 : 116a) g NL k ¼ ( § þ § T ) n i (1 þ § þ § T ) v NL k \u0001\u0002 2 \u0003 k 2 C 2 s hi (2 : 116b) Here again, § ¼ 1 = q H Q H , and § T ¼ 1 = q T H Q H , q T H ¼ v H = n T e ; all other parameters are well known and have been introduced previously. In the saturated steady (equilibrium) state, g NL k ¼ 0 and, consequently, v NL k ¼ kC s ¼ kV 0 cos u 1 þ § þ § T (2 : 117) In other words, it was shown [128] that § T increases the probability of shutting the instability in plasma and, simultaneously, causes a shift in phase (due to v NL k ) to keep the nonlinear phase velocity at ion-acoustic velocity C s . These features, the isotropy of the process and the limiting value of phase velocity, are explained elsewhere [128] using a more precise mathematical tool approach. At the same time, in that study [128] a result close to that shown earlier [136 – 138] was obtained, concerning the low saturated level of density perturbation, of about a few percent, in region E of the ionosphere. In this region of the ionosphere, for the case of V 0 \r C s , as shown earlier, following Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 71 26.3.2008 9:21pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 71"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Ref. [128], the spectrum I k of the corresponding instabilities with wave-number spread D k 0 \u0001 k is fully described by Equation 2.99. As mentioned in Refs. [141,142], because of different theories, sometimes with close, and sometimes different, results, and based on kinetic and hydrodynamic (e.g., two-fluid, electron and ion) approaches, it is difficult to present any clear physical picture of the anomalous transport processes accompanying excitation of either two-stream (FB) or E 0 \u0004 B 0 (GD) instabilities (or both of them) in the equatorial and polar E region of the ionosphere. Moreover, some authors have excluded the anomalous diffusion and the corresponding effective frequencies of collisions between plasma species and neutral molecules (atoms), despite the fact that wave – wave and wave – particle interactions can play an important role, as shown earlier, in the saturation process of growth of unstable waves (i.e., instabilities) in the ionospheric plasma. Therefore, the authors [141,142] have tried to unify the theory of anomalous resistivity of plasma caused by the anomalous (turbulent) diffusion of plasma species and corresponding changes of collisional frequencies due to interaction of unstable waves with particles, based on fluid theory and comparing their approach with those obtained [127 – 129,143 – 145] on the basis of kinetic theory. As shown by Sudan and coauthors [101,102,127 – 129] and based on simplified and also on consistently strict kinetic theory, wave – wave and wave – particle interactions can modify signifi- cantly the characteristic properties of unstable waves in the ionospheric plasma of the auroral or equatorial region E, both FB and GD instabilities, first in their growth rate, phase velocity and oscillatory frequency of eigenmodes (see previous discussions) and, finally, the change of transport processes in plasma, in which additional (to ordinary) anomalous diffusion, called turbulence, always occurs. The close effects were obtained by Robinson and coauthors [143 – 145], analyzing the effect of the interaction between unstable waves and particles and also using the framework of kinetic theory. It was shown that through wave – particle interactions, plasma waves can essentially change the diffusive properties of ionospheric plasma, the coefficients of diffusion (from ordinary to turbulent) and the frequencies of interaction of species, as well as the plasma resistivity, described as anomalous. In some studies [141,142] based on fluid theory and a fluid isotropic two-dimensional turbulent model and built upon the Sudan ’ s algorithm, the anomalous (turbulent) collisional electron – neutral frequency was found in the same way as in a previous work [128]. The authors then modified the method, as well as the corresponding coefficient of turbulent diffusion for the strongly anisotropic turbulent model. We will not go into all the mathematical statements in the studies referred to [141,142], but will only point out the common physical aspects leading from these different theories. Considering the FB and GD unstable wave excitation, the same broadband shifting nonlinear effects through diffusion due to the presence of small-scale waves were analyzed [141,142] as done in an earlier investigation [128]. Thus, for the fluid isotropic turbulent model, it was shown that the anomalous frequency of electron – neutral collisions n T e ¼ § 1 þ § Q H 2 v H d N N 0 \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b 2 (2 : 118) can be modified by introducing into the denominator the parameter § þ § T instead of § ¼ 1 = q H Q H , where, as earlier, § T ¼ 1 = q T H Q H ( q T H ¼ v H = n T e ), i.e., the same as obtained in the previous work [128]. But as was shown in Refs. [141,142], in the case of strongly anisotropic turbulence when anomalous diffusion is enhanced only in the direction of the original electric field, such a replacement in Equation 2.118 is impossible. It was also shown [142] that the diffusion process in the E 0 \u0004 B 0 Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 72 26.3.2008 9:21pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 72 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"drift direction reduces the rate of growth in the eigenfrequency, which is executed through the factor § in Equation 2.118 with only the linear value of § ¼ 1 = q H Q H in the one-dimensional case (when eigenmodes d n k or d E k of plasma density and electric field perturbations are delta functions with the peak at u ¼ 0 0 ) and for a nonlinear regime. On the assumption of isotropic plasma density distribution, and when § þ § T is also isotropic, the results in Refs. [127 – 129] and those in Refs. [141,142] give, for relations between perturbations of electric field d E and of plasma density d N (called standard isotropic turbulence model), close results; i.e., d E E 0 ¼ cos u Q H (1 þ § þ § T ) d N N 0 (2 : 119) Instead of using the nonlinear term § þ § T , for a description of the coefficient of anomalous diffusion, the factor § 0 was chosen as nonlinear [141,142], expressed by § 0 ¼ [ n e þ n T e ( u 0 þ p = 2)] = Q H v H . So, the authors [141,142] instead of using n T e in Equation 2.116 used the more complicated term n T e ( u 0 þ p = 2), accounting for the main anomalous diffusion effects in the direction u ¼ p = 2, i.e., in the E 0 \u0004 B 0 drift direction. In this case, the only difference between the theories will be in the frequency broadening, D v k 0 , which was chosen to be D v k 0 ¼ k 0 2 ( D þ D T ) [127 – 129]. According to Refs. [141,142], we get D v k 0 ¼ k 0 2 D § ( § þ § T ) \u0005 k 0 2 D (2 : 120) So, using fluid theory and assuming that § 0 \r 1 (instead of § < 1 [127 – 129]), the authors [141,142] included the nonlinear effects by choosing an anomalous frequency n e þ n T e instead of n e used in Refs. [127,128], and therefore obtained the same effects in broadening of frequency due to turbulence in Equation 2.120, replacing D by D þ D T . Again, both kinetic and fluid theories give close results even though the physical concepts diverge. 2.4.2.1 Nonlinear Saturation of Electrostatic Instabilities in the Ionosphere In the foregoing we discussed the saturation of instability growth due to turbulent diffusion caused by wave – wave interaction and transformation of energy from long-wavelength to short-wavelength modes, as well as by wave – particle interactions, both based on kinetic and fluid theories. It is interesting to point out that a decrease in increment of instability, i.e., stabilization of plasma perturbations in the ionosphere, can be observed in several other interesting cases, when fluctuations of electric fields and plasma densities lead to (1) decrease of eigenfrequencies v k (which corresponds to respective decrease of drift velocity V d ), (2) decrease of plasma density gradient x ¼r ln N 0 leading to a steady-state (equilibrium) configuration of the average plasma concentrations, (3) increase of temperature of plasma species, electrons, and ions, and (4) generation of drift velocity shear produced by the electric field component in the direction of the density gradient. In Refs. [146,147] estimations were obtained of the quasi-equilibrium level of plasma turbulence due to stabilization of GDI of plasma by decreasing the gradient of plasma density, x ¼r ln N 0 , and by decreasing the drift velocity of plasma species, V d . It was shown that for low-frequency (long- wavelength) electrostatic waves with relative amplitudes not exceeding 10% (i.e., d N = N 0 < 0.1), the amplitude of disturbances of plasma d N and the potential of electric field dw (because d E ¼\u0003 i k dw ) are related through the following expression: Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 73 26.3.2008 9:21pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 73"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"d N ¼ d a dw exp \u0003 i DF fg (2 : 121) Here, DF is the phase shift between oscillations of dw and d N ; the amplitude parameter d a was estimated [146,147] for the lower and upper ionosphere.

The total electric field E in the turbulized plasma of the total density N can now be presented through the disturbed plasma parameters d E and d N , the nondisturbed parameters E 0 and N 0 , and the additional parameters ~ E ( t ) and N ~ ( t ).

Taking into account Equation 2.121, after straightforward computations [146,147] the decrement of damping of eigenmodes in the turbulized plasma was obtained. This describes the effect of stabilization of plasma GDI growth with decrease of the plasma density gradient and of the drift velocity of plasma species: g k ¼\u0003 4 m eH k ? \u0006 k 2 jj x ~ \u0006 d a d N N 0 \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b 2 sin DF (2 : 124) Here, as earlier, x ~ ¼ N \u0003 1 0 ( @ N ~ ( t ) =@ y ) is the gradient of average density of turbulent plasma, the y -axis is the vertical axis, which, for simplicity of the problem, was directed along the magnetic field B 0 , and subscripts jj and ? determine components of wave vectors parallel and perpendicular to B 0 .

Plasma irregularities of such amplitudes were observed both in the equatorial and auroral ionosphere (details in Chapters 6 and 7). The process of thermostabilization of current instabilities (FB or GD) in region E of the ionosphere was analyzed [148] using the quasilinear approach for low-frequency electrostatic instability of ionospheric plasma. The corresponding change in the equilibrium temperature, D T a , of plasma electrons ( a ¼ e ) and plasma ions ( a ¼ i ) with respect to those occurring in the equilibrium regime, T 0 a , as well as the level of turbulence enough to establish a steady-state regime were estimated [148] based on the hydrodynamic (fluid) theory. The estimations were made separately for E and F layers. Without entering into mathematical details we will present in the following text estimations of the preceding parameters to finally give the amplitude of plasma disturbances (with respect to background steady-state plasma density) usually observed in region E of the ionosphere (see Chapter 6 and results of observations presented there). We will only note that in this investigation [148] a model of homogeneous turbulence and the hydrodynamic equations for the temperature of plasma species, electrons, and ions was used. After averaging these equations over the spatial scale, larger than the wavelength in plasma, and after subtracting from these same equations, but written for the non-turbulent equilibrium plasma (i.e., using the same method as in Refs. [146,147]), the author has obtained expressions for the disturbances of electron and ion temperatures, which we estimate separately for lower and upper ionospheric plasma.

These estimations made for the lower and upper ionosphere are in good agreement with those made in Refs. [146,147], presented previously. Concluding this paragraph, we note that the stabilizating effects of the electric field components along the plasma density gradient x play an important role in ‘‘ saturating ’’ the E 0 \u0004 B 0 instability [149 – 151] generated in region F during artificial experiments involving injection of plasma clouds in the ionosphere, observed experimentally [152 – 156] and obtained analytically and numerically [157 – 169]. The authors [157 – 159] have investigated the generation of E 0 \u0004 B 0 instability based on the model of one- and two-layered ionosphere, where in the upper layer the barium cloud was artificially injected as background equilibrium plasma disturbance. They therefore dealt with the one- and two-dimensional models of plasma structure generated in the homogeneous background ionospheric plasma. In such a statement of the problem, the equation of continuity (i.e., conser- vation) of the ion component of plasma and the equation of the nondivergence of current have been integrated along the ionospheric altitude on the assumption that the electrostatic potential F does not depend on the height z , which extended along the geomagnetic field lines. In the initial conditions of the problem for plasma density during numerical simulations, artificially induced initial small perturbations were introduced and their spatial and temporal evolution was analyzed. It was shown that if the integral Pedersen conductivity of the E layer (the bottom layer) is higher than that of the F layer (where the barium cloud was injected), the stratified small-scale structure cannot be developed because the polarization fields of each strata can be neutralized by short-circuit currents passing through the background ionosphere between two layers. The result obtained leads from the assumption made in these investigations [157 – 159] that the potential F does not depend on the height of the ionosphere for instabilities of various scales. As shown in Refs. [160 – 162], based on the three-dimensional model, and again in Refs. [163 – 166], where the effects of short-circuit currents and their role in the evolution of strong plasma disturbances have been investigated both analytically and numerically, for small-scale plasma perturbations this statement is Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 76 26.3.2008 9:21pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 76 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"not correct. For small-scale perturbations of the electric field for the transverse scales (to B 0 )of plasma perturbations less than 1 km, the polarization fields cannot penetrate from the F layer to the E layer. This example shows the limitation of the two-dimensional model of plasma instability evolution in the ionosphere. We will discuss the barium cloud evolution and its accompanying features in Chapter 6. We now present the effect of stabilization of growth of plasma GDI, following results obtained in Refs. [151,169] by analyzing drift processes of plasma clouds in the ionosphere. It was shown that the stabilization effect can be observed at the initial stage of plasma cloud evolution due to the creation of the shear of the azimuthal drift velocity created in the background plasma by azimuthal currents. Their stabilizing effect is observed if the azimuthal drift velocity exceeds its threshold value [169]: V th \u0001 V A [ A = ( A þ 2)] (2 : 130) Here, A ¼ d N (0,0,0) = N 0 is the relative initial plasma density perturbation within the barium cloud, V A \u0001 c \u0003 1 E 0 ? \u0004 B 0 is the drift velocity in the azimuthal direction, c , the speed of light, and E 0 ? , the ambient transverse (to B 0 ) electric field component. It was also shown that the shear of the azimuthal drift velocity decreases with an increase of the plasma structure dimensions along B 0 . According to Drake et al. [151], the criterion of plasma drift stabilization can be presented (using notations introduced in this chapter) as follows: T e (1 þ T i = T e ) eE 0 ? > ‘ jj ‘ ? \f\r 2 1 \u0003 V th ðÞ q H Q H (2 : 131) From the preceding inequality (Equation 2.131), with an increase in E 0 ? , i.e., with an increase in azimuthal drift velocity V A , the threshold of stabilization is also increased. Hence, the absence of stabilizing effects can occur, accompanied by drift instability growth, in a strong ambient electric field. At the same time, with increasing parameters of plasma density perturbations A within the initial plasma structure ( A > 10), the factor A = ( A þ 2) \u0005 1 and, as seen from the previous inequality (Equation 2.131) for E 0 ? ¼ const , the threshold of plasma drift stabilization becomes smaller than in the inverse case of A < 10, where A = ( A þ 2) < 1. So, with increasing plasma perturbations inside the plasma structure (cloud, beam, etc.) the effect of plasma drift stabilization is strongly manifested and a smooth spreading of plasma structure in the process of its evolution is observed (see Refs. [167 – 169] and Chapter 6). It was also found in several studies [151,160,167 – 169] that the effect of stabilization of E 0 \u0004 B 0 instability strongly depends on the criterion of ‘‘ stretching ’’ of GDI, the amplitude of initial plasma instability, and its transversal dimension to B 0 . It was found that the maximal GDI growth rate that is needed for the development of the stretching mechanism is of the order [151,160] g max \u0001 cE 0 ? = B 0 ‘ ? (2 : 132) At the same time, as was shown by Blaunstein et al. [167 – 169], GDI will develop if the growing perturbation of ambient electric field d E is not cancelled by longitudinal electron currents due to the short-circuit effect in the background plasma. In other words, when the time of the ‘‘ mean ’’ electron ’ s run along B 0 ; t k ¼ ‘ k = V k , exceeds the inverse increment of GTD instability, ~ \u0001 jj ¼ X g \u0003 1 max , i.e., t jj > ~ \u0001 jj .

This is why some numerical results obtained in Refs.

At the same time the striation mechanism observed in Ref. [160] for very anisotropic plasma structures is fully confirmed by the analysis presented here and by estimations obtained from the expansion given in Equations 2.132 through 2.134). At the same time, following from these estimations and with a decreasing parameter of initial plasma structure anizotropy, i.e., for ‘ jj =‘ ? < 3 \u0006 10 1 , the threshold of drift stabilization is smaller, and its saturation will affect weakly stretched plasma structures at an ealier stage of their evolution. So, using the formulas numbered 2.130 – 2.134 and results obtained in various studies [160 – 162,167 – 169], we can predict both the process of GDI stabilization in strongly ionized ( A > 10) weakly anisotropic ( ‘ jj =‘ ? < 3 \u0006 10 1 ) plasma structures ’ evolution in a weak ambient electric field ( E 0 ? \u0007 1 \u0003 5mV = m), and the process of GDI generation during evolution of a weakly ionized ( A < 10), strongly anisotropic ( ‘ jj =‘ ? > 3 \u0006 10 1 ) plasma structure drifting in a strong ambient electric field ( E 0 ? > 5mV = m). 2.4.2.2 Numerical Analysis of Nonlinear Effects of Instabilities Generation As mentioned previously, due to the complicity of analytical investigation of the whole complex of physical processes accompanying the generation and further evolution of plasma waves (instabil- ities) and associated plasma disturbances in the ionosphere, several groups of researchers, including those mentioned here, separately and idependently investigated numerically two- and four-order systems of equations for eigenmodes based on both kinetic and hydrodynamic approaches. Thus, some authors [170,171] investigated GDI and the associated plasma irregularities in the equatorial region of the ionosphere based on a two-dimensional numerical simulation of the equations governing the dynamics of electron and ion plasma components in the quasineutral, quasihomogeneous, and isothermal background ionosphere, i.e., the equations of conservation of charged particles and of nondivergence current, presented here using our unified notations employed throughout this chapter: @ N @ t þ m eH B 0 \u0004r F B 2 0 r N ¼ D i Q 2 H r 2 N (2 : 135a) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 78 26.3.2008 9:21pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 78 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"m 2 eH B 0 \u0004r F B 2 0 r N þ m iP r F \u0006r N þ N r 2 F \u0001\u0002 ¼ D i Q 2 H \u0003 D e q 2 H \f\r r 2 N (2 : 135b) We also assumed that the plasma concentration N ¼ N ( x,y,t ) and the potential of electric field F ¼ F ( x,y,t ) do not depend on the coordinate z situated along the geomagnetic field B 0 .

Equation 2.136b, taken from Refs. [127,128] with our unified notations, is more general than presented in Refs. [170,171] as it takes into account the direction of unstable wave propagationwith respect to drift velocityassociated with GDI dynamics. At the same time, Equation 2.136b for the increment is different compared with that obtained in Refs. [127,128], where ion inertia was taken into account and the term \u0003 k 2 C 2 s n im replaced by [ v 2 ( k ) \u0003 k 2 C 2 s ] = n im . According to the statements of the problem, for the diurnal equatorial region E, where the constraint V 2 d \u000b (1 þ § ) 2 C 2 s is usually satisfied, v 2 ( k ) \u000b k 2 C 2 s , and the ion inertia terms in the equation of ion fluid can safely be neglected. In this case Equation 2.136b is sufficiently correct for numerical analysis of GDI temporal and spatial evolution. The parameters chosen for the simulations were such that only the two or three modes with the longest wavelengths possible in the system had positive g ( k ); other modes have a tendency to damp fast. The problem was numerically simulated at the limited square plate with scale L 0 ¼ 75 \u0003 256 m, the boundaries of which were chosen so that N ( r , t ) ¼ N 0 and r F ( r , t ) ¼\u0003 E 0 . In the initial conditions for the concentration N, small 2-D plasma disturbances of scale L 0 = 2 p were introduced. The initial amplitude of these perturbations was changed from 1% to 3% compared with that for the background ionospheric plasma N 0 . The nine models were analyzed numerically with different numbers of mesh points for the size L 0 and the drift velocity V d . One of the models called model (3) of such computations is shown in Figure 2.3 for V d ¼ 125 m = s [170]. Contour lines represent equal increments in d N between maximum (plus signs) and minimum (minus signs). The horizontal axis is y -directed along the electron drift velocity and the vertical axis is z -directed along the altitude of the ionosphere. Density contour plots at t ¼ 0, 2, 8, and 16 s appear in Figure 2.3a through d. It was found that up to t ¼ 6 s the density perturbation reaches a maximum of about 12.5% compared with N 0 . Short-wavelength growth was strongest around t ¼ 8 s, then damping due to turbulences with velocities v h reaching the original electron drift velocity and finally approaching a steady state after t ¼ 12 s. Defined solutions of the Equation 2.135, N ( x,y,t ) ¼ d N ( x,y,t ) þ N 0 and F ( x,y,t ), were then expanded in Ref. [171] in the Fourier series and 2-D spatial spectra of fluctuations of plasma density (see also the definition introduced previously according to Refs. [127,128]) were derived as follows: I k ( k , t ) ¼ ( L 0 = 2 p ) 2 d N ( k , t ) = N 0 jj 2 \t ¼ ( L 0 = 2 p ) 2 n k ( t ) jj 2 \t (2 : 137) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 79 26.3.2008 9:21pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 79"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"where L 2 0 is the area of the mesh of numerical computations.

For the analysis of nonlinear broading, the frequency spectra I k ( k , v ) were derived in Ref. [171] by using Fourier transformance of the spectra I k ( k , t ) at the time interval of 20.5 s after achievement of the quasi-equilibrium state.

Here k y is the wave number for the mode propagating along the direction of the electron drift velocity, V d , and k x is the wave number of the mode propagating in the vertical direction (along altitudes of the ionosphere). The illustration presented shows that the nonlinear interaction of plasma modes (associated with GDI) breaks down the direct dependence between v and k . Each wave vector k in such interactions corresponds in the frequency spectra not only to one frequency v k , described by the dispersive Equation 2.43, but also to a wide band of frequencies of width D v / G k .As shown earlier, following previous investigations [127,128], the value of D v generally depends on the orientation of the vector k and achieves maximum magnitude for k orthogonal to drift velocity V d (i.e., for u ¼ p = 2), as seen from the illustration presented in Figure 2.5c.

Numerically, in Refs. [170,171] the possibility of nonlinear transformation of energy from linearly excited modes to the linear damping modes was predicted. However, the effects of saturation of linear damping modes were not obtained in Ref. [171] even when using the quasilinear approach, but were obtained in Refs. [127,128], where, from a numerical modeling of the evolution of strong GDI in region E of the ionosphere, the nonlinear effects were stressed. In a framework of a strongly turbulent two-dimensional convection of two-fluid plasma, electrons, and ions, based on the same initial conditions of the problem, as in Refs. [170,171], giving the same basic system of Equation 2.135, in Refs. [127,128] the nonlinear wave damping, the steady-state spectra intensity, and the the nonlinear frequency broading were analyzed more correctly. Previously, we described results of quantitative analytical analysis carried out by Sudan and Keskinen [127] based on a two-fluid theory. The calculations were based on the ‘‘ direct interaction ’’ approximation pioneered by Kraichnan [126] and on the ‘‘ renormalized nonlinear wave interaction ’’ theory devel- oped by Kadomtsev [124].

As found theoretically [127,128], because of the difference in collisionality of two plasma species, electrons, and ions, in the E layer, the ambient electric field E 0 gives rise to a current J 0 ¼ J 0 y resulting from the drift of the electrons with velocity V d / E 0 \u0004 B 0 .

The nonlinear evolution of these unstable waves generated by the current J 0 ¼ J 0 y leads to a 2-D equilibrium turbulent state (usually called steady-state regime).

Based on the self-consistent theory [128], we analyzed previously the behavior of G k and I k in the frequency domain, in relation to the wavelength. We will now present the approximate formula which can be used successfully to describe the broadening of the plasma power spectra in the nonlinear regime, corresponding to the theory of strong turbulence. Without going into details of the description of all parameters and notations used during complicated derivations of the non- linear dispersive equation and the corresponding wave – wave interaction coefficients, the predicted approximate formula for G k is [127,171] G k ¼ const \u0006 q H 1 þ q H Q H V d k 2 I 1 = 2 k (2 : 141) In Figure 2.8 the numerically obtained angle-averaged spectral width, h D v i = 2 p , defined by Equation 2.140 is shown versus k = k 0 and the corresponding wavelengths L for the three electron drift velocities V d ¼ 75, 100, 125 m = s (i.e., for models 1 – 3, respectively, introduced in Refs.

Again, there is a good agreement between simulated nonlinear damped rate, G sw , and the same parameter, G k , obtained theoretically from Equation 2.141 by using the quasilinear approach, is evident. To solve the Equation 2.135 numerically, in Refs. [127,128], a spatial Fourier transformance to perturbed plasma concentration, N ( x,y,t ) ¼ d N ( x,y,t ) þ N 0 , and to the potential of the electric field F ( x,y,t ) was used over the coordinate x orthogonal both to B 0 and to the gradient of plasma density x ¼r ln N 0 , directed parallel to E 0 . As the result of such a transformation, a system of differential equations in partial derivatives for the modes N k and F k was obtained. The functions N k ¼ N k ( y,t ) and F k ¼ F k ( y,t ) are now functions of time and the coordinate y directed parallel to V d (see the statement of the problem introduced according to Refs. [170,171]). The system obtained was solved numerically for the discrete set of wave vectors k j ¼ k 0 \u0006 j , where j ¼ 0, 1, 2, . . . ; k 0 is the wave vector with the maximum linear increment g k max ; i.e., the wave mode with j ¼ 0 described the quasilinear changes of plasma and the electric field (e.g., the potential).

Here, the normalized time T along the horizontal axis is presented in the units of t 0 ¼ l 0 = V d , where l 0 is the length of the mesh along y -axis. It can be seen that with an increase of the level above the threshold of instability generation, the time of the steady-state regime when the wave system limits its quasi-equilibrium is decreased. Numerical analysis of the Equation 2.135 was carried out in Ref. [172], where the geometry of the problem was assumed to be the following: The gradient of plasma density r N 0 as well as the ambient electric field E 0 were directed along the z -axis, and the vector B 0 along the x -axis. The obtained numerical solution of the system (Equation 2.135) for the zero-mode wave (with j ¼ 0) showed that turbulization of background ionospheric plasma decreases the large-scale gradient of plasma density and the large-scale electric field E at the place of localization of the initial maximum gradient r N 0 ( t ¼ 0). In addition to this effect, the moving pulses of this type of solutions usually occur along the y -axis, i.e., in the direction orthogonal to both the ambient electric and magnetic fields. In the system mentioned (Equation 2.135), the nonlinear effects, producing real values of coefficients of nonlinear wave – wave interactions, V k , k 0 , were not taken into account. In Ref. [173] it was shown that even for three-mode interactions with the pure imaging coefficients V k , k 0 , and with g k ¼ const , the linear growing waves do not achieve their quasi-equilibrium level if the nonlinear effects are omitted from the problem under consideration. So, in the numerical models presented in Refs. [127,170 – 172], the limitation of the growth of linear unstable modes take place due to quasilinear and nonlinear processes. The same (as for GDI) quasilinear limitation of turbulence growth was obtained during numerical simulation of two- stream (FB) instability in the homogeneous ionosphere [174]. Here, the 2-D system of equations of conservation of plasma species and their movement was numerically solved, where the ion inertia and the viscosity forces were taken into account. The 2-D functions computed, N ( x,y,t )and F ( x,y,t ), allowed for finding the average current J hi ¼\u0003 eN ^ m r F hi , where ^ m ¼ ^ m e \u0003 ^ m i , the correspond- ing average electric field denoted by h E i . It was shown that the component of h E i along y -axis, i.e., in the direction of the ambient field E 0 \u0002 E 0 y y coming close to the threshold level, E th , usually occurs for two-stream instability (see previous text) when the turbulence achieves its quasy-equilibrium level. This result shows the efficiency of the quasilinear and nonlinear effects for stabilization of linearly growing wave modes. This is an important result, because in Ref. [174] the level above the threshold was taken to equal E 0 y = E th ¼ 1.06, sufficiently small. Therefore, in these computations the maximim of wave amplitude has achieved more than 20% (compared to background plasma), and it is very important to point out that, in Refs. [127,173,174], taking into consideration the effects of strong turbulences and nonlinearity in the statement of the problem, it was shown that for higher levels, above the threshold, V dth ¼ V 0 (for GDI) and V dth ¼ C s or V dth ¼ v Ti (for FBI); the more effective quasi- and nonlinear mechanisms of turbulence stabilization should be taken into account to limit the growth of unstable waves and for their saturation. All results obtained in the studies mentioned [127,128,170 – 174] correspond to short-scale plasma turbulences. Numerical simulation of large-scale plasma turbulences existing in the daytime equatorial zone of the ionosphere was carried out in an investigation [175], taking into account for the close relation with the nonlinear effects of short-scale turbulence on large-scale plasma disturbances analyzed in Ref. [94], following the strong turbulence theory developed earlier [127]. As shown previously for short-scale turbulences, a nonlinear saturation of GDI and the isotropic distribution of the associated waves in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field occur, and the linear eigenfrequency v r k remains simultaneously unchanged even in the presence of strong turbulence with large spectral frequency width, D v ( k ).

[175] because, as found during the theoretical analysis of the problem, wavelengths of plasma density perturbations become of the same order of the equilibrium electron density scale height. The principal modification was the inclusion of the effects of shear in the electron drift velocity generating small-scale vertical structures. In another study [93], the nonlocal effects modifying the linear growth rate and affecting the long-wavelength perturbations were analyzed, and their influence on the large-scale dynamics predicted in Ref. [94]. The same system of equations, as in Refs. [93,94], describing evolution of isothermal plasma and neglecting inertial terms in them, was used in Ref. [175] to investigate numerically nonlinear nonlocal evolution of large-scale plasma structures, developing and growing out of initial random perturbations (instabil- ities) in the ionospheric plasma. To take into account effects of strong small-scale turbulence on large-scale dynamics, the renor- malized (turbulent) values for the electron Pedersen mobility, m P *, and diffusion coefficients, D P * , were introduced despite those usually used in the linear theory based on weak turbulence effects; i.e., m P * ¼ 1 2 c 1 þ c m eH m eP \f\r 2 d N ( z ) N L \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b 2 *+ s m eP (2 : 142a) D P * ¼\u0003 1 2 c \u0003 c 2 (1 þ c ) 2 m eH m eP \f\r 2 d N ( z ) N L \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b \u000b 2 *+ s D eP (2 : 142b) where c ¼j m eP = m iP j , hj d N ( z ) = N L j 2 i s is the turbulent spectrum of small-scale fluctuations (defined by subscript s ), and N L , the large-scale total plasma density; other parameters have been introduced earlier. Then, we can write that m P \u0002 m eP \u0003 m P * and D P \u0002 D e \u0003 D P * . Following an earlier study [94], in Ref. [175] a 2-D two-fluid model was introduced to find the large-scale density, N L ¼ N 0 ( z ) þ d N ( x,z,t ), and the gradients of the electrostatic potential r F L ¼\u0003 E 0 ( z ) þ r F ( x,z,t ), where N 0 ( z ) and E 0 ( z ) ¼ E 0 x x þ E 0 z ( z ) z are the steady-state solutions of the back- ground plasma when the vertical currents are usually equal to zero. The ambient magnetic field B 0 is directed along the y -axis; i.e., B 0 ¼ B 0 y y . Introducing Fourier transform to the system, as in Equation 2.135, over the x -coordinate, the corresponding eigenmodes of the concentration and electric field perturbations were found and used to obtain the expression for the perturbed current density and the corresponding plasma density fluctuation spectra. The main result obtained in these studies [94,175] is that there is a strong coupling between interactions of short- and large-scale waves; by introducing nonlinear modifications in the linearized steady-state equations, the authors described the evolution of equilibrium density and electric field gradients. In the strongly turbulent regime, a nonsteady saturated state is reached faster due to damping of large-scale plasma disturbances strongly affected by shear of drift velocity which tends to distort and stretch the plasma perturbations in the horizontal direction (to the vertical axis). These mechanisms coupled with the diffusion process leads to fast damping of all perturbations with wavelengths comparable to the equilibrium gradient length of around 1 km. At the same time, during daytime conditions, recombination prevents growth of instability at longer wavelengths. This result, obtained in the studies mentioned [94,175], is in contradiction to those obtained using the local linear theory of GDI generation, according to which all modes with wavelengths greater than a few tens of meters are unstable. As shown in Refs. [94,175], even in the linear but nonlocal theory, the complete spectrum of global eigenfunctions of the GDI is stable because the coupled effect of all modes, small- and large-scale, leads to a system of steady-state waves. At the same time, in the strongly nonlinear regime the wave system tends to the nonsteady saturated state.

This effect is evident from Figure 2.9, in which the quasiperiodic pattern of the electron horizontal velocity is clearly seen in the time domain (initially with strong velocity shear for t ¼ 0 to steep layers with opposite shear in each layer at t ¼ 60 s). This quasi periodic pattern can decrease the stabilization effect of the horizontal shear. With time, when processes of collisional diffusion and the recombination mechanism are involved in plasma instability evolution, the striation effect of velocity shear becomes weaker (see bottom of figure for t ¼ 90 s), so that the nonlocal features involved in the nonlinear equations describing evolution of plasma perturbations in the ionosphere can slow down the effects of stabilization and saturation of instability growth caused by the horizontal velocity shear. Such an effect of neutralization of velocity shear effect was found in numerical simulations of evolution of plasma clouds in the ionosphere [160 – 162] as a large-scale plasma structure, and was mentioned previously based on a theoretical analysis [169]. Finally, we have to point out that the dependence of the average power spectrum versus k of I k / k \u0003 (1 : 76 \b 0 : 3) numerically obtained in Refs. [94,175] is fully in agreement with that obtained by Sudan using the analytical approach [128] (this dependence from k \u0003 8 = 3 to k \u0003 2 was discussed earlier in this chapter). Simultaneously, using nonlinear theory of GDI generation, Keskinen Ref. [176] has shown numerically that the existence of short-scale turbulences observed experimentally in the ionospheric plasma containing plasma shears [130,160] as a stabilization mechanism can be explained by the nonlinear cascade of wave energy from the large-scale (e.g., with long wavelengths) to the small- scale (e.g., with short wavelengths) turbulences. In Ref. [177], based on the quasilocal theory of GDI generation, it was shown that not only according to linear theory but also based on quasilocal mode approximation, the existence of short-wavelength unstable waves can be explained even in the presence of velocity shear, which exponentially damps the short-wavelength modes. We do not go into the mathematical description of this approximation and the corresponding direct numerical analysis of eigenmode equations, but will only mention that a new quasilocal wave mode not attenuating exponentially, as do local and nonlocal modes [93,94,175], was found in Ref. [177] and is responsible for the linearly exciting short GDI (modes) despite the damping effects of velocity shear, the aspect outlined earlier as one of the mechanisms of instability stabilization. These quasilocal unstable waves (modes) are evolved from the local wave modes (i.e., from those fully explained by the linear theory). At the same time, due to nonlinear increase of wave numbers with time, these modes grow and saturate even in the linear regime of GDI evolution, whose effect cannot be explained by using only the concept of generation of local modes in the ionospheric plasma, i.e., based only on the linear theory. If we now compare results obtained in Refs. [160,177] with those obtained in Refs. [93,94,175] using a nonlocal approach, as well as by different numerical and physical models, the former based on the quasilocal, nonexponential solution of two-order linear equations describing temporal and spatial evolution eigenmodes, and the latter models employing the numerical initial-value method for the fourth-order differential equations describing nonlocal growth of unstable waves, we will find some principally differing results obtained by these groups of researchers. Following other studies [178,179], in which the numerical results otained earlier [93,94,175] were compared with those from Refs. [160,175], and again without going into a mathematical description of the problem but only trying to understand the physical aspects of the problem, we can explain the results obtained through the prism of the experimentally observed data. Thus, most experiments carried out in the equatorial regions of the ionosphere have found the predominance of large-scale plasma perturbations of the order of about 1 km associated with long-wavelength unstable waves with the horizontal wave numbers of k x \u0005 (6.0 \u0003 6.3) \u0006 10 \u0003 3 m.

To confirm this contradiction with experiments in further study [94,175], the effects of short-wavelength turbulence on long- wavelengths was modeled (the so-called the subgrid model), because the linear theory does not explain the evolution of small-scale unstable modes (see previous discussion in this section); in equations for long-wavelength modes were artificially included additional turbulent mobility and diffusion coefficients and the height dependence of the laminar (regular) mobilities, and collisional frequencies of the plasma species were involved in the two-fluid theory. As a result, the essential increase of the increment rate and the corresponding transiently growing large-scale plasma structures were found. At the same time, in Refs. [160,177], using the quasilocal-mode concept and based on a numerical solution of two-order equations for eigenfunctions, it was found that the growth rate of large-scale unstable waves prevailed above the short-scale waves, and the later unstable modes damp faster due to velocity shear and recombination processes occurring in the lower E region of the ionosphere. In Refs. [178,179] two approaches were more carefully compared using the same numerical initial-value approach as in Ref. [93] and dealing with eigenmodes as done in previous studies [160,177], but taking into account a more realistic profile of the parameters of the ionosphere, such as plasma density gradient, mobilities of plasma species, and the ambient electric field. It found more general features than those concluded in previous studies indicating that the large-scale mode structures observed in the E region of the equatorial electrojet are spaced over a wide height range of several kilometers from 100 to 106 km (see Figure 2.10), whereas the short-scale mode structures fill the narrow height range of about 100 – 300 m around the height of 107 km (called the ‘‘ upper electrojet ’’ ; see Figure 2.11). At these altitudes, the effects of the velocity shear and recombination process are weaker than those of the exitation of rapidly growing short-wavelength instabilities due to a strong plasma density gradient (see Figure 2.12) and the maximum of electric field distribution (at an altitude of 106 – 107 km (see Figure 2.13).

It is interesting to mention that the saturation mechanism of other kinds of long- and short- wavelength plasma instabilities, such as Rayleigh – Taylor instability, described earlier can explain their growth and saturation by including in the process of instability evolution the presence of time- dependent eigenmodes and density gradient enhances. The importance of these effects was proved theoretically by Basu [180] based on a numerical analysis of the system of quasilinear equations of plasma species transport. All the researchers mentioned previously used the two-fluid theory based on the hydrodynamic approach, whereas in Refs. [101,102] a consistent kinetic theory was proposed for the description of FBI evolution in the E layer of the lower ionosphere. The consistent kinetic theory presented there was clarified in a study [181] using a simple fluid model associated with a new type of instability generation by Joule heating of electrons in the perturbed electric field occurring in the E region of the high-latitude ionosphere. Such a perturbed field can modulate temperature of plasma in the same manner as artificially done by a powerful alternate field described in Section 2.1. Such temperature perturbations finally lead to the creation of a new kind of instability caused by two independent mechanisms. The first mechanism related to the changes of the sign of plasma pressure to be opposed to the plasma density perturbation and is very sensitive to signs of flow angle q introduced in Refs. [101,102]: cos q \u0001 k \u0006 V d , q is the angle between the k -vector and the drift velocity V d [181]. The corresponding instability growth (i.e. unstable modes generation) is found at the negative angles u ¼ p = 2 \u0003 q ( \u0001 k \u0006 E 0 ) and its growth stabilization at positive angles u ( \u0001 k \u0006 E 0 ). The second mechanism is associated with thermal perturbations of the electron Pedersen conductivity due to the monotonically increasing dependence of the electron – neutral collision frequency on temperature, the effect that plays an essential role in the FB instability evolution obtained from the strict and consistent kinetic theory [101,102]. This thermal mechan- ism of plasma heating and the corresponding instability generation was earlier predicted and proved theoretically by Gurevich with coauthors [182,183], respectively, for high and moderate ambient electric fields occurring at higher and lower altitudes of the E layer. The zone of instability growth in the flow angle domain (e.g. u -domain) covers two wide ranges of u around the bisectors between the direction of \b E 0 and the drift velocity V d / E 0 \u0004 B 0 . The same features of instability evolution were found for FB turbulence in some studies [101,102], as briefly described in Section 2.3. The new instability, found theoretically in Ref. [181], occurs in the broad height range between 75 and 105 km, i.e., covering the D layer and the lower E layer, and the associated unstable waves have wavelengths ranging from several to tens of meters (called longwaves in Ref. [181]). As this instability is generated by the cumulative effect of the Pedersen electron flux directed opposite the electric field, J P / s P ( E 0 þ d E ), and the Hall electron flux, directed along V d / E 0 \u0004 B 0 because J H / ( N 0 þ d N ) V d , i.e., by currents driven across the ambient magnetic field, this new instability was called by the authors [181] the ‘‘ cross-field current driven instability. ’’ As was noticed in Ref. [181], this new instability can be a preferable candidate of the source generating the meter- and longer-scale turbulences in the lower ionosphere; as observing by VHF radars is problematic, only rocket measurements can be used. In fact, in Refs. [184,185] possible evidence of the existence of ‘‘ cross-field current-driven instability ’’ was found by rocket observations of an anomalously high level of the long-wavelength plasma structures occurring at altitudes above 78 km, associated with anomalously high values of the measured ambient electric field. Because the gradient-drift (GD) and two-stream (FB) are the main sources of plasma irregularities in the ionosphere, we return to the recent theories that were developed from the mid-nineties up to the present time. These theories were developed by Hamza and St-Maurice [186 – 192], who made Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 93 26.3.2008 9:21pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan Nonlinear Phenomena and Plasma Instabilities & 93"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"an overview of existing theories and their drawbacks and advantages, and proposed a self-consistent analysis of plasma instabilities, GDI and FBI, occurring both in equatorial and auroral (polar) ionospheric zones. We will not enter into a detailed analysis of the mathematical aspects of the solutions of fourth-order coupling nonlinear equations of two-fluid dynamics, which some- times (in convenient conditions) have been reduced to the quasilinear and linear equations for eigenfunctions. Most of the foregoing authors used closed mathematical approaches. For us it is very interesting to show the reader additional elegant ideas of how to transfer results obtained in studies [127 – 129,170 – 175] for the equatorial E and F regions of the ionosphere to the high-latitude ionosphere, where an artificially introduced concept of anomalous diffusion was proposed for explaining nonlinear fast growth and stabilization of plasma waves observed experimentally. More- over, the direct application of the models for the equatorial to the high-latitude ionosphere, introduced previously, has exposed the principal difficulties in explaining the new features of plasma observed experimentally in auroral and polar zones, such as wide broadening of plasma density spectra, nonlinear Doppler shift, and changing thresholds of GDI and FBI depending on ambient electromagnetic conditions, which significantly change densities, temperature, mobilities and diffu- sion coefficients of plasma species, electrons, and ions. In Refs. [186 – 192], after analyzing existing theories, the strict concept of wave – wave and wave – particle interactions proved by Sudan and his coauthors [94,101,102,127 – 129,170 – 175,181], was taken as a basic concept using both self-consistent theory of two-fluid dynamic and consistent kinetic theory. Thus, in one study [186], a fully nonlinear theory based on a two-fluid model for the electrons and ions was presented and analyzed following the wave-coupling theory [127,128] based on the ‘‘ direct approximation principle ’’ of Kraichnan and the corresponding Depree ’ s resonance broading theory (we have described these approaches in Sections 2.3 and 2.4). Drift mechanism both along B 0 (when k jj 6¼ 0) and across B 0 (when k jj ¼ 0) was analyzed. Nonlinear effects occur due to the introduction of additional anomalous collisional frequencies, mobilities, and conductivities of plasma species which were introduced to understand the correction of the proposed mathematical tool to explain the anomalous Doppler shift and frequency broading caused by nonlinear effects in unstable perturbed plasma, as well as the equilibrium spectrum observed in the steady-state regime of saturation of unstable waves due to strong turbulization of plasma. It was shown that the nonlinear mode-coupling mechanism fully predicts nonlinear effects in the perturbed plasma. Therefore, in further research [187 – 192], the effects of the anomalous inter- charge collision frequencies and the anomalous diffusion of plasma species caused by them were disregarded. We will now show additional elegant ideas proposed in Refs. [187 – 192] of how, based only on wave-coupling and wave – particle interaction mechanisms, we could explain redistribution of energy between primary and secondary unstable waves generated in the high-latitude ionosphere from various ambient sources, which finally does not change overall energy balance of the ionosphere as a steady-state global structure. Thus, wave – wave and wave – particle interactions leading to the steady-state regime (system equilibrium) were analyzed [187] by using the analogy of a sectional bucket into which water flows (see Figure 2.14). This simple sketch illustrates the flow of energy in a steady-state turbulent regime in which interaction between the linearly unstable primary waves and the linearly stable secondary waves occurs. A hole in the middle of the bucket demonstrates coupling between these modes. The energy of the primary and secondary waves fill the left and the right reservoirs. During nonresonant wave – particle interactions, shown at the bottom of the bucket, the energy of waves transfer to the plasma species causing Joule heating of the plasma as shown in Refs. [141,142] (this subject is beyond the scope of this book, so we refer the reader to these exellent works). From the beginning, where perturbations of the ambient electric field are strong and strong currents occur in the high-latitude ionosphere flowing both along and Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 94 26.3.2008 9:22pm Compositor Name: VBal amugundan 94 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"across the ambient magnetic field (which is close to the vertical axis at these latitudes), the free energy from currents is transferred to the linearly unstable primary waves, as shown at the top left- side of the bucket. Due to coupling between primary and secondary waves in the steady-state regime, the energy from the former modes is transferred to the latter ones. The energy of both primary and secondary modes is extracted to the particles during mode – particle interactions, which explain the two bottom holes of the bucket. In Ref. [187] the steady-state turbulent regime by zero- order increment of unstable wave growth was defined, and it was postulated that the overall rates of free energy from currents to the primary waves and of its loss during interaction with particles are the same. As seen from the sketched figure, in equilibrium the energy of secondary waves is less than that of primary waves. This effect can be understood if we use the results obtained in Ref. [193], in which the interaction between modes in the anisotropic magnetized plasma was investi- gated using Feunman ’ s diagrams and Bouret ’ s approximation for a mean double propagator. It was found that slowly growing primary unstable waves due to coupling can transfer their energy to the fast secondary stable modes, the energy of which has the tendency to increase after interaction (they becomes unstable). Conversely, due to coupling, the fast unstable primary modes can transfer their energy to the slow secondary modes with the tendency of their damping. Finally, the redistribution of the energy of the secondary waves is not the same in the steady-state configuration as that for the primary waves. It was also pointed out in Ref. [193] that the overall time required to reach the equilibrium energy distribution is of the order of the magnitude ( e s ) \u0003 1 both for short- and long- wavelength modes, and for a weak turbulent regime (e.g., for a medium with small random fluctuations) the transver of energy from primary to secondary waves occurs over a long period. As shown in Ref. [187], this happens because the time scales related to such equilibrium configurations have to cover a large number of mode-coupling events to obtain a steady-state system with further stabilization of the process.

What is interesting to note is that a more general self-consistent two-fluid theory performed in Refs.

Now using this constraint and Equation 2.143, we will present in the following paragraphs the qualitative analysis of the nonlinear Doppler frequency shift and power spectral spread for various scenarios occurring in the ionospheric plasma, weakly, moderately, and strongly turbulized by ambient factors. Without loss of generality, we will assume in our qualitative analysis that the term in Equation 2.143 responsible for plasma density gradient effects is zero; i.e., the growing process due to plasma gradients can vanish. If so, let us start with the quasilinear case of the instability growing process. From Equation 2.143, in the case of weakly turbulent plasma, when the growth of unstable modes can be described using linear theory, i.e., dealing with the linearly unstable eigenmodes, described by Equations 2.144a and b, we get D v k ! 0; i.e., a very narrow spread of plasma spectrum occurs, and the average oscillating frequency caused by random fluctuations of plasma density power is limited to the linear eigenfrequency, described by Equation 2.144a; i.e., v k \u0005 v L k . This situation is illustrated in the simpler manner at the right side of Figure 2.15. At this quasilinear regime the primary waves, extracting free energy from currents or electric field perturbations, lead to the steady-state regime changing in their instantaneous amplitude with a slow-to-moderate linear growth rate, as illustrated at the left side of Figure 2.15.

As is seen from the left side of Figure 2.15, after several oscillations with v L k , the unstable plasma wave attains its maximum and becomes sufficient for transferring energy of the primary wave to the secondary wave due to coupling between modes (according to the scheme sketched in Figure 2.14). After completing the energy transfer, the amplitude of the primary wave decreases sharply, as can be seen from the left side of Figure 2.15, and the coupling process disappears. If, again, the primary unstable wave extracts free energy from the ambient sources, increasing to its instantaneous amplitude, the process of coupling between primary and secondary waves will be repeated in the same manner. What happens in the case of weak turbulence embedded in the medium with a lot of free energy, i.e., in a medium consisting of high-energy sources, as occurs in the auroral and polar ionospheric regions? In this case, due to coupling, the secondary damped waves will quickly extract energy from primary linearly growing waves, and the frequent wave-coupling occurrence leads to faster linear growth rate and faster repletion of the process, as illustrated in the left side of the sketch in Figure 2.16. According to results obtained in Refs. [187 – 190] for a steady turbulent state regime, and substituting in Equation 2.143 g NL k ¼ 0 by ignoring effects of plasma gradients, we finally get v 2 k þ D v 2 k ¼ k 2 ? C 2 s (2 : 150) As evident from the right side of Figure 2.16, in this case, a nonzero spread of the power spectrum occurs.

The same effects will result with the mean Doppler shift, which becomes slower than C s . It was found in Refs. [187 – 189], both theoretically and experimentally, that to obtain the saturation regime the Doppler width D v k has to 0.0 Time, t 0 N k ( t ) Power spectrum ∆ w k w k w k L __ Figure 2.16 Same as Figure 2.15, but for unbounded plasma consisting of high-energy sources.

From this it is easy to obtain the limit at which the phase velocity of linearly damping secondary modes, which extract energy from the linearly growing primary modes due to nonlinear coupling between them, can be smaller than C s but not more than by a factor given approximately by V NL ph ( thr ) \u0005 C s ffiffiffi 2 p ¼ 0 : 7 \u0006 C s (2 : 152) Now, when a strong turbulent condition occurs, which was associated, in Refs. [187,188], with a situation in which the Doppler spectral width D v k is broad enough but the mean Doppler shift frequency tends to zero; i.e., v k ! 0. This strong turbulent regime is sketched on the right side of Figure 2.17. In this case, due to the wave-coupling process, the wave modes with eigenfrequencies close to zero periodically receive energy from the primary unstable modes, obtaining instantaneous amplitudes in a very short time. It can easily be shown that in this nonlinear regime we can obtain a negative increment of linear modes growth; i.e., g L < 0. Indeed, when in the steady state configuration g NL k ¼ 0, we get from Equation 2.143, assuming the absence of the plasma gradient term, g NL k ¼ D v 2 k n im (1 þ q H Q H ) þ g L k \u0002 0(2 : 153) from which we get the threshold of the Doppler spectral width for a zero nonlinear increment of wave growth D v 2 k ¼\u0003 n im (1 þ q H Q H ) g L k (2 : 154) So, we can see that to satisfy Equation 2.154, the increment of linear modes growth must be negative; i.e., g L < 0. This is the corresponding threshold between growth and damping of the secondary modes due to nonlinear coupling process. So, as was found in Ref. [188], the linearly stable secondary modes with Doppler frequency spread 0 < D v 2 k < \u0003 n im (1 þ q H Q H ) g L k will still be nonlinearly damping. 0.0 Time, t N k ( t ) w k ~0 Power spectrum ∆ w k Figure 2.17 Same as Figure 2.15, but for a strong turbulent regime occurring in the unbounded plasma.

Moreover, the corresponding constraint of unstable waves generation along the flow angle u predicted by linear and quasilinear theories [101,102, 127 – 129,169 – 175] (we repeat it again using our notations) V d cos u > (1 þ & ) C s (2 : 156) was now generalized in Refs.

C s , reduces to V e d cos u \r 0. This result is clearly seen from the illustration sketched in Figure 2.17. The results obtained are consistent with spectral width observations of plasma perturbations with velocities from 350 to 600 m = s obtained by separate groups of investigators using various high-latitude radars in the corresponding wave frequencies [189,194,196,200,203]. At the same time, it was shown experimentally that plasma instabilities, such as FB and GD instabilities, can be observed at the wide spectrum of angles around the flow angle u . Therefore, following the nonlinear self-consistent fluid theory performed in Refs. [186 – 188] and proved experimentally in Ref. [189], the extension of this theory on the large aspect angles u (larger than 10 8 ) was made and analyzed with regard to growth and stabilization mechanisms of FB instabilities generated in the high-latitude ionosphere [190 – 192]. The effects of the parallel (to B 0 ) currents on the perpendicular drifts and the influence of the flow angle spread was analyzed based on the three- wave coupling model. We do not enter into complicated mathematical analysis, but will only summarize that the general results obtained in Refs. [186 – 192] using the self-consistent nonlinear two-fluid theory cover results achieved by linear and quasilinear models performed in other studies [157 – 163,172 – 179] and are in good agreement with those obtained in Refs. [101,102,171,181] based on the consistent quasilinear fluid and kinetic theories. The theories and corresponding models discussed in this chapter predict more accurately various scenarios of plasma instabilities and the associated plasma perturbations evolution in the space, time, and frequency domains in the different ranges of the ionosphere, from the equator to the polar cap. Results obtained during the theoretical analysis carried out in the preceding text allow us to conclude that the instability of the ionospheric plasma is the main source generating small- to large- scale plasma structures in the E and F regions of the ionosphere, among which are H E irregularities occurring in the middle-latitude ionosphere and plasma field-aligned irregularities observed in the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C002 Final Proof page 100 26.3.2008 9:22pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan 100 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"high-latitude ionosphere. The existence of weakly and strongly anisotropic plasma structures at the altitudes of 200 – 400 km (i.e., in the F region and above) can be explained by development of current-gradient, current, and convergence instabilities. Strictly speaking, all instabilities contribute more or less to the cumulative effect of plasma perturbations. Therefore, it is difficult to find some universal mechanism for the creation of plasma irregularities in the ionosphere, as the reader can well understand from the discussion of a wide spectrum of different theories, models, and physical concepts presented in this chapter. We notice that the main aspects of the creation and further evolution of weakly anisotropic (with dimensions along and across B 0 exceeding 1 – 10 km) and strongly anisotropic plasma structures (with degree of anisotropy exceeding 100), generated by various natural and artificial sources of their creation, will be considered in Chapter 6.

[2 – 4,7 – 10], which we denote as y ( t ).

We will now give a mathematical description of CW signals. Several mathematical statistical models have been proposed to describe such signals for various kinds of channels: terrestrial, atmospheric, or ionospheric. To describe such narrowband signals mathematically, the 2-D (flat) Clarke model was used in Ref. [11] for a land mobile communication link. It cannot be successfully used for description of the interference of direct (incident) waves and waves reflected from different kinds of plasma structures occurring in the ionosphere, because it does not take into account the elevation of the satellite or any other vehicle embedded in the ionosphere (such as a rocket or missile). For this purpose we present here a more general 3-D model that is based on scattering from obstructions both in the azimutal and elevation planes. This stastistical model was worked out by Aulin and is also described in Ref. [12] for land communication links with high- elevated base station antennas. As was shown in Ref. [10], we can use it for the description of multiple scattering of radio waves within the ionospheric communication channel. Let us briefly describe this model. The Aulin model assumes a fixed ground-based transmitter with a vertically polarized isotropic (called omnidirectional) antenna and a moving vehicle (satellite or rocket) as a receiver, which also has an omnidirectional antenna (see Figure 3.2). The signal at the receiver is assumed to consist of N horizontally traveling plane waves, each wave with a number i having amplitude A i , and with statistically independent angle-of-arrival, azimuth ( w i ) and elevation ( q i ), and phase angle ( f i ) distributions. Aulin has generalised 2-D Clarke model by the inclusion of the angle q i (see Figure 3.2), which in the Clarke model was always zero. y z x Satellite n J i j i → i th incoming wave Figure 3.2 Geometry of the land – satellite communication link.

In the 3-D case, the angle q i describes the spatial orientation of the i th incoming wave and w i is its projection on the XY -plane (i.e., simply the azimuthal angle). According to Ref. [12], we assume that both q i and w i are homogeneously and independently distributed over the ranges [0, p /2] and [0,2 p ], respectively. The same homogeneous distribution is assumed for the i th wave phase f i over the range [0,2 p ]; i.e., the probability density function (PDF) of such a distribution is P ( f i ) ¼ 1/(2 p ). Without any loss of generality of the problem, because the same technique is used for each field component, let us consider only the E -field component. In this case, for each electrical field component wave with number i , we can obtain a general expression at the arbitrary point ( x 0 , y 0 , z 0 ) according to Ref.

We now assume that the vehicle (satellite or rocket) moves with velocity v in the XY -plane, making an angle u to the x -axis (as shown in Figure 3.3 for the vector of the vehicle velocity directed along the x -axis).

Furthermore, in narrowband communication links, most of the energy of the received signal is concentrated near the carrier frequency, f c , and the power spectra is defined as the RF spectra of such a narrowband signal. At the same time, as was shown in Section 3.1, the RF narrowband signal can be converted into the complex baseband signal that has its frequency content centered around zero frequency (see Figure 3.1). Below, we will present the power baseband spectra distribution in the Doppler shift domain. For this purpose we introduce the autocorrelation function K ( t, t þ t ) ¼h E ( t ) \b E ( t þ t ) i of signal fading in the time domain [11,12].

Taking the Fourier transform only for the component (Equation 3.30) of the autocorrelation function of the total signal (Equation 3.28), i.e., converting a 3-D model to a 2-D model, we obtain the corresponding complex baseband power spectrum in the Doppler frequency shift domain: W 0 ( f ) ¼ E 0 4 p f Dm 1 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 \u0002 f f Dm \b\t 2 r , j f j\u0006 f Dm W 0 ( f ) ¼ 0, elsewhere (3 : 31) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C003 Final Proof page 119 9.4.2008 5:00pm Compositor Name: BMan i Radio Signal Presentation in the Ionospheric Communication Channel & 119"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"As follows from Equation 3.31, the 2-D spectrum (defined in the literature as a classical ‘‘ U-shaped ’’ spectrum) is strictly band-limited within the range j f j\u0006 f Dm , and the power spectral density becomes infinite at f ¼\u0003 f Dm . This spectrum is a classical Doppler spectrum that is usually used in many situations in various radio communication channels.

Frequency shifts of such a magnitude can cause interference with any message information. 3.3 Wideband Signal Presentation An example of a power profile of an actual wideband (or pulse ) signal at the receiver is presented in Figure 3.7a. When plotted in the time domain, the signal envelope power is defined as the power delay profile . If we now apportion the time delay axis into equal segments, or bins , as shown in Figure 3.7b, then there will be a number of signals in each bin corresponding to the different paths whose times of arrival are within the bin duration. If so, these signals can be represented vectorially using delta-function presentation [7 – 13] centered around each bin, as shown in Figure 3.8. This time-varying discrete-time impulse response, which completely characterizes the communication channel, can be expressed as a function of both the current time t and time delay t : h b ( t , t ) ¼ X N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 A i ( t , t ) exp \u0002 j 2 p f c t i ( t ) \u0002 j f i ( t , t ) ðÞ dt \u0002 t i ( t ) ðÞ () (3 : 34) The variable t represents the time variations due to the motion of one of the terminal antenna, whereas t represents the channel multipath delay for a fixed value of t . If the channel impulse response is assumed to be time invariant, or is at least stationary over a small-scale time or displacement interval, then the impulse response (Equation 3.34) can be simplified as h b ( t ) ¼ X N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 A i ( t ) exp \u0002 j u i ðÞ dt \u0002 t i ðÞ (3 : 35) where u i ¼ 2 p f c t i þ f i ( t ) A i ( t ) is the amplitude of each i th ray If so, for a wideband probing signal, the total received power is simply related to the sum of the powers of the individual multipath components, where each component has a random amplitude (a) (b) t , μ s 1234567891011 P , dB ~ t , μ s P , dB ~ Figure 3.7 Signal power presentation of the pulse signal in the time delay domain (a), and its presentation after division into short time bins (b).

We may add that if the bandwidth is sufficiently large to resolve all multiray components, then there is no need for spatial averaging. A comparison between the CW and pulse small-scale power representations, Equations 3.36 and 3.27, shows that when h A i A j i¼ 0 and/or h cos( f i \u0002 f j ) i¼ 0, the average power for a CW signal is equivalent to the average received power for a pulse signal in the small-scale region. This can occur when either the path amplitudes are uncorrelated, i.e., when each multipath component is independent after reflection or scattering, or when multipath phases are independently and uniformly distributed over [0,2 p ]. Thus, we can conclude that in the UHF/X-wave band, when the multipath components traverse differential path lengths of hundreds of wavelengths, the received local ensemble average power of wideband and narrowband signals are equivalent . This statement will be used for adaptation of the proposed propagation models for further description of fading characteristics both for narrowband and wideband signals. The more important parameters of wideband radio communication channels that can be determined from a signal power delay profile are mean excess delay, rms delay spread , and excess delay spread for the concrete threshold level X (in decibels, dB) of the channel. Other parameters of the pulses, related to these main parameters, are the coherent bandwidth , B c , the time of coherency, T c , and the Doppler spread , B D . The mean excess delay is the first moment of the power delay profile of the pulse signal and is defined as t hi ¼ P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 A 2 i t i P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 A 2 i ¼ P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 P ( t i ) t i P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 P ( t i ) (3 : 37) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C003 Final Proof page 123 9.4.2008 5:00pm Compositor Name: BMan i Radio Signal Presentation in the Ionospheric Communication Channel & 123"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The rms delay spread is the square root of the second central moment of the power delay profile and is defined as s t ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi h t 2 i\u0002h t i 2 q (3 : 38) where t 2 \u0005\u0006 ¼ P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 A 2 i t 2 i P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 A 2 i ¼ P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 P ( t i ) t 2 i P N \u0002 1 i ¼ 0 P ( t i ) (3 : 39) These delays are measured relative to the first detectable signal arriving at the receiver at t 0 ¼ 0. Note that these parameters are defined from an average delay profile, which was obtained after temporal or local (small-scale) spatial averaging of the measured impulse response of the channel. As is well known, the power delay profile in the time domain and the power spectral response in the frequency domain are related through the Fourier transform [5]. Therefore, for a full descrip- tion of the signal inside the multipath channel with fading, the time delay parameters in the time domain and the coherence bandwidth in the frequency domain are used simultaneously. The coherence bandwidth is the statistical measure of the frequency range over which two frequency signals are strongly amplitude-correlated. Depending of the degree of amplitude correlation of two frequency-separated signals, there are different definitions of this parameter. According to the first definition , the coherence bandwidth , B c , is a bandwidth over which the frequency correlation function is above 0.9% or 90%; then it equals B c \u0007 0 : 02 s \u0002 1 t (3 : 40a) According to the second definition , the coherence bandwidth , B c , is a bandwidth over which the frequency correlation function is above 0.5% or 50%; then it equals B c \u0007 0 : 2 s \u0002 1 t (3 : 40b) Earlier we considered two parameters, delay spread and coherence bandwidth , which describe the time-dispersive nature of the multipath communication channel in a small-scale area. To obtain information about the time-varying nature of the channel caused by movements of the transmitter or of the receiver, or scatterers located along radio path, new parameters such as Doppler spread and coherence time are usually introduced to describe time- and frequency-dispersive properties of the multipath channel with fading. Doppler spread , B D , is a measure that is defined as a range of frequencies over which the received Doppler spectrum is essentially nonzero. It shows the spectral spreading caused by the time rate of change of the dynamic radio channel due to relative motions of vehicles (or scatters) with respect to the receiver. According to the Doppler effect, the Doppler spread B D depends on the maximal Doppler shift, f Dm ¼ v / l , and on the angle u between the direction of motion of moving vehicle and direction of arrival of the reflected and scattered waves, i.e., B D ¼ 2 f Dm cos u ¼ 2( v = l ) cos u (3 : 41) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C003 Final Proof page 124 9.4.2008 5:00pm Compositor Name: BMan i 124 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Coherence time T c is the time-domain dual of Doppler spread and is used to characterize the time- varying nature of the frequency-dispersive properties of the channel in time coordinates.

If so, one can, as was done earlier for coherence bandwidth, define the coherence time as the time over which the correlation function of two different signals in the time domain is above 0.5% (or 50%). Then, we get [7]: T c \u0007 9 16 p f m ¼ 9 l 16 p v ¼ 0 : 18 l v (3 : 43a) This definition can be improved for modern digital communication channels by combining Equations 3.42 and 3.43a as their geometric mean; i.e., T c \u0007 0 : 423 f m ¼ 0 : 423 l v (3 : 43b) The definition of coherence time implies that two signals, arriving at the receiver with a time separation greater than T c , are affected differently by the channel.

These plasma density irregu- larities cause additional losses compared to those observed when the ionospheric plasma is a uniform, homogeneous, regular-layered medium, and also cause multipath fading of the signal strength/intensity observed at the receiver [1 – 8]. In real ionospheric communication links, the field forming the complicated interference picture of received radio waves arrives via several paths, thus the various waves arrive with different time delays (Figure 4.1). In Figure 4.1 the normalized signal strength (to rms ; see definitions in the following text) is plotted against decoder real time. At the receiver such waves combine vectorially at any given frequency to give an oscillating resultant signal, the character of whose variations depends on the distribution of phases among the incoming component waves. The signal amplitude random variations are known as the fading effect [1 – 16]. Although the fading is basically a spatial phenom- enon (Figure 4.2), such variations in the space domain are experienced as temporal variations by a receiver moving through the multipath field. Therefore, large-scale and small-scale fading in the space domain correspond to slow and fast fading, respectively, in the time domain. In the literature, both these definitions are usually used (see, for example, Refs. [8 – 16]). Thus, we can discuss random space-domain and time-domain variations of an EM-field in ionospheric communication links. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations of the spatial and temporal variations of radio waves in ionospheric communication links have shown that the spatial variations of signal level have three attributes (see Figure 4.2a through c).

The cause of path loss is the spreading of the electromagnetic wave radiating outward in space. The spatial and temporal variations of the signal path loss are large and slow. The second phenomenon, superimposed on the path loss, is slow fading (Figure 4.2b), which changes more rapidly, with significant random variations over distances between the terminal antennas. Slow fading is caused by diffractions from small-scale plasma structures (these effects will be discussed in the Chapter 9), all showing slow random variations in signal amplitude with a tendency to a lognormal or Gaussian distribution if the signal fading is expressed in decibels (dB). The spatial scale of the slow variations is up to several tens of meters, which is lognormally distributed [7,8,15]. Such slow random variations of the total field describe its structure within zones of diffraction and are also called large-scale fading . The third attribute is fast random variations of the signal (Figure 4.2c), which are caused by the mutual interference of the wave components of the multiray field. The characteristic scale of such waves in the space domain is changed from a fraction of a wavelength to several wavelengths [10 – 16]. They are therefore usually defined as small-scale or fast - fading signals in the literature. 4.1 Path Loss: A Mathematical Description The path loss is the phenomenon most investigated in literature, both theoretically and experi- mentally [1 – 16]. It is a principal characteristic determining the effectiveness of the propagation channel in various environments. It defines variations of the signal amplitude or field intensity along the propagation trajectory ( path ) from point to point within the communication channel. The main classical aspects of the path loss phenomenon in the ionospheric communication channel are described in detail in Ref. [2], and we will consider its characteristics and implications for different situations when the ionosphere is considered a homogeneous uniform-layered environ- ment (see Chapter 6). For its quantitative evaluation we will assume that the signal/wave amplitude at the point r 1 along the propagation path is A 1 ( r 1 ) or the signal/wave intensity J ( r 1 ) ¼ A 2 1 ( r 1 ). In the process of propagation along the path at any farther point r 2 the signal/wave amplitude is A 2 ( r 2 ) or intensity J ( r 2 ) ¼ A 2 2 ( r 2 ). In the literature the path loss is defined as the logarithmic difference between the amplitude/power at any two different points r 1 and r 2 along the propagation path in the medium [15,16]. Actually, these points determine the position of both terminals at the ends of the propagation channel, namely, the transmitter and the receiver. In other words, path loss, which is denoted by L and is measured in decibels (dB), can be evaluated as follows [15]. For signal/wave amplitude A ( r j ) at two points r 1 and r 2 along the propagation path L ¼ 10 \u0001 log A 2 ( r 2 ) A 2 ( r 1 ) ¼ 10 \u0001 log A 2 ( r 2 ) \u0002 10 \u0001 log A 2 ( r 1 ) ¼ 20 \u0001 log A ( r 2 ) \u0002 20 \u0001 log A ( r 1 ) [dB] (4 : 1) For signal/wave intensity J ( r j ) at two points r 1 and r 2 along the propagation path L ¼ 10 \u0001 log J ( r 2 ) J ( r 1 ) ¼ 10 \u0001 log J ( r 2 ) \u0002 10 \u0001 log J ( r 1 ) [dB] (4 : 2) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C004 Final Proof page 129 25.3.2008 2:40pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan Fading Phenomena in Ionospheric Communication Channels & 129"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"If we take point r 1 as the origin of the radio path (the transmitter location) and assume A ( r 1 ) ¼ 1, then L ¼ 20 \u0001 log A ( r ) [dB] (4 : 3a) and L ¼ 10 \u0001 log J ( r ) [dB] (4 : 3b) The next question is what the units are by which the losses are measured at the receiver. Let us assume that the signal/wave amplitude is measured in millivolts (mV) per meter and the signal/wave power in milliwatts (mW). In this case the resulting output value has to be presented in decibels above 1 mV/m for measured amplitude and in decibels above 1 mW for measured power, i.e., [ L ] A ¼ dB = (mV) [ L ] J ¼ dB = (mW) ¼ dBm (4 : 4) Finally, the resulting output value is denoted in dB = (V = m), dB = (mV = m), and dB = ( m V = m) if the signal = wave amplitude is measured in decibels corresponding to measured values V = m, mV = m, and m V = m, respectively. In the same way, the resulting output value is denoted in dB, dBm, and dB m , if the signal/wave power is measured in decibels and W (watt), mW and m W, respectively. 4.2 Slow Fading of Radio Signal: A Mathematical Description The large-scale or slow fading in mean signal level, shown in Figure 4.2b, occurs over much larger distances with a spatial ‘‘ period ’’ of several to tens of meters. As has been shown [2 – 9,15,16], due to the slow random spatial signal variations, as a result of their averaging within some individual small area, the average signal amplitude or power variation (expressed in volts/meter or watts) tends to be lognormally distributed (expressed in decibels, dB) with a standard deviation depending on the degree of perturbation of the ionospheric region along the radio path (see Chapters 6 and 7). Following Refs. [8 – 16], we define a Gaussian or normal distribution of a random variable x (representing, let us say, the signal strength or voltage) by introducing the following probability density function ( PDF ) of the received signal random level x : PDF ( x ) ¼ 1 s ffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 p p exp \u0002 x \u0002 \u0001 x ðÞ 2 2 s 2 () (4 : 5) Here, \u0001 x \u0003 x hi is the mean value of the random signal level, and s 2 ¼ x 2 \u0002 \u0001 x 2 hi is the variance or time-averaged power ( h x i is a sign of averaging of variable x ) of the received signal envelope in dB. This PDF can only be obtained as a result of the random interference of a large number of signals with randomly distributed amplitudes (voltage) and phases. If the phase of the interfering signals is uniformly distributed over the range [0,2 p ], then one can talk about a zero-mean Gaussian distribution of the random variable x. In this case we define the PDF of such a process by Equation 4.5 with \u0001 x ¼ 0 and s 2 ¼h x 2 i in it.

The ionospheric channels are usually dynamic channels. In the case of a dynamic multipath situation in which either the terminal antennas are in movement or the plasma structures move because of wind and ambient electrical and magnetic fields (see Chapters 1 and 2), the spatial variations of the resultant signal at each receiver will be seen as temporal variations by the receiver as it moves through the multipath field. The signal received by the mobile at any spatial point may consist of a large number of signals having randomly distributed amplitudes, phases, and angles of arrival, as well as different time delays. All these features change the relative phase shifts as a function of spatial location of the moving antennas and finally cause the signal to fade simultaneously in the space and time domains. The temporal fading relates to a shift of frequency radiated by the moving transmitter or receiver. In fact, the time variations or dynamic changes of the propagation path lengths are related to the Doppler effect, which is due to a relative movement between a stationary transmitter and a moving receiver, or vice versa. To describe mathematically these kinds of fading, the 3-D statistical model was introduced in Chapter 3, which together with some specific statistical distributions fully describe fast fading occurring in the ionospheric com- munication link. In the following text we will present the most useful distributions usually used for modeling ionospheric communication channels [2 – 8,15,16]. Rayleigh PDF and CDF . In wireless communication channels, stationary or mobile, the Rayleigh distribution is commonly used to describe the signal ’ s spatial and temporal fast (small-scale) fading.

A line-of-sight (LOS) component describing signal loss along the path of direct visibility (called the dominant path [2]) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C004 Final Proof page 132 25.3.2008 2:40pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan 132 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"between both antennas is often found at the receiver. This dominant component of the received signal may significantly decrease the depth of the interference picture of the signal envelope variations. The PDF of such a received signal is usually said to be Rician. The Rician PDF distribution of the signal strength or voltage, denoted by arbitrary random variable x , can be defined as [8,15,16] PDF ( x ) ¼ x s 2 exp \u0002 x 2 þ A 2 2 s 2 \u0002\u0003 \u0001 I 0 Ax s 2 \b\t for A > 0, x \u0007 0(4 : 13) where A denotes the peak strength or voltage of the dominant component envelope and I 0 ð . Þ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind, and is zero-order. To estimate the contribution of each component, dominant (or LOS) and multipath, for the resulting signal at the receiver, the Rician parameter K is usually introduced as a ratio between these components, i.e., K ¼ LOS component power Multipath component power (4 : 14) According to Equation 4.14, one can now rewrite the parameter K , which was defined earlier as the ratio between the dominant component power and the multipath component power. It is given by [2 – 8,15,16] K ¼ A 2 2 s 2 (4 : 15) Let us rewrite the Rician PDF by introducing the Rician K -factor from Equation 4.15 into Equation 4.14 as a function of only K : PDF ( x ) ¼ x s 2 exp \u0002 x 2 2 s 2 \u0002\u0003 \u0001 exp \u0002 K ðÞ\u0001 I 0 x s ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 K p \u0006\u0007 (4 : 16) It must be noted that the Rician distribution consists of all the other distributions mentioned earlier. Thus, when K ¼ 0, i.e., there is no dominant component but only scattered and reflected components reach the receiver, the communication channel is Rayleigh with the PDF described by Equation 4.8. Conversely, under conditions of good line-of-sight between the two terminals with no multipath components, i.e., K !1 , the Rician fading approaches Gaussian fading, yielding a ‘‘ Dirac-delta-shaped ’’ PDF . This is illustrated by Figure 4.3, depicted according to Refs. [15,16], where a set of PDF s that describe the envelope fading profiles for different values of K versus the signal level are presented, normalized to the corresponding rms . Thus, we can define the Rician distribution as the general case of signal fading along the radio path between two terminal antennas that cover both Rayleigh and Gaussian distributions of signal strength envelope. As the dominant component at the receiver becomes weaker, the resulting signal becomes closer to that obtained after multiple reflections and scattering, which has an envelope described by the Rayleigh law. In this case the fades with high probability are very deep, whereas if K is limited to infinity the fades are very shallow. The Rician CDF can be defined in the same manner as the Gaussian CDF (Equation 4.6) and the Rayleigh CDF (Equation 4.9), using the same quadrature formula given by Refs. [15,16].

We now present another statistical distribution that is, as are the Rayleigh and Rician distributions, frequently used to characterize the signal strength or power envelope fading in multipath communication links: the Nakagami m -distribution.

We will not discuss this subject further; the interested reader can consult Refs. [2 – 8,15,16]. 4.4 Definition of Fading Phenomena in Static and Dynamic Ionospheric Channel It is clear from the foregoing definitions that the type of signal fading within the dynamic radio channel depends on the relation between the signal parameters, the bandwidth B s , and the symbol period T S , and the corresponding parameters of the channel, such as coherence bandwidth B c and rms delay spread s t (or Doppler spread B D and coherence time T c ). So, different kinds of transmitted signals (defined by B S and T S ) will undergo different types of fading. There are four possible effects due to the time- and frequency-dispersion mechanisms in a mobile radio channel, which are manifested depending on the balance of the aforementioned parameters of the signal and of the channel. The multipath time delay spread leads to time-dispersive and frequency-selective fading , whereas Doppler frequency spread leads to frequency-dispersive and time-selective fading . Separation between these four types of small-scale fading for the impulse response of a multipath radio channel is explained in Table 4.1 [8,15]: A. Fading due to multipath time delay spread . Time dispersion due to multipath phenomena causes small-scale fading, either flat or frequency selective . A.1. Small-scale fading is characterized as a flat, if the mobile channel has a constant-gain and linear-phase impulse response over a bandwidth that is greater than the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. Here, T S \u0006 s t . Obviously, a flat-fading channel can be defined as a narrowband channel, because the bandwidth of the applied signal is narrow with respect to the channel flat-fading bandwidth in the frequency domain; i.e., B S B c .At the same time, the flat-fading channel is an amplitude-varying channel because there is a deep fading of the transmitted signal occurring within the channel. A.2. Small-scale fading is characterized as frequency selective if the mobile channel has a constant-gain and linear-phase impulse response over a bandwidth that is smaller than the bandwidth of the transmitted signal in the frequency domain, as well as if its impulse response has a multiple delay spread greater than the bandwidth of the transmitted signal waveform, i.e., T S s t . Obviously, a frequency-selective fading channel can be defined as a wideband channel, because the bandwidth of the spectrum Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C004 Final Proof page 136 25.3.2008 2:40pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan 136 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"S ( f ) of the transmitted signal is greater than the channel frequency-selective fading bandwidth in the frequency domain (the coherence bandwidth); i.e., B S > B c . B. Fading due to Doppler spread . Depending on how rapidly the transmitted baseband signal changes with respect to the rate of change of the channel, a channel may be classified as a fast- fading or slow-fading channel. B.1. The channel in which the channel impulse response changes rapidly within the pulse (symbol) duration is called a fast-fading channel. In other words, the coherence time in such a channel is smaller than the symbol period of the transmitted signal. At the same time, the Doppler spread bandwidth of the channel in the frequency domain is greater than the bandwidth of the transmitted signal; i.e., B S < B D and T c < T S . These effects cause frequency dispersion (also called time-selective fading) due to Doppler spreading, leading to signal distortion. B.2. The channel in which the channel impulse response changes at a rate slower than the transmitted baseband signal u ( t ), is called a slow-fading channel. In this case, the channel may be assumed to be static over one or several bandwidth intervals. In the time domain, this implies that the reciprocal bandwidth of the signal is smaller than the coherence time of the channel, and in the frequency domain, the Doppler spread of the channel is less than the bandwidth of the baseband signal; i.e., B S \u0006 B D and T S T c . It is important to note that the velocity of the moving vehicle or moving obstructions within the channel, as well as the baseband signal, determines whether a signal undergoes fast or slow fading. Usually, for real-world situations in wireless communication links, we deal with time- and frequency-dispersive channels, and therefore cannot separate fading into flat or frequency-selective and fast or slow. There could simultaneously occur flat slow fading (FSF) or frequency-selective slow fading (FSSF), when the channel is time dispersive, and flat fast fading (FFF) or frequency-selective fast fading (FSFF). These situations occur within any wireless channel, land, atmospheric, or Table 4.1 Types of Fading Depending on Relations between the Signal and the Channel Parameters Type of Fading within the Channel Relations between Signal and Channel Parameters (A1): Flat fast fading (FFF) (A.1.1): B S B c , B S < B D (A.1.2): T S \u0006 s t , T S > T c (A.2): Frequency-selective fast fading (FSFF) (A.2.1): B S > B c , B S < B D (A.2.2): T S < s t , T S > T c (B1): Flat slow fading (FSF) (B.1.1): B S B c , B S \u0006 B D (B.1.2): T S \u0006 s t , T S T c (B.2): Frequency-selective slow fading (FSSF) (B.2.1): B S > B c , B S \u0006 B D (B.2.2): T S < s t , T S T c Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C004 Final Proof page 137 25.3.2008 2:40pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan Fading Phenomena in Ionospheric Communication Channels & 137"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"ionospheric, and are shown in Table 4.1.

When we call them macrostructures , we take into account the fact that the dimensions of such plasma irregularities are large compared to the Debye radius, r D ¼ ( T = 4 p e 2 N e ) 1 = 2 . Here, all parameters were defined in Chapter 1. Numerous experi- mental investigations of natural and artificial plasma inhomogeneities in the high-latitude ionosphere [23 – 26], weakly ionized H E plasma structures, and meteor trails in the middle-latitude ionosphere [27 – 29], and plumes and bubbles in the equatorial regions [30 – 32] establish the presence of anisotropic irregularities of plasma stretched along the geomagnetic field B 0 with a wide spectrum of scales transverse to B 0 . Such plasma irregularities are also formed when ion clouds or beams are artificially injected from rockets at the ionospheric altitudes [33 – 49], as well as in the field of powerful radio waves radiated from ground-based facilities [50 – 57] (see also the bibliog- raphies in Refs. [20 – 22]). In Refs. [19 – 22,39 – 46], the complicated deformation and stratification of barium clouds caused by inhomogeneous properties of the ionosphere in the ambient electric and magnetic fields were explained on the basis of classical theories of plasma dynamics [1 – 15]. At the same time, while studying artificial heating-induced irregularities in the ionosphere, a satisfactory explanation was obtained for the large degree of anisotropy of small-scale turbulences and quasi-periodical plasma structures formed in the strong field of powerful radio waves, as well as of the complicated relaxation and lifetime dependence on their initial dimensions and the degree of ionization [50 – 57,75 – 78].

In these chapters, the effects of various types of plasma irregularities on radio wave propagation are described systematically, following the historical perspective of iono- spheric radio channels performance. We will now introduce the main equations and the corresponding solutions analyzing the processes of diffusion, drift and thermodiffusion of plasma disturbances, large-, moderate-, and small-scale, in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma and will describe the peculiarities of each process separately. 5.1 Diffusion of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere The spreading of an arbitrary plasma disturbance in the ionospheric plasma in the presence of an ambient electric or magnetic field has not been satisfactorily explained by existing theory despite the significant development of the theory of diffusion and the number of experiments [21,50 – 57] performed to investigate it. Only in recent decades have the corresponding theoretical models been developed that allow the prediction of many specific features of the evolution of experimen- tally observed plasma disturbances (see bibliographies in Refs. [20 – 22]). All modifications in the theory of plasma transport are based on the classical description of processes of quasi-neutral and ambipolar diffusion and drift in the magnetic field obtained in Refs. [2 – 14], mostly for small-scale plasma structures in the presence of an infinite homogeneous background plasma, as well as based on presentation of diffusion as unipolar ( electronic along B 0 and ionic across B 0 ), the rate and character of which are determined by short-circuit currents through the background iono- spheric plasma [7 – 14]. In Ref. [15], where generalized results obtained in Refs. [7 – 14] for a description of diffusion spreading for both strong ( d N > N 0 , N 0 being the density of background plasma) and weak ( d N \u0001 N 0 ) plasma disturbances (denoted by d N ) in the presence of an infinite homogeneous plasma. On the basis of the real model of the middle-latitude ionosphere, diffusion of weak and strong plasma inhomogeneities in the presence of homogeneous and inhomogeneous background plasmas was investigated theoretically and numerically in Refs. [16 – 19]. It was found that the character of diffusion along and across the magnetic field B 0 depends significantly on the degree of anisotropy of the initial irregularity, and finally changes occurrence from electron-controlled for plasma structures greatly stretched out along B 0 to ion-controlled for those elongated across B 0 . At the same time, analyzing a nonuniform problem of plasma diffusion and taking into account the altitude depend- ence of the transport coefficients of charged plasma particles, some new effects in irregularity diffusion spreading in inhomogeneous middle-latitude background plasma compared with homo- geneous plasma were obtained theoretically. There is the deformation of the initial form of the irregularity, the splitting into two or three plasmoids (depending on the spatial orientation of crossing electrical and magnetic fields [16 – 19]) in the course of spreading and the elongation of the irregularity upward along the geomagnetic field lines in the upper ionosphere, and so on. Before going deeper into the subject of diffusion spreading of plasma disturbances in the real ionospheric plasma, we will analyze briefly some classical aspects of the diffusion process in the unbounded homogeneous plasma.

In the case where dimensions of plasma perturbation are sufficiently small compared to the Debye radius introduced earlier — i.e., when ( r N = N 0 ) \u0003 1 < r D , plasma quasi-neutrality is infringed significantly and the self-consistent intrinsic electric field, caused by the displacement of charge particles in plasma, is insufficient and cannot affect the character of movements of charge particles — the potential energy of the intrinsic electric field is less than the kinetic energy of thermal (chaotic) movements of plasma charged particles; i.e., e w = T \u0004 1, where T ¼ T e \u0002 T e is the equilibrium temperature of electrons and ions expressed in the energetic units. In the inverse case , where ( r N = N 0 ) \u0003 1 \u0005 r D , diffusion changes its character significantly. Thus, when the initial dimensions of plasma disturbance are larger than the Debye radius, the charged particles strive for displacement due to the higher mobility of electrons compared to that for ions. Even a small decompensation of charged particles leads to the creation of a self-consistent electric field in plasma, thus preventing further displacements of charged particles. In this case eE a L = T \u0005 1, where the characteristic size of plasma perturbation is defined as L ¼ ( r N = N 0 ) \u0003 1 , and E a is the intrinsic electrostatic field in plasma. As a result, plasma perturbation spreads in such a manner that concentration of the electrons N e and the ions N i are similar; i.e., N e \u0002 N i ¼ N . Effects of the Magnetic Field on Plasma Diffusion . The solution of the problem of plasma diffusion in the absence of the magnetic field ( B 0 ¼ 0) was obtained by Schottky in 1924 [1]. He showed that the condition of plasma quasi-neutrality leads to the condition of ambipolarity of diffusion, which is defined by the equality of flows of electrons and ions at each point of the space filled by plasma; i.e., G e ¼ G i . In this case, as shown in Refs. [2 – 4], we can exclude in the equations of diffusion the inner electrostatic ( E a ¼\u0003r w ) electric field E a , i.e., @ N a @ t þr G a ¼ 0(5 : 2a) G a \u0006 N a V a ¼\u0003 D a r N a \u0007 N a b a E a (5 : 2b) In Equation 5.2, V a is the directed velocity of electrons ( a ¼ e ) and ions ( a ¼ i ). It should be noted that in the case of B 0 ¼ 0 the ordinary linear equation follows from the constraint G e ¼ G i , and the self-consistent electric (ambipolar) field does not exist: @ N @ t ¼ D a D N (5 : 3) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 141 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 141"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Additionally, the profile of plasma concentration does not depend on the current flowing through the plasma. Thus, because diffusion is slower than other transport processes, the electric field is electrostatic (potential) and the equations (Equation 5.2) for the plasma concentration N and the potential w can be separated, i.e., r ( b e \u0003 b i ) N r w ¼ ( D e \u0003 D i ) D N (5 : 4) that is, the profile of the plasma density can be found independently of the profile of the potential. In the other words, the plasma profile N ( r , t ) does not depend on the currents flowing through the plasma.

Thus, when B 0 ¼ 0, ambipolar diffusion can be described by the linear equations (Equations 5.3 and 5.4) for the plasma density profile and for the inner electric field, respectively, and can be determined by ions as particles with lower mobility. The influence of plasma electrons, as particles with higher mobility, and of the self-consistent (ambipolar) electric field, is described by the term (1 þ T e = T i ). In the case of a sufficiently strong magnetic field , when B 0 6¼ 0, even in the case of ordinary plasma consisting of electrons, monoatomic ions, and neutrals of one kind, the situation changes sharply. a. In the case introduced earlier, where dimensions of plasma perturbation are small compared to the Debye radius, i.e., where ( r N = N 0 ) \u0003 1 < r D , the step of chaotic movement (i.e., diffusion) along B 0 is defined by the free paths of electrons l e and ions l i , whereas transverse to B 0 is determined by the Larmor radii of electrons r He and ions r Hi . In a sufficiently strong magnetic field where r He \u0004 l e and r Hi \u0004 l i , the transverse coefficient of diffusion of electrons and ions can be presented through these radii as D e ? ¼ T e b e ? = e \u0002 r 2 He n em , D i ? ¼ T i b i ? = e \u0002 r 2 Hi n im (5 : 6) Because r He \b B \u0003 1 0 and r Hi \b B \u0003 1 0 , the corresponding transverse coefficients of diffusion are sharply decreased ( \b B \u0003 2 0 ) with growth in the strength of the magnetic field. At the same time, r He \b m e and r Hi \b M i , where m e and M i are the mass of electrons and ions, respect- ively. Because M i = m e \t 10 3 \u0005 1, the Larmor radius of ions exceeds the Larmor radius of electrons significantly.

However, as shown in Refs. [7 – 15], it is impossible to perform the potential inner (ambipolar) electric field that will simultaneously hamper faster electrons along B 0 and faster ions across B 0 , and will equalize the electron and ion flows at each point in the area filled by plasma. As shown by the authors of Refs. [5,6], the condition of plasma quasi-neutrality, N e \u0002 N i ¼ N , leads in the presence of the magnetic field to the equality of divergence of these flows, i.e., to r G e ¼r G i . The latter constraint does not prohibit the flow of the vortex current through the background plasma, defined in Refs. [9 – 15] as short-circuit current . This current is created by the background electrons along B 0 and by the background ions across B 0 . These particles secure the condition of plasma quasi-neutrality in the region occupied by the plasma disturbance, i.e., in the electronic ellipsoid due to the transverse flow of background ions and in the ion ellipsoid by the longitudinal flow of background electrons. As a result, the depletion regions occur in the background plasma [9 – 15], and the total plasma concentration is disturbed significantly both in the volume of electronic and ionic ellipsoids. The condition of quasi-neutrality does not limit the volume occupied by the disturbance of plasma density. In a strong magnetic field it can exceed the analogous volume, just as when the magnetic field is absent. The potential of the ambipolar electric field is also disturbed within this volume (compared with the case B 0 ¼ 0). This volume corresponds to propagation of more mobile particles in corresponding directions to B 0 : electrons along and ions across B 0 . Depending on the degree of plasma perturbation, nonlinear diffusion can be divided at the intermediate and the strong diffusion process, depending on the degree of depletion of the background plasma, weak or strong. 5.1.2 Diffusion of Small Plasma Disturbance in Weakly Ionized Plasma In the previous text, we sketched a physical picture of the plasma disturbance diffusion spreading in the infinite background plasma both in the presence and absence of the magnetic field. We will now prove this picture theoretically, following the classical theory of diffusion spreading of plasma perturbations of different origins in the infinite background plasma with various degrees of ionization and magnetization [4 – 15]. Diffusion Spreading of Weak Plasma Disturbances . First, we consider diffusion of a weak plasma density perturbation, d N ( r , t ) ¼ N ( r , t ) \u0003 N 0 , having in an initial time t ¼ 0 the following point profile, d N ( r ,0) ¼ n 0 d ( r ), where N 0 is the density of the background plasma, n 0 the number of charged particles in the initial plasma perturbation, and d ( r ) is the delta function. The perturbation of plasma density in any time is described by the following expression [5,6,9,15]: d N ( r , t ) ¼ n 0 G ( r , t ) ¼ n 0 ð exp i k r \u0003 D a ( m 2 ) k 2 t \u0002\u0003 d 3 k (5 : 7) where G ( r , t ) is Green ’ s function of the following diffusion equations of quasi-neutral plasma, and which can be described in units of T = e [9,11,15]: @ N @ t ¼r ^ D e ( r N \u0003 N r F ) @ N @ t ¼r ^ D i ( r N \u0003 N r F ) (5 : 8) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 143 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 143"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Here F is the dimensionless potential in units of T = e , i.e., F ¼ ( e = T ) f ; ^ D e and ^ D i are the tensors of electron and ion components of plasma, respectively. Their components can be obtained, as was done in Chapter 1, based on the framework of elementary theory and on the simple geometry of the problem analyzed in Refs. [7,8,15], where the vector B 0 has been directed vertically upward along the z -axis D e jj ¼ T m e n em , D e ? ¼ T m e n em (1 þ q 2 H ) , D e L ¼ T q H m e n em (1 þ q 2 H ) (5 : 9a) D i jj ¼ T M i n im , D i ? ¼ T M i n im (1 þ Q 2 H ) , D i L ¼ T Q H M i n im (1 þ Q 2 H ) (5 : 9b) All notations and parameters in Equation 5.9 are the same as those that were introduced in Chapter 1. As for the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion, D a ( m 2 ), where m 2 ¼ cos 2 b and cos b ¼ k B 0 = j k k B 0 j is the angle between vectors k and B 0 , it can be analyzed directly only for a simple case, where spreading of a small perturbation with the sinusoidal initial profile occurs, spreading in plasma with the wave-vector k [9,10] d N ( r , t ) \b exp i k r \u0003 D a ( m 2 ) k 2 t \u0002\u0003 (5 : 10) Then, the expression (Equation 5.7) is simply a superposition of the sinusoidal plasma modes with the profile (Equation 5.10). For such plasma perturbations, in Refs. [9,10] an expression was obtained describing the tensor of ambipolar diffusion D a ( m 2 ) in the infinite weakly ionized isothermal plasma, which, using our unified notations of plasma parameters introduced in Chapter 1, will be presented as D a \u0004 m 2 \u0005 ¼ 2 T \u0004 1 þ q 2 H m 2 \u0005\u0004 1 þ Q 2 H m 2 \u0005 M i n im \u0004 1 þ Q 2 H \u0005\u0004 1 þ q 2 H m 2 \u0005 þ m e n em \u0004 1 þ q 2 H \u0005\u0004 1 þ Q 2 H m 2 \u0005 (5 : 11) In the sufficiently strong magnetic field, corresponding to the constraints r He r Hi \u0004 l e l i and q H Q H \u0005 1, and taking into account for Equation 5.9, the tensor of the ambipolar diffusion can be presented as D a ( m 2 ) ¼ 2[ D e jj m 2 þ D e ? (1 \u0003 m 2 )], m \u0004 m 0 2[ D i jj m 2 þ D i ? (1 \u0003 m 2 )], m \t m 0 \u0006 (5 : 12) where m 0 ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi b i ? = b e jj p \u0004 1. From Equation 5.12 it follows that the tensor of the ambipolar diffusion is determined by the larger unipolar coefficients of diffusion (Equation 5.9) in the direction defined by m ¼ cos b . Thus, for m > m 0 the character of diffusion is determined by ions with D a ( m 2 ) \u0002 2 D i k and with sinusoidal plasma perturbation spreading under the angle g ¼ tan \u0003 1 ( D i ? = D i jj ) tan b \u0007\b to B 0 . The diffusion flow of plasma electrons along B 0 , G e k , essen- tially exceeds the longitudinal ion flow, G i k , and for m \u0004 m 0 we get D a ( m 2 ) \u0002 2 D e k . That means that the regions with maximum concentration have a positive charge, creating the inner electric field that conserves the condition of quasi-neutrality along B 0 . As a result, the current occurs in directions perpendicular to the vector k of spreading of the sinusoidal plasma perturbation along the lines with d N ¼ const . At the same time, as was shown in Refs. [9,10], the inner electric field is Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 144 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan 144 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"absent for m ¼ m 0 . Thus, in the simple case of sinusoidal perturbation spreading, the character of diffusion differs essentially from ambipolar diffusion in the absence of the magnetic field (according to Schottky [1]). Even using the usual constraints of ambipolar diffusion, G e ¼ G i , for the case under consideration, i.e., G e k ¼ G i k and G e ? ¼ G i ? , we will then get, instead of Equation 5.12, the expression of the coefficient of ordinary diffusion in the anisotropic plasma [4 – 6] D e ( m 2 ) ¼ D ( m 2 ¼ 1) m 2 þ D ( m 2 ¼ 0) (1 \u0003 m 2 )(5 : 13) where from Equation 5.11 it follows that D ( m 2 ¼ 1) \u0006 D a k ¼ 2 T = ( M i n im þ m e n em ) is the coefficient of the longitudinal diffusion ( m ¼ 1, b ¼ 0 8 ) equaling the analogous coefficient of diffusion for isotropic plasma defined by Equation 5.9b and taking it into account in M i n im = m e n em \u0005 1. As for the coefficient of the ambipolar diffusion transverse to B 0 ( m ¼ 0, b ¼ 90 8 ), defined by D ( m 2 ¼ 0) \u0006 D a ? ¼ 2 T = ( M i n im Q 2 H þ m e n em q 2 H ), it is similar to the coefficient of diffusion of electrons in the sufficiently strong magnetic field, increasing by (1 þ T e = T i ) \u0002 2 times due to the influence of ions [7 – 9]. It should be noted that D e ( m 2 ) from Equation 5.13 differs significantly from D a ( m 2 ) (Equation 5.11), and this difference is stronger at angles corresponding to m \u0002 m 0 . Results of numerical analysis of both coefficients carried out in Ref. [9] showed that for 0 < m < 1 the value of D e ( m 2 ) is smaller than that for D a ( m 2 ), and this difference increases with the growth of the degree of magnetization of plasma (i.e., with increase of Q H ). Thus, for q H Q H \u0005 1, a strong anisotropy occurs in the spreading of the sinusoidal plasma perturbation (Equation 5.10), and diffusion along B 0 ( m ! 1, b ! 0 8 ) occurs with the velocity of diffusion of ions increasing (1 þ T e = T i ) \u0002 2 times due to the influence of electrons. In the directions transversal to B 0 ( m ! 0, b ! 90 8 ) the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion D a ( m 2 ) decreases sharply to a value of 2 D i ? ffiffiffi g p . This peculiarity in the dependence of D a ( m 2 ) on angles of b close to 90 8 significantly affects the character of diffusion spreading of plasma disturbance in a strong magnetic field. Even for realization of the equation (Equation 5.13) describing ambipolar diffusion in anisotropic plasma, the nonpotential (i.e., vortex) inner electric field is needed to secure the short-circuit current through background plasma. This new effect relates to a non-single-dimension problem that we will consider briefly on the basis of results obtained in Refs. [7 – 10]. Thus, for small distances , when r \u0004 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D a t p , Equation 5.7 yields G (0, t ) ¼ 1 8 p 3 = 2 t 3 = 2 ð 1 0 d m D 3 = 2 a ( m 2 ) (5 : 14) Following Equation 5.14, the small weak plasma disturbance in its center decreases in time with \b t \u0003 3 = 2 , i.e., in the same manner as when the magnetic field was absent [1 – 3]. The value of G (0, t ) that characterizes speed of damping of initial plasma perturbation depends essentially on the diffusion rate of electrons and ions. Thus, as mentioned earlier, in the strong magnetic field plasma electrons fill the ellipsoid with dimensions L e and d e , and plasma ions fill the ellipsoid with dimensions L i and d i . To oppose the particles with higher mobilities, electrons along B 0 and ions across B 0 , the inner self-consistent electric field has to be quadruple-shaped with two symmetrical maxima of electric potential at points z ¼\u0007 z 0 along the vertical axis z and vector B 0 , and with one maximum at the point r ¼ r 0 (i.e., in the plane z ¼ 0 transverse to B 0 )[8 – 10]. In this case the flow of background electrons along B 0 under the influence of the inner electric field for z > z 0 is directed toward the diffusion flow of electrons inside the disturbance, increasing the diffusion flow of Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 145 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 145"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"electrons along B 0 . In the same manner, for r > r 0 this electric field increases the diffusion flow of ions as particles with higher mobility across B 0 . Finally, the plasma disturbance occupies the area consisting of two overlapping ellipsoids, electron and ion, as shown in Figure 5.1 according to Refs. [8 – 10]. This figure illustrates the relative profile of point perturbation of plasma density, d N ( r , t ) = d N (0,0), where the corresponding coordinates along and across B 0 are denoted by the relative units ~ z ¼ z = L i and ~ r ¼ r = L i , computed for q H ¼ 30 and Q H ¼ 0.3. The dark areas with negative values of plasma concentration correspond to depletion regions of background plasma. Numerical results obtained in Refs. [8 – 10] as well as results described earlier indicate that the electron and ion components of a weak small plasma perturbation spread independently in a strong magnetic field, so that the requirement of quasi-neutrality is absent. This quasi-neutrality is secured in the electronic ellipsoid by background ions flowing into it across B 0 and in the ionic ellipsoid by background electrons flowing into it along B 0 . These flows of background particles are caused by an inner electric field occurring inside the initial perturbation. At an angle of about b 0 ¼ cos \u0003 1 ( m 0 ) the perturbation of electric potential of this field is limited to zero, i.e., from this direction background particles leave their initial sites under the influence of the electric field creating the depletion regions, as shown in Figure 5.1. The number of particles leaving depletion areas corresponds to the number of particles inside the initial plasma perturbation. We will now estimate the volume filled by the perturbed plasma and the concentration of plasma particles within this volume. In the absence of the magnetic field ( B 0 ¼ 0), the effective volume occupied by the initial perturbation d N of plasma is of the same order as the ambipolar volume, i.e., z ~ 10 0.20 sin a = m 0 0.30 0.45 (a) (b) 0.02 0.4 0.05 \u0001 2 \u0001 1 012 ~ r 8 4 6 sin a = m 0 z ~ 12 10 0.0 \u0001 0.005 8 \u0001 0.012 \u0001 0.02 6 4 0.17 0.31 0.5 2 \u0001 2 \u0001 10 1 2 ~ r Figure 5.1 Equipotential (a) and equidensity (b) contours of the point plasma density in the unbounded weakly ionized magnetized plasma.

It can be seen that the volume occupied by plasma disturbance may essentially increase compared with the case when the magnetic field is absent. The plasma concentration in the near zone ( r \u0004 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D a t p ) following Equation 5.14 can be presented as d N (0, t ) N 0 ¼ n 0 8 p 3 = 2 t 3 = 2 ð 1 0 d m D 3 = 2 a ( m 2 ) \u0002 (1 þ T e = T i ) 3 = 2 (8 p D i jj t ) 3 = 2 1 þ Q 2 H þ q 1 = 2 H Q 3 = 2 H \t (5 : 17) This ratio is of the order of V \u0003 1 e þ V \u0003 1 i \u0004\u0005 n 0 = N 0 ; i.e., the concentration of plasma in the zone of the overlapping of the two ellipsoids is determined by the volume of the smaller ellipsoid. From Equation 5.17 it follows that as the magnetic field increases, the value of the integral in Equation 5.17, which we denoted by I , increases proportionally to B 2 0 . In the sufficiently strong magnetic field (when q H \u0005 1 and Q H \t 1) for the case of isothermal plasma ( T e \u0002 T i ¼ T ), the expression for I is I ¼ ð 1 0 d m D 3 = 2 a ( m 2 ) \u0002 1 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi (2 D i jj )(2 D i ? )(2 D e ? ) p (5 : 18) Comparing this expression with that for ordinary diffusion in the anisotropic plasma, I ¼ ( D jj D 2 ? ) \u0003 1 , we get the effective coefficient of diffusion across the magnetic field B 0 as the mean square of doubled coefficients of transverse diffusion of electrons and ions, i.e., D ? ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi (2 D i ? )(2 D e ? ) p . In the presence of the ambient magnetic field, the volume occupied by plasma perturbation increases significantly compared to when the magnetic field is absent, despite the fact that at the same time the corresponding velocities of plasma diffusion across the magnetic field slow down significantly. In the close zone corresponding to the overlapping of two ellipsoids, as shown in Refs.

We can again point out that in the far zones the character of diffusion spreading of point weak plasma disturbances is determined by the short-circuit currents through plasma. In the intervals sin a \u0002 m 0 , from which the background particles come to the volume contain- ing the initial plasma disturbance, are created the areas with the negative plasma concentration; these are the depletion zones . Thus, in the zones far from the initial plasma disturbance, its profile attenuates not according to the exponential law, but according to the polynomial law, \b r \u0003 5 .In Refs. [8 – 10], the physical description of this phenomenon was analyzed in detail. It was shown that the reason for this behavior — of plasma disturbance spreading at large distances — is that the process of its relaxation is determined not only by diffusion of its electrons and ions along and across B 0 , but also by the influence of spatial electrical charge of background plasma, i.e., by the flow of vortex (short-circuit) currents through the background plasma. The relative depth h of the depletion zones, from which background electrons and ions come to the initial plasma disturbance to secure conditions of plasma quasi-neutrality, is of the order of the ratio of the amount of particles inside the disturbance to the amount of background particles in the depletion zones with the volume, V b \b L e d 2 i , which greatly exceeds the volume of ellipsoids traced by electrons and ions of the initial disturbance, i.e., h ¼ d N N 0 \b n 0 16 ffiffiffi 2 p p 3 = 2 N 0 D 1 = 2 e jj D i ? t 3 = 2 (5 : 25) The results of numerical computations of the strict formula (Equation 5.7), of the approximate formulas for the close zone (Equations 5.19a through 5.20) and for the far zone (Equations 5.21 and 5.22), and of the ambipolar exponential profile obtained in the case of B 0 ¼ 0 are shown together in Figure 5.2 by circles, solid, and dashed curves, respectively. The profile of spreading of a weak initially small plasma disturbance versus the dimensionless distance x ¼ r = L i is shown for the two cases: (a) cos a ¼ 0 (curves 1), and (b) cos a ¼ 0.9 (curves 2). The first case corresponds to diffusion in the direction transverse to B 0 and the second one to diffusion along B 0 . Computations were made for sufficiently magnetized plasma ( Q H ¼ 1 and q H \u0002 333, i.e., q H Q H \u0005 1). Here, the boundary of overlapping of ellipsoids corresponds to the constraint 0 < cos a < 1, and the boundary of the larger ion ellipsoid (across B 0 ) corresponds to the constraint D e ? = D i jj \u0002 0 : 99. In this area, a sharp gradient (with the scale \b d e ) of plasma concentration occurs in the inner electric field, which hinders faster particles (ions) in this direction. Thus, in the areas of the overlapping of the ellipsoids, the profile of plasma concentration is ambipolar and attenuates according to the exponential law, as in the case of B 0 ¼ 0, which is seen from Figure 5.2 for x < 0.1. Apart from areas of electron and ion ellipses, the profile of plasma concentration falls according to the polynomial law \b r \u0003 5 , which is shown in Figure 5.2 for x > 0.1. In the far zones, the quick exponential damping of Green ’ s function, G ( r,t ) ¼ d N ( r,t ) = n 0 , becomes weaker and decreases according to Equations 5.21 and 5.22 as x \u0003 5 . It can also be seen that for small x , Green ’ s function falls faster in directions orthogonal to B 0 (cos a ¼ 0). This fact can be understood taking Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 149 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 149"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"into account that the magnetic field sharply hinders coefficients of diffusion across B 0 . The anisotropy of spreading for x < 0.1 is significant, whereas for x \u0005 0.1 it becomes insufficient.

The form of plasma disturbance in the process of its spreading is shown in Figure 5.3a in the logarithmic scale, and in Figure 5.3b the curve G ( x,t ) ¼ 0.03 is shown in the ordinary scale. The rotation of the angle, cos a , commences from the vertical axis. Thus, we again see that the shape of the initial plasma disturbance during its spreading takes on the anisotropic form, covering the area of overlapping of both electron and ion ellipsoids; i.e., its maximal semi-axis along B 0 corresponds to L e ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 D e jj t p , and its maximal semi-axis across B 0 corresponds to d i ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 D i ? t p .

In the nonlinear case of strong plasma disturbances, when the concentration of the background plasma is not sufficient to guarantee quasi-neutrality, the spreading of plasma disturbance occurs according to other scenarios. The depletion zones become sufficiently broad (compared to the linear case) and deep. The mechanism of short-circuit current becomes insufficient and the ambipolar regime is predominant; i.e., ambipolar diffusion in the anisotropic plasma occurs [1 – 3]. The fully consistent analysis of diffusion spreading of small strong ( d N \u0005 N 0 ) or intermediary ( d N \u0001 N 0 and d N \t N 0 ) plasma disturbance in infinite weakly ionized plasma was analyzed in Refs. [10 – 14]. Without going into the mathematical details of this analysis, we will describe briefly peculiarities occurring during spreading of such plasma disturbances in strong magnetic fields.

Thus, the nonlinear effects occur in the overlapping of these ellipsoids. In this region the solution can be presented as follows: d N ( r , t ) ¼ N \u0003 N 0 ¼ N e þ N i þ N e N i N \u0003 1 0 (5 : 26a) F ( r , t ) ¼ e T w ( r , t ) ¼ ln N e N 0 þ 1 \u000b\f \u0003 ln N i N 0 þ 1 \u000b\f (5 : 26b) where N e and N i are defined by Equation 5.20a and b, respectively.

Outside the overlapping zone, the concentration and the flows in the electron and ion ellipsoids are similar to those for the linear case of a weak disturbance; i.e., they can be described by Equation 5.19, because in Equation 5.26 the term \b N a h is sufficiently small compared to other terms. We will now summarize the physical aspects of the quasi-linear process occurring when an intermediate plasma disturbance is injected into infinite weakly ionized plasma. In this case, because of a weak effect of nonlinearity, until the relative depth of the depletion zone h is sufficiently small, the effects of short-circuit currents through the background plasma caused by electrons and ions from depletion areas are essential. The maximum value of plasma concentration in the electron and ion ellipsoids is limited by the number of particles of background plasma that can come from the depletion areas to secure the statement of quasi-neutrality. Ions of background plasma enter the electron ellipsoid across B 0 from distances \b d i , and the number of ions filling the volume of electron ellipsoid is of the order \b N 0 L e d 2 i . Thus, the concentration in this ellipsoid is d N e \b N 0 hD i ? = D e ? (5 : 28) At the same time, background electrons enter the ion ellipsoid along B 0 from distances \b L e , and the number of ions filling the volume of the electron ellipsoid is of the order \b N 0 L i d 2 e . Thus, the concentration in this ellipsoid is d N i \b N 0 h ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D e jj = D i jj q (5 : 29) The background ions collected in the electron ellipsoid are conserved there by a strong transverse (to B 0 ) electric field that decreases with the scale \b d e . This leads to strong depletion of the background plasma close to the electron ellipsoid. At the same time, the transverse diffusion of background ions increases the transverse dimension of the depletion area to d i (for B 0 ¼ 0 was d e ; see earlier text). Simultaneously, the background electrons collected in the ion ellipsoid are conserved there by a strong longitudinal (to B 0 ) electric field that decreases with the scale \b L i . This leads to strong depletion of background plasma close to the ion ellipsoid, and also to an increase of the longitudinal dimension of the depletion area to L e (for the case of B 0 ¼ 0 was L i ; see earlier text). Hence, because of short-circuit flows through the background plasma, the total concentration of plasma is disturbed significantly both in the volume of electron and ion ellipsoids and the condition of quasi-neutrality does not necessarily limit the volume occupied by a weak or an intermediary plasma disturbance because, as shown earlier analytically, the processes are similar for these kinds of plasma disturbances. If now a strong disturbance is injected into the plasma, the background plasma becomes depleted significantly and the constraint h \u0005 1 usually occurs in this scenario. The character of diffusion changes completely, because the number of particles in the central (i.e., in a zone of overlapping of ellipsoids) becomes equal to the total number of injected charged particles in a plasma disturbance. In this case, the plasma concentration is described by the ambipolar profile (Equation 5.27), and the disturbance spreads, as when the magnetic field is absent ( B 0 ¼ 0). Only a negligible percentage of charged particles spread in the electron and ion ellipsoids caused by the short-circuit mechanism.

In the case of strong nonlinearity ( h \u0005 1) the plasma disturbance at the boundary of this region becomes of the order of N 0 , and the asymptotical nonlinear solution d N NL simply equals the product of the linear asymptotic solution d N L and the inverse depth of the depletion zone, i.e., d N NL ( r , t ) / d N L h \u0003 1 (5 : 30) where d N L is described by Equations 5.21 and 5.22. Hence, for the extreme case when d N \u0005 N 0 and h \u0005 1, the influence of the background plasma is insufficient and plasma disturbance spreads as in the case of B 0 ¼ 0 (according to Schottky [1 – 3]). Diffusion of Plasma Disturbances of Finite Dimensions in the Weakly Ionized Unbounded Plasma . Based on the theory of diffusion spreading of weak and strong disturbances of a weakly ionized unbounded plasma in the absence or presence of the ambient magnetic field, a set of simple models of spreading of plasma perturbations with arbitrary initial configuration, infinite [14] and cylin- drical [7,15] with limit dimensions L and d , oriented under the angle u to B 0 , was performed. These models will be described briefly in the following text. We consider now a two-dimensional (2-D) plasma disturbance of infinite length along B 0 oriented at the angle u to B 0 , as shown in Figure 5.4a. In the case of a weak disturbance of the background plasma ( d N \u0004 N 0 ), the solution is a 2-D analogue of the problem discussed earlier for a point weak disturbance. The form of such a disturbance is shown schematically in Figure 5.4a, which can simply be presented as a superposition of two ellipsoids, the electronic with semi-axes L e e ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 D e e jj t q and d e ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 D e ? t p , and the ionic with semi-axes L e i ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 D e i jj t q and d i ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 D i ? t p , where D e e jj ¼ D e jj sin 2 u þ D e ? cos 2 u D e i jj ¼ D i jj sin 2 u þ D i ? cos 2 u (5 : 31) B 0 , z q z \u0002 y \u0002 x (a) (b) s z \u0002 p a d x c rq bb ⊕ Figure 5.4 The shape of 2-D plasma disturbance (a) strongly elongated under angle to the ambient magnetic field, and the corresponding electric field spatial distribution (b).

The asymptotes in the far zone (outside ellipsoids) can be obtained by using Equations 5.22 and 5.23 to change the longitudinal coefficients of diffusion in them according to Equation 5.31. These asymptotic solutions are valid for angles u for which D e e jj > D e i jj , i.e., for u > m 0 \u0006 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D i ? = D e jj p . If the inclination angle u is sufficiently small, i.e., u < m 0 , then L e e < L e i and the depletion regions vanish. Then diffusion is limited to the 1-D ambipolar diffusion across B 0 both in the case of weak and strong plasma density disturbance. The dimensions of the disturbed region are quickly decreased, forming the ambipolar volume \b L i d 2 e . However, in the case of strong plasma disturbance ( d N > N 0 ), for the initial geometry of the problem, the additional Hall flows occur and become significant. Because these flows are proportional to B \u0003 1 0 , they can significantly accelerate the transport process across B 0 . This is correct only for a small plasma disturbance. In the case presented by Figure 5.4, the situation is more complicated. As shown in Ref. [14], for u > u 0 \u0006 min Q \u0003 1 H , ffiffiffiffiffiffi m 0 p \u0007\b the Hall flows can be short-circuited by the background electronic flow along B 0 and the background ionic flow across B 0 . The difference between the point disturbance described previously and the disturbance shown in Figure 5.4a is that here, diffusion occurs in the plane z 0 0 x (see Figure 5.4b). If the disturbance of plasma concentration does not greatly exceed the concentration of the background plasma ( d N \t N 0 ), the diffusion in the plane z 0 0 x is determined by short-circuit currents through the background plasma. In the case of strong plasma disturbance ( d N \u0005 N 0 ), an ambipolar diffusion (for B 0 ¼ 0) takes place. Finally, for u > u 0 (corresponding illustrations in Figure 5.4a and b), two cases can be realized: (1) for the relative depth of the depletion regions h ¼ A = 8 p N 0 t ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D i ? = D e jj p \u0004\u0005 < 1, the mechanism of short-circuit currents through plasma occurs, and (2) for h > 1 the ambipolar diffusion for B 0 ¼ 0 (according to Schottky [1 – 3]) takes place. Here, A is the number of particles at the unit length of the plasma disturbance. Thus, in Figure 5.4b the electron flows along B 0 are shown by curved arrows, which, together with Hall flows, create the short-circuit current through the ambipolar ellipsoid, with the positive volume charge in direction sr and with the negative volume charge along line pq (see Figure 5.4b). Divergence of electronic flow, associated with perturbations of the inner field potential, dw , is proportional to b e jj dw N u 2 = L e 2 i . Therefore, for u > ffiffiffiffiffiffi m 0 p , Q H < 1 (ions are weakly magnetized) it is possible even for a small potential disturbance, dw / w 0 m 0 = u 2 ,to compensate for the divergence of electronic Hall flow. The ionic Hall flow is circuited across B 0 in the same manner as the electronic Hall flow. Only for small angles m 0 < u < u 0 does diffusion in the crossing E 0 \u000b B 0 fields (Hall current) lead to a fundamental change of the character of diffusion of strong plasma disturbance (with d N > N 0 ). The polarization ( pqrs ) (see Figure 5.4b) cannot now be circuited along B 0 , and the Hall flows are generated in this field. A divergence of these flows is proportional to eD e ? dw ( T e d e L e i ) \u0003 1 at the scale of the ambipolar ellipsoid, and is small compared to r G e jj but exceeds r G e ? . Therefore, the electric field changes sign across B 0 , and the transverse scale of strong plasma disturbance increases from d e to L i . Without going deeply into the theoretical analysis of the process in this case, which is presented in detail in Ref. [14], we point out that for angles of inclination of the initial strong ( d N > N 0 ) corresponding to the constraint m 0 < u < u 0 , the Hall flows lead to acceleration of the diffusion process compared to the previous case of u > u 0 . In the case of small inclination angles, where u < m 0 , as mentioned earlier, the disturbance, weak or strong, spreads according to 1-D (across B 0 ) ambipolar diffusion. In Ref. [14], some numerical computations of spreading of the initial 2-D plasma disturbance with the finite dimensions L ¼ d in the ( x , y )-plane and infinite length along z -axis, with the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 154 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan 154 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"inclination angle u to B 0 , were carried out for wide range of angles u .

As found by numerical analysis, the potential of the internal field has a quadruple character. For large angles u , its extrema lie practically at the z 0 - and x -axes, and the profile of concentration is symmetrical relative to x - and z 0 -axes (see Figure 5.4a). Figure 5.5 shows the distribution of the plasma concentration within the disturbed region (solid curves in the upper plane) and the potential of the inner field (dashed curves at the bottom plane) for the case of small u ¼ 1 8 50 0 . The coordinates z 0 and x are normalized on L . It is evident that the essential asymmetry of the profile of concentration and potential is observed for small angles u of the initial disturbance (relative to B 0 ) infinitely stretched along the z -axis. Because the asymmetry is essential only in the regions where d N > N 0 , it is negligible in the far zones. Estimations made in Ref.

The dimensionless potential was determined by a similar expression, F ¼ e w = T . In computations the initial disturbance was chosen to be moderate, i.e., d N ¼ (3 – 10) N 0 . The boundary conditions were taken as follows: F ¼ 0, @ r @ ~ x ¼ 0, ~ x ¼\u0007 L R F ¼ 0, @\u0001 @ ~ y ¼ 0, ~ y ¼\u0007 L R (5 : 35) In Figures 5.6 through 5.9 the lines of equal normalized concentration (solid curves) and the normalized potential (dashed curves) are presented for ~ t ¼ 0, (a) 0.5, (b) and 1 (c), and for u ¼ 0 8 , 1 8 10 0 ,1 8 50 0 , and 90 8 , respectively.

The function F ( t ) relates to screening effects of the electrostatic field made by the disturbance d N . For large time t , depletion regions can be created, and the character of diffusion spreading becomes directly dependent on the degree of perturbation A of the background plasma. As mentioned earlier, the convenient characteristics of plasma disturbance such as the maximal depth of the depletion zones h (Equation 5.25) can be taken into account and rewritten according to Ref. [94] as h ¼ AL 3 8 ffiffiffi 2 p D 1 = 2 e jj D i ? t 3 = 2 (5 : 39) If h \u0005 1, the depth of the depletion zones is significant, and the character of spreading is determined by the ambipolar diffusion along B 0 described by Equation 5.38. In the case of moderate disturbance, where h \t 1or h \u0001 1, the process of diffusion is controlled by short-circuit currents through the depletion regions and the profile of plasma concentration in the electron and ion ellipsoids is close to that described in Ref. [94]: N ( z , r , t ) ¼ d N e þ d N i þ d N e d N i N \u0003 1 0 þ N 0 (5 : 40) where the components d N e and d N i are described by Equation 5.20. In Figure 5.10a the dependence of concentration at the origin of the coordinate system ( z ¼ 0, r ¼ 0) is shown versus the dimensionless time t ¼ D i jj t = L 2 according to numerical calculations made in Ref. [94]. Here, curve 1 corresponds to direct calculations of the system (Equation 5.8) with initial (Equation 5.36) and boundary (Equation 5.37) conditions, curve 2 indicates the approximation solution (Equation 5.38), and curve 3 relates to the approximation (Equation 5.40) with Equation 5.20. Parameter A in computations varied from 1 to 100. In Figure 5.10a, the parameter A was taken to equal 10. It can be seen that curve 1 is approximated closely by formula Equation 5.38 up to time t ¼ t 0 ¼ 0.46 and by Equation 5.40 beyond t 0 . The point t 0 is the moment of switching on the mechanism of short-circuit current generation through the background plasma. For t < t 0 , the character of diffusion is close to the ambipolar one described by Equation 5.38. In the case of strong disturbance, A ¼ 100, where the character of spreading is presented in Figure 5.11a and b, the direct numerical solution of the system (Equation 5.8) (solid curve) differs insignificantly compared to the ambipolar solution (Equation 5.38) (dashed curves) during the time of computation. The profiles of the concentration along B 0 (curve 1) and across B 0 (curve 2) for t ¼ 0.1 and A ¼ 100 are shown in Figure 5.11a. The continuous curves correspond to the direct numerical computations of Equation 5.8 and the dashed curves to the ambipolar solution Equation 5.38. It is evident that the character of diffusion is fully described by the ambipolar diffusion along B 0 (or for the case of B 0 ¼ 0[1 – 3]).

[4 – 15] the theory of the arbitrary disturbance of plasma density in the presence of the ambient magnetic field was consistently presented, it cannot explain all the peculiarities occurring in the process of the spreading of irregularities in plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization. In other words, the previous discussion does not consider the effects of electron – ion collisions occurring in the real ionospheric plasma at altitudes more than 140 – 150 km. Therefore, based on results obtained in Refs. [16 – 22,47], we will analyze the main peculiarities of diffusion spreading of arbitrary plasma irregularities in the ionosphere, taking into account the empirical distribution of the main parameters of the real model of the middle-latitude ionosphere described in Chapter 1. We use the data for the middle-latitude ionosphere because they are much more systematically presented in the literature [20 – 22,27,83]. First, we will consider a simple case of diffusion spreading of a small weak plasma disturbance in the infinite homogeneous ionosphere, now taking into account the real parameter of ionization p ¼ n ei = n em introduced and described in Chapter 1 for the real model of the middle-latitude ionosphere. In this case the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion differs from that described by Equation 5.11. Thus, for the case of the isothermic ( T e \u0002 T i ¼ T ) background plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization, and according to Refs. [16,17,20], the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion equals D a ( m 2 ) ¼ 2 T (1 þ p ) 2 þ q 2 H (1 þ 2 h p ) m 2 þ Q 2 H q 2 H m 4 \u0007\b M i n im (1 þ p ) 2 þ Q H q H (1 þ p ) þ q 2 H (1 þ h p þ Q 2 H m 4 ) \u0007\b (5 : 41) where all parameters are defined in Chapter 1. As in the case of weakly ionized plasma ( p ¼ 0) discussed earlier, a tendency of plasma diffusion in the strong magnetic field is found [17]. Thus, the dependence of the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion (Equation 5.41) in the magnetized plasma ( Q H q H \u0005 1) in the direction of the vector k of spreading in the ambient magnetic field is sufficiently complicated and fundamentally differs from the similar coefficient of diffusion in the anisotropic medium D 0 ( m 2 ) ¼ D jj m 2 þ D ? (1 \u0003 m 2 )(5 : 42) from which for m ¼ 1( b ¼ 0 8 ) and m ¼ 0( b ¼ 90 8 ), we get, respectively, D jj \u0006 D ( m ¼ 1) ¼ 2 T M i n im (1 þ h ) (5 : 43a) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 164 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan 164 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"D ? \u0006 D ( m ¼ 0) ¼ 2 T M i n im (1 þ p þ h q 2 H ) (5 : 43b) From Equations 5.42 and 5.43, it can be seen that the velocity of longitudinal diffusion in the magnetic field is the same as that of ions in the isotropic plasma, D i jj ¼ 2 T M i n im , because h ¼ m e n em = M i n im \u0004 1, and the collisions of the charged particles do not influence diffusion along B 0 . Also following from Figure 5.14, in the case of weakly ionized plasma ( p ¼ 0), the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion D a ( m 2 ) defined by Equation 5.31 differs significantly from that of anisotropic diffusion D 0 ( m 2 ) defined by Equation 5.42. Thus, with an increasing degree of ionization of plasma ( p > 1), the difference between D a ( m 2 ) and D 0 ( m 2 ) becomes weaker and insufficient for p \u0005 1 (more strictly for h p > 1). The corresponding dependences, D a ( m 2 ) = D a (0) and D 0 ( m 2 ) = D a (0), determined by Equations 5.41 and 5.43b and by Equations 5.42 and 5.43b, are shown by a family of solid and dashed curves, respectively. Hence, in the ionospheric plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization, the ambipolar diffusion simply transforms into an ordinary diffusion process in the anisotropic medium. This peculiarity is evident from analysis of the coefficients of unipolar diffusion described in Equation 1.12a, which was made taking into account the real model of the middle-latitude ionosphere (see Figure 1.3). From Figure 1.3 it can also be seen that for a weakly ionized plasma the short-circuit currents through the background plasma cause higher speed of diffusion (dashed curves) comparing to that for plasma with a real degree of 1 r =10 D a ( b )/ D a (0) 5 1 0 h = 200 km 90° - b 10 \u0001 3 10 \u0001 2 10 \u0001 1 0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 Figure 5.14 Normalized coefficient of ambipolar diffusion versus ionospheric altitude for the real model of the middle-latitude ionosphere (solid curves) and virtual weakly ionized iono- spheric plasma (dashed curves).

Accounting for the real degree of ionization of the ionospheric plasma (solid curves in Figure 1.3), where the difference between coefficients of unipolar diffusion of electrons and ions along and across B 0 becomes negligible, we observe the inverse process. Here, the character of diffusion changes from the ambipolar in the presence of the magnetic field (with D e jj along B 0 and D i ? across B 0 ) to the ordinary diffusion in the anisotropic medium (with D i jj along B 0 and D e ? across B 0 ). The foregoing allows for generalizing a tensor of ambipolar diffusion described by Equation 5.12 to the case of real ionospheric plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization D a ( m 2 ) ¼ 2 D e jj m 2 þ 1 þ p 1 þ 2 p D e ?

This presentation of the tensor of the ambipolar diffusion allows for transferring continu- ously from weakly ( p ¼ 0) to strongly ( p \u0005 1) ionized plasma. Thus, as shown in Refs. [16,17] and clearly seen from Equation 5.44, for the case p ¼ 0 for angles b ¼ cos \u0003 1 ( k B 0 = kB 0 ) close to the transverse to B 0 direction ( b ! 90 8 , m ! 0) the tensor D a ( m 2 ) is the doubled tensor of electron diffusion (for isothermal plasma) D a ( m 2 ) ¼ 2[ D e jj m 2 þ D e ? (1 \u0003 m 2 )] (5 : 45a) which for b ¼ 90 8 , m ¼ 0 equals 2 D e ? . For b ! 0 8 , m ! 1 the tensor D a ( m 2 ) is the doubled tensor of ion diffusion (for isothermal plasma) D a ( m 2 ) ¼ 2[ D i jj m 2 þ D i ? (1 \u0003 m 2 )] (5 : 45b) which for b ¼ 0 8 , m ¼ 1 equals 2 D i jj . These results fully describe diffusion of the point or sinusoidal disturbances in the isothermal weakly ionized infinite plasma reported in Refs. [4,5,9,11]. At the same time, for the case of ionospheric plasma with p \u0005 1 (more strictly for h p > 1) for the transverse diffusion ( b ¼ 90 8 , m ¼ 0) D a ( m 2 ) ¼ D e ? \u0002 D i ? , and for the longitudinal diffusion ( b ¼ 0 8 , m ¼ 1) D a ( m 2 ) ¼ 2 D i jj . These results are in agreement with those discussed earlier and also obtained in Refs. [16,17]. We can now estimate the critical parameter of ionization of the ionospheric plasma for which the transformation of diffusion process, from ambipolar in weakly ionized plasma described by Equation 5.12 to that in the case of the ionospheric plasma with arbitrary degree of ionization described by Equation 5.44.

Thus, following from Equation 1.12, for the components of unipolar diffusion of charged particles, for p !1 (i.e., n em ! 0and n im ! 0), the coefficients D e jj !1 and D i jj !1 , i.e., the longitudinal diffusion in the fully ionized plasma, are impossible. The main reason for this condition is that for diffusion in plasma it is necessary that the total pressure, described by a sum of the gas ( P e þ P i ) and the magnetic ( P B ¼ B 2 = 8 p ) pressure, should be constant, i.e., r ( P e þ P ) þr P B ¼ 0. However, in the fully ionized plasma r P B ¼ 0, and, therefore, r ( P e þ P ) ¼ 0or( T e r N e þ T i r N i ) ¼ 0. In the case of isothermal ( T e \u0002 T i ¼ T )andquasi-neutral( N e \u0002 N i ¼ N ) plasma, these conditions are satisfied if r N ¼ 0; i.e., the definition of the longitudinal diffusion loses its physical meaning. However, the coefficient of the ambipolar diffusion D a ( m 2 ) does not give any information about the shape and form of the spreading plasma disturbance of arbitrary configuration and only describes damping of disturbance with the initial profile of Fourier harmonic type \b exp{ i kr \u0003 D a ( m 2 ) k 2 t }. In the spreading of the 3-D disturbance, d N , as mentioned previously, new effects occur related to the 1-D problem. Thus, for the point disturbance and following Equation 5.7, Green ’ s function, which characterizes the velocity and the time of spreading of arbitrary disturbance, essentially depends on the velocity of diffusion of electron and ion components of plasma disturbance. In fact, as shown earlier, in strong magnetized plasma ( q H \u0005 1, Q H > 1) the plasma disturbance occupies an area having the shape of the crossing electron and ion ellipsoids with characteristic semi-axes, L e , d e and L i , d i , respectively. The dimensions of the initial plasma disturbance along B 0 are determined by the length \b 2 L e and the width \b 2 d i across B 0 . These dimensions and the shape of the initial disturbance depend significantly on the degree of ionization of background plasma. Thus, in Figure 5.15 the shape of the disturbance is presented in the form of the overlapping of electron and ion ellipsoids. The corresponding scales are also shown for each z , Hz , Hz , Hz , H M L e = 1:40 M L i = 1:10 M d e, d i = 10:1 L e d i L i 2 d e r = 0 r = 1 r = 5 r = 10 Figure 5.15 The shape of overlapping electron and ion ellipsoids versus the parameter of ionization, p ¼ 0, 1, 5, and 10.

It can be seen that with the growth of the degree of ionization, p , the width of the electron ellipsoid is limited to the width of an ion. Along B 0 , the dimension of the disturbed area is defined by electrons. Finally, the shape of the disturbance is limited to the that of the ellipsoid, characterized by ordinary diffusion in the anisotropic medium (we should not forget that for p ¼ 0 it has the spindle-shaped form; see Figure 5.3). Moreover, the dimensions and shape of the disturbance in the real ionosphere with an arbitrary degree of ionization differ significantly from those in the weakly ionized plasma (for p ¼ 0). Thus, in Figure 5.16, the dashed lines correspond to the weakly ionized plasma and the continuous curves to the real degree of ionization and plasma parameters corresponding to the altitudes h ¼ 200 km and h ¼ 300 km (see Tables 1.1 through 1.3). It can be seen that for h ¼ 200 km and t ¼ 0.01 s and p ¼ 0, L e ¼ 400 m, d e ¼ 0.01 m, L i ¼ 10 m, d i ¼ 0.3 m, whereas for p ¼ 3 (corresponding to the altitude of 200 km) L e ¼ 200 m, d e ¼ 0.02 m, L i ¼ 11 m, d i ¼ 0.4 m.

For p > 1, the value of V e is of the order of unity, and for p \u0005 1 we get V e ¼ 1. Thus, with growth in the degree of plasma ionization, the volume occupied by the plasma disturbance is limited to the analogous volume in the case of B 0 ¼ 0 (according to Schottky [1 – 3]). The character of diffusion spreading of arbitrary plasma disturbance essentially depends on the degree of ionization of the background plasma. Without loss of generality, let us consider a weak ( d N \u0004 N 0 ) small ( d N ( r ,0) ¼ n 0 d ( r )) plasma disturbance injected into the background plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization. In this case, a system of hydrodynamic equations (Equation 1.6) can be linearized, taking into account the quasi-neutrality of plasma, ambipolarity of diffusion, and the constraint ( r ^ s e r )( r ^ s i r ) ¼ ( r ^ s i r )( r ^ s e r ) according to Refs. [5,9,11], i.e., ( r ^ s e rþr ^ s i r ) @ d N @ t ¼ ( r ^ s e r )( r ^ D i r ) þ ( r ^ s i r )( r ^ D e r ) \u0007\b d N (5 : 48) The solution of Equation 5.48 has the same form as Equation 5.7 for weakly ionized plasma but with the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion D a ( m 2 ) now described by Equation 5.41 or 5.44. We present this solution in the spherical coordinate system { k , m , c }, as a frame in the wave-vector space, which after integration over k yields G ( r , a , t ) \u0006 d N ( r , a , t ) n 0 ¼ 1 8 p 5 = 2 t 3 = 2 ð 1 0 d m D 3 = 2 a ( m 2 ) ð p 0 e \u0003 r 2 B 2 4 D a t 1 \u0003 r 2 B 2 2 D a t \u0006\r d c (5 : 49) Here B ¼ m cos a þ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 \u0003 m 2 p sin a cos c ; c is the angle between planes ( r , B 0 ) and ( k , B 0 ); a the angle between the radius vector r and vector B 0 , i.e., cos a ¼ rB 0 = j r jj B 0 j , m ¼ cos b . For small distances from the origin of the frame ( r \u0004 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D a t p ) from Equation 5.49, we immediately obtain Equation 5.14. It was shown in Refs. [9,11] that for the case of weakly ionized plasma, the linear solution (Equation 5.49) up to distances r \u0001 10 L i can be presented by a simple superposition of solutions obtained for the electron and ion ellipsoids: G ( x , a ) ¼ G e ( x , a ) þ G i ( x , a )(5 : 50) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 169 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 169"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"where G e ( x , a ) \u0006 d N e ( x , a ) n 0 ¼ exp \u0003 x 2 D i jj D e jj cos 2 a \u0003 D i jj D e ? sin 2 a hi no p 3 = 2 L 2 i ( D e jj = D i jj ) 1 = 2 ( D e ? = D i jj ) (5 : 51a) G i ( x , a ) \u0006 d N i ( x , a ) n 0 ¼ exp \u0003 x 2 cos 2 a \u0003 D i jj D i ? sin 2 a hi no p 3 = 2 L 2 i ( D i ? = D i jj ) (5 : 51b) Here, as before, x ¼ r = L i and L i ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8 D i jj t p (plasma is isothermal; T e \u0002 T i ¼ T ).

At the right side of the picture the shape and the characteristic scales of dimensions of plasma disturbance are shown for two different times, 0.01 s (solid curves) and 0.1 s (dashed curves). As can be seen, in the zones of electron and ion ellipsoids, i.e., in the close zone ( x \u0001 1), the Green function G ( x , a ) falls sharply according to the exponential law, mostly in the direction orthogonal to B 0 (or close to this direction, particularly, for a \t 60 8 ). In this zone, strong anisotropy in the initial disturbance spreading is observed; the speed of diffusion depends on the angle a , and for a ¼ 0 8 (along B 0 ) the damping of G ( x , a ) occurs more slowly than for a ¼ 90 8 (across B 0 ).

In this zone the anisotropy is not as vivid and becomes weaker with an increase of dimensionless distance x . The form of the inhomogeneity in the far zone is limited to ellipsoidal, with the scale 2 d e across B 0 and 2 L i along B 0 , which corresponds to that in the case of diffusion in an anisotropic medium. For a strong degree of plasma ionization, the shape of disturbance in a far zone can even achieve a spherical form analogous to that in isotropic plasma occurring in the absence of a magnetic field. So, for strong plasma ionization, the profile of plasma disturbance concentration falls exponentially both in close and far zones, as in the case of ordinary diffusion in the absence of a magnetic field. With an increase in the time of the spreading process, G ( x , a ) decreases quickly. Thus, following from the given illustration, for the same values of the function G ( x , a ) for t ¼ 0.1 s are smaller than the analogous values for t ¼ 0.01 s. The concentration of plasma inside the disturbance falls proportionally to t \u0003 3 = 2 . From the analysis presented above it follows that in the far zone for r > ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D a t p the value of d N decreases as r \u0003 5 in longitudinal and transverse directions to B 0 . With an increase of the magnetic field (with altitude of the ionosphere) the asymptotic of d N increases proportionately with B 2 0 . However, for B 0 ! 0 this asymptotic has a tendency to change the law of damping versus r from polynomial to exponential. This law for the nonmagnetized plasma [5,9] can be described as G ( r , t ) ¼ 1 8( p t ) 3 = 2 D 1 = 2 jj D ? exp \u0003 r 2 4 D jj t \u0006\r (5 : 52) as in the case of the usual diffusion for B 0 ¼ 0 described by the ambipolar equations obtained by Schottky [1 – 3]. We have mentioned earlier and now want to reiterate that the changes in asymptotic behavior of d N in the far zone follow from the analytical properties of the Fourier components (harmonics) of d N for k ¼ 0. The components of d N in a singularity k ¼ 0 correspond to the changes of the total number of particles in plasma. The physics of such phenomena can be described by the following mechanism. The character of plasma disturbance d N in the far zone (beyond ellipsoids) is determined not by the ambipolar field but by distribution of the spatial charge of the background plasma, i.e., by short-circuit currents through the background plasma. This is the same result that was found in Refs. [5 – 11] and mentioned earlier when considering weakly ionized plasma in a strong magnetic field. The lifetime of the plasma disturbance t was defined in Refs. [5 – 11] as the time during which the initial concentration of plasma disturbance in its maximum, d N (0,0), decreases in the n times ( n ¼ e , 5, 10, . . . ), i.e., d N (0,0) ¼ n d N (0, t )(5 : 53) Then the lifetime of plasma disturbance can be found by using Equation 5.14 according to the following formula: t t 0 ¼ ð 1 0 D i jj (1 þ T e = T i ) D a ( m 2 ) \u000e\u000f 3 = 2 d m 8 < : 9 = ; 2 = 3 (5 : 54a) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 171 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 171"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Here, t 0 ¼ h n 0 n d N (0,0) i 3 = 2 = 4 D i jj (1 þ T e = T i ) is the lifetime of plasma disturbance in the absence of a magnetic field; the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion D a ( m 2 ) is defined by Equation 5.41 or 5.44, and n 0 is the number of particles in the initial irregularity.

For such altitudes the conditions of plasma magnetization ( q H Q H \u0005 1) are satisfied. With the increase of the degree of plasma ionizations, the time of relaxation of initial plasma disturbance increases, mostly in directions transverse (or close) to the magnetic field. 5.1.4 Diffusion Spreading of Plasma Irregularities in the Middle-Latitude Ionosphere We will now introduce the reader to a physical framework concerning diffusion spreading of various irregularities in the real ionospheric parameters that were used for the middle-latitude ionosphere in the description of moderate solar activity presented in Chapter 1, in accordance with Refs. [16,20], and which the authors usually used in their theoretical and experimental research on the middle-latitude ionosphere. First, we will show the new effects and features of diffusion spreading of plasma irregularities caused by the inhomogeneous ionosphere, the transport param- eters of which, as was shown in Chapter 1, are complicated functions of the ionospheric altitudes. We will then use quasi-homogeneous background ionospheric plasma to show peculiarities in diffusion spreading of strongly elongated irregularities in the middle-latitude ionosphere and will analyze the effects of their initial dimensions on the nature of diffusion spreading. Inhomogeneous Ionosphere . We will deal with an inhomogeneous ionosphere and plasma irregularities with various degree of anisotropy, using rigorous inhomogeneous nonlinear equations of plasma diffusion, which cover both strong ( d N > N 0 ) and weak ( d N < N 0 ) plasma inhomogene- ities and can be obtained from the full system (Equation 1.6) described in Chapter 1, taking into account Equation 1.7. We then examine diffusion spreading of an arbitrary quasi-neutral plasma irregularity with initial concentration d N ( r , t ¼ 0) created in the background ionospheric plasma with density N 0 ( z ), i.e., N ( r , t ) ¼ d N ( r , t ) þ N 0 ( z ). Here, z is the altitude of the real ionosphere, along which parameters of diffusion vary considerably on a scale up to the order of tens of kilometers (see Figure 5.18).

As mentioned previously, for ionospheric irregularities with scales exceeding the characteristic scales of the plasma (the electron and ion mean free paths, l e and l i , along B 0 or their Larmor radii, r He and r Hi , transverse to B 0 ), a system of hydrodynamic equations (Equation 1.6) can be simplified, taking into account conditions of the plasma ’ s quasi-neutrality (Equation 1.9a) and quasi-stationarity ( T e \u0002 T i ¼ T ), as well as of the diffusion ambipolarity (Equation 1.9b): @ N @ t ¼ 1 2 ( r ^ D e ( z ) rþr ^ D i ( z ) r ) N þ 1 2 e ( r ^ \u0002 i ( z ) r\u0003r ^ \u0002 e ( z ) r ) f 1 e ( r ^ \u0002 e ( z ) rþr ^ \u0002 i ( z ) r ) f ¼ ( r ^ D e ( z ) r\u0003r ^ D i ( z ) r ) N (5 : 55) Here f is the potential of the internal self-consistent (ambipolar [2]) electric field d E ¼\u0003r f ; the components of tensors diffusion ^ D a ( z ) and conductivity ^ \u0002 a ( z )( a ¼ e , i ) are now functions of the altitude z .

The boundary conditions to the system (Equation 5.55) are chosen according to commonly accepted physical suggestions, as follows. At the lower boundary, along altitude z , z ¼ z 1 , the plasma density perturbation d N vanishes because of a strong recombination process, discussed in Chapter 1, i.e., d N ( r , z ¼ z 1 , t ) ¼ 0, N ( r , z ¼ z 1 , t ) ¼ N 0 ( z 1 )(5 : 58) At the upper boundary along z , z ¼ z 2 , the charged particle flux is supposed to be constant, since the mean free path of electrons and ions along B 0 increases with altitude, i.e., D a jj @ d N ( r , z , t ) @ z \u0010 \u0010 \u0010 \u0010 z ¼ z 2 ¼ const , a ¼ e , i (5 : 59) In the directions transverse to the field B 0 , when r 1 > D e ? t ðÞ 1 = 2 , the plasma density perturbation d N vanishes, i.e., d N ( r ¼ r 1 , z , t ) ¼ 0, N ( r ¼ r 1 , z , t ) ¼ N 0 ( z )(5 : 60) The introduced boundary conditions with respect to the altitude z correspond to the computations of distributions of the charged particle density in the ionosphere usually used in the modeling of the upper region E and region F of the ionosphere [84 – 86].

[17], the approximate numerical model was also developed instead of Equation 5.55 for the case of diffusion of weak irregularity ( d N \u0004 N 0 , N 0 is the background plasma density) in the unbounded inhomogeneous background ionospheric plasma. According to this model, the density disturbance d N ( r , t ) in the process of spreading of a quasi-neutral irregularity with initial electron density d N ( e ) or ion density d N ( i ) (i.e., d N ( r , t ) ¼ d N ( e ) ¼ d N ( i )) can be represented in a weakly disturbed plasma (the linear case; see earlier text) as a sum of two terms d N ( r , t ) ¼ d N e þ d N i .

The effective coefficient of recombination a ( z ) describing recombination processes usually signifi- cant in the low ionosphere at altitudes h < 160 – 180 km, can be presented according to Refs. [17,20,27] as a ( z ) ¼ a 0 exp \u0003 z \u0003 z 0 0 a \u0006\r (5 : 63) where a ¼ 35, a 0 ¼ 10 \u0003 4 (daytime) and a ¼ 25, a 0 ¼ 2 10 \u0003 4 (nighttime), and z 0 0 ¼ 300 km. In the system Equation 5.55, as well as in Equation 5.62, we have ignored the effect of gravity, which is usually significant in problems concerning the dynamics of the F layer (see, for example, Ref. [8]). This is related, first of all, to the fact that in contrast to problems concerning the formation of the F layer (the one-dimensional case), here, we examine a three-dimensional model following Refs. [17,20]. In the case under consideration, the spreading of the irregularity is determined by vortex (i.e., short-circuit) currents of charged particles through the background plasma (see previous text), for whose formation the transverse diffusion, which largely determines the spreading of the plasma disturbance, is important. Second, in contrast to the problem of the F layer, the spreading of the irregularity is determined by two components, the electronic and ionic. For the electronic component the influence of gravity is insignificant, because for electrons the height of the uniform gas H g \u0002 10 4 km greatly exceeds the height H i \u0002 50 km for ions, and, therefore, also the effective longitudinal diffusion size of the electronic component in the irregu- larity L D jj \u0002 50 \u0003 100 km. We also note that from Equation 5.62, if gravity is included, it follows that the ratio of the magnitude of the diffusion term F D jj to the gravity term F g is around H g = L D jj \u0002 100 \u0003 200; i.e., F D jj greatly exceeds F g . For the ionic component in Equation 5.62, d N i , the principal term is that consisting of the transversal diffusion coefficient. For this reason, the influence of gravity on the ionic component could be significant only in a one-dimensional (1-D) problem. However, as an analysis made in Refs. [17 – 19] shows, the effect of this term is of little consequence even in this case because the effective longitudinal size of the irregularity along B 0 in the one-dimensional case does not actually increase with time and remains smaller than the characteristic size of the F layer. Hence, the effects of gravity can be omitted in the analysis of diffusion spreading of irregularities strongly stretched along B 0 (also called field-aligned irregularities in the literature).

In other words, this coefficient was introduced in Refs. [17,19] to obtain the correct limiting transition in the transverse direction in completely ionized plasma. It was shown in Refs. [17,19] that the approximate solution for weak plasma disturbances of various origin quite accurately describes the diffusion spreading of plasma irregularities over a large period (0 < t < 100 s) and coordinate ( x ¼ r = L i ¼ 10 \u0003 30) intervals. In the following text we will compare the results obtained from an exact solution of the system (Equation 5.55) and from the approximate ones described by the systems (Equation 5.62 or 5.64). As shown in Refs. [17,19], the inhomogeneous nonlinear system (Equation 5.55) as well as the inhomogeneous linear system (Equation 5.64) with initial and boundary conditions (Equations 5.56 through 5.61) cannot be solved by rigorously using well-known analytical methods, because parameters of the nonlinear (or linear) equations are inhomogeneous, when only numerical methods can be used to solve a problem. This was actually done in Refs. [17,19,20] by using the trial-run and variable direction methods, in which the steps in time and space were chosen to justify the stability conditions of the trial-run and variable direction methods (see also Refs. [17,19,20]). Before entering into numerical computations of the problem concerning spreading of both weak (linear case) and strong (nonlinear case) plasma disturbances, because many factors should be taken into account in the inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma, we present simple analytical formulas for the case of spreading of weak disturbances in the quasi-homogeneous background plasma, and compare the results obtained for the inhomogeneous plasma with those obtained analytically for quasi-homogeneous background plasma. Quasi-Homogeneous Ionosphere . At the same time, as also shown in Refs. [18,20], the analytical solution can only be obtained for quasi-homogeneous background ionospheric plasma where changes of transport coefficients of plasma particles (described by Equation 1.12a through c) with altitude are weak enough and can be taken as constant along the longitudinal scales of the initial plasma perturbation. In this case, the approximate 3-D solution can be obtained analytically [18,19]. We now briefly describe this solution, because we will use it in our further description of the processes of relaxation of different natural and artificially induced plasma inhomogeneities (see Chapter 6) and their effects on radio propagation through the ionosphere (see Chapter 7).

The solution of a uniform homogeneous system (Equation 5.65), where all unipolar coefficients of diffusion have constant values, can be presented in the form of the Fourier transformation: d N ( r , t ) ¼ 1 (2 p ) 3 ð d N k (0) exp i kr \u0003 \u0004 D jj k 2 jj þ D ? k 2 ? \u0005 t no d 3 k (5 : 66) where d N k (0) ¼ Ð d N ( r ,0) exp \u0003 i kr fg d r . Accounting for the Gaussian form of the initial profile of concentration d N ( r ,0) of the irregularity (Equation 5.56), we get, following Refs. [18 – 20], the expression of the total profile of plasma disturbance d N ( r , z , t ) ¼ d N 0 Ld 2 d N e ( r , z , t ) þ d N i ( r , z , t ) fg d N e ( r , z , t ) ¼ exp \u0003 z 2 ( L 2 þ L 2 e ) \u0003 r 2 ( d 2 þ d 2 e ) hi ( L 2 þ L 2 e ) 1 = 2 ( d 2 þ d 2 e ) d N i ( r , z , t ) ¼ exp \u0003 z 2 ( L 2 þ L 2 i ) \u0003 r 2 ( d 2 þ d 2 i ) hi ( L 2 þ L 2 i ) 1 = 2 ( d 2 þ d 2 i ) (5 : 67) Here L 2 e ¼ 8 D e jj t , L 2 i ¼ 8 D i jj t , d 2 e ¼ 8 D e ? t , and d 2 i ¼ 8 D i ? t are the characteristic longitudinal and transverse scales of diffusion at time t > t 0 of the initial point irregularity of electrons and ions, respectively. Following on Equation 5.67, we should note that the character of diffusion spreading of initial plasma disturbance d N at time t is very sensitive to the ratio of the initial scales of the irregularity L and d and the characteristic scales L e,i ( t ) and d e,i ( t ).

As a result, the nature of the diffusion of the plasma disturbance changes appreciably from electron-controlled to ion-controlled , and the dependence of the relaxation time t on scales L and d also changes. The latter parameter will be discussed when evolution of the heating- induced inhomogeneities are analyzed in Chapter 6.

Let us compare results of the numerical computation of the system of Equation 5.64, which describes diffusion of weak irregularity in the inhomogeneous ionosphere with the analogous analytical solution (Equation 5.67) obtained from a system (Equation 5.65) for the same irregularity but spreading in the quasi-homogeneous ionosphere without taking into account effects of recombination, which are not so important for the ionospheric heights h > 160 km [18,19]. This is carried out to obtain the effects of plasma density gradients, and transport coefficient altitudinal nonmonotonic dependence on the spreading of a weak anisotropic 3-D plasma irregularity in the middle-latitude ionosphere. In Figure 5.19 the results of the numerical calculations of the system (Equation 5.54) are presented in a form of curves of equal values of the normalized density d N m ¼ d N ( z , r , t ) = d N ( z 0 ,0,0) ¼ ( d N e þ d N i ) = d N ( z 0 ,0,0) in an irregularity at t ¼ 0 s (a), 5 s (b), 40 s (c), and 100 s (d) for the initial irregularity (Equation 5.46) with characteristic scales L ¼ 10 km and d ¼ 10 m, and a maximum d N ( z 0 ,0,0) situated at t ¼ 0 at the altitude of z 0 ¼ 200 km. The curves at t ¼ 5, 40, and 100 s characterize the change in the form of the initial irregularity ( t ¼ 0) as it spreads. The dark points show the location of maximum density at each time of spreading. Numbers 1 and 2 at t ¼ 0 correspond to densities of d N m ¼ 0.132 and 0.0013, with the maximum value d N max ¼ 2. At t ¼ 5s, d N max ¼ 0.21, and numbers 1, 2, and 3 near the curves correspond to d N m ¼ 0.066, 0.007, and 0.005. At t ¼ 40 s, d N max1 ¼ 0.025 (bottom point), d N max2 ¼ 0.022 (top point), and numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 correspond to d N m ¼ 0.02, 0.0175, 0.01, 0.005, and 0.002. At t ¼ 100 s, d N max1 ¼ 0.0081 (bottom point), d N max2 ¼ 0.0082 (top point), andnumbers1,2,3,and4correspondto d N m ¼ 0.0072, 0.002, 0.001, and 0.0005. From Figure 5.19 the following features in the spreading of the irregularity are evident. On the whole, the form of the irregularity remains spindle-shaped, as in homogeneous weakly ionized plasma (see previous subsec- tion), but already ( t < 20 s) a strong asymmetry initially appears in the form of the irregularity along the z -axis (along B 0 ). The initial irregularity during its spreading is compressed from below and is elongated upward in the upper ionosphere. Thus, at t ¼ 5 s its size from the maximum in the direction of increasing z is approximately twice greater than in the opposite direction. This change in the form of the irregularity is related to the intensification of diffusion along B 0 with increasing z but first to the increase of D e jj with altitude (see Figure 5.18). In addition, there is a small (by several km) displacement of the maximum of the irregularity upward. Later, at t ¼ 20 – 40 s, a characteristic change is observed in the form of the irregularity. Thus, at an altitude z ¼ z max2 ,whosevalueis20 – 30 km greater than the altitude of the first maximum z ¼ z max1 , a second maximum in the density appears. Finally, in the course of spreading, the irregularity is split into two plasmoids. At the same time the second maximum moves upward with a velocity increasing with time, as does the irregularity as a whole plasma structure. Thus, at t ¼ 40 s, the velocity of the second maximum upwards is about 1 km = s, whereas at t ¼ 100 s the velocity equals 2.2 km = s. The velocity of the first maximum upward is lower, on the average being about 80 m = s. The second maximum decays with time more slowly than the first. This follows from Figure 5.20, which shows the change in density at the first maximum (denoted by 1) and at the second maximum after its generation at t ¼ 20 s (denoted by 2) as a function of time on the logarithmic scale. It is evident that the rate of spreading of the first maximum is proportional to t \u0003 3 = 2 , which corresponds to a velocity of spreading at the maximum of the plasma disturbance in a homogeneous weakly ionized plasma in a magnetic field described in the previous subsection. The rate of spreading of the second maximum is proportional to t \u0003 1 , i.e., much slower. As a result, with time the density in the second maximum becomes equal to or even greater than the density in the first maximum (see, for example, the case t ¼ 100 s). Additional analysis of the solutions of the system (Equation 5.64) with a different dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the height z showed that the appearance of the second maximum is related to the nonmonotonic dependence of altitude of the coefficients of transverse diffusion D e ? , D i ? , and primarily, of the coefficient D e ? , i.e., to the nonmonotonic variation of the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 179 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 179"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"z , km 300 z , km 250 1 250 21 2 3 200 r , m r , m 40 120 20 40 60 150 150 (a) (b) (c) (d) z , km z , km 400 450 400 350 350 300 300 250 1 2 250 1 32 3 r , m r , m 4 150 4 150 5 100 100 180 180 180 60 60 60 80 80 80 60 60 60 40 40 40 20 20 20 Figure 5.19 Temporal presentation of a shape of small plasma disturbance according to the model of middle-latitude ionosphere.

When the monotonic dependences D e ? ( z ), D i ? ( z ) are given, the second maximum is not formed in the same way as in a homogeneous plasma. However, in this case, the first maximum moves upward with a velocity exceeding several times the velocity under conditions examined here, and its rate of spreading is proportional t \u0003 1 . What is important to note here is that by introducing additional artificial extrema in the altitudinal dependence of unipolar coefficients, made in Ref. [19], compared to that shown in Figure 5.18, primarily for D e ? ( z )and D i ? ( z ), leads to the creation in time ( t > 30 – 40 s) of the third and more maxima d N max , as with the second maximum, floating up along B 0 ,i.e.,upward.Inthissense we should emphasize that in the case of the polar or equatorial ionosphere, with more complicated nonmonotonic altitudinal dependence of the coefficients of diffusion than that presented in Figure 5.18, we may wait splitting of the initial irregularity in a set of plasmoids elongated along B 0 and penetrating into the upper ionosphere. This will be shown, for example, in Chapter 6 in the context of evolution of the equatorial natural plasma structures called bubbles, and their floating-up penetration from lower to upper ionosphere was observed experimentally. To ensure that the obtained effects are the pure effects of plasma inhomogeneity along altitude z , in Figure 5.19 at t ¼ 40 s, we represent with dashed lines the form of the spreading of the irregularity in the unbounded homogeneous plasma, i.e., for D (200) ¼ const computed using Equation 5.67, which correspond to solid curves computed by using the system of Equation 5.64. Here, D (200) is the value of the transverse and longitudinal components of the diffusion tensor of electrons and ions at the altitude z ¼ 200 km in the ionosphere. Comparing the dashed and continuous curves in Figure 5.19 at t ¼ 40 s (Figure 5.19c), we see that the spreading of the weak irregularity with the degree of anisotropy x ¼ 10 4 m = 10 m ¼ 10 3 in an inhomogeneous ionosphere differs considerably from the spreading of this irregularity in the model of a homoge- neous ionospheric plasma. In homogeneous ionospheric plasma the spreading of the irregularity both along and across B 0 is symmetrical relative to the center of the irregularity and has a spindle- shaped form, as in the case of the weakly ionized plasma in the magnetic field described in d N ( z 0 ,0, t )/ d N ( z 0 ,0,0) 10 0 z 0 = 200 km 1 10 \u0001 1 t \u0001 1 t \u0001 3/2 2 10 \u0001 2 10 \u0001 3 1 5 10 20 50 100 t , s Figure 5.20 Temporal decay of the first (1) and the second (2) maximum of plasma density in the model of weakly ionized plasma (dashed lines) and according to the model of middle-latitude ionosphere (solid curves).

The additional features, such as the displacement and splitting of the maximum of the irregularity, do not occur. At the same time, in an inhomogeneous plasma, because of the dependence of the rate of diffusion on altitude z , the speed of spreading along and across B 0 at different altitudes changes considerably, which affects the change in its form (compare the same curves in Figure 5.19c, t ¼ 40 s). Thus, for z < 200 km, the size of the irregularity along B 0 in an inhomogeneous plasma ( L in jj ) is less than that in a homogeneous plasma ( L ho jj ) (compare curves 1, 2, 4, and 5). At z > 200 km, L in jj is likewise less, but at higher altitudes the difference in the dimensions vanishes, and for t ¼ 40 s with z \t 400 km L in jj exceeds L ho jj . As the time for the spreading process increases, this effect occurs at lower altitudes. Thus, at t ¼ 60 s L in jj > L ho jj for z \t 350 km; at t ¼ 100 s L in jj > L ho jj for z \t 280 km. The change in an inhomogeneous plasma of the quantity L in jj can be explained by the nonmonotonic nature of the increase in the magnitude of the unipolar coefficient D e jj with altitude in the ionosphere (see Figure 5.18), which primarily determines the size of the irregularity along B 0 . Thus, at z < 200 km D e jj ( z ) < D e jj ( z 0 ), z 0 ¼ 200 km, and at z > 200 km D e jj ( z ) exceeds D e jj ( z 0 ) insignificantly. Across B 0 with z ¼ z 0 in the close zone ( r \u0001 d ) in an inhomogeneous plasma the transverse scale L in ? of the irregularity is likewise less than the corresponding size in the homogeneous plasma L ho ? (curves 1, 2), whereas in the far zone ( r > d ) it is greater (curves 4 and 5). This fact is also explained well by the nonmonotonic nature of the unipolar coefficient D i ? ,asa function of z (see Figure 5.18), which primarily determines the rate of spreading of strongly elongated irregularity across B 0 [16 – 20]. Thus, for z > 200 km D i ? ( z ) < D i ? ( z 0 ), for 130 km < z < 200 km D i ? ( z ) > D i ? ( z 0 ), and for z < 130 km once again D i ? ( z ) < D i ? ( z 0 ). An additional analysis of the character of spreading of the first maximum d N max1 ( z ¼ z 0 , r ¼ 0), depending on time t of diffusion spreading, made in Ref. [19], has shown that it depends on the degree of anisotropy of the initial irregularity, or for the constant longitudinal scale L ¼ const on the transverse scale d of the irregularity, as well as on the time of the process of spreading by itself. It is evident from Figure 5.20, where in the logarithmic scale the dependence of d N max1 ( z ¼ z 0 ,0, t ) on t for L ¼ 10 km and z 0 ¼ 200 km is shown for different d ¼ 1, 10, and 100 m. Here, solid lines correspond to the spreading of the irregularity in the inhomogeneous background plasma with D ¼ D ( z ) according to Figure 5.18, and the dashed lines correspond to the case of the homoge- neous background plasma with D ¼ D ( z 0 ¼ 200 km) ¼ const . The dotted-dashed lines correspond to changes of the value d N max1 ( z ¼ z 0 ,0, t ) / t \u0003 1 = 2 \u0003 t \u0003 3 = 2 . The case d ¼1 corresponds to a one- dimensional diffusion of the infinitely stretched across B 0 irregularity analyzed in Ref. [19]. It is evident that with the decrease of the scale d or with increase of the time of spreading t , the law of decay of the initial irregularity changes from t \u0003 1 = 2 to t \u0003 3 = 2 . Moreover, the altitudinal inhomogen- eity of the background ionospheric plasma does not play a sufficient role in the rate of spreading of the first maximum, nor of the whole irregularity for d \t 100 m and x ¼ L = d \u0001 10 2 . Its influence becomes vital for d \u0001 10 m, and for small d the decay of d N max in the irregular inhomogeneous plasma where D ¼ D ( z ) accelerates faster compared to the case of homogeneous plasma when D ¼ D ( z 0 ¼ 200 km) and at large t we get d N max \b t \u0003 2 (compare solid and dashed lines for d ¼ 1 m and t \t 40 s). Again, it is evident that the altitudinal inhomogeneity of the ionospheric plasma significantly influences the character of diffusion spreading of the irregularities strongly stretched along B 0 with a degree of anisotropy greater than x ¼ L = d ¼ 10 2 . The features of diffusion spreading of the irregularity with a sufficient degree of anisotropy in the inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma obtaine d during numerical computations can also prove the existence of plasma instabilities associated with gradients of plasma density and with non- monotonic altitudinal dependence of coefficients of unipolar diffusion of electrons and ions of plasma, which generate plasma disturbances and split them into two plasmoids.

A numerical analysis carried out in Refs. [17 – 19] has shown that the effects of recombination are insignificant at altitudes greater than 160 km, and they should only be taken into account at altitudes of the lower ionosphere less than 160 km, where the rate of decay of the irregularity increases when compared to the higher ionosphere ( z > 160 – 200 km) and only affects the electronic component of plasma irregularity d N e . This finally leads to the displacement upward along B 0 of the maximum of the electron component of the irregularity. The influence of the recombination on the ion component of the plasma irregularity d N i is weaker, and the maximum of the ion component of the irregularity does not change its position in space [19]. The total profile of irregularity concentration, d N ¼ d N e þ d N i , shows the same behavior. This allows the conclusion that the main contribution of recom- bination is observed below 160 – 200 km, where the fast decay of d N is usually observed, whereas in the upper ionosphere ( z > 200 km) the influence of the recombination on the character of the spreading of the irregularity is insignificant. Following the results obtained in Refs. [7 – 20], we will now consider the dependence of the character of irregularity spreading from its initial dimensions L (along B 0 ) and d (across B 0 ). The analysis of Equation 5.64, without taking into account the effects of recombination for the initial irregularity placed at the height of z 0 ¼ 200 km for different parameters L and d , is shown in Figure 5.21 in the form of the dependence of d N ( z ,0, t 0 ¼ 20 s) from the coordinate z (i.e., along B 0 ).

We denote by circles the maxima at the normalized curves d N ( z ,0, t 0 ¼ 20 s) = d N ( z 0 ,0,0). It can be seen that at time t 0 ¼ 20 s after the process of diffusion spreading commenced, the initial plasma irregularity splits onto two plasmoids for the case of L ¼ 1 km and d ¼ 4 and 10 m, whereas for the same degree of anisotropy but for the larger (by several times and more) transverse dimensions d ¼ 20, 40, and 100 m ( L ¼ 10 km) the effect of splitting has not been observed. The dependence of the rate of spreading of the irregularities elongated along B 0 on the initial dimensions will be investigated further by using the approximate analytical expressions of Equation 5.67 following the corresponding model described by Equation 5.64 or 5.65. In this sense we need to understand how strictly this approximate model describes the process of diffusion spreading of irregularities with finite dimensions both along and across the magnetic field. Therefore, we will now compare both the strict model described by nonlinear inhomogeneous equations (Equation 5.55) and the approximate model described by Equation 5.64 without taking into account the effects of recombination (to have the comparable solutions during numerical computations, as was done in Refs. [18 – 20]). The main results of the numerical simulations of the nonlinear inhomogeneous system (Equation 5.55) consisting both of the plasma disturbance density and the normalized potential of the self-consistent intrinsic electric field taking into account initial and boundary conditions are presented in Figures 5.22a through c and Figure 5.23a and b, according to Ref. [20]. In the case of weak plasma disturbance, d N \u0004 N 0 , for the time of the spreading process T, the values of the total concentration N were close to N 0 . This case was investigated for the purpose of comparing the results of the strict model (Equation 5.55) with those of the approximate model (Equation 5.64), which is valid only for the weak plasma perturbations (i.e., for the linear case). The solutions are presented in the form of lines of normalized equal density d N m ¼ d N ( z , r , t ) = d N (0,0,0) and the additional normalized equal potential d F m ¼ ( F ( z , r , t ) \u0003 F 0 ) = F 0 (compared with the case of the numerical solution of the approximate model [Equation 5.54] at the moments (a) t ¼ 5 s, (b) 20 s, and (c) 40 s, results of which are shown in Figure 5.19). The initial irregularity according to Equation 5.46 has the characteristic scales L ¼ 10 km and d ¼ 5 m and a maximum situated for t ¼ 0 at the altitude z ¼ 200 km. As in Figure 5.19, the curves at 5, 20, and 40 s in Figure 5.22 characterize the changes in the form of the initial irregularity as it spreads (the left- hand figures), and also the corresponding changes of equipotential lines in each case (the right-hand figures).

As seen from numerical results illustrated in Figure 5.22a through c, the rigorous approach based on general nonlinear system of inhomogeneous equations of plasma diffusion (Equation 5.55) gives the same new effects (in comparison with the case of a homogeneous plasma) that were observed earlier in Figure 5.19 by using the approximate system of inhomogeneous equations (Equation 5.64). These are the changes in the spindle-shape form of the irregularity (Figure 5.22a), a splitting of the irregularity into two plasmoids (corresponding to the model of the middle-latitude ionosphere presented in Figure 5.18) in the course of spreading at time t \t 20 s, and a floating-up penetration into the upper ionosphere, where the irregularity is compressed from the bottom side and elongated upward (Figure 5.22b and c). However, using the strict model of Equation 5.55, we can investigate the characteristic peculiarities of the spreading of an irregularity in more detail by examining the equipotential lines of the ambipolar electric field inside the disturbed areas. In fact, the curves of surfaces of normalized equal potential depicted at the right side of Figure 5.22 illustrate vividly the physical picture of a spreading process. Thus, at the initial moments (when t < 20 s) for a very stretched irregularity, the ions diffuse across B 0 (in the direction of the r -axis) and form areas of positive potential. At the same time, the character of irregularity spreading along B 0 (along the z -axis) is determined by the velocity of electron diffusion, which forms areas of negative potential near the maximum of the irregularity (see Figure 5.22). Later, when t > 20 s, the areas of positive potential expand both along and across B 0 , and larger areas of disturbed plasma are controlled by ions, determining the character and velocity of the irregularity decay in these areas. Along the z -axis and for r < 20 m, the character of irregularity spreading is controlled by electrons. In Refs. [17,18] it was shown that if the transverse scale of the irregularity exceeds the Larmor ion radius r Hi at the considered ionospheric altitudes, then the process of diffusion fundamentally changes its nature.

It can be seen that the character of irregularity decay in the maximum and across B 0 (along the r -axis) in the areas z ¼ 180 – 220 km is determined by ions, whereas in the areas z > 220 km and z < 180 km and near this direction, the diffusion spreading is determined by electrons. Moreover, for the weakly anisotropic irregularities (with x \u0001 10 2 ), a number of new effects, namely, a change in the shape of the irregularity, a splitting of the irregularity into plasmoids, and a floating-up penetration into the upper ionosphere were not obtained. This allows us to point out that using the rigorous self-consistent model, we finally unify the problem of diffusion spreading of different kinds of plasma irregularities in the real ionosphere, from the polar cap to the equator, by introducing the real nonmonotonic altitudinal dependence of the transport coefficients of the electron and ion components of plasma obtained for each region. At the same time, the approximate model presented by Equations 5.65 through 5.69, which is valid up to several tens seconds during the process of generation of plasma disturbance (dependent on its degree of anisotropy [17- – 20]), will allow to obtain simple analytical solutions that have a vivid physical meaning and can directly explain some features observed in systematic ionospheric experiments described in Chapters 6 and 7. Relaxation of Field Aligned Irregularities . We now return to the solution of the linear problem (Equation 5.65) of relaxation of the strongly stretched along the z -axis (along B 0 ) weak ( d N \u0004 N 0 ) irregularities in the unbounded quasi-homogeneous ionospheric plasma. The process of spreading of such irregularities according to the analysis carried out in Refs. [17 – 20] is described by Equation 5.67 as a solution to the linear problem of diffusion (Equation 5.65). In deriving Equation 5.67, it was assumed in Refs. [18 and 20] that at initial time t ¼ t 0 ¼ d 2 = 8 D i ? (for isothermic plasma, T e \u0002 T i ¼ T ), the density of quasi-neutral particles in the irregularity d N ( z , r , t 0 ) consists of two equal parts, i.e., d N ( z , r , t 0 ) ¼ d N e ( t 0 ) þ d N i ( t 0 ) ¼ 2 d N 0 e \u0003 z 2 L 2 \u0003 r 2 d 2 (5 : 70) One part of d N e is electronic, which spreads out with the diffusion velocity of electrons (the ions in the irregularity adjust themselves to it according to the Boltzmann law). The second part of d N i is the ionic component, which spreads out with the velocity of diffusion of ions (the electrons adjust themselves to the irregularity according to the Boltzmann law). The spreading of particles in the two simple one- dimensional (1-D) cases made in Refs. [16,18] using approximate linear model are the following: (a1) Diffusion along B 0 ; the irregularity is of infinite size across B 0 , L \u0004 d !1 . (a2) Diffusion across B 0 ; the irregularity is of infinite size along B 0 , d \u0004 L !1 . According to the constraint Equation 5.68, the electronic component spreads out more rapidly along B 0 and the ionic component more rapidly across B 0 . As with the result in the 1-D case (a1), the irregularity spreads out along B 0 (or along the z -axis) with the velocity of the ions, as is depicted in the upper part of Figure 5.24a. Such cases are characterized for diffusion of the F spread in the ionosphere for which L \u0004 d (see Chapter 6). In the 1-D case (a2), sketched in the bottom part of Figure 5.24a, the irregularity spreads out across B 0 (along r -axis) with the velocity of the electrons.

The presence and magnitude of the diffusion flows both along and across the irregularity in each specific case is now important. It was shown in Ref. [18] that depending on the magnitude of the transverse size d of the irregularity, in the 3-D case the character of diffusion spreading changes not only across B 0 but also along B 0 . The change in the nature of the diffusion accompanying an increase in the transverse size of the irregularity d is shown schematically in Figure 5.24b for small d , and in Figure 5.24c for large d based on an analysis of the relations (Equation 5.66) and Equation 5.68. It is evident that because of the spreading of the irregularity across B 0 (along r -axis), the velocity of diffusion changes at the center of the irregularity and at altitudes close to the maximum. For example, at the level d N max e \u0003 1 determining the effective dimensions of the irregularity along B 0 , L eff ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi L 2 þ L 2 e p , and across B 0 , d eff ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi d 2 þ d 2 i p . For small d ( d < d 1 , the value d 1 will be defined later) the ionic component d N i of the irregularity has time to diffuse a long distance across B 0 within a short time interval, since D i ? \u0005 D e ? . As a result of this, the ion density in the center of the irregularity essentially drops. The characteristic size of the irregularity along and across B 0 is in this case determined by the electronic component d N e ,asshown schematically in Figure 5.24b. For large d ( d > d 2 , the value d 2 will be defined later) there is not enough time for the ionic component in the irregularity to spread out across B 0 and therefore the effective size of the irregularity and the velocity at which it spreads are determined by the ionic component d N i ,as shown schematically in Figure 5.24c. Hence, as the transverse size of the irregularity d increases, the electronic character of the diffusion along and across B 0 (Figure 5.24b) changes into the ionic character (Figure 5.24c). We note that the schemes in Figure 5.24 correspond to estimations made for specific parameters of the upper middle-latitude ionosphere at z 0 ¼ 200 km. We will now analyze the relaxation time (or the lifetime) t of the weak irregularity defined by the constraint Equation 5.53 in the quasi-homogeneous ionospheric plasma based on the main equations (Equation 5.69) depending on initial dimensions of the irregularity both along L and across d the ambient magnetic field B 0 .

For small d ( d < d 1 ) t ( d ) \b d 4 = 3 \u0003 d 2 , i.e., relaxation time increases rapidly with d . For moderate d ( d 1 < d < d 2 ) t ( d ) \b d 1 = 2 \u0003 d , and for large d ( d > d 2 ) t is actually independent, i.e., the irregularity spreads out as if it is one-dimensional with the velocity of diffusion of ions along B 0 (see Equations 5.71c and 5.69, VII). Thus, the change in the nature of the dependence of t ¼ t ( d ) for small and large d is linked to the change in the decay law of the density at the center of the irregularity, which is evident from Equation 5.69: from the electron character along and across B 0 when d < d 1 to the ion character when d > d 1 . On the transverse scale d ¼ d 2 , saturation of the spreading process occurs and the relaxation time becomes independent of the transverse size. The character of the decay of the irregularity with d \t d 2 is analogous to the case of stretched-out geomagnetic field irregularities, which are actually observed in the middle-latitude F layer (see Chapter 6). Following Refs. [18,20], we can now estimate the critical values of transversal scales d 1 and d 2 at which the character of relaxation of the irregularity changes. Using Equation 5.71a through c and real parameters of the middle-latitude ionosphere at altitude z ¼ 200 km, we get d 1 \u0002 10 \u0003 20 m and d 2 \u0002 100 \u0003 150 m for the daytime ionosphere; and d 1 \u0002 3 \u0003 5 m and d 2 \u0002 100 \u0003 120 m for the nocturnal ionosphere, results that fully coincide with the dependences t ¼ t ( d ) shown in Figure 5.25. These estimated values, of course, depend on the altitude of initial irregularity.

Therefore, the results obtained in the previous section are correct for a description of the process of evolution of plasma irregularities in the ionosphere for which the lifetime is shorter than the characteristic time of switching of the drift mechanism through the background ionospheric plasma. Following the numerous theoretical and experimental investigations [6,7,21 – 37,87 – 94] carried out for weakly anisotropic large-scale plasma irregularities, such as barium clouds, bubbles, or meteor trails, we have to include both gravity and drift effects and use rigorous theories created both for small- and large-scale plasma disturbances [6,7,89 – 94], which were then modified in Refs. [49,72,74,81,87,88] for the case of real plasma anisotropic irregularities with various degrees of ionization (compared to background plasma) generated in the ionosphere by different natural and artificial sources. It was shown [6,89 – 94] that in the presence of ambient electric E 0 and magnetic B 0 fields in the unbounded weakly ionized plasma, the character of plasma disturbance spreading changes greatly compared to the case of diffusion spreading without taking ambient fields into account. Thus, the initial plasma inhomogeneity splits during its movements and spreads into separate plasma structures, caused by the wind of neutral molecules (atoms) and drift of plasma in ambient electrical and magnetic fields and called the plasmoids or strata in the literature [48 – 51]. These are stretched along magnetic field lines and attenuate more quickly than when only the diffusion process occurs [41,48,49,70,71]. This new mechanism of spreading and attenuation of plasma disturbances in real time was called a drift mechanism [6,87 – 94]. In Ref. [6] it was consistently analyzed, and then modified in Refs. [87,88,92,94] for real ionospheric conditions, the character of drift spreading of plasma inhomogeneity, its velocity, and the time of relaxation (e.g., the lifetime). It was shown that the phenomenon depends significantly not only on the value and character of the drift of the electron and ion components of plasma (as rigorously shown in Refs. [6,89]), but also on the initial size of the inhomogeneity and its degree of anisotropy x ¼ L = d in the ambient magnetic field B 0 , as well as on the value of the initial density of plasma disturbance and on the altitude of the inhomogeneity d N ( h \u0006 z 0 ) with respect to the background ionospheric plasma N 0 ( h ). Here, as before, L and d are the longitudinal and transverse to B 0 scales of inhomogeneity. Moreover, theoretical and experimental investigations carried out by separate groups of researchers [58 – 69], describing evolution of artificially injected ion clouds in the ionosphere, have shown that such splitting of initial plasma disturbance on several plasma plasmoids occurred in the first stage of drift spreading. In the next stage, each plasmoid splits into elementary strata and, finally, a cluster of these plasma strata is created in the front edge of the initial plasma irregularity (relative to the direction of the E 0 \u000b B 0 -drift), each of which is stretched out along the geomagnetic field lines. Unfortunately, during recent decades, only a few realistic numerical models were performed describing the dynamics of strong large-scale plasma disturbances (in comparison with the Debye radius) in the real ionosphere [49,73,74,88], and despite their accuracy, these models described only the initial stage of the evolution of isotropic and weakly anisotropic inhomogeneities embedded into the infinite homogeneous background plasma, but did not explain the more interesting later stages of their evolution, where complicated pictures of plasma striation and cluster strata structures creation were observed. On the other hand, some numerical models were performed to study the process of drift spreading of plasma inhomogeneities with an arbitrary initial form in the upper ionosphere, taking into account both the influence of recombination observed at the lower E layer, and mutual coupling and interaction of layers E and F [58 – 63].

As a result, the striation process was observed at the back edge of the initial inhomogeneity (also relative to the direction of the E 0 \u000b B 0 - drift). These models were too idealized to be compared to the real active space experiments with rocket injection of ion clouds and beams. At the same time, further performed numerical models [60 – 65,94 – 96] gained criteria of drift instability, which is generated by the gradient-drift instability (GDI) causing plasma splitting at the several plasmoids. In Chapter 2 we discussed the main aspects of GDI and showed to what degree of anisotropy of the initial plasma structure (called stretched or field-aligned irregularities (FAI)), the criteria of drift instability (and, conversely, drift stabilization ), theoretically obtained in Refs. [49,64 – 66,73,74], are valid. Our aim is to present the reader with the main formulations, functions, and parameters of the problem concerning the drift process of a wide spectrum of ionospheric irregularities independent of the origin of their creation, naturally or artificially, which will then be analysed in more detail in Chapter 6, which describes modern radio and optical methods of study of their spatial and temporal evolution. 5.2.1 A Classical Description of Drift in Unbounded Homogeneous Plasma In the unbounded homogeneous plasma each disturbance of plasma density occurring in real time moves with the velocity of drift of electrons V e 0 and ions V i 0 , if they are equal. However, in plasma in the presence of the homogeneous magnetic ( B 0 ), electric ( E 0 ), and gravitational ( g ) fields, electrons and ions of plasma drift along and across B 0 with different velocities: V e 0 ¼ U m \u0003 ^ s e eN e E 0 þ 1 c U m \u000b B 0 \u0003 m e g e \u0006\r V i 0 ¼ U m þ ^ s i eN i E 0 þ 1 c U m \u000b B 0 þ M i g e \u0006\r (5 : 72) Here, as in previous chapters, we consider ions of unit charge, where a charge equals the electron charge, i.e., q ¼ Ze \u0006 e , but with different masses, M i = m e / 10 3 ; ^ s e and ^ s i are the tensors of conductivity of electrons and ions defined in Chapter 1. As a result of this difference in velocities, the charged particles try to separate and the inner (ambipolar) electric field occurs (as in the case of pure diffusion process), which slows the fast particles and accelerates the slow ones in the corresponding directions to the magnetic field. Finally, because of the influence of the ambipolar field, the initial plasma disturbance moves with the intermediate velocity V a called the ambipolar drift velocity , and the concentration of the electrons and ions inside this disturbance is always equal; i.e., the quasi-neutrality of plasma ( N e \u0002 N i ¼ N ) occurs. The ambipolar field leads to the spreading of the initial plasma disturbance. The difference between the case of the absence of ambient- sources-caused drift and the case of drift occurrence in plasma is that the plasma perturbation with the wave vector k not only attenuates because of diffusion, but also propagates in space with the frequency v according to the law of dispersion v ¼ k V a ( m 2 ) \u0003 iD a ( m 2 ) k 2 (5 : 73) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 194 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan 194 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The phase velocity V a of the plasma perturbation (i.e., the wave of plasma density) depends on the angle b between the vectors k and B 0 , introduced in the previous section ( m ¼ cos b ¼ k B 0 = kB 0 ): V a ( m 2 ) ¼ [ D e jj m 2 þ D e ?

The coefficient of ambipolar diffusion D a ( m 2 ) was presented in the previous section both for weakly (Equation 5.11) and strongly (Equation 5.31) ionized plasma. From Equation 5.74 it follows that the different modes (e.g., Fourier harmonics) of plasma disturbance spread with different velocities. This leads to a general spreading of plasma disturbance, analogous to wave packet propagation in the dispersive medium [6,11,89] with the group velocity V gr ¼ @ @ k ( k V a ( k )) (5 : 75) and its decay due to diffusion with the coefficient D a ( m 2 ). Both velocities, V a and V gr , are functions of m ¼ cos b ; therefore, they are not defined for the case k ¼ 0. As a result, the disturbance of the total number of plasma particles, corresponding to the harmonics d N k with k ¼ 0, has a different behavior compared with that described in the previous section for a pure diffusion, i.e., in the case of the absence of plasma drift. Drift in Weakly Ionized Plasma . It was found in the previous section that the existence of the weak plasma disturbance, d N < N 0 , in the unbounded weakly ionized plasma leads to the flow of short-circuit currents through the background plasma with the creation of depletion zones in it. With the increase of plasma disturbance d N (compared to the background plasma N 0 ), more background particles participate in the forming of such currents — the depletion zones become broad and deep (up to zero). The existence of the drift process leads to a more complicated picture of spreading [6,11,89 – 91]. At the beginning stage of its evolution the plasma disturbance spreads as in the case of the absence of the drift process, and the picture of spreading is the same as was discussed in the previous section. However, because of the dependence of V a and V gr on the direction of spreading (i.e., on m ¼ cos b ), according to Equations 5.73 and 5.75, the dispersion mechanism of plasma density spreading becomes predominant. This mechanisms lead to new qualitative effects of splitting of the initial quasi-neutral plasma disturbance into three moving plasmoids, each of which has its own orientation to the magnetic field, and higher speed of decay compared to the case of V a ¼ 0 (absence of drift process). The plasma disturbance d N is maximal along a curve defined by the equation r m ¼ V a m 2 m \u0004\u0005 t (5 : 76) and therefore is called the curve of extrema . Here, the parameter m 2 m changes from zero to unit. In the absence of collisions between charged particles ( n ei \u0004 n im \u0004 n em ), this curve is transformed into a straight line (with the accuracy of the terms of the order D e ? = D i ? \u0004 1 and D i jj = D e jj \u0004 1). During the process of spreading the curve of extrema (Equation 5.76) moves in the space, conserving its shape, as it is shown from Figure 5.27. In this figure, the curve (Equation 5.76) is presented for three moments of time t 1 < t 2 < t 3 in the case where E ?

Correspondingly, the maximal value of the plasma density disturbance d N m ( r , t ) has to be decreased. Hence, the dispersion of drift velocity V a (i.e., its dependence on k ) leads to the spreading of the plasma disturbance and to the generation of three plasmoids around the points (see Figure 5.28) [ E , B ] [ U m , B ] t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 3 r m 1 r m 1 r m 2 r m 2 r m 3 t = 0 (a) (b) [ B ,[ E , B ]] t = 0 U m Figure 5.27 Spread of curve of (a) maxima.

The number of particles in each of the plasmoids is of the order of the total number of particles n 0 in the initial plasma disturbance. The projection of the curve of extrema (Equation 5.76) at the plane ( E , B 0 ) is the segment [AB] shown schematically in Figure 5.29. Here, the angle d is related to the electric field by the expression tan d ¼ m 2 m E ? = E jj \u0004\u0005 . When E ? ¼ 0, E jj 6¼ 0, the mean plasmoid C coincides with point A , and when E jj ¼ 0, E ? 6¼ 0, it coincides with the point B .

The position of plasmoid C corresponds to reaching of the surface of group velocity V gr ( m 2 ) according to Equation 5.75 to the straight line of extrema (Equation 5.76). Between plasmoids A and C , the plasma disturbance d N m ( r , t ) is positive at the line r m ( t ) (Equation 5.76), but between plasmoids B and C it is negative (see Figure 5.28). In the particular case of E ? B 0 plasmoid C coincides with the ionic plasmoid B , and for the case E jj B 0 , it coincides with the electronic plasmoid A . The concentration in the electronic plasmoid is [6,89,90] d N m V a m 2 m ¼ 0 \u0004\u0005 t , t \u0004\u0005 ¼ n 0 G 3 (5 = 4) D 5 = 4 e ?

This plasmoid is elongated along the magnetic field B 0 with the corresponding scale ‘ jj ¼ ( D e jj E ? t ) 1 = 2 ( D e ? t ) 1 = 4 . Its transverse scale is determined by electron diffusion, i.e., ‘ ? \b ( D e ? t ) 1 = 2 . The plasma density inside this plasmoid attenuates as t \u0003 7 = 4 and the corresponding disturbance of the potential of ambipolar field is negative and decays in time as \b t \u0003 5 = 4 . Because the concentration at the curve of extrema falls as \b t \u0003 2 [6,89,90], we can see that the first plasmoid spreads more slowly than the plasma disturbance located at the curve of extrema. The same tendency was obtained for the ionic plasmoid B [6,89,90]. Here, the concentration inside it equals d N m V a m 2 m ¼ 1 \u0004\u0005 t , t \u0004\u0005 ¼ n 0 16 ffiffiffi 2 p p 3 = 2 D i ?

The concentration in the plasmoid B decreases as \b t \u0003 5 = 2 , which is slower than at the curve of extrema ( \b t \u0003 2 ). The disturbance of the potential in this point is positive and decays as \b t \u0003 5 = 2 . From comparison of the expressions for the plasma concentration in the maximum and accounting for the characteristic scales, it can be found that the number of particles in each plasmoid for these two limited cases corresponds to the total number of particles in the initial disturbance of plasma density n 0 . Both these limiting cases are presented in Figures 5.30 and 5.31, respectively, based on the numerical analysis carried out in Ref. [6] for the case E ? B 0 and in Ref. [89] for the case E jj B 0 . Following Ref. [6], we point out that the main features occur in the case E ? B 0 during drift spreading in the plane XOY (for z jj B 0 ).

The curves in Figure 5.30a are performed for the time t 1 ¼ 2 D i jj = U 2 m , and in Figure 5.30b for t 2 ¼ 20 D i jj = U 2 m , where again U m is the velocity of the neutral wind in plasma. In the computations, the magnetized plasma was considered, taking q H ¼ 50 and Q H ¼ 0.5 (i.e., q H Q H ¼ 25 \u0005 1). It is evident that for t < t 1 the shape of the plasma disturbance is symmetric and determined by a pure diffusion process. At the moment t ¼ t 1 the drift begins to influence the spreading process and the shape of the disturbance differs from an ellipsoidal form (here the curves describing a pure diffusion are presented by dashed lines in Figure 5.30a). For t > t 1 the form of the disturbance is deformed owing to drift process and is now defined by the dispersion mechanisms of spreading. The initial disturbance splits into two plasmoids, the first moving in the direction of the vector U m with comparably small velocity V a (0) \u0004 U m . The second plasmoid moves with the velocity V a (1), which is more of the order higher than the velocity of the first plasmoid in the directions between U m and U m \u000b B 0 . However, the concentration in the second plasmoid decays with time slower than in the first one, and the transfer of particles from the first plasmoid to the second is observed. During the definite time the concentration in both plasmoids becomes equal. The first plasmoid is strongly stretched along B 0 , and the second is in the plane orthogonal to B 0 . The electric field created by these plasmoids is close to the dipole with potential F \b r \u0003 2 . Therefore, the asymptote of the plasma disturbance in the far zone ( r \u0005 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4 D a t p ) is proportional to t = r 4 and caused by the redistribution of the background particles under the control of the disturbed electric field (i.e., by short-circuit currents through the background plasma). The first plasmoids were denoted as electronic, and the second as ionic. However, as we will see in Chapter 6, the speeds and dimensions of these plasmoids do not coincide with real sizes and speeds of the injected electrons and ions in real ionospheric experiments. Introduction of definitions of electron and ion plasmoids in Refs. [6,89,90] was made to simplify a physical picture of the process of spreading, without distortion of the condition of plasma quasi-neutrality. The above approach was proposed in Refs.

The time ~ t in figures was chosen in units 8 D i jj ( D e jj E jj ) 2 and the concentration normalized to the initial concentration d N d (0, t ) defined by Equation 5.14 for a pure diffusion process; the distance is presented in units 24 D i jj D e jj E jj . Lines of equal concentration correspond to the relative time ~ t ¼ 9 (Figure 5.31a), ~ t ¼ 100 (Figure 5.31b), ~ t ¼ 900 (Figure 5.31c), and ~ t ¼ 10 4 (Figure 5.31d). It is evident that at the initial stage of plasma spreading, for t \u0001 D a = V 2 a (see Figure 5.31a), the distribution of the concentration d N is determined by pure diffusion. For t > D a = V 2 a (Figure 5.31b through d) the initial disturbance splits into two plasmoids and the redistribution of the depletion zones of the background plasma defined by the negative numbers near the curves of equal concentration. The same picture as observed for the case E ? B 0 is observed in the case E jj B 0 . Thus, electrons of the initial point disturbance d N ( r ,0) ¼ n 0 d ( r ) move with the velocity V a (0) ¼ D e jj E jj . The condition of quasi-neutrality for the corresponding plasmoid strongly stretched along z -axis (or B 0 ; see Figure 5.31), is provided with the flows of background ions across B 0 . Because the velocity of movement and the characteristic sizes of this plasmoid are determined by electrons, and the potential is negative, this plasmoid was defined in Refs. [89,90] as electronic . The character of spreading and the characteristic sizes of the second plasmoid, stretched along the y -axis (across B 0 ; see Figure 5.31), are defined by background ions coming from depletion zones to secure quasi-neutrality in this plasmoid (therefore, the potential in it is positive). In Refs. [89,90], this plasmoid was defined as ionic . However, as we will show in Chapter 6, the real injected ions move along the electric field with velocity \b D i jj E jj , whereas the virtual ionic plasmoid does not move along B 0 . Hence, movement of plasma disturbance along B 0 (along the z -axis) is the same as for the case of B 0 ¼ 0, where the maximum d N m is at rest and the scale of plasma disturbance is defined by the ambipolar diffusion. In the transverse directions to B 0 (along the y -axis), the ion plasmoid spreads linearly in time owing to background electrons coming along B 0 from depletion zones, which also move together with the electronic plasmoid. Drift in Unbounded Plasma with an Arbitrary Degree of Ionization . Here, we consider briefly peculiarities occurring when a small (point) weak plasma disturbance spreads and moves in plasma with arbitrary degree of ionization. As in the previous section, we consider a weak ( d N < N 0 ) point d N ( r ,0) ¼ n 0 d ( r ) plasma disturbance concentrated in the initial moment in the small volume of the characteristic scale L 0 . In this linear case, drift and diffusion of weak small plasma disturbances can be described by the linear equation obtained from general nonlinear equations presented in Chapter 1, by excluding from them the potential of the ambipolar field (see Refs. [6,89 – 91]), as done for a purely diffusion process (see Equation 5.48). Finally, the equation of joint drift and diffusion process is as follows: r ^ s e rþr ^ s i r ½\f @ d N @ t þ ( r ^ s e r ) @ @ N 0 ( N 0 V i 0 r ) þ ( r ^ s i r ) @ @ N 0 ( N 0 V e 0 r ) \u000e\u000f d N \u0003 ( r ^ s e r )( r ^ D i r ) þ ( r ^ s i r )( r ^ D e r ) \u0007\b d N ¼ 0(5 : 80) Here, all components of tensors of diffusion and conductivity for electrons and ions are as presented in Chapter 1 for the model of the ionospheric plasma as plasma with arbitrary degree of ionization.

This effect depends on the direction of spreading of the plasma disturbance in the ambient magnetic field (on the angle b ). Thus, for b ! 90 8 , u ! 0, and for 0 \u0001 p \u0001 1, the drift velocity is minimal in directions across the magnetic field, whereas for p \u0005 1, even in this direction, the effects of magnetic field become negligible.

In Figure 5.33 the results of numerical analysis of Equation 5.83 are in the form G ( y , k ) ¼ G ( r , k , t ) = G d (0, t ), where G d (0, t ) is the profile of plasma concentration in the origin of the coordinate system in the case of the pure diffusion problem with absence of drift movements described by Equation 5.14, depending on the dimensionless parameter y ¼ U 2 m = D i jj . This parameter was estimated using well-known values U m and D i jj at the corre- sponding ionospheric altitudes. All parameters were taken according to the model of the middle- latitude ionosphere for altitude z ¼ 200 km (see Tables 1.1 through 1.3). From the presented illustrations it is seen that for p \u0004 1 the velocity of spreading along B 0 (Figure 5.33a; b ¼ 0 8 , m ¼ 1) significantly exceeds the velocity of spreading across B 0 (Figure 5.33b; b ¼ 90 8 , m ¼ 0). This is evident because in the magnetized plasma the character of dispersion spreading of plasma disturbance along B 0 is determined by the electronic component of plasma (i.e., by D e jj and V e jj ) and across B 0 by the ionic component (i.e., by D i ? and V i ? ), and V e jj \u0005 V i ? .Evenfor p \t 1the effects of the magnetic field are significant, mostly in the direction along B 0 , and strong anisotropy is observed if we compare these two limited cases presented, respectively, in Figure 5.33a and b. However, for p \u0005 1 (more strictly for h p \u0005 1, h ¼ m e n em = M i n im ), all effects related to the influence of the magnetic field discussed earlier become negligible, and the velocity of drift process both along and across B 0 is the same; the anisotropy in the shape of the initial plasma density becomes sufficiently weak.

This effect can be understood if we take into account the fact that for the large wind velocities U m the neutral molecules (atoms) in their movement interact with the charged particles and force them to move with the same velocity in the direction U m [28]. It is also evident that in the presence of drift the influence of electron – ion collisions (i.e., the degree of ionization of plasma) is less compared to their influence in the pure diffusion process of s preading (see previous section). The results, depicted in Figure 5.33, correspond to the case where the vector of wind U m is orthogonal to B 0 , i.e., U m ?

Here, the same physical picture of the drift spreading of weak small plasma disturbances in the unbounded background plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization is observed, and the same effects of electron – ion collisions on drift spreading in the strong magnetic field should be taken into account. The analogous effects are observed in the analysis of time of drift spreading (lifetime) of the plasma disturbance defined earlier by the constraint Equation 5.53.

With growth of x (from 1 to 10) or the corresponding wind velocity U m , for the same parameter of ionization p , the duration of drift spreading decreases by 3 – 5 times. As parameter p increases, this dependence changes weakly.

It is evident that the time of drift spreading of the first plasmoid (across B 0 and U m ) exceeds the time of spreading of the second plasmoids (across B 0 and along U m ) by one or two orders of magnitude. This effect depends on the degree of ionization and magnetization of plasma. Thus, with increase of the parameter of ionization p , the value of ( t = t 0 ) I decreases faster than ( t = t 0 ) II for the same degree of plasma magnetization (see Figure 5.35). However, the additional analysis has shown that for strongly ionized plasma ( p \u0005 1), the lifetime of the first and the second plasmoids becomes equal, and the dispersion mechanism is ineffective; i.e., the influence of the magnetic field on plasmoid spreading becomes negligible. The same tendency (see also Figure 5.34) is evident: with the increase of parameter x (or U m ), the effects of the magnetic field on drift spreading of both plasmoids become weaker. The critical parameter of ionization p cr , for which this effect is observed, is defined by the equation ( t = t 0 ) I ¼ ( t = t 0 ) II . Estimations made in Ref.

We now consider the question of how the drift generally influences the lifetime of plasma disturbance compared with the case of a pure diffusion process. In Figure 5.36 we presented the dependence t = t ( t corresponds to drift with diffusion, and t is the pure diffusion) as a function of x (or U m ). Curve 1 corresponds to computations using parameters of the ionosphere at altitude 200 km and curve 2 is for an altitude of 300 km according to Chapter 1. It is seen that the existence of drift leads to a decrease by a factor of 3 – 5 in the lifetime of the plasma disturbance compared with a situation where the disturbance is in the rest. This effect decreases with altitude i.e., with decrease of altitude from 300 km to 200 km, the ratio t = t becomes smaller. However, as follows from Figure 5.35 for x > 1, ( t = t 0 ) I \u0005 1 and ( t = t 0 ) II \u0005 1. This means that even taking into account the drift process, the time of relaxation of a weak small plasma disturbance in the ionosphere exceeds the lifetime of that disturbance in the case of absence of ambient magnetic field ( B 0 ¼ 0) and drift process ( V a ¼ 0). 5.2.2 Dynamics and Spreading of Arbitrary Irregularity in the Ionosphere Further modeling of the process of the drift and diffusion spreading of plasma irregularities of comparatively large sizes in the ionospheric plasma has been carried out by several separate groups 10 4 10 3 p = 0 p = 1 p = 10 ( t / t 0 ) II ( t / t 0 ) I ( t / t 0 ) I , ( t / t 0 ) II 10 2 10 1 1 0.01 0.1 1.0 10 x Figure 5.35 Lifetime of the first and the second maximum of the initial plasma disturbance for various degrees of ionization of the background plasma.

Therefore, only some simplified analytical models concerning inertial drift process and evolution and striation of strong plasma structures in the ionosphere have been developed in recent decades [73,74,87 – 94]. Thus, in Refs. [40,58 – 63], the evolution of ion clouds in the ionospheric plasma at altitudes between the E and F layers was investigated numerically, taking into account the natural layers ’ structure, wind movements, and the process of recombination, mostly occurring in the E region of the ionosphere. We present the results of their investigations in Chapter 6, where we consider the evolution of artificial ion clouds in the ionosphere and compare results of computations with the corresponding data obtained from numerous rocket experiments and with the corresponding real-time optical observations of dynamics of such plasma structures. We only point out that some of the models under consideration are sufficiently realistic [58 – 60], because they account for multilayered ionosphere and interactions of the injected plasma structure with bottom and upper layers, as shown in Figure 5.37. As can be seen, the initial plasma cloud lies between two layers; the upper (1) corresponding to the F layer and the bottom one (2) to the E layer. Owing to the interaction between the plasma cloud and the layers, imaginary clouds are generated at these layers with lack of or excess of plasma concentration related to the effect of short-circuit (vortex) current through the background plasma. This vortex current is due to the flow of the electrons between the layers (along the magnetic field B 0 which is usually directed vertically) and the flow of ions between imaginary clouds within each layer, with depletions of density (denoted by ‘‘ \u0003 ’’ ) and with enhancements of density (denoted by ‘‘ þ ’’ ), as shown schematically in Figure 5.37.

The authors of these works related this deformation to the influence of the ambient electric field E 0 and to the multilayered structure of the ionospheric plasma. In some works [61 – 63], the consistent numerical analysis of the drift of plasma structures of various dimensions and forms (plate, spherical, and elliptical) was carried out. A new phenomenon was observed experimentally, related to the splitting of the initial plasma perturbation on plasma clumps strongly stretched along B 0 , called strata , which moved more slowly than the initial mother irregularity.

The authors of these studies related this phenomenon to the E 0 \u000b B 0 -drift instability described in detail in Chapter 2, and caused, according to Refs. [61 – 69], by the differences in velocities of ions and electrons in the crossing electric and magnetic fields. The localization of these instabilities (e.g., strata) depends on the gradient of the plasma density inside the large mother cloud, on the vector E 0 \u000b B 0 , and on the initial velocities of drift of electrons and ions defined by Equation 5.72, and also on the degree of disturbance of the ambient electric field d E 0 caused by the injected plasma clouds. In Refs. [61 – 63] the following criterion of weakness perturbation of the ambient electric field and its influence on movements of initial plasma irregularity in the nondisturbed electric E 0 and magnetic B 0 fields, l * ¼ S E , F P = S c P \u0004 1, was introduced. Here, S c P is the Pedersen conductivity along E 0 and across B 0 of the plasma cloud integrated along the height, and S E P , S F P are the same conductivities integrated along the z -axis (i.e., along the height), for the E and F layers, respectively. Conversely, the criterion of strong electric field perturbation caused by the injected plasma cloud, l * \u0005 1, was introduced in Refs. [61 – 63]. This criterion is more soft compared with the criterion of ambient electric field perturbation introduced in Refs. [89 – 91], l ** ¼ d N = N 0 \u0005 1, where d N ,as before, is the initial plasma concentration inside the irregularity and N 0 the concentration of the background ionospheric plasma. What criterion of plasma perturbation should be taken into account, is the main aspect of further explanation of the observed experiments, because it defines the degree of nonlinearity of the problem of drift evolution of arbitrary plasma disturbance in the ionosphere. Therefore, we will analyze this aspect in detail in Chapter 6, which deals with the evolution of barium clouds in the ionosphere. Here, we will only note that if the weak initial plasma disturbance ( d N = N 0 \u0004 1) occurs in the ionosphere, the vortex currents through background plasma stabilize the E 0 \u000b B 0 -drift instabilities. However, in the inverse case, d N = N 0 > 1, when the ambipolar field ( E a ¼\u0003r w ) cannot be fully secured by the vortex currents in the regions above and below the initial plasma disturbance, the movements of plasma disturbance in the total electric field as a sum of the ambient and inner fields ( E ¼ E 0 þ E a ) cause fundamental changes in the form of the irregularity. The inner field in the ionosphere is irregular in space and directed against the gradient of plasma density. Therefore, in the regions with enhancement of plasma concentration, the total field is smaller and these regions move more slowly compared with the depletion ones. This effect leads to bifurcation of the gradients of concentration during irregularity movements. This general result obtained in Refs. [61 – 63] is clearly seen from illustrations presented in Figure 5.38 of numerical simulations of the nonlinear dynamic of large-scale irregularity in the middle-latitude ionosphere. Here, the moments of time are presented in dimensionless units, t = t 0 , where t 0 ¼ L 0 = V d , L 0 is the initial size of irregularity, and V d the magnitude of drift velocity. Along axes, vertical and horizontal, the coordinates are also presented in relation to L 0 units. It is evident that stratification begins at the front of the movements in the direction of E 0 \u000b B 0 -drift (along the vertical axis), and because of bifurcation of the front profile, several strata are generated and move with the initial irregularity along the vertical axis. Conversely, in some works [35,40,58,59], the generation of plasma waves (oscillations) was observed at the back of the initial irregularity, i.e., opposite the direction of movements, which was explained by the authors taking into account the difference between mobilities of electrons and ions in the ambient electric field. However, in the previously mentioned works, the effects of stratification were generated artificially by the introduction into the numerical model of some artificial quasi-periodical (according to sine and cosine laws) perturbations in the initial Gaussian profile of irregularity.

Thus were resolved some problems of nonlinear drift evolution of strong ( d N = N 0 \u0005 1) one- and two-dimensional irregularity in the ionospheric plasma. It was shown that in more realistic cases, owing to spatial inhomogeneity of the total electric field E , the gradient of plasma density increases at the front of the irregularity (relative to E 0 ) with the normal vector along E 0 , as well as at the back of the irregularity (relative to V d ) with the normal vector orthogonal to E 0 and B 0 . During bifurcation of fronts of the irregularity, a sharp increase of plasma density occurs. At the same time, in Refs.

All the contradic- tions between different researches and their analysis, the theories and experimental data, reveal the involvement of the processes accompanying the evolution of arbitrary plasma disturbance in the real nonregular inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma. Therefore, in Refs. [49,73,74], taking into account effects of real ionosphere on the transport processes occurring at the different altitudes [87,88], a self-consistent model of the nonlinear evolution (drift and diffusion) of the arbitrary plasma irregularity (weak and strong) with arbitrary degree of anisotropy with respect to ambient magnetic field has been developed. Moreover, in Ref. [74] the effects of the degree of ionization, inhomo- geneity of background plasma, initial dimensions of the irregularity, and initial perturbation of the ambient electric field on plasma GDI generation were analyzed separately on the basis of results of the classical theory performed in Refs.

[49,73,74], the drift of strong plasma disturbances ( d N > N 0 ) with various degrees of anisotropy in the inhomogeneous ionosphere was investigated both theoretically and numerically on the basis of an ionospheric model that is to a great extent close to conditions in the middle- latitude ionosphere at heights from 100 to 400 km.

The actual boundary conditions usually used in the middle-latitude ionospheric study [83 – 86] were also taken into account. It was shown that the smooth diffusion process, which is more important in the initial stage of the spreading, transforms at the later stages into an unstable phase in which the front of the initial Gaussian profile of the irregularity splits into a number of strata (i.e., clusters) stretched along the geomagnetic field B 0 . The time of the GDI creation in crossing E 0 and B 0 fields depends on the initial parameters of the irregularity and initial ambient conditions in the ionosphere, such as the ratio of the plasma disturbance d N to the background density N 0 , the degree of anisotropy of initial inhomogeneity x ¼ L = d , the altitude of creation of such an irregularity, and the value of the ambient electric field E 0 in the ionosphere. As in the foregoing analysis of the smooth diffusion process, we consider next the movement (i.e., simultaneous diffusion and drift spreading) of plasma inhomogeneities with initial dimen- sions larger than both characteristic electron or ion mean free paths, l a ,along B 0 and the Larmor ’ s radii, r H a , across B 0 ( a ¼ e , i ). Here, as previously, we take into account the conditions of potentiality of the internal self-consistent ambipolar field, E c ( E c ¼\u0003r f ,where f is the potential of the ambipolar field), of plasma quasi-neutrality, N e \u0002 N i ¼ N , isothermality, T e ¼ T i ¼ T , and ambipolarity in the presence of the magnetic field, r j e ¼r j i ¼r j .Under such assumptions, the system of inhomogeneous hydrodynamic equations can be presented in the following manner [49,73,74]: @ N @ t ¼ 1 2 r ^ D e ( z ) rþr ^ D i ( z ) r \u0004\u0005 N \u0003 1 2 e \u0004 r ^ s i ( z ) r\u0003r ^ s e ( z ) r \u0005 f þ 1 2 \u0004 r V e 0 ( z ) þr V i 0 ( z ) \u0005 N 1 e \u0004 r ^ s e ( z ) rþr ^ s i ( z ) r \u0005 f ¼ \u0004 r ^ D e ( z ) r\u0003r ^ D i ( z ) r \u0005 N þ 1 2 \u0004 r V e 0 ( z ) \u0003r V i 0 ( z ) \u0005 N (5 : 88) Here, as before, V e 0 ( z ) and V i 0 ( z ) are the electron and ion drift velocities; and ^ D e ( z ), ^ D i ( z ), ^ s e ( z ), and ^ s i ( z ), the tensors of diffusion and electric conductivity of electrons and ions, respectively, described in Equation 1.12a and b for plasma with arbitrary degree of ionization and magnetiza- tion. Unlike the nonlinear equations used in Refs. [6,89 – 91], in a system (Equation 5.88) the components of the tensors are functions of altitude z in the ionosphere. Their dependence on ionospheric parameters for the real middle-latitude ionosphere was investigated in Refs. [87,88], and it was found that in the real conditions of the ionosphere the transport coefficients are complicated functions of altitude z (see Figure 5.39) with respect to those in a weakly ionized unbounded homogeneous plasma. Now, if the ambient electric field, E 0 , and the neutral wind, U m , occur in the ionosphere, the drift velocities, V a 0 ( z ), can be represented as follows ( a ¼ e,i ): V a 0 ( z ) ¼ U m ( z ) þ 1 eN sgn e a ðÞ ^ \u0002 a ( z ) E 0 þ 1 c U m \u000b B 0 ðÞ \u000e\u000f þ sgn e \u0003 1 a \u0004\u0005 m a g \u0006\r (5 : 89) where c is the velocity of light, and e a and m a are the charge and mass of the electron and ion components of the plasma inhomogeneity.

At the lower ionospheric boundary along the vertical axis, z ¼ z 1 , as well as at each side in the horizontal plane, x ¼\r x 1 , and y ¼\r y 1 , the density perturbation d N vanishes and the perturbations of electric field potential, created by d N , equal zero at both the upper and lower boundaries and at each side. At the upper boundary, z ¼ z 2 and, as follows from Equation 5.92b, either d N vanishes or the charged particle flux is taken to be constant, because the mean free path increases with altitude. The system of equations (Equation 5.88) is nonregular, non- linear, and inhomogeneous, therefore, as shown in Refs. [49,73,74], it can only be solved numerically. In Ref. [74], the solution was sought in the ionospheric region of z 1 ¼ 100 \u0001 z \u0001 z 2 ¼ 500 km, j x j\u0001 x 1 , j y j\u0001 y 1 , x 1 ¼ y 1 \u0001 10 km. The integration time interval was t 0 \u0001 t \u0001 100 s, where, as before, t 0 ¼ d 2 = 8 D i jj . The steps of numerical computations in time and space were chosen to be variable to justify the stability conditions of the trial-run method and the variable direction method [73,74]. Thus, the sharper the initial shape of the inhomogeneity (i.e., its spatial gradient, @ d N ( x , y , z ,0) = d z ), the smaller the step in time, D t , which was used in the numerical computations according to Ref. [74]. For a step in space, D z , a new spatial variable j ( z ) was introduced that enabled the investigation in more detail of the spatial zones nearest the initial inhomogeneity, and in less detail (with larger spatial steps) the zones farthest from the inhomogeneity (see details in Ref. [74]).

Using the same approach as for unipolar diffusion of the irregularity with finite dimensions across and along B 0 , evaluated in Refs. [16 – 20], we now obtain the additional effects caused by the drift process, the velocities of which we suggested, for simplicity ’ s sake, to be constant. Using the same equations of diffusion and drift for electron and ion components ( a ¼ e,i ) of initial plasma perturbation, as Equation 5.65, we can present their solutions for diffusion and drift process as two-dimensional integrals: I a ¼ ðð exp \u0003 b 0 2 a 2 þ ik b b \u0003 b 0 ðÞ\u0003 D ab k 2 b t \u0006\r d k b d b 0 (5 : 93) where b ¼ x , y , z ; b 0 ¼ x 0 , y 0 , z 0 ; a ¼ L , d ; D ab ¼ const are the coefficients of unipolar diffusion for electrons ( a ¼ e ) and ions ( a ¼ i ), which correspond to those depicted in Figure 5.39 for the altitude h ¼ z 0 of initial plasma irregularity.

The positive profiles of plasma disturbance are presented by solid curves and the depletion regions by dashed curves. It is evident that the shape and density of the disturbance, as well as those for the depletion zones, are not the same at different altitudes. Thus, if at the altitudes of the E layer ( z 0 ¼ 125 km; see Figure 5.40b) the irregularity is stretched along the V d / E 0 \u000b B 0 direction in the F 1 layer ( z 0 ¼ 185 km; see Figure 5.40c) and in the F 2 layer ( z 0 ¼ 305 km; see Figure 5.40d), the rotation of the initial irregularity at the angle a \u0002 tan \u0003 1 [( b e L \u0003 b i L ) = b i ? ], estimated in Ref. [70], is observed. In all figures, the vertical x -axis is directed along the E 0 \u000b B 0 -drift and the y -axis is along the E 0 -direction. The z -axis is directed along B 0 orthogonal to the plane of figures. Here, as was introduced at the beginning of this chapter, b e L and b i L are the mobilities of electrons and ions in the Hall direction (in the crossing E 0 \u000b B 0 direction), and b i ? is the mobility of ions in the Pedersen direction (in the direction along E 0 and across B 0 ). Moreover, the perturbed regions at the different altitudes have different shapes and forms and even the different displacements along the x -axis are not so noticeable. It can also be seen that with an increase of the height of injection of the initial irregularity, the decay of plasma concentration inside the regularity is also increased. The same disturbance computed according to the two-layered model (Figure 5.39e) is characterized by a strong elongation along the E 0 \u000b B 0 direction and rotation relative to the Hall direction. The comparison between 3-D and 2-D models shows that the two-layer model is a good approximation for the description of 3-D evolution of large-scale strong ionospheric irregularity. In Ref.

The region where these effects were found is defined by the authors as the ionic ellipsoid. Thus, it is again evident that the deformation of the initial irregularity and the floating of the charged particles of plasma occur in the E 0 \u000b B 0 direction. The flow of particles in the ionic area is of the order of N 0 V 0 L 2 ( b i ? b i L ) 1 = 2 , and the maximum of density in this region is of the order of N 0 L eff = L ¼ N 0 ( b e jj = b i ? ) 1 = 2 . Additional analysis of the 3-D model carried out in Ref. [71] gives the floating of plasma particles, electrons and ions, not only in the Hall ( E 0 \u000b B 0 ) direction but also in the Pedersen (along E 0 and across B 0 ) direction. The shapes of the electronic ellipsoid and the ionic ellipsoid and the corresponding depletion regions are quite adequate for the nonlinear spreading of strong large-scale plasma disturbance according to the scheme developed in Refs. [89 – 91] and presented in Figure 5.42.

In the same manner, the electronic areas 00 2 are formed by the injection electrons inside the plasma irregularity, which was initially located in the point O, as follows from Figure 5.42. From this simple scheme the physical meaning of formation of ionic and electronic areas floating from the initial irregularity and of formation of the corresponding depletion zones is evident. In Ref. [71], the conditions of the initial dimensions of the irregularity were obtained, and using them we can ignore the altitudinal inhomogeneity of the background ionospheric plasma and consider the constant averaged along the height parameters of plasma. Thus, the irregularity with initial transverse d and longitudinal L scales, according to the effect of short-circuit currents, has the real longitudinal scale of L jj \u0002 d ( D e jj = D i ? ) 1 = 2 . The influence of the longitudinal inhomogeneity of the background plasma depends on relations between AL and L jj , where as before, A ¼ d N = N 0 . For AL \u0004 L jj , we can ignore the inhomogeneity of background plasma as the approximate formulas (Equation 5.95) obtained according to Refs [73,74] are working well. This was also shown in Refs. [70,71], for 300 m \u0001 d \u0001 1 km and AL \u0001 L jj , where L jj \u0002 d ( D e jj = D i ? ) 1 = 2 for the actual altitudes, the 3-D computations are close to those leading from the two-layer (2-D) model [59 – 61]. If now AL > L jj , on the spreading of the strongly elongated irregularity ( x ¼ L = d \t 10 2 ) the significant influence comes from the gradients of the parameters of the background plasma and the corre- sponding transport coefficients. This case corresponds to the model proposed in Refs. [73,74]. The main difference between the model proposed in the aforementioned references and the model developed in Refs. [34,73] is that in the former not only was the E 0 \u000b B 0 -drift taken into account but also were the effects of the longitudinal electric field (even it is smaller than the transverse one, E 0 jj \u0004 E 0 ? ), of the neutral wind ( U m ), and the gravity force ( \b g ). The correspond- ing nonlinear inhomogeneous system for this model with the initial and boundary conditions is described in the foregoing by Equations 5.88 through 5.92. This model was simulated numerically accounting for the transport coefficients variable along height according to Figure 5.39, and the effects of ionization and recombination in the natural boundary conditions (Equation 5.92). We now return to the comparison of results of the simulation of system (Equation 5.88) with the results of the 3-D models proposed in Refs. [34,73] for the same initial conditions as were taken in their simulations and presented earlier. The results of the numerical analysis of Equation 5.88 are presented in Figure 5.43a for a spherical perturbation in the same conditions as in computations in Ref. [71] and for the following parameters: A ¼ 10 2 , h ¼ z 0 ¼ 160 km, E x ¼ E y ¼ 10 V = m, E z \u0006 E jj ¼ 0, L ¼ d ¼ 5 km and t ¼ 5 s. It is evident the results of computations according to Equation 5.88 for t \u0001 5 s are in good agreement with the calculations carried out in Ref. [71], where the ionosphere was assumed to be quasi-homogeneous and unbounded; i.e., the parameters were assumed to be constant with altitude. At the same time, the results obtained in Refs. [73,74] differ somewhat from those obtained in Ref. [70] in the case when L ¼ 5 km and d ¼ 0.3 km ( x ¼ L = d \u0002 17) and for h ¼ z 0 ¼ 300 km. As indicated in the contours of equal density plotted in Figure 5.43b during the initial phase ( t \u0001 5 s), the spreading is similar to that discussed in Refs. [70,71]. Later, however, the original irregularity splits into two elongated plasmoids for t \t 20 s; they rotate around an axis parallel to E 0 \u000b B 0 . The second plasmoid moves in the direction V a ¼ ( V e þ V i ) = 2, which is between B 0 and E 0 \u000b B 0 . This result is similar to that discussed in Ref. [6] for a small irregularity in which U m ? B 0 , and indicates that the initial irregularity splitting is purely dispersive in nature. Comparison between the proposed self-consistent model in Refs. [73,74] and the tested models created in Refs. [59,60,70,71] and the good agreement between them enabled the authors of Refs.

The geometry of this depletion region changes during the process of formation of a quasi-periodical structure inside it, the strata , and then its dimension also changes in the process of evolution followed by the reconstruction of the irregularity itself. As can be seen from examples presented in Figure 5.44a and b, the process of plasma structure evolution is complicated under real ionospheric conditions and depends on many actual ambient plasma parameters, each of which specifically affects the drift spreading. That is why we will try below to examine each effect independently. Effect of Longitudinal Component of the Ambient Electric Field . Many investigators exclude this component of the ambient electric field, and this is correspond to the experimental data from direct monitoring of the ionosphere presented by [100,101], according to which E 0 jj ¼ 10 \u0003 3 \u0003 10 \u0003 5 ðÞ E 0 ? .

Effects of Degree of Anisotropy. To understand the role of the degree of anisotropy of an arbitrary irregularity, we now examine a strong ( A ¼ 10 2 ) isotropic ( L ¼ d ¼ 5 km) irregularity (see Figure 5.45a), which is created in the background of inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma in the presence of insufficient ambient electric field ( E 0 ? ¼ 1mV = m, E 0 z ¼ 10 \u0003 4 mV = m). It is evident from Figure 5.45a that the velocity of drift spreading is slower than in the previous case of anisotropic initial irregularity (Figure 5.44) and the striation of the initial irregularity into a set of plasmoids (strata) is not observed. The character of drift spreading is isotropic and corresponds to a diffusive smooth expansion. Only at the edges of the Gaussian profile (Equation 5.90) of plasma density inside the irregularity do the local perturbations take place during the process of plasma drift in a weak electric field. This result is in good agreement with results obtained in Ref. [72] for weakly anisotropic irregularities. The same picture was also obtained from the numerical model created in Ref. [71], where the initial stage of evolution of an isotropic irregularity was investigated. The difference between the two results is that the irregularity stretches upward along magnetic field lines (along the z -axis; see Figure 5.45a) owing to a small longitudinal component of ambient electric field. In Figure 5.45a we show only an example of simulation. More studies of different kinds of initial irregularity are presented in Table 5.1, where the dependence of time t d \u0006 t 1 and t s \u0006 t 2 on the transversal dimension, d , of the initial irregularity is introduced (see Table 5.1). The other parameters of the problem are kept constant for numerical simulations: L ¼ 10 km, E 0 ? ¼ 1mV = m, E 0 z ¼ 10 \u0003 4 mV = m, A ¼ 10 2 . Here, t d is the time of plasma splitting on several plasmoids owing to dispersive drift spreading (according to Refs. [6,89,90]), and t s is the time that characterizes the plasma structure creation (i.e., splitting on the grid of strata) due to GDI [74], described in Chapter 2. As can be seen from Table 5.1, with increasing degree of anisotropy of the initial plasma irregularity (with decreasing parameter d ), the time of dispersive drift striation t d and the time of strata structure formation, t s ( t s > t d always) decrease. For isotropy irregularities ( L ¼ d ) both effects in the process of plasma irregularity spreading have not been observed. Effects of the Ambient Electric Field . In Figure 5.45b, the character of spreading is the same as in the case of the strong isotropic plasma irregularity. It is presented for a moment t ¼ 30 s after creation of the irregularity for the same conditions shown in Figure 5.54a, but for E 0 ? ¼ 10 mV = m. The difference between results of simulations shown in Figure 5.54a computed for t ¼ 30 s for a weaker electric field ( E 0 ? ¼ 1mV = m) and those obtained for E 0 ? ¼ 10 mV = m is evident when comparing the illustrations presented in Figure 5.54a and b. In the latter figure, after t ¼ 30 s striation of initial irregularity on the several plasmoids is observed. The comparison between these two figures allows us to conclude that with increasing electric field amplitude (from 1 to 10 mV = m), the striation process grows both along and across B 0 .

As can be seen, with increasing amplitude of the ambient electric field, the characteristic times of irregularity splitting due to a dispersive mechanism and further striation due to development of gradient-drift instability (GDI) decrease. On the other hand, for a significantly small ambient electric field these effects have not yet been observed. Effects of the Inhomogeneity of the Background Plasma . To understand the influence of back- ground ionospheric inhomogeneity on drift spreading, we generate the irregularity in the infinite quasi-homogeneous plasma where the concentration of plasma particles N 0 \u0006 N 0 ( h ¼ z 0 )is constant and where all transport plasma coefficients presented in Figure 5.39 correspond to the altitude of the initial maximum h ¼ z 0 of plasma disturbance. The solution of such a problem is described by Equation 5.85 by taking into account the same initial and boundary conditions (Equations 5.81 and 5.82) that were introduced for the inhomogeneous background ionospheric plasma. It is easy to see that for E 0 ¼ 0 and U m ¼ 0 the formulas (Equation 5.95) transform to those describing pure diffusional spreading of weak ( d N < N 0 ) plasma disturbances in the infinite back- ground plasma that were presented in the previous section in Equations 5.19 and 5.20. Results of numerical calculations of Equation 5.95 are shown in Figure 5.46 as lines of equal concentration, A ¼ d N = N 0 ¼ 10 2 , for the following parameters of numerical simulation, h ¼ 200 km, L ¼ 10 km, d ¼ 10 m ( x ¼ L = d ¼ 10 3 ), E * 0 ? ¼ 2mV = m (or E 0 ? ¼ 1mV = m and U m ¼ 30 m = s according to Refs. [83,100,101]) for two moments of current time, t 1 ¼ 1 s (Figure 5.46a) and t 1 ¼ 5 s (Figure 5.46b). Here, for t 1 ¼ 1 s digits 1 – 8 correspond to the lines of equal plasma density depicted in Figure 5.46a at the plane ( x , y ) perpendicular to B 0 , d N ( x,y,t ) = N 0 ¼ 48.3, 17.9, 6.8, 26.7, 20.4, 15, 6, 6.98, respectively, and for t 1 ¼ 5 s digits 1 – 9 corresponding to the same lines, but for d N ( x,y,t ) = N 0 ¼ 23.2, 8.91, 3.43 1.95, 23.4, 8.98, 2.51, 1.24, 0.92, respectively. It can be seen that during drift spreading the initial plasma irregularity moves in the direction between E 0 and E 0 \u000b B 0 , and splits into two plasmoids owing to pure dispersive drift mechanism only [6,89 – 91]. Overall, in the regular and homogeneous background plasma, the picture of spreading is symmetrical relative to both Pedersen (along E 0 ) and Hall (along E 0 \u000b B 0 ) directions and the additional striation on a cluster of strata, observed in Figure 5.44 for the case of the inhomogeneous plasma, is not found in this case. Moreover, we generated the same numerical simulations that are presented in Figure 5.46 for inhomogeneous background plasma with the same inner and outer parameters as their actual complicated altitudinal dependence, also taking into account effects of recombination and its altitudinal dependence (at the lower ionosphere) according to Ref. [73]. Figure 5.47, where the lines of equal density is shown in the ( z , x ) plane for t ¼ 5, 10, and 20 s, clearly indicates that the initial plasma disturbance breaks up into a cluster of stratified plasmoids stretched along the magnetic field B 0 , even as little as a few seconds away from the initial time ( t \u0001 5 s).

As mentioned earlier, this pattern depends on a wide variety of parameters describing both the initial irregularity in the background plasma and the background plasma itself.

For A \t 10 2 the processes of plasma splitting and striation are not observed. This case corresponds to that depicted in Figure 5.45a. The self-consistent theoretical analysis carried out in Refs.

In Chapter 2 we briefly presented analysis of the stretching criterion for arbitrary plasma irregularity striation due to drift instability based on results obtained in Refs. [64 – 69] and then modified for the plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization in Refs. [49,74]. Using estimations made there, we obtain the result that for altitudes of h ¼ 150 – 250 km the striation mechanism becomes effective for striation mechanism for the irregularities with a degree of anisotropy of x ¼ L = d \t q H (1 þ p ) (5 : 101) Taking into account deviations of the parameters of the ionosphere at these altitudes according to Ref. [83] and results presented by Tables 1.1 through 1.3, we get L = d \t 10 2 . So, as pointed out earlier, parameters taken for the simulations presented earlier according to Refs. [73,74] are in good agreement with results obtained from constraints (Equations 5.100 and 5.101) according to the phenomenological approach proposed in Refs. [49,74] and described in Chapter 2. Effect of Ambient Electric Field Perturbations . We will now estimate the perturbation, d E , of the ambient electric field, E 0 , generated inside the disturbed plasma region owing to the creation (by injection or by heating) of the plasma irregularity inside it. Using the relations between electric field perturbations and the electric potential, F , inside the disturbed region, d E \br ?

From Equations 5.103 and 5.104 it follows that for a plasma irregularity weakly stretched along B 0 ( L jj \u0005 AL ), the characteristic scale of the ionospheric plasma altitudinal variations L jj is more than the longitudinal scale of the irregularity, the components d E x and d E y of field perturbation d E being sufficiently small. In this case of a quasi-homogeneous ionosphere, the magnetic field lines are equipotential. Therefore, in this case, we can assume that the ionosphere is unbounded and homogeneous and can use the models constructed in Refs. [70,71]. In the inverse case, where L jj \u0004 AL , i.e., the irregularities are strongly stretched along B 0 , the perturbation of the ambient electric field is essential and the aforementioned models do not work. From estimations made in Ref.

In the inverse cases we obtain the effects of drift stabilization at the earlier stage of plasma irregularity evolution obtained theoretically for ion clouds in Refs. [67 – 69] and briefly described in Chapter 2. We return again to a description of the effect of plasma drift stabilization following Ref. [74]. As stated in Refs. [67 – 69], the criterion of plasma drift stabilization can be presented for isothermic, T e \u0002 T i ¼ T , plasma as 2 T eE 0 ? > L x q H Q H 1 \u0003 V A A A þ 2 \u000e\u000f (5 : 105) where V A / c \u0003 1 E 0 ? \u000b B 0 ½\f is the drift velocity in the azimuthal direction. We can compare the results of our numerical computations presented in Tables 5.1 through 5.3 with the criterion of drift stabilization (Equation 5.105). Thus, with increasing E 0 ? , i.e., the velocity V A , the threshold of drift stabilization is also increased. Again, we obtain the result that in a strong ambient electric field only development of drift instability can be found, the stabilization effect being absent. This result is clearly seen from results presented in Figures 5.44 and 5.47 and Table 5.2. At the same time, with the increasing parameter of perturbation, A ( A > 10), the factor A = ( A þ 2) ! 1 and as seen from Equation 5.102 for E 0 ? ¼ const , the threshold of drift stabilization becomes smaller. Therefore, because the stabilizing factor is more strongly manifested for the cases presented in Figure 5.45, we obtained smooth spreading there. We observed the same decrease in the threshold of drift stabilization as that of the degree of anisotropy x ¼ L = d (see Equation 5.105).

Now, taking into consideration the parameters of the background plasma and the ion cloud itself following Refs. [64 – 69], we obtain the same fast (of a few seconds) striation and splitting of the initial ion cloud in the strata structure (from Table 5.1 it follows that t s ¼ 5 – 8 s). Hence, as follows from results presented in Tables 5.1 through 5.3 and in Figures 5.44 through 5.47, we can, using the self-consistent model described earlier according to Refs. [49,73,74], predict both the process of plasma drift stabilization in the cases of strong ( A > 10), weakly anisotropic ( x \u0001 10) plasma irregularity evolution in a weak ambient electric field ( E 0 ? \u0001 3 \u0003 4 ðÞ mV = m), and the process of plasma drift instability during the spreading of weak ( A \u0001 10), strongly stretched ( x > 10), plasma irregularity in a strong ambient electric field ( E 0 ? > 5mV = m). We will use this approach in Chapter 6 for the analysis of optical observations of evolution of ion clouds in Earth ’ s ionosphere. 5.3 Thermodiffusion of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere The process of diffusion and drift relaxations of plasma structures in the background ionosphere, discussed earlier, mostly characterizes the situation of evolution of isothermal plasma where the temperatures of the charged particles, electrons and ions, are the same. However, most physical processes accompanying the formation and further evolution of plasma structures in the ionosphere are not isothermal, and, first of all, the processes of artificial heating of plasma by powerful short- wave radiation from ground-based facilities or heating of background ionospheric plasma during a magnetic storm and other natural phenomena occur due to solar activity. Investigation of such heating processes is important for the study of both geophysical and radiophysical phenomena, notably, the interaction of powerful radio wave radiation with a cold, dense, partially or fully ionized and magnetized ionospheric plasma (depending on the height of heating and power of the natural or artificial source). Here, the important questions that need to be answered are how electromagnetic waves transfer their energy into the plasma wave oscillation energy, how they create plasma temperature and concentration fluctuations, and finally, how the quasi-periodical grating plasma structures (also defined in the literature as plasma cavities, turbulences, irregularities or inhomogeneities [50 – 57,75 – 78]) are generated. Knowledge of all kinds of plasma structures artificially induced by a heating process or rocket injection at the corresponding altitudes of the ionosphere and their spatial and temporal evolution is necessary to adequately model their effects on propagation of probing radio waves through disturbed regions of the ionosphere and for predicting of propagation characteristics of ionospheric communication links [21,22]. In all these cases, thermodiffusion, a faster process compared to pure isothermal plasma diffusion and drift [75 – 78,102,103], plays an important role in the formation and further spatial and temporal evolution of striated plasma density structures. Theoretical and experimental studies on the influence of powerful radio waves on ionospheric plasma heating [50 – 57] indicated the possible development of cavities (in the 1-D case) and quasi-periodical heating-induced ionospheric plasma structures (in the 2-D case) in the regions of heating. However, the possible application of the proposed theories was limited because all these 1-D and 2-D analytical and numerical models of ionospheric plasma heating cannot explain the real spatial redistribution of plasma density during the heating process observed experimentally, namely, plasma striation during its evolution into the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 231 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan Evolution of Plasma Irregularities in the Ionosphere & 231"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"grating quasi-periodical structure stretched along the geomagnetic field lines and further nonlinear relaxation of such cluster of strata.

We describe the results obtained in detail in Chapter 6, where we will discuss such kinds of plasma turbulences. In the following text, we present the formulation of the problem and give the corresponding equations and parameters describing the evolution of such plasma irregularities in the ionosphere. We also present results of modeling of the specific cases of plasma heating (local or resonance) with altitudinal separation of heating sources, following results obtained in Refs. [50 – 57]. Then, we present the reader the physical picture of formation of the plasma temperature and plasma density profile in the real model of middle-latitude ionosphere at the altitudes of higher – E and lower – F regions of the ionosphere. 5.3.1 General Problem Statement: Functions and Parameters We now suggest that in a given region of the ionosphere, and at a fixed height h ¼ h 0 , the ionosphere was heated by a source of heat Q ( z ). We do not go into detail about the nature of the heater (local, resonance, adaptive, and so on) and will present for future discussions the relations between the coordinate z , which we usually direct along the geomagnetic field B 0 , and the height of the initial heating-induced plasma structure, h ¼ h 0 , h ¼ z cos u , h 0 ¼ z 0 cos u ,where u is the angle between the vertical axis h and the geomagnetic field B 0 lined along the z -axis. The point with coordinates ( x ¼ x 0 , y ¼ y 0 , z ¼ z 0 ) corresponds to the point of initial heating. Here, we consider a more general case occurring in the real ionosphere compared with that described earlier for pure diffusion and drift spreading, directing now the z -axis not along the field B 0 , i.e., vertically, but at an angle u to the real height of the ionosphere h . According to the classical theory developed in Ref. [102], because of the heating process, the temperature distribution of charged particles becomes nonuniform and inhomogeneous. Because of this, a pressure gradient arises, leading to an inhomogeneous distribution of electron and ion components of plasma density, i.e., disturbances of plasma temperature T e ¼ T e 0 þ d T e and concentration N e ¼ N e 0 þ d N e [102]. To describe the process of evolution of perturbed plasma temperature and the corresponding plasma density disturbances for the case of quasi-neutral plasma, N e \u0002 N i ¼ N , according to Equation 1.9a, and of ambipolar thermodiffusion, diffusion and drift, r j e ¼r j e ¼r j , according to Equation 1.9b, we based ourselves on the following system of three-dimensional (3-D) equations of plasma transport, introduced earlier in Chapter 1: a. Equations 1.5 and 1.6, which, together with conditions in Equation 1.9, describe the quasi- neutral and ambipolar diffusion and drift of plasma inhomogeneities in the ambient electric and magnetic fields. b. Equation 1.10a and b, which describes the energy balance in the ionospheric region of heating. As in Ref. [102], we do not take into account disturbance of the ion temperature T i ; i.e., we neglect Equation 1.10b describing its relaxation. This is possible if the inequality d ei n ei \u0004 n em , which is correct for ionospheric altitudes h \u0001 500 km, is satisfied (see also Chapter 1 where all parameters of ionospheric plasma components were defined). c. In Equation 1.10a we introduce two kinds of external sources of heating: the source Q 1 connected with the heating of thermal electrons during their interaction with highly energetic Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C005 Final Proof page 232 27.3.2008 12:24pm Compositor Name: JG anesan 232 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"photoelectrons formed during the process of solar ultraviolet irradiation, and the additional source, Q , connected with powerful radio wave heating. Finally, the total power of the combined natural and artificial sources is Q total ¼ Q 1 þ Q . d. In the analysis of Equations 1.5 through 1.10, we took into account the fact that all transport coefficients, described by Equation 1.12a through d, are functions of ionospheric altitude h ; i.e., the problem is nonuniform, nonregular, and inhomogeneous. e. We also consider in our calculations that the frequency of electron – ion collisions, according to Equation 1.3, depends on T e ( \b T \u0003 3 = 2 e ), and consequently, the longitudinal coefficient (relative to the geomagnetic field B 0 ) of electron thermal conductivity k e jj \b T 5 = 2 e (see Equation 1.12d) depends significantly on the perturbations of temperature of electrons. According to expressions of the transverse ( k e ^ ) and perpendicular ( k e ? ) coefficients of thermal conductivity given earlier, their temperature dependences are weaker, i.e., k e ^ , ? \b T 3 = 2 e (see Equation 1.12d). We present the corresponding coefficients of thermo- diffusion and thermoconductivity along B 0 , denoted by k , in Figure 5.48. It is evident that, as with other transport coefficients presented in Figure 5.39, the changes of these transport coefficients in the middle-altitude ionosphere with altitude have a nonmonotonic character. As shown in Refs. [75,76], a full nonlinear inhomogeneous system of equations (Equations 1.5 through 1.10) is impossible to solve analytically, and therefore, in Refs. [77,78], 1-D and 3-D numerical codes based on the self-consistent nonlinear inhomogeneous system of plasma density and temperature transport with given different heat sources (corresponding to each concrete heating experiment) were developed. To numerically solve such a complicated system for 1-D to 3-D models of thermodiffusion, diffusion and drift, in Refs. [77,78] — as was done in the cases of pure diffusion and drift — the method of trial-run and variable directions was introduced, following Ref. [104]. This was done to obtain stable solutions for an inhomogeneous ionospheric background with complicated height dependence of coefficients of thermodiffusion, conductivity, diffusion, and velocities of drift.

We describe in the following text the main aspects of these phenomena. 5.3.2 One-Dimensional Heating of the E and F Layers of the Ionosphere First, to understand the main physical aspects of local heating of the ionospheric plasma, we have to consider a nonstationary 1-D problem of the evolution of plasma irregularities highly stretched along B 0 , i.e., in a situation close to the real heating experiments carried out in the upper-E and lower-F regions of the ionosphere [50 – 57]. We consider different kinds of such heating processes, located at fixed altitudes, such as two-source heatings separated along the altitude, resonance and adaptive heating, and their influence on the formation of negative and positive disturbances of plasma density in the field of a powerful radio wave in the upper and lower ionosphere. Changes of Plasma Temperature and Density in Local Fixed Heating . In the 1-D case a self- matching system (Equations 1.5 through 1.10) of diffusion and thermodiffusion can be presented for the local heating of ionospheric plasma as follows [77]: @ N I @ t ¼ @ @ z D aN jj ( z ) @ N I @ z þ D eT jj ( z ) @ T e @ z þ D iT jj ( z ) @ T i @ z \u000e\u000f þ I \u0003 R (5 : 106a) @ T e @ t ¼ @ @ z k e jj ( z ) N e @ T e @ z \u000e\u000f \u0003 d ei n ei ( T e \u0003 T i ) \u0003 d em n em ( T e \u0003 T m ) þ 2( Q þ Q 1 ) 3 N e (5 : 106b) Here, the transport coefficients of ambipolar diffusion, D aN jj , thermal diffusion, D a T jj , a ¼ e , i , and thermoconductivity, k e jj , along B 0 can be simplified from Equation 1.12 as [77]: D aN jj \u0002 D ii jj þ h D ee jj 1 þ h , D eT jj \u0002 2 þ p (1 þ h ) (1 þ p )(1 þ h ) N e m e n em D iT jj \u0002 h þ p (1 þ h ) (1 þ p )(1 þ h ) N e M i n im , D ee jj \u0002 T e [1 þ h p (1 þ T i = T e ) m e n em (1 þ p ) D ii jj \u0002 T e [ p þ (1 þ p )( T i = T e )] M i n im (1 þ p ) , k e jj \u0002 T e N e m e n em (1 þ p ) (5 : 107) All parameters here were introduced in Chapter 1; here we only note that the energy shares transmitted by electrons during their interactions with ions and neutral molecules were estimated in Ref.

The coefficient of recombination R is described in Chapter 1 according to analysis of ionization – recombination processes in the ionosphere carried out in Refs. [77,78]. It should also be noted that, in Equation 5.106a, the disturbances of the ion temperature are not taken into account, and this is justified under the condition d ei n ei < n im . Using the aforementioned estimations of the parameters made according to Ref. [102], we obtain that this constraint is fulfilled in the height region from E to F layers. The second equation (Equation 5.106b) describes the energy balance in the ionosphere during the heating process (here, T e and T i are expressed, as in Chapter 1 in energetic units). The external ( Q 1 ) and the high-power ( Q ) source from ground-based facility were described previously. Furthermore, the plasma irregularities in the ionosphere created by an external heating source Q 1 were calculated in Refs. [77,78] on the background of a natural regular distribution of electron temperature T e 0 ( z ) and concentration N e 0 ( z ) given according to the model of the middle-latitude ionosphere [105] (see also Chapter 1). Values T e 0 ( z ) and N e 0 ( z ) were substituted into Equation 5.106, which allowed us to determine the natural source of ionization J ( z ) and thermal energy Q 1 ( z ), as well as the corresponding values of flows of particles and energy j 0 ( z ) j z ¼ z 2 ¼\u0003 1 M i n im @ @ z P þ M i N I g cos u ½\f \u0006\r \u0010 \u0010 \u0010 \u0010 z ¼ z 2 S 0 ( z ) j z ¼ z 2 ¼\u0003 \u0005 e jj @ T e @ z \u0006\r \u0010 \u0010 \u0010 \u0010 z ¼ z 2 (5 : 108) at the upper boundary, z 2 \u0002 500 km, of the region of the ionosphere under consideration. Here, P ¼ ( T e þ T i ) N I is the full pressure of the ionospheric plasma; the angle cos u was introduced at the beginning of this section; and g ¼ 9.81 m = s 2 is the acceleration due to gravity. We should note that without loss of generality we can take u ¼ 0 and h ¼ z , which is almost correct for auroral conditions and approximately correct for the middle-latitude ionosphere. The values J ( z ) and Q 1 ( z ), as well as flows j 0 ( z ) and S 0 ( z ), were considered unchanged after switching on the additional source of electron heating Q from a ground-based facility. In numerical calculations of the system (Equation 5.106) the same boundary conditions as were taken for diffusion and drift and usually used in ionospheric problems [84 – 86] were introduced: the disturbance of electron concentration d N e and temperature d T e is zero at the lower z 1 \u0002 90 km and upper z 2 \u0001 500 km boundaries of the considered ionospheric region. The initial conditions correspond to the absence of density and temperature disturbances at the initial time, i.e., d N e ( z , t ¼ 0) ¼ 0, d T e ( z , t ¼ 0) ¼ 0(5 : 109) It should be noted that in the numerical experiments carried out in Refs.

For the calculations it is convenient to measure the relative energy q ¼ Q = N e in kelvins per second (K = s), called the source capacity , and from Equation 5.110 we obtain the correlation between parameters of the numerical experiment [77]: Q = N e (K = s) \u0002 6 : 5 10 4 h PG (100 MW) L (km) h 2 0 (100 km) N e (10 6 cm \u0003 3 ) (5 : 112) It should be noted that in the given case the source Q ( z ) is located at the fixed altitude h 0 ¼ z 0 during the whole heating process. We compare this case with those where the heating source changes its position and moving into the upper ionosphere simultaneously with the changes of resonance plasma concentration during plasma heating, which is called resonance and adaptive heating [75,77,105].

In both figures the observed time of ionospheric plasma evolution after switching off the source was taken as t ¼ 3 s, i.e., less than the heating time. In all the figures on the left side, the solid lines show the altitudinal (in kilometers) dependence of plasma density N ( z ) ¼ N 0 ( z ) þ d N ( z ) (cm \u0003 3 ). Every heating altitude z 0 corresponds to the plasma density N ( z 0 ), which is indicated on the abscissa axis. The dotted lines indicate the altitudinal dependence of the background ionospheric plasma density N 0 ( z ). In the right-hand panels in Figure 5.49a and b, the altitudinal dependence of the total temperature of electrons T e ( z ) ¼ T e 0 ( z ) þ d T e ( z ) (solid curves) as well as background plasma temperature T e 0 ( z ) (dotted curves) and the altitudinal run of heating source capacity q ( z ), are presented. From the illustrations it can be seen that, with the growth of heat capacity q ( z ), the process of plasma ejection in the heat area increases and the negative concentration area, called cavity , widens and deepens. Thus, for q ¼ 2000 K = s during the heating time t T ¼ 5 s, the depletion of plasma in the heating area is about d N ( z ) = N 0 ( z ) \u0002 0.01; for the heating capacity q ¼ 5000 K = s, it is about d N ( z ) = N 0 ( z ) \u0002 0.03.

Downward plasma disturbances spread no further than h ¼ 160 km. This can be understood because at approximately these altitudes, the character of the recombination process changes radically. In fact, at altitudes greater than 160 km the term describing the recombination losses in Equation 5.106b is proportional to the plasma density. Here, the temperature dependence of the recombination velocity is absent. In contrast, at altitudes less than 160 km, recombination losses become proportional to the square of the plasma density, and the coefficients of dissociative recombination decrease with an increase of temperature (see Chapter 1, where the recombination process is fully described). Therefore, the additional heating at the altitudes less than 160 km produces an increase of plasma density and the creation of plasma enhancements (here according to Ref. [102] the transport processes are insignificant). This effect is seen from Figure 5.50, where the numerical simulations were carried out at an altitude z 0 ¼ 160 km for h PG \u0002 25 MW and t T ¼ 20 s. It is seen that when the temperature of the ionospheric plasma increases in a somewhat small altitudinal range of 150 – 180 km, a plasma density increase occurs compared with the background ionospheric plasma. We will consider now the heating of the ionosphere taking place with the separated sources Q 1 ( z ) and Q 2 ( z ), whose power profiles are exponential [105]: Q ( z ) ¼ Q 1 ( z ) þ Q 1 ( z ) ¼ Q 0 exp \u0003 B ( z \u0003 z 01 ) L 2 T \u0003 B ( z \u0003 z 02 ) L 2 T \u0006\r (5 : 114) All parameters, functions, and boundary conditions are the same as described earlier in the case of local heating. Here, z 01 and z 02 are the altitudes of the greatest heat intensity for the first (at altitude z 01 ¼ 200 km) and second (at altitude z 02 ¼ 240 km) source, respectively. The plasma density redistribution during such a separated heating along altitude is presented in Figure 5.51 for the normalized heating power of heaters q 1 ¼ 2000 K = s and q 2 ¼ 20,000 K = s, respectively. The heating time is t T ¼ 20 s and the time of observation after switching off the heating sources is t ¼ 20 s. It is seen that in the case of separate altitudinal heating, there appear additional plasma pits between source points z 01 and z 02 , i.e., a striated plasma structure at the ionospheric altitudes.

In Figure 5.52, the perturbation of plasma disturbance created at the initial height of the heating source h R ¼ 240 km for effective heating power h PG ¼ 120 MW is presented. Numerical computations were carried out in Ref.

The dotted curve represents the background undisturbed plasma profile, and the solid curve represents the disturbed plasma profile for the moment when the observed time is equal to the heating time, i.e., t ¼ t T ¼ 20 s. As can be seen from Figure 5.52, the location of the heating source is changed according to the change of the resonant plasma density during the heating process and for t ¼ 20 s, the difference between the initial and later location becomes about 40 – 50 km. In the process of floating-up penetration in the upper ionosphere, the reflection point of the wave also moves upward as if penetrating into the depths of the ionosphere [108].

Theoretical investigations of the influence of a powerful radio wave on ionospheric plasma heating [50,51,102,110,111] indicate the possible development of quasi-periodical artificial ionospheric turbulence in the region of heating. In Refs. [76,78], the formation and further spatial and temporal evolution of striated plasma density 3-D structures obtained from numerical and analytical computations were examined on the basis of experimentally determined distance – frequency characteristics of back-scattered signals from the ionospheric F region disturbed by heating effect of a powerful radio beam [55] (described also in Chapters 6 and 7 of this book). Following Refs. [76,78], we will analyze in the following text the evolution of the plasma density in the ionospheric F region created in the field of a powerful HF- wave during local heating using 3-D nonstationary hydrodynamics based on a full self-consistent system of transport equations (Equations 1.5 through 1.12) described in Chapter 1, as well as under conditions of the middle-latitude ionosphere described there and by items a – e described earlier. The difference from the problems investigated in Refs. [50,51,102,110,111] is that in Refs. [76,78] the full set of inhomogeneous equations with parameters dependent on the altitude was taken into account. Moreover, in the proposed rigorous self-consistent model, all characteristic frequencies of the plasma, as well as the recombination coefficient and coefficients of conductivity, are functions of electron temperature, i.e., of the heating process. All these aspects are fully described in Chapter 1 and in Section 5.3.1. As before with the local 1-D heating numerical experiment, we can present the amplitude of the plasma heater (Equation 5.110) through the absorbed radio wave power (Equation 5.111 or 5.112) incident on the ionospheric layer.

Results of numerical simulations are presented in Figure 5.54a and b as lines of equal concentration in the plane ( x 0 z ), i.e., along B 0 (i.e., along the z -axis) and transverse B 0 (i.e., in the E 0 \u000b B 0 -drift direction) at the moment of switching off the heating source t ¼ 10 s (Figure 5.54a) and t ¼ 20 s (Figure 5.54b). So, the total time of heating ( t T ¼ 10 s) and of observation was t total ¼ 30 s (in Figure 5.54b). The ambient geophysical parameters were chosen to satisfy the real conditions in the middle-latitude ionosphere at the observed altitudes [16,19,74]: the ambient electric field E 0 \u0002 5 – 10 mV = m and the neutral wind velocity U m \u0002 50 – 70 m = s. It can be seen that during the heating process the quasi-periodical plasma structure of induced heating irregularities of plasma density strongly elongated along B 0 with characteristic scales ‘ ? \u0002 10 \u0003 500 m is formed. Because in general equations the processes of drift and diffusion were accounted in the process of thermo- diffusion of plasma structure, we may expect generation of the gradient-drift instability (GDI) described in detail in Chapter 2, which, together with the altitudinal dependence of transport coefficients and external geophysical factors, according to Ref. [74], can be responsible for such a grating structure of irregularities with the degree of anisotropy of x ¼ ‘ jj =‘ ? \t 20 \u0003 30. Together, all factors lead to additional deformation and further striation of irregularities, which grow into separate plasmoids stretched in parallel and transversely to the geomagnetic field lines. It is necessary to note that electron density disturbances with different signs may occur at close height levels. The existence of regions with positive plasma disturbances along the x -axis (along E 0 \u000b B 0 direction) is characterized by the influence of boundaries in the process of plasma evolution caused by drift in crossing E 0 \u000b B 0 fields [74]. Again, we obtain here a physically evident effect of short- circular currents, which are created by the flow of charge particles through the undisturbed background plasma and which finally create the depletion region surrounding each plasma irregularity, as can be clearly seen from illustrations presented in Figure 5.54.

We now examine the stage of relaxation of a striated plasma structure (SPS) of irregularities strongly elongated along B 0 in the case of homogeneous unbounded ionospheric plasma, the initial Gaussian profile of which in the moment t ¼ t 0 can be presented in the same symmetrical form relative to the z -axis (along B 0 ), as was done in Section 5.1 for pure diffusion and in Section 5.2 for pure drift, but now taking into account a grid consisting of N inhomogeneities in it: d N ( r , z ,0) ¼ d N 0 X N j ¼ 1 exp \u0003 z 2 =‘ 2 jj \u0003 r \u0007 r 0 j \t 2 \u0011 ‘ 2 ? \u0006\r (5 : 118) Here, r 0 j is the transverse (to B 0 ) coordinate of the center of each irregularity of number j in the SPS; the symbols ‘‘ þ ’’ and ‘‘ \u0003 ’’ correspond to the arrangement of irregularities to the positive and negative directions at the r -axis.

The increase of the number of irregularities in the SPS ( N ¼ 5; Figure 5.55c) at the same time t ¼ 10 s leads to an essential deceleration of the decay of plasma concentration in the center of the SPS ( r ¼ 0). We note that relaxation time of the SPS increases by a factor of 1.5 with N ¼ 5 in comparison with that for a single irregularity. Furthermore, simultaneously with the fundamental deceleration of plasma density attenuation inside the SPS, the appearance of new extrema between the initial irregularities is observed (see Figure 5.55c). Here, at coordinates r 1 ¼\u0003 10 m and r 2 ¼ 10 m there appear two local maxima designed by ‘‘ crests. ’’ The concentration at these two maxima exceeds the concen- tration at the edge irregularities. Thus, d e N (10 m) ¼ 0 : 52, but d e N (40 m) ¼ 0 : 512. The observed numerical effects depend on the initial distance between irregularities inside the SPS (on its scale r 0 ). Thus, when r 0 ¼ 4 ‘ ? (see Figure 5.56) the velocity of SPS decay for N ¼ 5 (five irregularities inside the SPS) is of the same order as that for a single irregularity, and for time t ¼ 10 s, the relative concentration at its maximum is d e N (0) ¼ 0 : 456. For the case r 0 ¼ 4 ‘ ? there are no additional extrema between the initial irregularities inside the SPS; the attenuation and spreading are also symmetrical. From comparison between the calculations presented in Figures 5.55 and 5.56, it is seen that the boundary effects do not exist when the plasma density inside the SPS exceeds the plasma concentration outside it. Additional calculations made in Ref. [78] showed that for r 0 \t 4 ‘ ? the SPS spreads analogously to a single irregularity. It becomes clear if, according to Refs. [17 – 20], we return to Section 5.1 and consider the spreading of a single irregularity strongly stretched along B 0 (with the degree of anisotropy x \t 10 2 ). We will find for this irregularity that the spreading process transverse to B 0 is determined by the transverse ion diffusion (ion-controlled), but the character of attenuation at the maximum (in the center) of this irregularity is electron-controlled. When at the distance (or less) of the Larmor radius of the ions, r Hi , additional irregularities are placed near the existing irregularities (as occurs in the SPS with r 0 ¼ 2 ‘ ? ), the transverse ion diffusion becomes difficult because the ions of each irregularity ‘‘ screen ’’ the transverse diffusion ion flows from the irregularities adjacent to it inside SPS. In this case, the character of diffusion spreading at the SPS scale r 0 \u0001 r Hi is determined by the polarization 140 160 240 260 z , km 70 50 30 \u0001 30 \u0001 50 \u0001 110 90 110 L = 10 km, d = 10 m, r / d = 4, N = 5 r , m N max2 = 4.52 × 10 \u0001 1 N max1 = 4.56 × 10 \u0001 1 3.3 × 10 \u0001 1 2.0 × 10 \u0001 1 1.0 × 10 \u0001 1 N max3 = 4 . 34 × 10 \u0001 1 N max5 = 4.34 × 10 \u0001 1 N max4 = 4.52 × 10 \u0001 1 \u0001 \u0001 90 90 \u0001 90 220 220 220 180 180 180 \u0001 70 70 \u0001 70 Figure 5.56 Evolution of a grid of plasma disturbances with distance between them exceeding the gyroradius of plasma ions.

We also stress that when the SPS scale r 0 \u0002 ‘ ? , the character of plasma density attenuation for N > 5 becomes slower, namely, for t ¼ 10 s. Moreover, the increase of the number of irregularities in the SPS for N > 5 does not lead to an essential change of the character of plasma density attenuation at the SPS center (this fact will also be shown in Chapter 6 during the analysis of the experimental data). In Chapter 6, we will present the modern methods, radiophysical and optical, based on ground- based, rocket, and satellite facilities, employed in studying the main characteristics of ionospheric irregularities of various origins, artificial and natural, as well as the methods of investigation of geophysical characteristics of the ionosphere based on observations of evolution of such irregular- ities in the space and time domains.

For the prediction of the key parameters of such channels, it is important to understand the processes accompanying the generation and further evolution of ionospheric irregularities of various origins, natural or artificial, and to predict how they affect radio signals transmitted through the ionosphere at different operational frequencies. The processes associated with generation of plasma irregularities, such as diffusion, drift, and thermodiffusion, were analysed in detail in Chapter 5. In the present chapter, modern methods will be described, using ground-based radio and optical facilities as well as satellite facilities developed in recent decades to predict the main parameters of plasma irregularities. These included locations of irregularities in the ionosphere, the degree of plasma perturbations induced by irregularities with respect to the background plasma, the shape and time of relaxation (or lifetime) for future prediction of the key parameters of probing waves sent through the disturbed ionospheric region, such as reflection and scattering, absorption, fading, and so on. To predict these parameters more precisely, different radio and optical methods and the corresponding facilities were used during experimental investigations. Many modern methods have been devised in recent decades for studying the irregular structure of the ionosphere, equatorial, middle-latitude, and high-latitude, based on conventional iono- spheric stations and ionosonde sounding, satellite interferometers and ground-based radar systems, coherent and incoherent, and in situ rocket and satellite probes. To name one, ionosondes with linear frequency modulation of the transmitted signals with the help of which the authors of this book for many years investigated plasma irregularities, naturally and artificially induced in the ionosphere (see Chapters 7 and 8).

It is evident, taking into account limiting length of our book and its specific content related to radio propagation through ionospheric radio channels with fading, that we cannot cover all experiments and numerous theoretical explanations of the phenomena under discussion. We also understand that the broad spectrum of geophysical and radiophysical phenomena cannot be covered by this book. We concentrate our effort on only those experimental results that (1) give a systematic description of the corresponding precise experimental observations of natural and artificially induced plasma irregularities; (2) present rigorous of the phenomenon under observa- tion; and (3) present adequate theoretical explanations of the observed phenomena. In our opinion such an approach would attract the attention of the reader to existing problems, how they have been resolved up to the present, and what remains to be done in the future. In other words, we will concentrate our efforts on the analysis of those parameters and characteristics of ionospheric irregularities that finally allow for establishing numerous applications in the process of the performance of the long-distance ionospheric channels, as well as of the land – satellite communi- cation links in different ionospheric latitudes. We begin with investigations of the artificial irregularities generated during the heating of the E and F layers of the ionosphere by powerful radiation from ground-based HF facilities [1 – 18]. We will then describe experiments on rocket injection of ion clouds in Earth ’ s ionosphere during active space experiments [19 – 37]. The main goal of such experiments was mostly to understand and then to estimate the main geophysical factors in the ionosphere, such as the ambient electric and magnetic fields, as well as the neutral winds, vertical and horizontal, in the ionosphere by observing different stages of evolution and dynamics of artificially induced plasma clouds. In this chapter we will also introduce the experimental study of parameters of natural iono- spheric inhomogeneities based on how they are affected by radio propagation through the disturbed ionospheric regions. It should be noted that a wide spectrum of sporadic plasma irregularities has been found experimentally in the high-latitude ionosphere [38 – 47], the quasi-stationary natural H E inhomogeneities and meteor trails in the middle-latitude ionosphere [48 – 51], and the bubbles and sporadic E and F layers in the equatorial electrojet regions [52 – 61]. All these affect in different ways radio waves passing through disturbed ionospheric regions, causing the radiophysical phenomena such as signal attenuation, absorption, scattering and diffraction, aspects that will be considered in further chapters on ionospheric propagation channels performance (Chapter 7), the corresponding optical and radio devices for investigation of the natural and artificial phenomena occurring in the ionosphere (Chapter 8), and the effects of different types of ionospheric irregularities on these radiophysical phenomena occurring in land – satellite communication (Chapter 9). 6.1 Radio and Optical Methods of Studying Artificially Induced Irregularities in the Ionosphere 6.1.1 Radio Methods for Diagnostics of Heating-Induced Irregularities We begin with methods of radio diagnostics of formation and relaxation stages of plasma irregularities induced in the ionosphere by powerful short-wave radiation (called pump wave ) from ground-based facilities that have been developed by numerous investigators [62 – 83] for study of both geophysical and radiophysical phenomena in the irregular inhomogeneous ionosphere.

As is well known from the literature [84 – 89], the effect of cross-modulation occurs in the ionosphere, where the powerful radio wave radiation due to heating ionospheric plasma can change the collisional absorption of the probing waves sent through the disturbed heated region (DHR), because the coefficient of absorption of the probing wave, G , in the general formula of wave intensity I ¼ I 0 e \u0001 G (6 : 1) is related to the collisional frequency of plasma particles, electrons, ions, and neutrals, n e ¼ n ei þ n em ,as G ¼ 2 p e 2 m e ð N n e ( T ) v 2 þ n 2 e ( T ) d z cos u ( z ) (6 : 2) where u is the angle of incident of the probing wave at the ionospheric layer; the z -axis is directed vertically; all other parameters have been defined in Chapter 1. Hence, owing to the location of the DHR by probing waves, it is possible to obtain information on the parameters of the disturbed plasma region (all details can be found in Refs. [84 – 87]). Only a short time is needed to establish the quasi-stationary temperature and its relaxation, ( d \u0002 n e ) \u0001 1 \u0003 10 \u0001 3 s, thus allowing the use of the new approach of study of altitudinal profiles of n e ( z ) based on the time tomography. This approach is based on lighting by probing pulse signals of the ionospheric regions that were earlier disturbed by the short pulses of 100 – 500 m s of powerful radio waves [90]. The probing pulses radiate with a time delay relative to the powerful pulses perturbing the ionosphere at altitude z , while passing through it (in the moment t ¼ z = c ) crossing DHR during direct propagation and then after reflection from the upper layer of the ionosphere at the different moments of time relative to the moment of heating by the pump wave. Based on the limiting properties of the wave speed, c ¼ 3 \u0002 10 8 m = s, this effect allows for obtaining the altitudinal dependence of wave parameters [90] for small periods of changing of T e and n e in the D layer of the ionosphere. Another method of investigating disturbed ionospheric regions is by using heating-induced irregularities. From Equation 2.1, Chapter 2, the oscillatory speed v V of plasma electrons (ions, because plasma is quasi-neutral) in the field of the powerful radio wave, E V , relates linearly to this field, and for the periodically changing electron collision frequency n e associated with these oscillatory movements, the alternate electric field can occur at the modulation frequency V : j V \u0004 n e V n e eN ( V e 0 \u0001 V i 0 )(6 : 3) where in n e V = n e \u0005 5 T e = 6 T e 0 , T e and T e 0 are, respectively, the disturbed (after heating) and nondisturbed (before heating) temperature of electrons; all other parameters having been defined in Chapters 1 and 2. The current described by Equation 6.3 leads to the variation of electromag- netic waves with frequency V . The conditions of observations of this radiation at frequency V depend on conditions of capturing of this radiation by the waveguide Earth-ionosphere and propagation inside it. We will defer a treatment of capturing and further propagation of radio waves within such a waveguide to Chapter 7. Here, we will only mention that conditions for obtaining such a radiation at the ground surface, i.e., of removing it from the waveguide, are defined by this frequency V , depending on how the width of the skin layer inside the waveguide has changed. This width controls the level of lower-frequency signal at the upper (ionospheric) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 255 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i Modern Radiophysical Methods of Investigation of Ionospheric Irregularities & 255"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"bound of the waveguide. For sufficiently low frequencies V , the main contribution in the field at the ground surface gives the current momentum of the source, R j V d z , which is defined by the horizontal dimensions of the disturbed heated region (DHR) and the characteristic height interval, D z ¼ z max \u0001 z min , of the ionospheric DHR (along the z -axis) [91]. The structure of j V ( z ) also depends on the relationship between the Hall current ( j H \u0005 U m \u0006 B 0 or j H \u0005 E 0 \u0006 B 0 ) and the Pedersen current ( j P \u0005 E 0 ). This relation determines changes in the polarization of the receiving radiation [91]. Multiple reflections from the ionosphere (as an upper part of the waveguide) and Earth ’ s surface (as a bottom part of waveguide) of powerful pulses, changing conductivity in the ionospheric current system, cause the series of low-frequency responses at the receiver. Creation of powerful ground-based facilities operating at low frequencies (LH) for modification of the ionosphere under heating at frequencies close to the gyrofrequency of electrons makes possible continuous diagnostics of middle-latitude current systems in the ionosphere. The artificial radio radiation of low frequencies from the modified (after heating) ionospheric regions can be received successfully, as shown in Figure 6.1, according to experiments carried out in Ref. [66]. Here, the heating of the ionosphere was performed by short pulses ( t 1 ¼ 2.5 m s, Figure 6.1a; t 2 ¼ 0.3 m s, Figure 6.1b) from the transmitter with effective power of P ¼ P 0 G ¼ 240 MW ( G is the gain of antenna). Such experiments allow information to be obtained about the DHR using artificial electromagnetic radiation of the ionosphere (ARI) and also the structure of the ambient electric field at altitudes z < 100 km. Another method used in the diagnostics of the lower ionosphere disturbed by a pump-wave heater from ground-based HF radar is the use of artificial periodical irregularities (APIs) created in the field of powerful radio waves. The first to predict the possibility of generation of such heating instabilities in the lower ionosphere was Vilensky, who described and summarized this in a series of joint investigations by him and his colleagues from NIRFI (Gorky, USSR) [62 – 71]. This method- ology, based on numerous systematically prepared experiments, allows for studying a set of important parameters of the lower ionosphere using effects of scattering of probing waves by APIs. For example, in the D region ( z < 70 – 80 km), observations of the relaxation time of API allow for finding the coefficient of attractions of electrons to molecules of neutrals after switching off the transmitter. The Doppler measurements allow for searching the vertical motions and displace- ments of API during their spreading and relaxation (see Section 5.3). Moreover, using different regimes of switching the electromagnetic heater on and off allows for measuring the vertical 0 (a) (b) 123 3 H N - S ( pT ) H N - S ( pT ) \u0001 3 0 2 1 H 2 H 3 H 4 H 5 H 6 H \u0001 2 0 4 t , m s 1234 t , m s Figure 6.1 Artificial radio radiation received at low frequencies from the modified ionosphere after its heating by short pulses with durations: (a) t 1 ¼ 2.5 m s, and (b) t 2 ¼ 0.3 m s.

At the E layer (at altitudes 90 – 150 km) the velocity of ambipolar diffusion and drift along B 0 can be estimated on the basis of the observations of the velocity of relaxation of API. In the F layer, where a collision regime prevails, the nonstationary API excites ion acoustic waves. Their decay is determined by the collisional frequency of ions, n im , and by the collisionless attenuation at the heating ions. The latter related to the fact that the velocity of ion sound waves, C s ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ( T e þ T i ) = M i p ,for T e \u0004 T i , is close to the thermal velocity of ions, n Ti \u0004 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi T i = M i p ,where,as mentioned in Chapter 2, for the Maxwellian plasma (i.e., in a steady-state regime), the derivative of the distribution function @ f i ( n ) =@ n , defining Landau decay, is maximal [84 – 87]. Therefore, the value of this decay characterizes the ratio T e = T i in the ionosphere [84]. Using additional heating of the regular ionosphere by the pump electromagnetic wave, an increase by tens percent of T e with respect to T i (due to higher thermomobility; see Chapter 2) allows for separating the regimes of collisionless and collisional absorption because T i gives information on the collisionless and T e on collision absorption. Finally, this allows for estimating values n im , T e and T i , because n im \u0005 ffiffiffiffiffi T i p [92].

Therefore, between frequencies of excited wave, f ex , and probing wave, f pr , the following constraint could be satisfied [67]: f ex n o , x ( f ex ) ¼ f pr n x , o ( f pr ). Taking into account that in the quasi-longitudinal approximation n o , x is proportional to the square of the electron plasma frequency v e 0 , and the latter is proportional to concentration of electrons N e and, finally, using this method of backscattering from API, the electron content in the ionospheric disturbed region can be estimated. So, using the diagnostic of API by probing waves above the sites of the location of heating facilities, the main parameters of the ionosphere in the DHR can be estimated. In Ref. [92] the idea was proposed of using perspective excitation of API elongated along geomagnetic field lines (namely, during vertical excitation in the region of the magnetic equator), which could be more intensive, as well as moving API created by radiation of two waves with close frequencies. Diagnostics of Large-Scale Heating-Induced Plasma Structures . The possibility of generating the regions with enhancement of electron concentration in the E and lower F layers during the heating of the ionosphere by pump electromagnetic wave was pointed out in Refs. [86,87]. Some studies [64,93] also indicated the possibility of creating a region with depletion of plasma concentration because of thermodiffusion occurring during heating by pump radio wave, and on using this region as a radio lens. Experimental investigations of regions with enhancement and depletion of electron concentration using methods of vertical and oblique radio sounding of the ionosphere were carried out from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1990s [1 – 11,93 – 97]. In some of these experiments facilities for incoherent scattering of radio waves were used for studying large-scale plasma disturbances with the horizontal dimensions L h \u0005 u A z , where z is the height of heating and u A the width of the diagram of antenna of power transmitter. Continuous experiments were carried out in Arecibo, where the powerful beam at P 0 ¼ 300 kW with the gain G ¼ 23 dB was radiated at the frequency f ex \u0004 3.175 MHz with the value of power inside the beam of 50 m W = m 2 at the height of the DHR [2 – 5].

It is evident that during local heating a depletion region of plasma concentration (i.e., the negative disturbance) occurs, the effect of which was fully predicted by the self-consistent model of local heating described in Section 5.3. Here, following this model and taking into account the parameters of the ionosphere above Arecibo, as well as the parameters of the experiment presented in Figure 6.3, we present results of numerical simulation of the real heating experiment in Figure 6.4a for the concentration and in Figure 6.4b for the temperature of plasma versus the height of the local heating. It is evident that the computer experiment based on the proposed model is a good predictor of the existence of deep cavity in the nondisturbed profile of plasma density and increase of the temperature of plasma from 750 to 2500 K (in the real experiment the electron temperature was increased from T e 0 \u0004 T i 0 ¼ 800 K to T e \u0004 2400 K), and decreasing to the nondisturbed value again after switching off the powerful transmitter.

When separations with the resonance frequency f ex \u0004 3.175 MHz were performed, the specific dynamics of the cavity region was observed. Thus, in Figure 6.5 the dynamics of the cavity region and its structure after switching off of the excited wave are presented with separations from f ex \u0004 3.175 MHz: curve 1 corresponds to separation at 1.2 kHz; curve 2 to 1.7 kHz; curve 3 to 2.2 kHz; curve 4 to 2.7 kHz; curve 5 to 3.2 kHz; and curve 6 to 4.2 kHz. This heating regime can be predicted by the model of the so-called adaptive heating of plasma described in Section 5.3. Here, the extrema of the plasma profile within the cavity following the density corresponds to the current resonance frequency. With increase of the frequency separation (from 1.2 to 4.2 kHz), the corresponding extremum moves downward along the height of the ionosphere. We should point out that the main heating of electrons can be done either by the acceleration of plasma particles by plasma waves (thermal instabilities; see Chapter 2) or by the creation at the relaxation stage of the polarized (inner) field E p jj due to the existence of longitudinal currents or the ambient electrical field E 0 . Because amplification of the electric field within the cavity is E p jj \u0005 E 0 ( N = N 0 ), and the stationary temperature T e \u0005 E 2 p jj = n 2 e , and accounting for changes of n e ( T e ), we finally arrive at the fact that for N 0 = N \u0003 0.3 the ratio T e = T e 0 \u0003 10 n 2 e 0 = n 2 e ( T e ).

Measurements of Parameters of Moderate-Scale Artificial Irregularities . The artificial irregularities of the ionosphere of moderate scale 0 : 1km <‘ ? < 10 km can change the structure of the signal reflected from the ionosphere (in the same manner as the large-scale irregularities) during vertical and oblique soundings of the disturbed ionospheric regions, as well as cause changes in phase and amplitude of signals of orbital (LEO and MEO) or geostationary satellites (see details in Chapter 9). Simultaneous observations of amplitude and phase allow for gathering information about the power of moderate-heating-induced irregularities up to the scales of ‘ ? ¼ 3 \u0007 10 ðÞ km, because disturb- ances of signal phase are not affected by the influence of Fresnel ’ s filtering, which limits occurrence of irregularities with scale ‘ ? > ffiffiffiffiffiffi l \u0001 R p at the variations of signal amplitude. Here, \u0001 R ¼ R 1 R 2 = ( R 1 þ R 2 ), where R 1 and R 2 are distances from the transmitter and the receiver to the layer with irregularities [88,99]. Information on spectral characteristics of such irregularities using illuminating of the iono- sphere by in situ satellite probes will be discussed in the following text. We now only point out that such observations allow for studying dynamics of artificial irregularities at different altitudes from the source of their excitation (from the levels of reflection of the powerful radio wave from the ionosphere) [79]. Using such a methodology, high velocities ( n > (0.5 – 1) km = s) of the vertical transport of the agent responsible for generation of artificial irregularities were observed in Ref. [79]. Similar results can be obtained by using oblique or vertical sounding of the DHRs by signals of different frequencies [70]. The latter relates to the fact that the main contribution to the signal amplitude and phase fluctuations during reflections from the ionosphere introduce irregularities located near the level of wave reflection, first of all, irregularities with ‘ ? \b 1 \u0007 5 ðÞ km. Therefore, the observations carried out at different frequencies offer the possibility of obtaining altitudinal resolution of the DHR. From the corresponding ionograms of vertical or oblique sounding, the characteristic features of the moderate-scale irregularities can easily be found. Thus, the main characteristic of such turbulences is the phenomenon of diffusivity of the frequency ionograms, defined in the literature as E spread or F spread , depending of the height of heating and observation (see Chapter 7). This phenomenon is related to spread of the pulse signal because of reflection and scattering from irregularities located mainly near the level of reflection of sounding pulses from the ionosphere (see details in Chapter 9). The time of excitation of moderate-scale irregularities increases with an increase in their scale ‘ ? [78]. Therefore, after studying ionograms at different time intervals after switching the powerful radio transmitter on and off, selective influence of the irregularities of various scales on ionograms of vertical and oblique sounding of the ionosphere at the DHR can be found. As shown during experiments (see detailed analysis in Chapter 7), diffusivity at the ionograms occurs at moments less than 1 min after the commencement of the heating process. However, the occurrence of strong F spread related to the time of excitation exceeding 3 – 7 min is also observed (see Chapter 7). The observed effect of easy excitation of F spread and increase of its lifetime in the nocturnal ionosphere compared with the daytime ionosphere again demonstrate a correction of the main theory presented in Section 5.3, according to which in the nocturnal ionosphere effects of ionization and recombination are insufficient compared with transport processes. Therefore, in the nocturnal ionosphere all transport processes Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 261 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i Modern Radiophysical Methods of Investigation of Ionospheric Irregularities & 261"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"(thermodiffusion, diffusion, and drift) are easily developed with respect to the daytime ionosphere, where the recombination process depends strongly on the temperature of plasma and decreases with an increase of heating power. Radio Methods of Studying Small-Scale Artificial Ionospheric Turbulence . We will define small- scale artificial ionospheric turbulence (AIT), which usually occurs near the level of reflection of the excited wave, as the irregularity, the transverse scale of which is described by ‘ ? < l ex : w , where l ex.w is the wavelength of the excited wave in vacuum. As was mentioned earlier and in Chapter 2, the AIT is generated during the transformation of energy of the powerful radio wave into energy of the plasma wave. Finally, this process defines the main method of AIT diagnostics, called the method of anomalous weakness (due to anomalous absorption) of the exciting and probing waves. The effect of anomalous absorption is stronger for waves with ordinary polarization according to its behavior in the region of transformation of energy (see Figure 2.2, Chapter 2). The anomalous weakness of the exciting waves, after exceeding the power limit of parametric striction instability (see definition in Chapter 2) of about P eff \t h PG \u0004 80 MW, can achieve 70% – 80%. At the same time, the anomalous weakness of the probing waves occurs only if their frequency differs from the frequency of exciting waves by not more than a few kilohertz. The fact that the probing waves with frequency f p.w , which differs from that of excited waves f ex.w only at several kilohertz, are not displaying any anomalous weakness shows that there is a narrow-height region in the ionosphere where the striction parametric instability can be developed [78]. This experimentally obtained fact was proved by direct measurements of plasma waves using the method of incoherent scattering and an experimentally obtained narrow spectrum of scattering waves. During their further evolution, and after scattering at the heating-inducted irregularities and leading to the large-scale striation of the disturbed plasma regions, plasma waves fill large ranges of observation angles and height intervals in the ionosphere (as seen in Figure 6.5). These phenomena cause instability in the region of high-hybrid resonance (HHR) and generation of field-aligned (along B 0 ) irregularities, which then cause transformation of both exciting waves and probing waves into plasma waves (in the sufficiently wide spectral range – up to hundreds of kilohertz). Times of development of anomalous absorption of the probing waves of various frequencies are determined by the growth of intensity of irregularities of various scales generated at different altitudes. Therefore, the dynamics of the anomalous weakness (absorption) of the probing waves illuminating the disturbed heated region (DHR) provides much information about the spectrum of irregularities formed at the altitudinal range occupied by DHR. When the intensity of heating-induced irregularities is strong enough, the anomalous absorp- tion can also be observed for the extraordinary probing waves (i.e., waves with extraordinary polarization). In this case the weakness of the wave occurs due to the scattering process, and not by transformation into plasma waves. Diagnostics of AIT using the method of anomalous absorption of the exciting and probing waves provides information on the small horizontal part of DHR (with an area similar to the first Fresnel zone). We mentioned earlier another method using artificial low-frequency radiation of the ionosphere (see Figure 6.1). Observations in Refs. [78,100] of the dynamics of ARI (see also Figure 6.1) in the region of negative and positive ARI frequency deviations from the frequency of the exciting wave, consisting of informa- tion on the processes of splitting (and grouping) of plasma waves, and their penetration in the upper ionosphere along altitude caused by photoelectrons, are the problems which in present time do not find their full understanding and physical interpretation. At the same time, at the Arecibo [1 – 6] and Tromse [101 – 103] experimental sites, where powerful radiolocators for diagnostics of artificial plasma disturbances in the ionosphere were used, more complete information about distribution of N ( z ) and T e,i ( z ), and about ion acoustic Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 262 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i 262 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"and plasma waves, was obtained having at the same time evident description of the physical phenomena. We did not go into all details presented in Refs. [1 – 6,101 – 103]. Another effective method of investigations of AIT, mostly stretched along B 0 , is the method of specular scattering of HF and VHF waves, which will be described in more detail in Chapter 7. Now, following Refs. [7,8,80 – 82], we will direct the reader ’ s attention to radiophysical methods of estimation of parameters of the process of relaxation of AIT, and their lifetime dependence on the initial dimensions of created heating-induced irregularities filling the heating region. Thus, in Figure 6.6a the dependence of the amplitude of scattered probing wave A s during the short heating of the ionosphere by pulse with period t heat ¼ 0.1 s, normalized on the value A s 0 (corresponding to the stationary process) and presented in dB, versus the time of observation after switching off the heater is shown for the different intervals between the further heatings, T p : curve 1 — T p ¼ 4.9 s; curve 2 — T p ¼ 9.9 s; and curve 3 — T p ¼ 19.9 s. In Figure 6.6b the dependence of the time of achieving maximum value of A s , denoted by t m , is shown versus the moments of heating T p according to Ref. [81]. From Figure 6.6a it is seen that after switching off the heater, the amplitude A s has a tendency to increase. At the same time, t m depends on the time of pause between heatings. The velocity of relaxation of A s also depends on T p . Thus, from the moments of 1 to 2 s, the fast relaxation of A s is observed with the coefficient D \u0004 3 \u0002 10 3 cm 2 = s, whereas in its further relaxation the velocity of the decay becomes faster and is determined by the coefficient of diffusion D \u0005 ‘ 2 ? = (2 p ) 2 t \u0004 1 : 4 \u0002 10 3 cm 2 = s (where t is the time of diffusion relaxation of A s defined in Chapter 5, and ‘ ? \u0004 3 : 3 m [81]). 01234 t , s \u0001 15 (a) (b) t m , s 02.07.1985 1.0 D = 3 \u0002 10 3 cm 2 /s 0.8 \u0001 25 0.6 D = 1.4 \u0002 10 3 cm 2 /s 0.4 1 \u0001 35 2 0.2 3 A s / A so , dB 5101520 T p , s Figure 6.6 (a) Time dependence of the normalized amplitude of the scattered signal for different time intervals between heating pulses, T p : 1 corresponds to 4.9 s, 2 corresponds to 9.9 s, and 3 corresponds to 19.9 s, and (b) time of the amplitude of scattered signal to achieve its maximum value, t m , versus T p .

Hence, with an increase of pause between heatings (with increase of T p ) during the achievement of the next short heating process, larger irregularities have faded away. Therefore, their influence on excitation and relaxation of irregularities with smaller scales is the evidence of the transformation of energy along the spectrum of turbulence. As shown in Ref. [89], the direction and velocity of this transformation is defined by the initial form of turbulence spectra. Results of experiments [80 – 82,89] mentioned earlier showed that observations of AIT excited by various regimes of heating, simulated numer- ically in Section 5.3, can help in finding mechanisms of the formation of turbulence spectra and ability to control such spectra.

Furthermore, differences in dependence of relaxation time for diurnal and nocturnal ionosphere, as well as the height dependence of relaxation time of AIT obtained experimentally, are the subject of the unified theoretical explanations. The series of experiments was carried out on the radio path Kiev – Gorky – Beltsi (former USSR) in 1985 using the method of back specular scattering of radio waves [7,8] because the transverse scales ‘ ? responsible for the specular scattering corresponded approximately to the half-wavelength of the probing waves (according to Bragg ’ s law). The heating region was generated using a Sura heating facility located near Gorky and operating at frequencies 4.8 – 5.8 MHz. The geometry of the path corresponded to conditions close to the back scattering of radio waves. Because the operational frequencies of the probing waves used for diagnostics of artificial irregularities were in the range f ¼ 11 – 23 MHz; the corresponding transverse scales ‘ ? were equal, ‘ ? ¼ l = 2 ¼ 6 : 5 \u0001 14 m. The observations were made in diurnal and nocturnal time in different seasons. Thus, the experiments presented in Figure 6.8 were carried out in (1) May 1985 at 19:00 – 21:00 and (2) November 1985 at (a) 10:00 – 11:00, (b) 13:00 – 16:00, and (c) December 1985 at 10:00 – 11:00 (local time). All figures show the experimental relations of the average relaxation time t r versus the transverse scale ‘ ? (denoted in Chapter 5 by d ) of artificial irregularities.

However, in the case d > d 1 the dependence is close to t r \u0005 d 1 = 2 , which corresponds roughly with the value L 2 = 8 D i jj , where D i jj is the coefficient of longitudinal ion diffusion. Thus, for large scales d , where the value t r depends weakly on d , the main role in relaxation of artificial irregularity is longitudinal ion diffusion. The weak dependence of relaxation time t r on d can also be explained by weak dependence of characteristic scale L on d ( L / d 1 = 4 ), following from the theoretical analysis [104,105]. If we now denote the critical scale d by ‘ ? * , as done in Refs. [7,8], we can present this critical scale according to experiments carried out in the aforementioned references. Thus, the critical transverse scale ‘ ? * and the relaxation time t r of artificial irregularities, on which the polynomial dependence of the relaxation time changes from t r \u0005 ‘ 1 : 5 \u0001 2 ? for ‘ ? <‘ ? * to t r \u0005 ‘ 0 : 5 ? for ‘ ? >‘ ? * , were estimated as follows: for the daytime ionosphere ‘ ? * ¼ 10 \u0001 25 m and t r ¼ 3 \u0001 10 s; in the evening time ‘ ? * decreases to 6 – 10 m and t r ¼ 7 – 15 s; and for the nocturnal ionosphere ‘ ? * < 3m and t r ¼ 2 \u0001 3 s.

Following these results, in Refs. [7,8], the experimental altitudinal dependence of the relaxation time (curve 1 in Figure 6.9) was obtained and compared with that dependence obtained using theoretical analysis presented in Section 5.1 based on the aforementioned references (dotted curve 2 in Figure 6.9).

This dependence is illustrated in Figure 6.10, which shows that t r in the altitude region 200 – 250 km decreases sharply from day to night. As can also be noted, the experimentally obtained diurnal dependence of the relaxation time is the same for any season of the year (see signs indicating various months). All experiments, carried out in the period 1984 – 1987 [7,8,78 – 83], showed that, as estimated from experiments, the critical scale ‘ ? * is close to the limiting scale d kr \u0005 3( D e ? = D i jj ) 1 = 2 L obtained from Equations 5.104 and 5.105, which determines the transition from a longitudinal electron mode to a transverse ion mode of diffusion of weak plasma diffusion [105]. At the same time the theory predicts a three-mode stage of heating-induced irregularities relaxation with two critical transverse scales, d 1 \t ‘ ? * and d 2 \t ‘ ? ** , whereas the experiment predicts only two-mode dependence with only one critical scale d 1 \t ‘ ? * . To resolve this contra- diction between theory and experiment, in Ref. [106], a grid of irregularities, described in detail in Section 5.3, was proposed. According to this model, the grid or striated plasma structure (SPS) consisting of N separate irregularities spreads in such a manner that only two-mode dependence on ‘ ? is obtained from a numerical analysis of the problem. Here, as in Section 5.1, for a single irregularity, the lifetime of SPS, t , was estimated from the level of plasma density attenuation at its maximum until it fell e \u0001 1 times from its initial value (i.e., when d N (0,0,0) ¼ nN (0,0, t ), n ¼ e ,5, etc). Thus, as presented in Figure 6.11, for N changing from 1 to 5, the relaxation time of the SPS at its maximum ( z ¼ 0, r ¼ 0) has three-mode dependence with ‘ ? * and ‘ ? ** only for N \u0003 2, whereas for N \b 5 it is analogous to the case of N ¼ 3 and N ¼ 4, having only a two-mode increase with ‘ ? * \u0004 ‘ ? ** . In fact, as follows from illustrations presented in Figure 6.11, the character of attenuation of the SPS with the numbers of irregularities inside N \b 5 and with a transverse scale of each irregularity, ‘ ? , less than the SPS scale, r 0 and less than Larmor ion radius, r Hi , emanates from two-stage relaxation process with critical scales ‘ ? * \u0004 5 \u0001 10 m and ‘ ? ** \u0004 100 m to one-stage with break point ‘ ? * \u0004 ‘ ? ** \b 10 m (as was found in Ref.

However, not all natural phenomena and conditions occur often enough to allow for carrying out continuous and regular observations. This led to the idea of re-creating the same situations found in natural conditions in the nearby Earth space which can be modeled (as was done by heating of the ionosphere by the injection of pump electromagnetic waves discussed earlier) to the injection of the artificial ion clouds and beams from rockets into the ionospheric and magnetospheric plasma. Such experiments open the possibility of imitating natural phenomena and the diagnostics of the near-the-Earth plasma. Thus, the artificial cloud can be regarded as a probe to investigate the main characteristics of the space near Earth, such as ambient electrical and magnetic fields, their disturbances, the density and temperature of plasma, its wave properties as well as nonlinear phenomena occurring in plasma under its perturbation. Experiments for creating artificial plasma structures in the Earth ionosphere began at the end of the 1950s and continued until the middle of the 1990s [19 – 36,111 – 117]. Today, extensive experimental data has accumulated and adequate physical models developed, thus allowing the comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions. The first experiments carried out from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1970s at altitudes 120 – 170 km [19 – 21] showed that the more suitable material for the creation of artificial ionized clouds is ions of barium (Ba þ ), because their characteristic properties are better for optical and spectral observations compared to other ions (strontium, cadmium, etc.). Then, a cycle of further experiments described in Refs. [22 – 31] was carried out, which estimated the influence of ambient electric and magnetic fields on the ionized component of the injected cloud and determined the wind of the neutrals in the ionosphere at heights of 120 – 200 km following observations of the neutral component of the injected cloud. We will now introduce the reader to the problems that are directly related to investigations of the process of evolution of strong plasma perturbations of the ionosphere created by injections of ion clouds from a special geophysical rocket. It is not so important for the process of creation of such ion clouds, but the methods of investigation of their parameters, as well as characteristics of the background ionospheric plasma during the process of spatial and temporal evolution of clouds. Nonlinear Evolution of Injected Plasma Clouds in the Ionosphere . Detailed experiments of rocket injections based on visual observations of the evolution of the injected plasma clouds allowing defining a full picture of relative movements of the neutral and ionized components of clouds, and their spreading in the space and time domains, were studied systematically in the United States [19 – 26] and the former USSR [30 – 37]. In Ref. [24] the rocket experiment carried out at the height z ¼ 194 km at the Florida experimental site in 1967 is described. Detailed observations were carried out at three experimental sites of observation, S N , S W , and S E , during 930 s from the moment of cloud creation. Each site of measurement (see Figure 6.12) is shown in the coordinate system with direction zA to the North, zB to the East, zC vertically upward, zD along B 0 , and zE in the direction of the sun. The positions of these observation sites were as follows: S N is about 100 km in a northerly direction, S W about 150 km in a westerly direction, and S E about 150 km in an easterly direction from the region of injection. Site S E was oriented to the vector B 0 , which passes through the point of injection and has a magnetic declination of \u0004 3 8 and a magnetic inclination of \u0004 61.5 8 . As can seen from the three groups of isolines on the right of equal optical lightness (or isolines of equal density) observed separately from three experimental sites and the corresponding analysis of experimental data during 930 s after creation, the center of the cloud descends with a velocity of 27 m = s at the height of 168 km (from 194 km) along the lines of geomagnetic field B 0 and forms a columnlike trail with the plasma concentration of \u0004 10 10 cm \u0001 3 , which was observed at the height of 160 – 190 km along B 0 .

Crossings of all these coordinates define four lines of the cylinder and three layers parallel to Earth ’ s surface at the point of injection at different altitudes, 160, 170, and 190 km, as shown in Figure 6.13. This simple model of the cloud with strata was chosen to observe the cloud simultaneously from all experimental sites S N , S W , and S E (Figure 6.12). Why is it important? Because, for example, from S W and S E through 930 s, the peaks of brightness at heights 165 – 168 to 185 km were observed; from S W the bottom ends of strata were better observed, whereas from S E the upper ends of strata were better observed at altitudes up to 185 km. Despite the absence of a good height resolution at the site S E , the angle dimensions and thickness of each strata were estimated more accurately. Additional observations of evolution of the ion cloud (see Figure 6.14) have shown that during t ¼ 500 s the ambipolar diffusion across B 0 occurs with the velocity of diffusion, which is only about 10% of the velocity of diffusion of the neutral barium cloud. After 500 s the cloud becomes deformed, as is clearly seen in Figure 6.14. The upper part of the cloud had a Gaussian profile with a radius of about 0.8 km, whereas the bottom part of the cloud, also having a Gaussian profile, had a radius of about 3.7 km. During the time of drift spreading of 500 s, as seen from Figure 6.14, at the fear of the cloud, a striated structure as a cluster of a set of plasma sleeves is generated, each sleeve moving with a velocity of about 10 m = s, i.e., much slower than the barium cloud itself ( \u0005 35 m = s) from which they were formed. The dimensions of the created strata are as follows: L ¼ 30 km along B 0 , the height from the center of the cloud h ¼ 10 km, and the width across B 0 d ¼ 0.6 km. Accounting for these dimensions, the concentration of barium ions inside the cloud was estimated as \u0004 6 \u0002 10 6 cm \u0001 3 , while at the same range of altitudes the concentration of background ionospheric plasma does not exceed \u0004 3 \u0002 10 6 cm \u0001 3 ; i.e., it is less. Thus, we talk about a strong large plasma structure created in the ionosphere by injection of ion cloud from a rocket. 160 km 190 km Figure 6.13 Modeling of the ion cloud by the cylinder with side strata.

It is evident that during a definite time the cloud is deformed by the floating of its plasma along B 0 , and then at the bottom of the cloud the striation at the plasmoids stretching along B 0 occurs. In the aforementioned two experiments, the clouds of high density and large dimensions were observed during the limiting time of observation and, unfortunately, the striation and further evolution of strata were not analyzed, because in the problems under consideration the researchers employed a coordinate system moving with the wind of neutrals, and the mechanisms of drift instability generation and the splitting of cloud on several smaller sleeves were not considered. A more detailed experiment was described in Refs. [29,31]. In Ref. [31] the development of the barium cloud injected at a height of 160 km was registered by an optical device with interference filters allowing observation of the first 100 s of evolution of the neutral central component of the cloud and then of the ion cloud with intermittent returns to observations of the neutral cloud. The complete time of observation was about 12 min, and it was made up to the moment the radiation from ions Ba þ became lower than the radiation level of the background ionospheric plasma. For an observation time of about 400 – 500 s, the shape of the neutral cloud deviates from its spherical-symmetrical form (see Figure 6.16a). During observation the fixation of the neutral and ion barium clouds was carried out periodically by fixing their positions in space. After 200 s of barium cloud creation, the displacement of the cloud of ions Ba þ from the neutral one was about Figure 6.14 Temporal and spatial evolution of plasma density inside the injected cloud (right panel) and its brightness (left panel), obtained experimentally.

The longitudinal profile of concentration of ions Ba þ was still Gaussian (see curve with [Ba þ ] jj in Figure 6.19).

Because the influence of transverse diffusion on ion cloud spreading begins from the moment of time exceeding d n ( t i ) = D ( Ba þ ) a ? \u0004 2 \u0002 10 3 s, i.e., the total time of observation, in Ref. [31] it was assumed that the asymmetry of profile [Ba þ ] ? shown in Figure 6.20 by curve (2) for t ¼ 608 s can only be explained by the effects of the ambient electric field and the wind of neutrals. In the following text, based on theoretical analysis discussed in Section 5.2, we will try to prove this assumption with rigorous theoretical approaches. We will now return to some interesting measurements carried out after the pioneering experiments in barium release and briefly present their results in the observation of spatial and temporal evolution of ion clouds in the ionosphere. The same phenomena in movements of neutral and ion clouds were observed in Ref. [29], where injection of four clouds with differing number of ions Ba þ was performed. In three clouds the concentration of ions was large enough, N c \u0004 7 \u0002 10 6 7 2 \u0002 10 7 cm \u0001 3 , whereas the fourth had a concentration of about N c \u0004 0.6 \u0002 10 6 7 2 \u0002 10 6 cm \u0001 3 , i.e., of the same order as the concentration of the background ionospheric plasma. The first three ion clouds moved close to the neutral barium (compare circles denoted by (a) for atoms Ba and curves 1 – 3 together with points denoted by (b) for ions Ba þ in Figure 6.21), and their velocities of spreading were also close to those for the neutral cloud. This tendency was observed during the entire experiment ( T ¼ 10 min). As for the fourth ion cloud, from t ¼ 3 – 4 min it sharply changed its direction compared with the neutral cloud (curve 4 in Figure 6.21), and from the beginning its velocity and direction of spreading were different when compared to those for the cloud of neutral atoms Ba. In parallel with these experiments, in the former USSR, the same barium release experiments were carried out from 1975 onward [30 – 37]. In light of these investigations, preliminary analysis of observations of evolution of both neutral and ion clouds of barium will be given, and then a physical analysis will be given following results obtained in Section 5.2 and analysis of theoretical works presented in Refs. [122 – 129]. First, cumulative injections Spolokh 1 and Spolokh 2 were performed at the altitude z ¼ 170 km close to the vertical direction ( / 2 0 \u0001 5 0 to B 0 ).

In Figure 6.22 the photos of neutral barium and ion clouds obtained from three sites are denoted by 1 – 3. Observations were absent in some fragments for all three sites. All photographs correspond to the following moments of time (from top to bottom, respectively): 20, 50, 150, and 400 s. At all optical devices a fast-spreading spherical cloud of Ba was registered, which after 20 s had a radius of about 2 km. After this time, the plasmoid of ions Ba þ elongated along B 0 was created owing to ionization of the neutral component of barium cloud, which was observed by using special photo filters. At about 130 s both clouds, the neutral and the ion, moved in parallel, and after that the spherical neutral cloud was hardly observed because of its low brightness. After 45 s from this moment, the floating of ions Ba þ from the main plasmoid in forms of fingerlike structures, strata, elongated along B 0 were clearly observed from experimental site 1 and less so from site 2. Later, the brightness of the main ion plasmoid decreased and strata became more diffusible. At a later stage of ion cloud evolution the brightness of the tail with stratum exceeded that for the main ion plasmoid. In experiment Spolokh 2, parallel movement of the spherical neutral cloud and the main ion plasmoid 32 s after injection (Figure 6.23a) and at time t ¼ 100 s floating of the main plasmoid from the neutral cloud (Figure 6.23b) was also observed. At the later stage of ion cloud evolution (at t ¼ 15 min, Figure 6.23b), a tail with strata structure was also observed. Careful optical and spectrometric analysis allowed the distribution of atoms Ba inside the neutral cloud and concen- tration of ions Ba þ in the ionized cloud to be obtained. Thus, it was found that concentration in the main ion plasmoid exceeded the concentration of background plasma by more than one order of magnitude.

Accounting for the homogeneous distribution of ions inside the ion plasmoid with dimensions L \u0004 20 km (along B 0 ), d \u0004 1km (across B 0 ), the average concentration of plasma within the ion cloud was estimated at about N c \u0004 10 7 cm \u0001 3 , which matches with results obtained using radiolocation measurements during these experiments, which yielded N c \u0004 (6.3 \u0002 10 6 7 1.4 \u0002 10 7 )cm \u0001 3 . This value exceeds the con- centration of the background ionospheric plasma at altitudes of 160 – 170 km by about two orders of magnitude. At the same time, estimations made for the tail structure yielded N c \u0004 2 \u0002 10 5 cm \u0001 3 , which is of the same order as the concentration of the background plasma. Stratification of the main ion plasmoid 45 s from the moment of injection obtained experimentally, and floating in the form of strata in the tail can be seen from Figure 6.24, where the time dynamic of the profile of brightness in the direction of floating of ions is shown. As can be seen, the sharp rear of the main ion plasmoid remains stable during the time of observation. From the beginning of the process of stratification, two to three strata leave the main plasmoid. Each stratum has an asymmetrical profile of brightness, smoother than the sharp profile of the main ion plasmoid. From the commencement of this process, the concentration in each leaving strata exceeds that for background plasma. During the process of diffusion, the concentration in both sleeves equalizes. Changes in distance between continuously leaving strata denoted by digits 1 – 3 are presented in Figure 6.25. It can be seen that the velocity of movement of these three strata is approximately constant, practically equally for these strata structures, and coincides with drift velocity of the floating tail structure in the crossing E 0 \u0006 B 0 fields. A system of thin, field-aligned plasma filaments, which the authors called secondary strata, appeared. These small secondary strata structures with weaker brightness and smaller dimensions are shown by arrows in Figure 6.26. Each filament structure then groups around the primary strata structure. However, their weak brightness observed in this experiment did not allow for obtaining detailed information on filament-structure dynamics. More detailed observation and investigation of the dynamics of this fine filament structure was carried out in Refs. [33,34,36], and the corresponding interpretation of nonlinear processes accompanying formation and evolution of artificial ion clouds in the inhomogeneous ionosphere was presented in Ref.

In three of the four experiments the striation mechanism was clearly observed, and the fine filament structure of strata elongated close to the magnetic field lines (with deviations of no more than 1 8 ) was investigated in detail. In each release, a similar picture of inhomogeneity evolution was observed. Thus, in the first stage of the cloud ’ s evolution (within about 30 s after each release) when the density of plasma was about two orders of magnitude higher than the background density, the dispersive diffusion stage corresponded to the process described in Section 5.1 according to Refs. [104,105,123,133]. After this time, the cloud began to split into a neutral quasi-spherical and ionic cloud, the latter of which after approximately 50 – 60 s split into an ionic cluster stretched along B 0 . In a further evolution (up to 160 s) in this primary strata, separation of each stratum from the ionic cluster was observed in the E 0 \u0006 B 0 direction (see Figure 6.27a). After 30 s, i.e., up to 190 s, the striated structure (the grating of primary strata) was replaced with a cluster of B 0 -field- aligned plasma filaments (called secondary strata ) concentrated within the disturbed region with transverse (across to B 0 ) and longitudinal (along B 0 ) sizes 5 – 6 km and 22 – 25 km, respectively (see Figure 6.27b).

This result is in good agreement with estimations obtained in Section 5.2 based on calculations carried out in Refs. [37,129], where, for the commencement of striation mechanisms, the degree of anisotropy of the initial irregularity has be not less than 100. All strata were oriented along B 0 with an accuracy of 1 0 (see Figure 6.27c); i.e., they were field- aligned. The striations took place at the front , but not the back , edge of the ionic cluster, i.e., in the E 0 \u0006 B 0 direction. The same results were observed earlier in Refs. [29,31], which contradicted the initial pioneering observations [24 – 27], where the striation mechanism was observed from the rear of the initial ion cloud. At the same time the dark areas between bright plasmoids in directions parallel to the geomagnetic field B 0 lines were observed during a detailed optical analysis of experimental data [36]. These peculiarities can be explained by the theoretically predicted and numerically obtained results in Refs. [128,129], taking into account altitudinal inhomogeneity of ionospheric plasma and nonuniform altitudinal dependence of plasma transport coefficients, which can finally accelerate generation of gradient-drift instabilities in plasma during filament-structure creation. Thus, add- itional estimations of the ion density in each separate strata based on the photometric method [36] yield the value d N i \u0004 5 \u0002 10 5 7 10 6 cm \u0001 3 , i.e., of the same order as concentration of background plasma at the altitudes under consideration. In this situation, the striation mechanism can be developed faster than for the case of strong plasma disturbances ’ drift spreading. In fact, the characteristic time of new (secondary) stratum creation in the grating structure was estimated as 3 – 4 s, which was of the same order of magnitude as the time of the splitting of existing (primary) strata. In other words, newly created strata enter the gap between the diffusive ion cluster and the grating structure with the characteristic time of 3 – 4 s. At the same time, splitting of already-existing (primary) strata takes place inside the strata grating with the same characteristic time of 3 – 4 s. The lifetime of each separate stratum within the grating was about 30 s. The characteristic diameter of the secondary stratum, moving in the same direction as the whole grating structure, was estimated to be of the order of 100 – 150 m. Using the estimated drift velocity of separate stratum, V d / 100 m = s, and its deviation D V d \u0005 20 m = s, which depends on strata luminosity and location in grating (because the boundary stratum spreads faster than inner one), the associated perpendicular component of electric field perturbations, d E ? ¼ E ? \u0001 E 0 ? , was estimated as d E ? = E 0 ? \u0004 0 : 2 \u0001 0 : 3. All these parameters will be used later to simulate numerically the experimental data described earlier based on the theoretical model developed in Refs. [128,129]. We now explain the evolution of ion clouds through the prism of more realistic theoretical and numerical models referred to in Section 5.2. Experimental Data via Theoretical Prediction . We now continue the foregoing discussions of nonlinear evolution of artificial ionospheric irregularities created by injection of plasma clouds into the ionosphere, now based on the knowledge obtained in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 regarding processes of diffusion and drift of arbitrary plasma disturbances in the real ionosphere. The developed models of drift referred to there point to the qualitative agreement between observed phenomena and theoretical predictions based on analytical and numerical analysis [112 – 129]. Thus, for example, it was found that the injected cloud influenced the nondisturbed ambient electric field E 0 . Defined in Refs. [123,124], the criterion of influence of plasma disturbance on E 0 supposes a large concen- tration of ions of barium N þ Ba in the cloud compared with the concentration of background ionospheric plasma N 0 , i.e., N þ Ba = N 0 \u000b 1. In Refs. [21,27,107], another criterion, less rigorous, of perturbation of the ambient electric field was proposed in the following form: l * ¼ S c P = S 0 P \u000b 1, where S c P and S 0 P are the integral Pedersen conductivities of ion cloud and background plasma, Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 282 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i 282 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"respectively, introduced in Section 5.2. We mentioned in this section, following Refs. [123,124], that a fundamental change in the drift process of the strong plasma disturbance occurs only when the depletion region surrounding it becomes deep (up to zero). Therefore, the criterion of disturbance of the ambient electric field proposed in Refs. [21,27,107] was modified for the real ionosphere in Refs. [125 – 127]. According to the study, the perturbation of E 0 is possible if the full amount of ions in the cloud with scale L , Ð L 0 N þ Ba ( z )d z , exceeds the amount of electrons (ions, plasma is quasi-neutral), Ð z 0 0 N 0 ( z )d z , in the plasma column, oriented along B 0 below the cloud, where z 0 is the height of cloud injection. This condition is stronger than l * ¼ S c P = S 0 P \u000b 1, proposed in Refs. [21,27,107], but weaker than N þ Ba = N 0 \u000b 1 (according to Refs. [123,124]). Moreover, the cloud ’ s dimensions are smaller than the characteristic scale of the ionosphere under the cloud H d ; i.e., d < L < H d . Therefore, the parameter of nonlinearity h ¼ N þ Ba = N 0 describing a degree of depletion of regions of the background plasma surrounding the injection cloud (see definitions in Sections 5.1 and 5.2) is much higher that the parameter l * introduced in Refs. [21,27,107], taken as a degree of perturbation of the background ionosphere by the injected ion cloud. For the high-density clouds, the ambient electric field E 0 is fully compensated by the inner disturbed electric field d E , and the effect of the latter becomes predominant in the movements of injected ions. Therefore, as shown in Refs. [123 – 125], in the limited case of fully ionized plasma ( N þ Ba \u000b N 0 ) when the depletion zones become deep (zero-order), the drift of cloud ions in the crossing E 0 \u0006 B 0 fields is absent. In the frame related to the neutral wind, the ordinary ambipolar diffusion in the absent of the magnetic field takes place (according to Schottky; see Section 5.1). In this case diffusion of strong ion cloud is isotropic, and the center of the ion cloud coincides with that for the neutral cloud, as was evidently illustrated in Figures 6.22 and 6.23 for the time of observation t \u0003 200 s; in this case N þ Ba = N 0 \b 10 2 , as was estimated from experiments. However, at the edges of the cloud, the electric field E 0 is not fully compensated, and a part of the ions and electrons of plasma cloud are liable to drift in crossing E 0 \u0006 B 0 fields, i.e., the electrons in the Pedersen (across B 0 and along E 0 ) direction and the ions in the Hall (across B 0 and across E 0 ) direction. Thus, they create regions of floating electrons O 1 and floating ions O 2 as illustrated schematically in Figure 5.42 (see Chapter 5). According to this scheme, the injected ions floating in region O 1 create a tail moving in the nondisturbed ambient electric field E 0 . At the initial stage of ion cloud evolution ( t < 2 – 3 min) the dense plasma cloud moves with the velocity of neutral wind U m , damping ambipolarly as in the case of B 0 ¼ 0, and only some of the ions float in the crossing E 0 \u0006 B 0 fields, fully coinciding with the vision of drift spreading following from classical drift theory described in Section 5.2. At a later stage of its evolution ( t > 3 – 4 min), the density of plasma within the ion cloud becomes smaller owing to ambipolar diffusion, and we consider the case of moderate nonlinearity, when N þ Ba = N 0 \b 1or N þ Ba = N 0 \u0003 1. Here, the effects of short-circuits currents through the depletion regions and the effects of the background plasma become predominant. Drift spreading of ions occurs faster than in the case of ambipolar diffusion, and most float in an E 0 \u0006 B 0 direction. The picture of spreading becomes more complicated because in this case, and as has been shown in Refs. [126 – 129], the shape, form, and orientation of plasma structure in space are changed nonuni- formly. Different parts of the ion cloud begin to move with different velocities determined by different physical processes — from ordinary diffusion to the effect of short-circuit currents (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2). However, in this case the problem becomes quasi-linear, and we can again use the results obtained in Section 5.2 following Refs. [122 – 129]. In this case, a disturbance d E of the ambient electric field E 0 is sufficiently small, and currents of particles caused by this disturbance mostly flow through the background plasma.

Here, in the linear case, described in Refs. [123 – 127], owing to the dispersion mechanism of spreading of plasma cloud, three plasmoids are created, the first of which associate with the electronic (1) and spread with slower velocity across B 0 ; the second (2) is ionic , spreading faster along B 0 ; and the third (3) spreading in the E 0 \u0006 B 0 direction (see Figure 6.28, which we present here in a simpler manner than that shown in Figure 5.42). In this figure, the initial position of the cloud after injection is denoted by (0). Now, using results of theoretical prediction, one can easily explain the asymmetry of the density profile of ions Ba þ across B 0 obtained experimentally in Refs. [29,31] and shown in Figures 6.19 and 6.20. According to the classical presentation of the dispersive mechanism of drift, this phenomenon has an evident physical explanation: the asymmetry of the transverse Gaussian profile of ion concentration in the cloud is caused by transverse movements of injected ions in the E 0 \u0006 B 0 direction relative to the wind of natural molecules (atoms) occurring in ionospheric plasma. Moreover, because Hall mobilities of electrons and ions are different, the injected cloud in itself cannot move in the E 0 \u0006 B 0 direction, as this contradicts the condition of quasi-neutrality. This scenario can be secure only by short-circuit currents through the background plasma and the depletion regions occurrence.

Such dispersive spreading leads to a fundamental enlargement of the barium cloud, which was observed experimentally [30 – 36] Moreover, a sharp decrease in the number of ions in the barium cloud after t \b 400 s can obviously be described by the influence of dispersive drift mechanism in the process of plasma ordinary diffusion at the quasi- linear and linear stages of evolution of ion cloud. Thus, in all experiments [29 – 36], at the stage after t \b 400 s, the observed illumination of the ion cloud was falling fast to the illumination of the background plasma. Now, taking from a theoretical framework the critical time t kr ¼ d n ( \u0002 0 ) = b i ? E ? * of commencement of the drift process and information about the initial plasma cloud transverse dimension d n ( t 0 ), found from Figure 6.18, we can obtain an estimation of the transverse electric field E ? * , defined in Section 5.2 as E ? * \u0004 2 \u0001 6mV = m, which is in good agreement with estimations made during experimental optical observations [31 – 36]. At the final stage of its evolution, the ion cloud transforms into a small-scale plasma structure having a lower density than that of the background ionospheric plasma. During this stage the striation of plasma clouds on the grating structure consisting of clusters of strata stretched along geomagnetic field lines (see Figures 6.12 through 6.14 and Figures 6.26 and 6.27 obtained by different experiments). To explain this phenomenon, various physical mechanisms were analyzed and discussed, and in Ref. [112] three possible types of instabilities, acoustic, drift-dissipative, and gradient-drift, were analyzed analytically; it was found that the more probabilistic source of striation of plasma cloud on strata structure is gradient-drift instability (GDI), discussed in detail in Chapter 2. A first one-dimensional (1-D) theoretical model of ion cloud in which GDI was stressed as a main mechanism of striation into strata was developed in Ref. [108], and then has been generalized for 2-D and 3-D models of plasma cloud in Refs. [114 – 121]. All authors have pointed out and proved theoretically that GDI in crossing E 0 \u0006 B 0 fields is the most probabilistic mech- anism of plasma structures ’ striation without entering into the origin of their creation. In Refs. [37,127,128], the phenomenon of fine grating structure creation was analyzed theoretically and experimentally on the basis of precise optical and spectral observation of the process [34 – 36]. We have described this effect in the foregoing text and in Section 5.2. We now will only reiterate some important aspects of this theory and again present results of the numerical experiment carried out under conditions of one of the experiment described in Refs. [36,37]. Firstly, it was found that the increment of GDI growth (as a limit of striation of plasma plasmoids into grating structure) can be estimated for stretched along B 0 irregularities as g \u0004 V d =‘ ? , where V d can be estimated from Equation 6.5 and ‘ ? is the transverse (to B 0 ) scale of primary strata (plasmoid). To obtain a clearer comparison with experiments carried out in Refs. [35 – 37] and briefly described previously, in Refs. [37,129] were presented numerical experiments with various kinds of plasma structures related to injected ion clouds. The input parameters of plasma clusters in numerical experiment we want to present now were chosen to be close to those of Experiment 3 described in Refs. [36,37]. Initially, the parameters of the plasma cloud were taken from the barium release phenomena described in Refs. [36,37]: N þ Ba = N 0 ¼ 100, the shape of initial plasma cloud was isotropic, L ¼ 2 d ¼ 10 km. The background electric field (including neutral wind; see Section 5.2) was estimated as E * \u0004 10 mV/m. All parameters of the background ionospheric plasma were chosen from the model of middle-latitude ionosphere (real experiments were carried out in such an ionosphere) described in Chapter 1. Presented in Figure 6.29a through c are the isolines of equal density at 10, 30, and 60 s, respectively. Simulations again show the physical picture of the spreading process, described earlier and obtained experimentally. Thus, in the initial stage less than 20 s, the smooth diffusive expansion of the plasma profile is observed. Then, after 20 s, when the degree of anisotropy of the plasma cloud significantly exceeds Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 285 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i Modern Radiophysical Methods of Investigation of Ionospheric Irregularities & 285"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"ten (i.e., L = d > 10), the front steeping strengthens with subsequent stratification on plasmoids owing to a drift dispersion mechanism in less than 10 s being observed.

The drift velocity of each separate stratum varies from 50 to 100 m = s. It is significant that the drift velocities of the extreme strata, as well as the secondary ones in the grating structure, are noticeably higher (by 10 – 30 m = s) than those of more dense primary strata (1 – 5m = s) obtained both numerically and experimentally. It should be noted that the main cloud drifts significantly slower that the strata grating. It is easy to see that the characteristic times of the plasma cloud splitting on plasmoids due to drift mechanism are about t d ¼ 20 \u0001 30 s, and the striated structure formation commences 10 – 20 s after the splitting process, which is also in good agreement with all z , km 395 350 305 260 215 170 125 80 \u0001 150 \u0001 100 \u0001 50 0 50 100 x , km (c) z , km 395 350 305 260 215 170 125 80 \u0001 150 \u0001 100 \u0001 50 0 50 100 x , km (a) z , km 395 350 305 260 215 170 125 80 \u0001 150 \u0001 100 \u0001 50 0 50 100 x , km (b) Figure 6.29 Numerical simulation of spatial and temporal evolution of the ion cloud in the crossing ambient electric and magnetic fields in the presence of the wind of neutrals for (a) 10 s, (b) 30 s, and (c) 60 s.

The interaction between the primary and secondary strata and transformation of energy between these strata are still not clear. To describe this process in terms of nonlinear plasma mode, stable and unstable, coupling and redistribution of energy between them (as carried out in Chapter 2, Section 2.3), to obtain the dependence for the time of striation t s from the parameters of plasma structures and ambient ionospheric conditions (see Tables 5.1 – 5.3, Chapter 5), many more numerical simulations and additional experiments for ion cloud releases are needed. Nevertheless, results presented in this section show that many parameters of artificially induced plasma irregularities can by predicted accurately, so also ambient geophysical characteristics of the ionosphere, by studying spatial and temporal evolution of artificial plasma structures of various origins and at different stages of their evolution, using modern radiophysical and optical methods and the corresponding theoretical and numerical background described in Chapter 5. 6.2 Natural Ionospheric Irregularities and Methods of Their Parameters ’ Diagnostics Many aspects of the investigation of artificial plasma irregularities can be directly transformed by studying natural ionospheric irregularities generated by different geophysical and morphological processes occurring in the ionosphere at different altitudes, from the polar cap to the equatorial zone. We will direct the reader ’ s attention to those from a whole spectrum of natural irregularities that are interesting for the purpose of the performance of ionospheric radio channels (Chapters 7 and 8) and for the investigation of their effects on land – satellite radio communication to predict an efficient design of such channels and transfer of information data through them (Chapter 9). 6.2.1 Radio Methods of Diagnostics of Meteor-Induced and H E Irregularities in the Middle-Latitude Ionosphere The meteor-induced and the natural field aligned along B 0 irregularities (called H E irregularities in the literature; see Chapter 7) have been studied at the middle-latitude traces in several regions over the world by separate groups of researchers from the beginning of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1990s [48 – 51,134 – 164]. The purpose was to explore the possibility of achieving stable radio channels due to scattering of radio waves by these kinds of plasma disturbances occurring in the ionosphere by meteor trails and by Farley – Buneman (modified two-stream) instability (FBI), respectively, which occur at the lower ionosphere at altitudes 80 – 150 km. As for sporadic layered structures (denoted by E s ) occurring in the middle-latitude ionosphere, the main mechanism of their generation is associated with gradient-drift instability (GDI) [155 – 160] and with a combination of GDI and FBI for large- and small-scale irregularities, respectively [160 – 164]. We will discuss the practical aspects of the creation of such radio links in Chapters 7 and 8. For now, we will consider some actual radio methods for investigating the initial parameters of meteor- induced and H E irregularities and, first of all, the process of their spreading and the corresponding lifetime that characterizes the efficiency of radio propagation within the ionospheric channel consisting such types of irregularities.

In Ref. [144], it was found that the lifetime of meteor-induced irregularities actually depends on orientation of plasma irregularity relative to geomagnetic field lines. Theoretic- ally, in Ref. [130] a strong dependence of diffusion spreading of such irregularities on the degree of orientation with respect to B 0 was obtained. It was also found that only at a deviation of the irregularity at the angle of u ¼ 1 8 \u0001 2 8 from the direction of the magnetic field B 0 does the velocity of spreading increases by two to three orders of magnitude and the corresponding lifetime of such an irregularity decreases by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, in experimental inves- tigations of meteor trails and meteor-induced irregularities carried out in Ref. [144], doubt is cast on such a critical dependence of diffusion spreading (the corresponding ambipolar coefficient of diffusion) on the angle u between the axis of the irregularity and the vector B 0 . The discrepancy between the experimental [144] and theoretical [130] results may be due to the fact that in Ref. [130] only slightly ionized irregularities (i.e., quasi-linear disturbances with d N \b N 0 and d N \u0003 N 0 ) were analyzed without taking into account collisions between charged particles of the weakly ionized background ionospheric plasma. Therefore, in Refs. [50,51] the effects of arbitrary degree of ionization and disturbance of the background ionospheric plasma corresponding to real perturbation and ionization of meteor-induced irregularities were investigated theoretically and experimentally and described in detail in Refs. [134 – 136]. Analyzing the formula (Equation 5.41) for plasma with arbitrary degree of ionization p ¼ n ei = n em defined in Chapter 1, and changing this parameter for under-dense to high-dense meteor trails, p ¼ 1, 10, 100 according to Refs. [134 – 136], it was found that the dependence of the character of diffusion spreading depends essentially on the orientation of meteor-induced irregularities only after u \b 10 8 . This result clearly seen from Figure 6.30, where the relative coefficient of ambipolar diffusion (Equation 5.41) D a ( q )/ D a ( p / 2) 1 p = 100 p = 10 q = 10° p = 1 10 \u0001 1 10 \u0001 2 p = 100 p = 10 q = 0° p = 1 10 \u0001 3 10 \u0001 4 80 90 100 110 h , km Figure 6.30 Height dependence of the normalized coefficient of diffusion for various degrees of ionization of meteor plasma ( p ¼ 1, 10, 100) and for different angles of orientation of the meteor trail to the ambient magnetic field, u ¼ 10 8 (dashed curves) and u ¼ 0 8 (solid curves).

The results indicate that the magnetic field has a significant effect on diffusion only at h > 90 km, and mostly on field-aligned irregularities (for u ¼ 0) with a weak degree of ionization ( p < 10). With the increase of the angle u beyond 10 8 , the degree of ionization ceases to play an important role in the character of diffusion spreading. The same picture is observed during analysis of lifetime calculated according to formula (Equation 5.54b) of an arbitrary meteor-induced irregularity with parameters of ionization changing from p ¼ 1 (weak-dense irregularity) to p ¼ 100 (high-dense irregularity). Thus, the relative lifetime according to Equation 5.54, where t 0 is the lifetime of plasma irregularity in the absence of a magnetic field, is presented (see Figure 6.31) versus the angle u for height h ¼ 80 km (solid curves) and h ¼ 90 km (dashed curves). The dot-dash line represents this relation for weakly ionized plasma (when p ¼ 0) obtained in Ref. [130] (i.e., for H E inhomogeneities). As expected, the magnetic field affects a significant increase in the lifetime of meteor-induced irregularities in the region of angles 0 8 \u0003 u < 20 8 at altitudes h \b 90 km. In this case, there is a strong dependence on the degree of ionization in the region of angles 0 8 \u0003 u \u0003 5 8 , which is most distinct at heights h \b 90 km.

[50]. We now compare theoretical predictions from Ref. [50] with the corresponding experimental data according to measurements carried out at the middle-latitude trace with a radio path of about 1400 km long on frequency f ¼ 74 MHz to investigate the scattering effect of meteor-induced irregularities located at the altitudinal range of 80 – 110 km and of H E irregularities located at the altitudinal range of 110 – 150 km [49,50]. As we wrote earlier, full information of how to perform such radio traces will be presented in Chapter 7. Now we will present lifetime of meteor-induced irregularities estimated from measurements by studying the burstlike signals of a duration from several seconds to several minutes, most of which were produced by meteor ionization. In this estimation in Ref. [50] it was taken into account that there is a distinction between the two stages of dissipations of field-aligned meteor trails with two specific mechanisms of diffusion spreading. In the first stage , diffusion takes place in the strongly ionized and disturbed plasma with large velocity of spreading (though relatively smaller than in the absence of the magnetic field). In this stage the scattering burstlike signal from the meteor trail is coherent (i.e., with deterministic oscillations of its strength envelope) with rapid decrease of the amplitude envelope and intense regular fading (with a deep oscillatory character) of the received signal (see Figure 6.32). The corresponding relative time constant of the dissipation of a meteor-induced irregularity at this stage t co = t 0 can be estimated by Equation 5.54b for the plasma with an arbitrary degree of ionization and perturbations. In the second stage , the inhomogeneous plasma of the meteor trail becomes weakly ionized and perturbed (as in the case of artificial injected plasma clouds described in the previous section). The velocity of diffusion spreading decreases considerably. The scattering signal is diffuse (i.e., inco- herent with random oscillations of its strength envelope), because we now observe scattering from a cluster of small-scale turbulences with a fairly slowly decreasing amplitude envelope and small Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 290 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i 290 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"irregular fluctuations of the signal (see Figure 6.32). The corresponding relative time constant of the dissipation of a meteor-induced irregularity in this stage, t inc = t 0 , can be estimated by Equation 5.54c for weakly ionized plasma ( p ¼ 0). In this phase, regular anisotropic diffusion is determined by the degree of anisotropy of small-scale plasma turbulences (as was observed for heating-induced and injected irregularities mentioned earlier) within the meteor-induced plasma cluster generated during dissipation of the meteor trail of the first phase. In that sense we can stress about the generation by meteor trails a cluster of small-scale irregularities that under the effect of the ambient magnetic field are oriented and extended along B 0 (or close to the lines of force). According to the fine structure and duration of the scattering signal in the first and second phases, we can now judge the effect of the geomagnetic field on diffusion spreading of meteor- induced irregularities in the ionosphere. We will later discuss another effect of deep fading of the signals caused by drift mechanism and its horizontal gradients along altitudes. We now estimate the duration of dissipation of meteor-induced irregularities obtained experi- mentally [50] from all the radio bursts of meteor origin in one of a series of experiments in which only those signals whose duration was more than 5 s were selected, the ratio of the incoherent to coherent part of signal duration was more than unit — i.e., t inc = t co > 1 — and the decrease of the signal envelope of which in the first phase was accompanied by a strong regular fading. The distribution of durations of the burstlike signals is shown in Figure 6.33. The duration of most of these signals is 5 s \u0003 t \u0003 160 s, where t ¼ t co þ t inc . Such a broad spectrum of the time constant of the dissipation process agrees with the results of the theoretical framework [50]. Figure 6.34 shows the dependence of the ratio of the total lifetime of meteor-induced irregularities to the time constant of the dissipation during the first phase of diffusion spreading. It is evident from the presented histogram that the duration of the second phase of dissipation of irregularities is greater (from 3 – 4to10 – 15 times) than the duration of their first phase.

From Figure 6.35a it can be seen that the essential influence of the drift spreading of anisotropic meteor-induced irregularities takes place for angles u up to 3 8 at altitudes more than 95 km. The value 0.1 < V a = U m < 1 for meteor ionizations, but for weakly ionized irregularities ( p \r 1), such as under-dense meteor trails or H E inhomogene- ities, becomes much smaller.

In Figure 6.36 the relative dependence V a = U m versus the height of meteor trials formation h for u ¼ 0, b ¼ 90 8 , and for different degrees of ionization p of irregularities, is depicted. As can be seen, for the field-aligned meteor-induced irregularities (i.e., for u ¼ w ¼ 0 8 ) the magnetic field decreases at the order the velocity of their drift spreading elative to wind velocity at altitudes h \b 100 km. This effect increases with increase of the height h and with decrease of the degree of ionization of plasma within the irregularity. As for H E irregularities, scattering from which generates quasi-continuous signals of duration from several minutes to several hours with a slow increase and decrease of signal envelope and with irregular fading of signal all the time of observation (see Figure 6.37), most of them are caused by long-lived slightly ionized weakly anisotropic inhomogeneities of the low ionosphere of great extent and has the same sporadic structure as high-latitude and equatorial sporadic structures called sporadic E layers . On the basis of experimental studies of a long-distance (about 1400 km) middle-latitude ( / 45 8 North Latitude) radio trace in Refs. [49,147], some conclusions about the nature of field-aligned irregularities responsible for foreshortened scattering (at 44 and 74 MHz), called diffusive H E irregularities, were pointed out. Thus, the daily variation in transmission intensity of quasi-continuous signals of durations from tens of minutes to several hours and their duration and fine structure characterized by fast stochastic fading (a fragment of which is shown in Figure 6.37) indicate that they are produced by long-lived weakly ionized diffusive irregularities of the ionospheric E region of E sq type, consisting of small-scale field-aligned irregularities typical of the equatorial and polar zones [48 – 51,145 – 147]. The latter type of sporadic E structures will be discussed later. It should be noted that the diffusion mechanism of these plasma structures is described satisfactorily through the framework of theories concerning diffusion spreading of weakly ionized irregularities in the ionospheric plasma [123,133].

[147] a correlation was found between the occurrence of sporadic E s layers with the corresponding critical frequencies (and, consequently, between the blanking frequency f b E s ) and the frequency of occurrence of quasi-continuous signals. The high correlation between them indicates the nature of the quasi-continuous signals, if sporadic irregularities of E sq type, having small blanking frequency, cause great differences between the limiting f 0 E s frequency and blanking frequency f b E s , i.e., large D fE s ¼ f 0 E s \u0001 f b E s . As found experimentally, quasi-continuous H E signals are not observed or is a rare phenomenon [49] in which sporadic E s layers of low values of D fE s appear. An example of such experimental observations can be seen in Figure 6.38, where (lower part) the limiting frequency f 0 E s (dashed curves) and blanking frequency f b E s (solid curves) as well as the index K of magnetic activity at the area of scattering of radio signals (for detailed description of the radio trace, see Chapter 7) are presented. The circles with a plus sign along the horizontal axis (indicating the local time at middle-latitude radio trace) indicate the time of receiving of quasi-continuous H E -scatter signals, and the circles with a minus sign indicate the times these signals were absent. The top part of Figure 6.38 gives the magnetograms of the vertical Z and horizontal H components of the geomagnetic field, as well as the corresponding daily pattern of the index of magnetic activity K (arranged inside the lower part of the figure) versus the local time at the radio trace during the period of 18:00 on June 26 to 18:00 on June 27, 1970.

According to such a combined sketched presentation, the correlation between the occurrence of sporadic irregularities of E sq type and H E scatter signals can be found, and the role of the magnetic field disturbance (due to large K ) and ionospheric disturbances = instabilities (due to D fE s ) in the formation of H E irregular- ities can also be understood. It can be seen that where D fE s ¼ f 0 E s \u0001 f b E s \b 1 MHz, which mostly occurs in evening time and nocturnal periods, both quasi-continuous signals and sporadic E s layers are observed successfully, whereas in the morning and daytime periods, when even the blanking frequency exceeds 4 – 5 MHz but D fE s \r 1 MHz, the H E scatter signals were not found. a b a b V = 10 mm/s.

At the same time, statistical analysis carried out in Ref. [147] has found that there is a good correlation (exceeding 70%) between recording of quasi-continuous H E signals and the presence in the active scattering E region of the ionosphere of sporadic E s layers with a blanking frequency f b E s < 5 MHz, but with the difference of the corresponding frequencies D fE s > 1 MHz. Even in the presence of only weakly ionized sporadic E s layers but with a large D fE s , the presence of such layers and the occurrence of H E scatter signals coincide. Additionally, it was found that there is no relation between magnetic activity and the occurrence of H E scatter signals. In other words, no transmission of H E signals was observed during magnetic storms. At the same time, such signals were recorded frequently (up to 85% – 90%) under magnetically quiet conditions several days before and after a storm. Following the results of the analysis of experimental data obtained in Refs. [48 – 51,145 – 147] regarding sporadic H E irregularities causing scattering of quasi-continuous H E signals (one of the fragments of which is shown in Figure 6.37), we should note that the lifetime of sporadic E s layers observed at middle latitudes (up to 90 – 150 min [52 – 54]) coincides with the duration of quasi- continuous H E signals (amounting to 120 min at 74 MHz and to 180 min at 44 MHz [145 – 147]). The fact that such sporadic irregularities are mostly observed in evening and nighttime observation correlates with data obtained by other researchers using other methods of investigation of the E region of the middle-latitude ionosphere who obtained similar features common to middle-latitude sporadic layers and E sq layers of the second type generated by gradient-drift instabilities in the polar and equatorial ionosphere, which we will further discuss in the following text. Before entering into discussions of results obtained by other researchers, we will show by using methodology proposed in Refs. [145 – 147] how to estimate drift velocities of such sporadic plasma structures. The comparative analysis carried out in the aforementioned references for highly ionized meteor-induced irregularities and weakly ionized H E sporadic irregularities showed that for small angles u , the magnetic field reduces the velocity of drift spreading of H E irregularities at altitudes h > 95 km by a factor 10 – 100 compared with wind of neutral molecules, whereas at h < 90 km the 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 g , % 1234 D fE s , MHz Figure 6.39 Correlation between existence of H E scatter signals recorded at the receiver (in percentages) and perturbation of the ionospheric plasma (i.e., critical frequency of the sporadic layer E s ).

For u > 5 8 the value of V a = U m for H E irregularities is not more than one order of magnitude. An additional feature, which was mentioned earlier in the context of different drift velocities occurring at different heights of field-elongated meteor-induced irregularities, can be used for the estimation of their real velocity by investigating the Doppler effect [145,146]. In fact, the scattering of radio waves from individual segments of a field-aligned meteor trial at various heights and, therefore, drifting at different velocities are coherent in the first phase of spreading of the meteor trail, as was also mentioned previously. This leads to regular fading of the envelope of the received signal as a result of the Doppler effect. The frequency of this fading, f D , can be determined from signal records, and this in turn makes it possible to estimate the radial components and the total drift velocity. Following Refs. [145,146], we will determine the effect of the ionospheric wind on the frequency of signal fadings in oblique radio sounding [48,49]. Considering the height dependence of the effect of the magnetic field, we will use various values for the velocity of drift spreading, depending on height. Suppose that the drift velocity at the point B of the active zone of scattering is V d 2 (see Figure 6.40). We will now assume that the conditions of specular scattering also occur at the higher point A, where drift velocity is V d 1 (Figure 6.40). These points will move by BB 0 ¼ V d 2 d t and AA 0 ¼ V d 1 d t , respectively, over time d t . In this case the path difference changes can be found as D s ¼ ( KB 0 \u0001 BP ) \u0001 ( NA 0 \u0001 AM ) ¼ [( V d 2 \u0001 V d 1 ) T þ ( V d 2 \u0001 V d 1 ) R ]d t (6 : 9) Here, we assume that the transmitter, T , and receiver, R , are sufficiently far apart [145]. The frequency of fadings produced by such difference drift can be obtained from the obvious relation f D ¼ l \u0001 1 j @ D s =@ t j , which taking Equation 6.9 into account gives f D ¼ l \u0001 1 ( V d 2 \u0001 V d 1 ) T þ ( V d 2 \u0001 V d 1 ) R jj (6 : 10) Without entering into complicated geometrical calculations following from the radio trace described in Refs.

Using experimentally determined limits of the frequency of fadings, 2 – 12 Hz (see Figure 6.41) and a geometry of the trace described in Ref. [145], we obtain for the difference in the horizontal drift velocities of the scattering centers at various altitudes: (1) 16 – 106 m = s for north-westerly or south-easterly winds; (2) 9 – 61 m = s for a wind from the north or south; (3) 12 – 78 m = s for north- easterly or south-westerly winds; and (4) if we used the minimum fading frequencies, 2 – 4 Hz, for ionospheric winds from the west to east, we obtain velocity values of 61 – 122 m = s. These estimates are close to the horizontal velocities of ionospheric winds at heights of 85 < h < 95 km, because for two-center reflections of field-aligned under-dense meteor trails, the segment of the trail above 100 km is actually not affected by neutral winds. These estimates agree satisfactorily with the data on drift velocity at these heights obtained in other studies [152 – 154]. The agreement between the estimates of the drift velocity of the meteor-induced irregularities and the H E sporadic irregularities at the lower ionosphere obtained in Refs. [145,146] and those using other methods [152 – 154] indicates that the proposed unified explanation of dissipation of these two types of natural ionospheric irregularities at the lower ionosphere due to diffusional and drift spreading under the effect of geomagnetic field and the neutral wind, based on classical theory developed in Refs. [123,133], is vindicated. Only after one or two decades were more precise methods of investigating drift velocities of meteor trails and sporadic E s irregularities occurring at the middle latitude ionosphere proposed, based on Doppler shift estimations using the same continuous wave (CW) vertical and oblique sounding of the E region as discussed earlier, and the corresponding radar systems operating in the frequency domain and analyzing the shape and deviations of Doppler spectra of echo-signals recording at the receiver antenna [155 – 164]. We will discuss in Chapter 7 the experiments and the results of radio propagation performance using scattering from such irregularities. For now we will discuss briefly only two such studies that more accurately and precisely account for the corresponding effects of the Doppler shift of arriving radio waves scattered from the field-aligned irregularities (FAIs) occurring at the E region of the middle-latitude ionosphere, which in our opinion more precisely estimate Doppler shifts and the corresponding drift velocities of FAI movements [162 – 164].

In this case the threshold of ion sound speed becomes significantly smaller because C s \u0005 M \u0001 1 = 2 i and with increase of mass of metalling ion (with respect to monoa- tomic ion) C s becomes smaller, and the corresponding threshold for F-B instability generation essentially decreases. Thus, the drift velocities obtained experimentally that are shown in Figure 6.43 can be sufficient for exceeding the threshold of FBI and for generation of associated small-scale field-aligned (FAI) irregularities that fully coincide with observed measurements. We will discuss below the type and form of FAI spectra, comparing them with those observed in equatorial and polar regions of the ionosphere. 6.2.2 Radio Sounding of Sporadic Inhomogeneities and Bubbles in the Equatorial Ionosphere In the equatorial region of the ionosphere there are irregularities of plasma density of various origins, as was expected and found in numerous experiments carried out by engineers and designers of land – ionospheric – land and land – satellite communication links. These irregularities introduce a lot of problems in prediction of key parameters of the corresponding ionospheric channels, such as the path loss, fading, SNR, and so on. In periods of plasma perturbations occurring in the E and F layers of the equatorial ionosphere, signals transmitted and received by satellites and = or ground- based terminals undergo deep and frequent oscillations after passing ionospheric channel, i.e., fading (see definitions in Chapters 3 and 4). Also, strong fading of the transmitted = received information data is observed even at UHF = X-band frequencies, applicable for satellite communi- cations. This causes troublesome problems not only for designers of the ionospheric links, but also for regular users of satellite communication and navigation (called global positioning system, GPS; see Chapter 8), notably, for positioning of any subscriber in areas of service. Because geophysical processes occurring in regions E and F of the ionosphere differ, and even today a general theoretical approach that could fully predict creation in these regions of different types of plasma instabilities and the associated plasma irregularities, small-, moderate-, and large- scale, is still lacking, we will consider these two regions independently and will present results of experimental investigations of the corresponding irregularities in these two regions separately. Observations of Irregularities in the Equatorial E layer . We begin by considering the E region of the equatorial ionosphere, which, as was mentioned in Chapter 1, covers a layer of (15 8 \u0001 20 8 )in latitudes around the geographical dip equator to the north and to the south. In altitudes of E layer of 80 – 150 km, the electromagnetic processes are related to ionospheric electric fields and currents, even when they can be sufficiently small. Thus, the ambient electric field as was found by in situ spacecraft probe experiments does not exceed a few millivolts per meter (mV = m). Therefore, taking into account measured magnetic field strength of several hundreds and thousands of nanoteslas ( nT ), we find that the drift velocity of plasma in crossing E 0 \u0006 B 0 fields is approximately V a \u0004 80 \u0001 100 m = s, i.e., small enough to exceed the ion acoustic or thermal ion speed. We cannot therefore expect generation of drift instabilities in the lower equatorial ionosphere. At the same time, the drift velocity can exceed ion acoustic speed (or even ion thermal velocity), which leads to two-stream (or Farley-Buneman) instability. These kinds of instabilities were analyzed in Chapter 2.

Moreover, at the center of the equatorial layer, all these phenomena produce the current that in the literature is called the electrojet , where the corresponding drift velocities can exceed 500 m = s. Such complicated natural geophysical features and phenomena dictate precise experimental and theoretical investigations of irregularities existing in the equatorial E region of the ionosphere. Pioneering observations of the E layer of the equatorial ionosphere, and mostly sporadic E irregularities using a vertical sounding of the ionosphere, commenced from all over the world toward the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s. Despite their wide geographical range, these observations were carried out sporadically, with only statements of observed phenomena (see the analysis carried out by Chapman [165]). The study of sporadic irregularities in the equatorial E region was carried out more systematically during the 1958 – 1959 International Geophysical Year (IGY) at Huancayo, Peru, by researchers from Peru and the United States (Stanford University) using a three-frequency, swept-azimuth backscatter sounder. These studies were then summarized in Refs. [166 – 169]. The investigations resulted in the discovery of the presence of field-aligned irregularities (FAIs) of a sporadic type in the equatorial ionospheric E layer and the corresponding mechanism for the formation of sporadic E s irregularities (called E spread or ‘‘ E sq echoes ’’ ) [168,169]. Without going into the technical description of the backscatter sounder, we only point out that in these investigations three operational frequencies were used: 12, 18, and 30 MHz. The scattered signal from sporadic equatorial E s irregularities ( E sq echoes) was observed in more than 90% of the daytime observations at 18 and 30 MHz scattered from FAIs placed at altitudes between 100 and 140 km. The typical E sq echo fading rate is illustrated in Figure 6.44, where an A-scope photograph of an E sq echo integrated over approximately 10 pulses is presented. Sporadic occurrence of E sq echoes was observed up to 200 km. The mean-square of deviations of plasma density inside these E sq irregularities, h ( d N = N ) 2 i , was estimated at between 10 \u0001 3 to 10 \u0001 5 , i.e., weak enough (i.e., of the same order as for middle-latitude ionospheric H E sporadic irregular- ities described earlier). These first systematic experiments and theoretical investigations based on backscatter sounding of the ionosphere adequately describe the mechanism of ‘‘ equatorial-type ’’ sporadic E generation in the same manner as was carried out for the middle-latitude ionosphere, and we will compare them later in this chapter.

It was found experimentally that the small-scale irregularities observed by the radar are embedded in the large-scale plasma structures and that the 2-D turbulent plasma eddies create diffused radar echoes at the receiver. On the basis of a theoretical framework of plasma instabilities creation, the researchers assumed that the small-scale irregularities are generated by a 2-D coupling process in which large-scale plasma irregularities, associated with the gradient-drift instability (GDI) due to interactions between unstable and stable modes, generate small-scale irregularities via either the same GDI or the Farley – Buneman (modified two-stream) instability (see Chapter 2 and the referred bibliography there). Analyzing the Doppler spectra of small-scale irregularities, the investigators found an interesting common feature of echo signals received after scattering from such types of plasma irregularities consisting within the equatorial electrojet. Two characteristic Doppler spectra of echo signals was found for small-scale irregularities located in the lower (E layer) equatorial ionosphere: one is with narrow spectral bandwidths, D v \r kC s , defined as type-1 irregularity , and the second is with a wide spectral bandwidth, D v > kC s , defined as 2- type irregularity . Both are presented schematically in Figure 6.45. Here, as in Chapter 2, C s is the ion acoustic velocity, and k ¼ 2 p = l is the wave number (as is well known, according to Bragg ’ s law adapted for backscattering process l irregularity ¼ l = 2 [54]). To be clear as to what was carried out by researchers, we present here one of the examples of analysis presented in Refs. [54,173]. Thus, in Figure 6.46, an A-scope display (i.e., time-range display of signal strength = intensity) of several thousand superimposed traces of the 50 MHz backscattered signal from electrojet received by the Jicamarca radar. The mean spectrum of the power density of the echo signal, averaged over the entire echoing region and the entire 2 min 40 s period, is shown in Figure 6.47. As can be seen, this spectrum is sufficiently narrow and symmetrical around zero Doppler shift. Therefore, the full coincidence with the spectrum schematically presented in Figure 6.45a is evident. At the same time, the situation fundamentally changes when altitudinal and time dependence were analyzed in depth. For this purpose, a real signal presented in Figure 6.46, having been sampled and digitized at the five ranges labeled 1 to 5 at the bottom photograph of Figure 6.46, was separated in altitudinal range along the vertical axis (see Figure 6.48) according to the labels, and in (a) Type 1 (b) Type 2 Figure 6.45 Schematic presentation of spectra of echo signals scattered from irregularities of the first and second types.

Detailed analysis of each spectrum demonstrates that the shape can change from the 1-type to the 2-type presented in Figure 6.45a and b, depending on altitude and the time of the process of evolution.

This methodology is based on complex simultaneous observations of spatial, temporal, and Doppler shift evolution of irregular plasma structures using the VHF radar Jicamarca interferometer, the HF backscatter radar operated at 14.2 MHz [55,175,176], and in situ satellite measurements [177 – 179]. The corresponding experiments and analysis of the theoretical background through the prism of obtained experimental data were carried out in Refs. [55,175 – 179]. We will briefly follow these excellent works, where full explanations of observed phenomena have been presented based on a self-consistent theoretical framework developed by Sudan and his colleagues and separately by Hamsa and St.-Maurice and their colleagues (see their theoretical background with the correspond- ing bibliography in Chapter 2). The complex experiments based on VHF = HF radar [55,175,176] and several rocket in situ measurements [177 – 179] were unified in a joint Project called ‘‘ Condor Equatorial Electrojet Campaign ’’ (CEEC) and fully described in the aforementioned references. We will discuss briefly the results obtained there. Major campaign results discussed in these works are the following. First, the simultaneous investigations of kilometer-scale irregularities (large and moderate) were carried out by using radar measurements and rocket detections, and a detailed comparison between data obtained by different methods was made. Moreover, a good coincidence between measured data and theoretical prediction, based on the theoretical background of two-stream instability (or FBI) generation, developed by Sudan and his colleagues, was obtained, taking into account the anom- alous diffusion process, nonlocal effects, and coupling between wave modes, large- and small-scale (see Chapter 2). Earlier, in Refs. [175,176], it was found that large-scale irregularities (from few to several kilometers) are more predictable sources of echo signals received both in daytime and nighttime observations of the equatorial E spread layer.

Moreover, during their spatial and temporal evolution, the velocity of growth of these plasma perturbations can exceed the ion acoustic velocity; i.e., they are also candidates for FBI generation associated with small-scale irregularities. Radar observations using a 50 MHz Jicamarca VHF interferometer (see technical details in Chapter 8) of the altitudinal range 90 – 110 km with a height resolution of 1.75 km have indicated the same results in the Doppler shift domain as presented in Figures 6.48 and 6.49, but performed more precisely with resolution in time (interpulse periods) of 2.25 ms. These results are shown in Figure 6.50a through c for (a) daytime ionosphere at a 96 km altitude and for nighttime ionosphere; (b) at 96 km altitude; and (c) 109.5 km altitude, respectively. As can be seen, for lower ionospheric altitudes (Figure 6.50a and c) the spectra of echo signal distribution in the time domain is the same in both diurnal and nocturnal ionosphere and indicates the existence of irregularities of 1-type, defined in Refs. [170 – 176] and presented in Figure 6.45a. They also indicate that the electron drift velocity always exceeds the ion acoustic speed, which is enough to create two-stream instability waves (e.g., FBI waves) in the equatorial ionospheric plasma. Thus, the peaks of 1-type of echo signals indicate that the 1-type instable plasma waves (e.g., irregularities) travel radially away from the radar with velocity approximately equal 315 m = s. As for higher altitudes (Figure 6.50c), the spectral characteristics differ completely from those presented for lower altitudes. Here, evidently the 2-type of echo signals occur corresponding to GDI causing large-scale waves (irregularities of type 2) at the top of the equatorial sporadic E layer with oscillatory variations of spectral shapes. The same difference between spectral characteristics along altitudes in the bottom, central, and the top levels of the equatorial E spread layer has been observed from results of radar observations carried out in the space domain, presented in Figure 6.51a (daytime) and Figure 6.51b (nighttime) obtained in Ref. [55]. The intersample gap for the former figure is D t ¼ 1.44 s, and that for the latter figure is D t ¼ 4.32 s. Again, we see that for both time observations, daytime and nocturnal, the narrow quasi-symmetric-shaped spectra for each of the five consecutive estimates at altitudes less than 100 km (bottom part of layer) and the wide multimode-shaped spectra at the center of the E layer. As for altitudes above 110 km (top part of the E layer), quasi-symmetrical narrow (but not smooth) spectra are observed that at higher altitudes for daytime ionosphere (Figure 6.51a) continuously transform into multimode diffuse spectra, an effect that has not been found for nighttime spectral observations in the Doppler shift domain. These pictures were also observed by using HF radar, as well as by satellite. Thus, simultaneous observations using the 14.2 MHz HF radar were carried out with a time resolution of 1.44 s at 10 min intervals (during a 2 h period) at an elevation angle of about 20 8 . The corresponding measured data in the Doppler shift domain (from \u0001 50 to þ 50 Hz) is shown in Figure 6.52. The strong 2-type echo signal spectra are evident, which again allows for pointing out the main role of large-scale plasma irregularities associated with GDI in generation of turbulent small-scale eddies embedded into a large-scale structure. Therefore, some authors, based on results of measurements, have proposed three kinds of the echo-signal power spectra [52]: type 1, type 2, and the mixed type, as shown in Figure 6.53. At the same time, as shown in Ref. [52], the shape of the power spectrum depends on the zenith angle of the radar scattering cross section, which differs for all three types of spectra presented in Figure 6.53. This effect was proved by series of in situ experiments during the corresponding rocket probe measurements of plasma structure and ambient electric field in the equatorial ionosphere [177 – 179]. Thus, as was shown experimentally by the rocket observations presented in Figure 6.54, the shape of the spectra depends strongly on the elevation angle of observations of the equatorial E spread layer.

Moreover, in Refs.

The corresponding in situ measurements of the altitudinal profile of the plasma concentration inside the inhomogeneous E region (the left panel) and the frequency – height sonogram (the right panel) extracted from Ref. [177] are shown in Figure 6.55. A more detailed examination of the pure two-stream region consisting of F-B instabilities was made in Ref. [178]. In Figure 6.56 frequency – time – altitude dependence is displayed for this region to show the high Doppler shift, which can measure up to several hundreds of hertz and the corresponding drift velocities of several hundreds meters per second which can easily cross the ion acoustic speed threshold for FBI generation in the altitudinal range 106 – 111 km. The experimentally obtained results were analyzed and summarized in Ref. [179] on the basis of analysis of Figures 6.50 through 6.56, from which it is evident in which altitudinal region the two kinds of instabilities prevail to generate the corresponding plasma irregularities. Additional measurements have shown that for small-scale eddies with scales from 1 m to 15 – 20 m the plasma density fluctuations (with respect to background ionospheric plasma) do not exceed 1% – 2%, whereas for moderate-scale eddies (with scales 30 – 300 m) these characteristics can achieve 10% – 20%.

[182]. The authors mostly studied an altitudinal range from 95 to 120 km during the daytime and evening time periods. Because their results are precise, with high resolution of measured data in space, time and frequency domains, we present here further vivid physical results obtained in the aforementioned reference. Thus, we present here only two characteristic plots of altitude – time (Figure 6.57) for echo signal power (or signal-to-noise ratio, S = N, in dB) and for Doppler velocities, V d ,inm = s (Figure 6.58), where the pixel size in Figure 6.57 was about 125 m in the space domain and 1.92 s in the time domain. In Figure 6.58, the black pixels correspond to downward velocities greater than 20 m = s, the light pixels correspond to upward velocities greater than 20 m = s, and velocities of 20 m = s and less are dark. As can be seen in the upper sublayer stretching from 110 to 115 km, the scattered echo signals are strongest. The corresponding irregularities have a tendency to move downward, whereas at the lower sublayer of 95 – 100 km the tendency to move upward is usually observed and less violent dynamics is exhibited. These two layers are separated by a distinct gap in the echo signals. The tendency of echo signal power and Doppler velocity distribution in a 2-D altitude – time domain observed for midday periods is changed slightly. The corresponding example of these two characteristics is shown in Figure 6.59 for S = N (the left panel) and for V d (the right panel). It can be seen that in daytime periods more intensive echo signals arrive from the lower sublayer located at altitudes 97 – 107 km with a tendency of higher downward velocities with respect to the higher layer, which is now sufficiently weak.

To argue the existence of FBI as a potential source of observed H E irregularities in the middle latitudes, it was assumed in Refs. [162 – 164] that if accounting for the metallic ions (namely, Fe þ ) instead of monoatomic simple ions, then the corresponding ion acoustic speed threshold becomes several times lower, and the corresponding condition of F-B instability generation can be satisfied with sufficient accuracy also in the middle-latitude E region. Thus, taking T e \u0004 T i ¼ 400 K at altitude 120 – 125 km (middle-latitude conditions; see Chapter 5) and M Fe þ i ¼ 56 amu, we find that the ion acoustic speed is given by C s \u0004 345 m = s, which is similar to that observed in the equatorial E region. Hence, it can be suggested that H E irregularities observed in the middle-latitude ionosphere have the same nature as the equatorial sporadic E sq irregularities and can be associated with the two-stream (or FBI) instability. We will now describe several modern experimental methods for measuring the electron content and the plasma density profile of the E equatorial region, which recently began to be used in the study of irregular structures of the ionosphere. It is evident that knowledge of plasma density allows for predicting effects of refraction, scattering, and reflection of probing radio waves passing the corresponding irregular layers of the ionosphere (see Chapters 7 to 9). It has been established for many years that the conventional method of measuring electron density profile in the strongly variable E region of the equatorial ionosphere, as a thin rarefied ionospheric layer, by using incoherent scatter radar is generally unacceptable for daytime periods, and rocket probe sounding is the only technique that can provide information about this region of the ionosphere (see Refs. [177 – 179] and the references contained therein). In Ref. [183] it was recently reported that even when using the Jicamarca radar system based on an incoherent scatter technique, strong interference of the echo signals arriving at the receiver after scattering from intensive FAIs filling the equatorial E region is observed, which makes it difficult to measure the plasma density profile and the corresponding electron concentration in the ionosphere. Therefore, in Ref. [183], a new remote-sensing technique for measuring plasma (electron) density was proposed and successfully employed, taking into account advantages of the coherent scatter radar based on measurements of the Faraday rotation angle. It is well known that the Faraday rotation of the radio signals passing through ionospheric plasma occurs in proportion to the electron density along the radio path. The differences in the Faraday angle from one radar range gate to the next indicate the plasma density at a given altitude. Using advantages of the Jicamarca bistatic coherent radar operating at 50 MHz, it was shown [183] that this radar can detect signals passing the daytime thin rarefied equatorial E layer with an accuracy of less than 1 rad of the Faraday rotation, i.e., even in the hard conditions when the rotation rate decreases significantly. Figure 6.61, extracted from Ref. [183], represents the geometry of the experiment. A bistatic coherent radar system for measuring the Faraday rotation angle was arranged at Paracas (the transmitter) and Jicamarca (the receiver), Peru. We will not describe this technique in any kind of depth; we will only point out that the scattered ionospheric area was located at altitude of about 100 km. In Figure 6.61 the irregular solid line indicates the Pacific coastline, and the horizontal line bisecting the figure indicates the locus of perpendicularity to B 0 at an altitude of 100 km. At the right-hand side of the figure the radar antenna pattern is shown with spacing of antenna elements at \u0005 1.5 l for both site terminal antennas. Figure 6.61 shows the effective two-way power pattern in the combined transmitter and receiver arrays. The half-power full beam width of the main antenna lobe was about 6 8 , and the sidelobes were down by more than 20 dB compared to the main lobe. Using four five-element antennas with \u0005 1.5 l broadside spacing and sending narrow pulses (3 m s) with high pulse repetition frequency, the authors of Ref. [183] significantly increased the sensitivity of the experiment with minimization of the error in measurements of the Faraday rotation angles. For a whole cycle of experiments both terminal antennas were synchronized using satellite (GPS) receivers.

The corresponding electron density profiles computed at about 20 min time intervals are shown in Figure 6.62b based on the Faraday rotation analysis. To compare the new technique proposed in Ref. [183] with that based on a sounding by rocket probe during the Condor campaign (see previous text), the latter measurements of electron concentration in the equatorial E region and the corresponding plasma profile are shown in Figure 6.62c according to Refs. [177 – 179]. On the basis of the theoretical background that predicted existence of two-stream waves and the cascade wave interaction (from large-scale to small-scale) occurring in the daytime equatorial electrojet, an existence of the echo signals scattered from the topside of the E layer can be observed using bistatic coherent radar technique that record waves with wavelengths at the outer scale of two-stream turbulence [183]. This argument is evident from Figure 6.63, where the altitudinal dependences of (a) S = N, (b) magnitude of correlation (the coherence), (c) the echo signal phase (in radians), and (d) the electron density (in cm \u0001 3 ) are depicted.

The observed plateau along altitude in S = N and the coherence (from 95 to 110 km) (Figure 6.63a and b, respectively) fully correspond to the absence of the signal phase deviations (Figure 6.63c) recorded by the radar receiver. Obtained results allow us to point out that this technique, based on measurements of the Faraday rotation angles by backscatter bistatic coherent radar, can be successfully adapted for obtaining F region density profiles when spread F prevents ionogram inversion.

This technique was also validated via the standard ‘‘ Faraday International Reference Ionosphere ’’ (FIRI) empirical model based on Faraday rotation experiments conducted on flying rockets, which provides electron densities between 60 and 140 km [186], as well as with the analytical Danilov ’ s model [187] as an option of IRI model, but for the D equatorial region (below 90 km).

Observations of Irregularities in the Equatorial F Layer . Before going into the subject of main properties of irregularities of various origins and scales located in the equatorial F region of the ionosphere and of modern methods of studying their main parameters and characteristics important for radio propagation, let us point out some general aspects of the problem. First, according to knowledge obtained in Chapter 1, we should stress that the main difference between the F layer compared with the E layer of the ionosphere is the that region F extends from about 180 to 200 km up to more than 700 – 800 km, where it continuously transfers to the magnetosphere. Having a thickness more than 500 km, this region of the ionosphere is affected by different physical processes occurring at its bottom part, inside the layer and in the topside of region F. Therefore, it was difficult from the beginning to investigate all processes accompanying formation and further evolution of plasma at different altitudinal ranges of this ionospheric region.

Moreover, at altitudes of the F layer, the transport processes are predominant compared with ionization – recombination processes occurring in the lower E layer of the ionosphere. The ambient conditions are also changed compared with the E layer, because in the equatorial F region the evolution of plasma large- and moderate-scale irregularities associated with various instabilities occurring in the ionosphere is controlled (as in the middle-latitude ionosphere; see previous section) by atmospheric wind, ambient electric, magnetic, and gravitation fields, finally defining the specific dynamics of such irregularities. The small-scale irregularities, as in the E layer, are usually embedded into large-scale plasma structures, and such chaotic (turbulent) structures result in diffuse echo signals (i.e., oscillations of signal amplitude and phase) due to back = forward scattering from turbulent regions consisting of eddies of various origins and with scales varying from dozens of meters to hundreds of kilometers. Below, following Refs. [188 – 214], we describe experimental investigations of irregularities occurring in the equatorial F region, covering a layer surrounding the dip equator with a width of 15 8 northward and southward, respectively. Then we analyze separately the depletion zones accompanying evolution of large-scale irregularities, called bubbles in the literature [56 – 61,213 – 215]. Because the geomagnetic field lines lie in the horizontal plane to the ground surface, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the gravity field and to the gradient of plasma density along ionospheric altitudes. Under such conditions, the Pedersen horizontal currents are generated at the bottom side of the F layer, and the effect of short-circuit currents between the highly-conductive E layer and the lower side of the F layer dictates the evolution of irregularities observed experimen- tally. Large-scale irregularities created at the bottom side of the F layer floating upward penetrate the central and topside of the F region, generating these irregularities of wide spectrum of scales, from moderate (with hundreds of meters to a few kilometers) to small (of dozens of meters to several meters). Here we should note that, despite the fact that some authors have presented another separation on several different kinds of irregularities according to their scales, we divide irregularities into large, moderate, and small scales, because throughout our book, right from the beginning (see Chapter 1), we have compared their scales with characteristic dimensions of plasma components, electrons and ions, such as their free path length, gyroradius in the ambient magnetic field, and so on. Therefore, our differentiation into separate groups of irregularities with their specific spatial and temporal evolution is based on the understanding of physical processes occurring in the ionospheric plasma. It should also be noted that, as done for irregularities of the equatorial E layer, in this chapter we do not go deeply into the analysis of physical processes accompanying formation of plasma instabilities and associated plasma irregularities. These aspects are fully presented in Chapters 2 and 5. Here, we will draw the attention of the reader to the methodology of modern radio and in situ rocket and satellite methods of observations for predicting the main characteristics of the irregular structure of the equatorial F region that are important for the performance of the corresponding radio propagation links passing through this region of the ionosphere. The equatorial spread F phenomenon has been studied sporadically for five or six decades. However, the first systematic radar observations of the equatorial F layer were carried out at the end of the 1960s to the end of the 1970s [188 – 198] and continued through the 1980s [199 – 205] up to the end of the 1990s [206 – 214] using HF = VHF radar systems located in different geographical sites of Earth (see details in Chapter 8) combining modern in situ measurements using rocket and Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 324 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i 324 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"satellite physical probes. Such radio sounding of the F region of the equatorial ionosphere together with systematic in situ rocket and satellite probe measurements allowed investigators to create an adequate theoretical background to explain many specific features of plasma irregularities of various origins observed experimentally.

[188 – 200] using non-great-circle propagation on the transequatorial path from Lindau (West Germany) to Tsumeb (South West Africa), combined with radar backscatter observations in Nairobi (Kenya). In Lindau ( \u0004 51 8 40 0 N, \u0004 10 8 10 0 E), the transmitter sent impulse radio signals at the carrier frequency of 18.21 MHz, which arrived at the receiver located at Tsumeb ( \u0004 19 8 10 0 S, \u0004 17 8 40 0 E).

The pulse duration of 200 m s used in this type of ionospheric sounding prevents an exact observation of propagation paths showing azimuthal deviations less than D a ¼ 10 8 around the great-circle area. Simultaneously, the monostatic back- scatter radar, where the transmitter and receiver were arranged in one location in Nairobi ( \u0004 1 8 30 0 S, \u0004 36 8 50 0 E), operating at 27.8 MHz, was used with rotation in azimuth plane antenna to obtained echo signals reflected from the equatorial spread F irregularities. First, we present results obtained along the radio trace Lindau – Tsumeb. Experiments were carried out according to equatorial spread F conditions when echo signals predominantly occur via F layer scattering. The received propagation modes on non-great-circle paths were characterized by the number of semihops between Earth and the ionosphere, northward and southward from the equator line (Figure 6.66). Using geometry of traces, the mean position of irregularities was found by using information on signal propagation time and azimuth of arriving signals. During experi- ments, several groups of traces or patches were observed, mostly from 20:00 to 22:00 (UT), showing a wavelike horizontal structure of the area of scattering. The distances between patches were defined by the authors as horizontal scale d WE of wavelike plasma irregularities in the west – east direction. The left panel in Figure 6.67 shows the distribution of d WE obtained from the corresponding sounding of the ionosphere during March 1971. As is evident, the patch size can be a few hundreds of kilometers with a mean value of about 380 km, and the lower and upper boundaries at 210 and 640 km, respectively.

The lifetime of irregularity patches, D t , was determined as the time during which patches were observed at 18.21 MHz. Its distribution is shown in Figure 6.68.

Additional analysis of this phenomenon has shown that the observed irregularities are strongly elongated along geomagnetic field lines (the same as was shown for the equatorial E layer; see previous text). So, preliminary observations indicated the existence in the equatorial F region of large-scale quasi-periodical (having wavelike structure) FAIs of plasma density. Therefore, the authors assumed that these irregularities of electron density could be stated as precursors of periodically occurring equatorial spread F irregularities. Moreover, results obtained by monostatic backscatter radar indicated a high correlation in the occurrence of equatorial large-scale spread F irregularities identified using backscattering echo signals and signals arriving due to bistatic transequatorial propagation through the equatorial region. Further, the in situ satellite probe [191,192] and rocket probe [196 – 199] direct measure- ments of ambient plasma parameters in the equatorial zones of the ionosphere proved the existence of the large-scale spread F quasi-periodical (i.e., wavelike) irregularities in the equatorial ionosphere. However, despite the fact that in Refs. [188 – 190] an existing close association between the wavelike structures observed experimentally and atmospheric gravity waves occurring in the equatorial zones has been assumed, no theoretical proof was proposed to explain the close correlation between phenomena. This was done by several authors using radar sounding from ground-based facilities placed at different geographical points along the dip equator and by several theoretical works created by analyzing of experimental data [193 – 195,200 – 212]. We will describe briefly their results accounting for methods of study of main parameters of these plasma structures. We start with systematic organized experiments carried out in Peru using the same 50 MHz radar located in Jicamarca [193 – 195] (see technical details of this radar system in Chapter 8). The same monostatic backscatter radar was used for investigation of spread E irregularities, the technical details of which were given earlier, and, therefore, we will not repeat this description and will instead analyze results of measurements of structure, localization, and dynamics of the spread F irregularities in the equatorial zones. The authors used the same, but modified, more precise technique based on measured data presentation as the range – time – intensity (RTI) radar plots using 5 km pulses. As for a digital power mapping (DPM) technique, 2.5 km pulses were used. Using this modified, very sensitive backscatter radar, the occurrence of spread F echo signals in the space and time domains and their relation to the plasma (electron or ion, plasma is quasi-neutral) density and irregularity drifts was obtained with high accuracy. Thus, Figure 6.70, extracted from Ref. [195], presents spatial and altitudinal distribution of echo signals scattered from spread F irregularities, their relation to electron density (log 10 N e ) denoted by lines with the corresponding values, electron density gradients ( Sp F ) denoted by vertical black lines superimposed on the density contours and indicate areas filling by irregularities, and also present vertical drift velocity plotted around the horizontal axis (around the zero-line). The dashed line defines the maximum altitude of the F region denoted by h max . It is evident that spread F large-scale irregularities occur mostly in the evening time periods, floating both upward (drift velocity is positive) and downward (drift velocity is negative) with vertical drift velocities not exceeding 40 m = s, respectively. The drift velocities have been estimated more precisely from signal power spectra in the Doppler shift domain (using the same methodology that was introduced for estimation of drift velocities of spread E irregularities described earlier). At the same time, the shape of power spectra (more than 3000 samples of spectral characteristics were obtained) allowed researchers to determine the corresponding types of irregularities occurring in the F region. Thus, in Figure 6.71 a set of selected spectra corresponding to different altitudes and observation times are shown to illustrate the different forms of echo signals.

Obtained experimental data indicates a more complicated (composite) structure of echo signal power spectra which change with altitude of the F region and evening time period of observation. Thus, the composite spectra with broadening widths are mostly observed for higher altitudes above 400 km, whereas the fine and narrow spectra with narrow widths are recorded at the bottom side of the F region.

[193 – 195] first outlined the two possible candidates of generation of irregularities located at the bottom side of the F region as the gradient- drift instability (GDI) and the drift instability. These irregular plasma structures observed in the spread F region and responsible for strong backscatter from FAIs filling this structure are usually called the plumes . As is shown, they float upward from the bottom side to the topside of the F layer. Moreover, the close correlation between the echo signals reflected from the steep bottom side of the F region and existence of steep gradients of plasma density in this altitudinal region was found experimentally. At the same time, in further studies carried out by other authors it was shown that the mechanisms of spread F irregularities generation is more complicated, and these two proposed mechanisms can be taken as an extension of Rayleigh – Taylor instability caused by coupling between the plasma at altitudes of the F region and atmospheric gravity waves. We will discuss these important experimentally obtained results in the following text, but now we will note again that the authors of Refs. [193 – 195] more precisely (with respect to preliminary studies) investigated the main features of these plasma structures plumes , and, more importantly, related them and their spatial and temporal dynamics to the corresponding depletion plasma areas, called bubbles, and their spatial and temporal dynamics. Because this phenomenon is important for the further evolution of the irregular structure of the middle and topside of the F region, we will consider it separately. Finishing the analysis of results obtained in Refs. [193 – 195] we should point out that the incoherent scatter radar used in the radio observatory of Jicamarca (Peru) allows associating the rapidly growing plumes inside the spread F regions with strong echo signals received after scattering from meter-scale irregularities (according to Bragg ’ s law of backscattering, the scale of the scatterer equals the half-wavelength of radiated radio wave, i.e., ‘ ¼ l = 2 \u0004 3 m). At the same time, it has been shown [200 – 202,204] that this is correct only if the vector of the radiated radio wave is perpendicular to the geomagnetic field lines. When the radar wave vector is only a few degrees away from perpendicularity, wedge-shaped depleted plasma density structures and the collocated plasma bubbles with walls strongly stretched along geomagnetic field lines are usually observed. The results were obtained using steerable backscatter radar (called ALTAIR radar) located on the island of Kwajalein and operating at 0.96 m wavelength. All technical information on the ALTAIR radar system can be found in Ref. [200]. We will now discuss the main features of the observed irregular plasma structures. A thin structure and dynamics of plumes, and their spatial and temporal evolution, as well as the collocated bubbles, were observed experimentally with the help of the ALTAIR radar system. Thus, in Figure 6.73 sequences of backscatter radio map of echo signals is shown leading the generation and further evolution of secondary plumes A, B, and C. It is evident that during secondary plume generation the continued structuring of the west wall of upwelling is observed. Thus, as shown in Figure 6.73a, the primary plume extends vertically upward, floating up to altitudes of about 800 km. The bubbles collocated with the primary plume also developed upward from the wall. Generation of secondary plumes A (Figure 6.73b), B (Figure 6.73c), and C (Figure 6.73d) is evident during spatial and temporal evolution of the irregular plasma large-scale structure. The dynamics of plumes and the collocated bubbles are controlled by the collisional Rayleigh – Taylor instability, which can generate a gravity-driven equivalent velocity exceeding 180 m = s [202]. Finally, the three secondary plumes shown in Figure 6.73e and f have a mean east – west spacing of 125 km, compared to 400 km for three large upwellings and primary plumes. The west wall continuous structuring was also observed during development and evolution of the three secondary plumes. As was shown experimentally in Ref. [203] by in situ observations of satellite probe measurements, plasma bubbles produce scintillations and Faraday rotation on the polarization plane of radio waves crossing the depletion regions, which are important features for future ionospheric radio link performance.

Existence of the horizontally stratified ionosphere with an increase of the plasma density gradient along altitude, as well as the eastward electric field observed in in situ rocket and satellite experiments [191,192,196 – 199] after sunset (i.e., exactly in the evening time periods when such echo signals were observed by ALTAIR and Jicamarca radars) are the best candidates for gradient-drift instability generation with the growth rate g E ¼ E = BL at the further stage of the large-scale irregular plasma structure evolution as an additional source of plasma irregularity generation. Here, E and B are the magnitudes of ambient electric and magnetic fields. In Ref. [204] the effect of a neutral wind was considered as a probable additional candidate for plasma irregularity generation and a destabilizing factor in regions where plasma density contours are tilted at an angle a with the density gradient r N partially directed westward.

However, both spectra are similar before and beyond this range. The small-scale irregularities (denoted in the left panel as short-wavelength, SW) of 10 – 100 m have been termed transitional whereas those with dimensions above 20 km (called long-wavelength, LW) have been termed long. The transition range refers to the small-scale irregularities that are responsible for backscatter at Jicamarca ( ‘ ¼ 3 m) and ALTAIR ( ‘ ¼ 0 : 96 m) radar observations. Additional studies [200 – 204] showed that the spectra presented in the left-hand panel of Figure 6.75 varies roughly as k \u0001 n , n ¼ 1.5 – 2.0 in the intermediate range, i.e., for the moderate-scale irregularities, whereas for the small-scale irregularities it can vary more sharply, with n ¼ 2.5 – 3 and more (up to n ¼ 4 – 6 [200,201]). These results also show that introducing effects of turbulent diffusion and wave coupling, i.e., interactions between small-, moderate-, and large-scale irregularities (see Chapter 2), one can explain the experimentally observed complicated spectral distribution plasma density irregularities. Evidence that such processes occur in the equatorial spread F region is shown in Figure 6.76, where spectral distribution of electron density fluctuations for irregularities of various scales filled the bottom side F region. The common form of spectra, k \u0001 n , n ¼ 2 þ k , k ¼ 1 – 2, obtained theoretically for the moderate-scale irregularities, is interrupted by a steep regime. In Ref.

The spectral breaks where observed in Figure 6.76 for the inner scales at about 2 km scale and at about 100 m scale, i.e., within the intermediate range. According to Ref.

From the presented radio pattern of echo signals shown in Figure 6.82, it can be seen that in the initial phase of irregular layer evolution, the irregularities are extended in altitude in the form of three plumes, the central one penetrating at latitudes beyond 800 km. After about 20:20 LT, a steep descent of the spread F region takes place and the irregularities occupy a narrow altitudinal region not more than 100 km in thickness. Thus, during a further period the thickness of the irregular layer with filled irregularities is reduced. Figure 6.83 shows the time variations (scintilla- tions) of signal strength obtained by using the 250 MHz transmission from the FLEETSATCOM satellite which are then received at the Huancayo observatory (see intersection point denoted in Figure 6.82). Thus, the plasma density structure and the corresponding signal scintillations can be obtained simultaneously. It was found in Ref.

It is interesting to note that other experiments give the same or an even greater difference between the zonal neutral winds and the drift velocity of observed irregularities filling the equatorial F region, higher by 40% during the equinoxes and by 100% during the winter [203]. Because the obtained data was not sufficient to draw any conclusions, the authors also used in situ obtained satellite data [207,209], results of which are shown in Figure 6.85 in the form of an altitudinal profile of eastward drift velocity (in m = s). The main result shown here is the increase of the zonal drift velocity of irregularities beyond an altitude of about 580 km in the period from 19:55 to 20:10, the onset of the spread F layer. The arrow in Figure 6.85 indicates the selection of an appropriate data point for drift comparison that was replotted in Figure 6.84 at 19:53 LT. A good coincidence between data obtained by different methods is evident. During recent decades researchers based their effort for investigating the total electron content and plasma density profile during equatorial spread F events on the Jicamarca radar system described earlier. Thus, using the Jicamarca Unattended Long-Term Investigation (JULIA) radar, echo signal scintillations were recorded from two stations, of which the first was located near the magnetic equator (in Ancon) and the second located 12 8 southward, in Antofagasta, Peru. In investigations of the equatorial F spread, observations of 3 m irregularities forming altitude- elongated plumelike structures were carried out. Thus, Figure 6.86 displays a plot of the magnitude of the coherent echo signals recorded by the JULIA radar during the period 10 – 11 October, 1998 (top panel) [213]. The bottom panel shows the scintillation index, S4, temporal distribution during the same period measured by the Ancon east and the Antofagasta west receivers. It can be seen that during registration of strong scintillations of signal intensity by a station located in Antofagasta, plasma plumes extending up to altitudes of about 900 km were observed simultaneously by the Radar interferometer JRO 19:55-20:10 LT October 11, 1988 600 580 560 540 520 500 480 460 440 420 400 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 Eastward velocity, m/s Figure 6.85 Altitudinal profile of the eastward velocity, in m = s, of irregularities observed by radar interferometer.

It was also found that reflections arrive at the receiver from easterly and westerly directions in both the E and F regions. The irregularities responsible for these echo signals and operating frequency 4.5 MHz have dimensions (according to Bragg ’ s rule) of about 33 m, i.e., ten times greater than those of the irregularities observed at 50 MHz backscatter Jicamarca radar.

As can be seen, at lower altitudes in the E layer the spectra shape is symmetrical corresponding to the type 1 irregularities, and the symmetry is conserved even at the upper part of the E layer. This symmetry relative to zero is also observed at the intermediate altitudes with wide spreading of spectrum, becoming wider than in the F region where spectra remain broad. What is important is that for the latter two regions, spectra lose the specific shape of the type 2 irregularity. More detailed analysis of experimental data concerning Doppler spread of recorded signal allows for estimating the velocity of the horizontal motion of irregularities filling both regions: for the E region of the order of 100 m = s and for the F 1 region of the order of 130 m = s.

Like other authors, they first suggested a gravity wave wind-driven instability as the main candidate of generation of associated FAIs. However, following results presented in Figure 6.90 and the ambient conditions of the experiment, the gravity wave activity was found to be weak. Another mechanism of generation of irregularities proposed during the analysis of the results obtained by using the ALTAIR incoherent radar system (in Kwajalein) is related to the polarization electric field developed in response to the presence of a latitudinal gradient of plasma density [200 – 202]. In the experiments described in the aforementioned references, the magnetic field lines pass over the magnetic equator at 150 km, and, therefore, the echo signals were observed over Kwajalein at a height of the 150 km. In the current experiment described in Ref. [207], the magnetic field lines cross the magnetic equator at an altitude 120 km. Because the 150 km HF echo signals were observed here simultaneously with a Doppler bilateral symmetry and the extension of the irregu- larities region upward to the F 1 region, it is difficult to explain the echo signals arriving from the 150 km region by the same mechanism of latitudinal gradient influence on drift processes described in Refs. [200 – 202]. This result again allows us to point out (as we did earlier) that the wide spectrum of physical processes occurring in the equatorial E and F regions of the ionosphere and vertical coupling between these two regions finally lead to a very complicated picture of temporal and spatial evolution of irregular plasma structures associated with the spread E and F layers.

We will now briefly describe this phenomenon and how it can be studied. Studies of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles . As noted earlier, the bubbles are the localized plasma depletion regions associated with the plasma enhancements called plumes, which follow the latter in their spatial and temporal evolution to secure conditions of plasma quasi-neutrality at each place of spread F layer filled by disturbed irregularities [56 – 61,193 – 195,216 – 235]. The transverse dimensions (with respect to B 0 ) of such plasma structures are of the order of tens to hundreds of kilometers. The first systematic radar observation of the equatorial F region [193 – 195] found that bubbles always collocate the tilted and plumelike plasma structures, and together they filled the whole thickness of the spread F layer, from the bottom side to the topside of its boundaries. From the beginning it was stated [195] and theoretically proved [193,194] that a close relation of bubble structures with Hamilton ’ s mechanism of positive plasma gradients creation due to plasma extension of the gravitational instability (e.g., the Rayleigh – Taylor instability described in Chapter 2) is responsible for the chaotic motion taking place whenever a heavier fluid rests on top of a lighter one. In these works, to explain the existence of regions with negative gradients of plasma density, i.e., the bubbles observed experimentally at the topside of the equatorial F region, a three-fluid phenomenological model was proposed. According to this model, the lightest fluid is located at the bottom side of the F region, and the second, the heaviest, is at its middle part (denoted by crests), and the fluid with the moderate density is located at its topside (denoted by straight crossing lines), as shown in Figure 6.91, where dynamics of bubblelike plasma structure, having cylindrical shape with the axis directed along B 0 , is sketched schematically. As can be seen from this sketch of a Figure 6.91 Schematic presentation of dynamics of bubblelike structure in the upper ionosphere.

In the coordinate system moving with the E \u0006 B 0 drift, a vertically floating upward bubble with its wake having any configuration produces in its evolution a plumelike vertical structure. To explain the phenomenon of tilting of plumelike structure in Refs. [193 – 195], it was assumed that the bubble could move eastward with a velocity not exceeding the background E \u0006 B 0 drift velocity. When the neutral atmosphere moves eastward faster than E \u0006 B 0 drift, the bubble will move more slowly than the background plasma. However, this difference between velocities of the neutral and ionized medium was not observed experimentally. Therefore, another mechanism was assumed to explain the tilt phenomenon of plumes, taking into account a sheared drift in the ionosphere, assuming the east – west drift to be faster at the bottom side of the F layer compared with that at the topside. We note that the same mechanism was proposed during observation of the barium cloud evolution (see previous text). These were not systematic evalu- ations of the problem. The more rigorous models based on linear and nonlinear collisional Rayleigh – Taylor instability type generated in plasma were performed to explain processes of creation and further evolution of bubbles in the topside of the spread F layer [56 – 58,218 – 235]. Some rigorous numerical models, taking into account many experimentally observed natural features occurring in the equatorial F spread, have finally shown stable evidence of the existence of upward-floating bubbles, as vertically elongated depleted plasma density regions extending upward to the topside ionosphere and accom- panying evolution of plumelike plasma enhancement plasma structures. We will not go deeply into the mathematical aspects of the problem and the corresponding physical models. We will present the most interesting experiments using simultaneous ground-based radar and satellite observations carried out for finding parameters of plasma structures that could be important for predicting the propagation characteristics of probing radio waves passing the F region of the equatorial ionosphere, which is important both for land – ionospheric and land – satellite communication. More systematically, plumelike and bubblelike spatial and temporal evolution were analyzed [218 – 235] using the ground-based radars located at Jicamarca and Kwajalein described earlier and comparing the measured data with those obtained during satellite observations,. We present only those results that give full presentation of the phenomena under consideration. Thus, we focus on experiments carried out by using the ALTAIR backscatter radar located at Kwajalein operating simultaneously at 155.5 and 415 MHz [217,218] combined with in situ measurements carried out by satellite probes [61,215,219,226,227]. Thus, in Refs. [217,218], comparing the observed data obtained by different methods, the location of bubbles relative to plumelike plasma density enhancement structures, their dynamics, shape, density profile, and velocity of movements were reported. The in situ measurements carried out by satellites having a low inclination orbit over island Kwajalein at altitudes ranging from 372.5 to 374.5 km have shown, during all the sets of experiments, full depletion (of about 99%) of regions collocated the plume structures, which were defined by researchers as typical bubbles [227]. Thus, in Figure 6.92 the ion-density profiles obtained by in situ probe measurements during the satellite trajectory passing the ALTAIR radar during a short-term period from 10:41 to 10:43 UT (which corresponds to 21:51 – 21:53 LT) on August 1978. The satellite trajectory is presented in Figure 6.92 by solid lines with bold points with 16 s intervals between points directed from west to east near the zero magnetic aspect ( B ? ) curve. The ALTAIR radar scan was close in time to the moments of satellite trajectory to cross the magnetic meridian at about 21:51 to 21:53 LT (10:41-10:43 UT). The authors of Refs. [217,218] extrapolated spatially the measured ion density data along the magnetic meridian into a plane Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 348 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i 348 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"scanned by the radar. Thus, in Figure 6.92 the ion density variations were plotted along the ALTAIR radar zero magnetic aspect curve, shown by the dashed line placed at altitude of 400 km. The authors have identified ion-density variations of interest in terms of four bubbles denoted by letters A to D (see the topside of Figure 6.93). The monotonic increase of depth of depletion areas from A to D is evident, with bubble D depleted by more than two orders of magnitude from the background plasma, i.e., more than the other (A to C) bubbles. The relations between plasma bubbles and the collocated plumes obtained by ALTAIR radar during the same period are shown in Figure 6.93. The top panel presents the ion-density variations measured by the satellite during its trajectory (inverted from those presented in Figure 6.92), whereas the bottom panel presents the corresponding radar backscatter radio map. The path of the satellite is superimposed above this radio map corresponding to the height of the satellite above Earth ’ s surface. The contours of the equal strength corresponding to the strongest echo signals (of 40 – 50 dB) can be associated with plumelike structures observed by the radar. Thus, two plume structures are clearly seen at the time of the satellite pass. The major plume extends upward at an altitude exceeding 700 km and the minor one appears next to the west side of the major plume. This plume pair was associated by the authors with the large-scale upwelling that has an east – west dimension of approximately 400 km (or even more). The relationship of bubbles with collocated plumes was determined by the vertical lines between the upper and bottom panels, as shown in Figure 6.93. Bubble A corresponds to a weak patchy backscatter region located to the west of the minor plume, which was interpreted in Refs. [215,216] by the absence of plasma structures within bubble A. Bubbles B and C were more structured. Bubble D corresponds to the strongest backscatter region in the neck of the major plume. Based on experimental observations, the two-dimensional shape of the plasma-depleted region was obtained (see Figure 6.94). The different character and structure of each bubble can be seen.

The combination of downdrifting and updrifting velocities due to the existence of eastward and westward electric field, as shown in case (c), leads to the pinching off of the upper part of the bubble. As observed experimentally from satellite measurements [59,61], such a plasma structure appears to be collapsing inward with a velocity of about 20 – 40 m = s. At the same time, the authors of Refs.

Equatorial plasma structures were measured over several months in 1999, using an electromagnetic probe operating at 1024 Hz.

We will consider investigations of irregular structures of both these regions, concentrating our attention on the processes occurring separately in the E and F regions, as was done in the previous subsection dealing with the equatorial ionosphere, because, as with the equatorial ionosphere, different physical processes accompany the spatial and temporal evolutions of the corresponding irregularities filling these two regions. Furthermore, different methods of observations, as well as the different theoretical models, are used to analyze the dynamics of these two regions of the ionosphere. Before going deeper into the subject, we should note that the geophysical ambient conditions are strongly varied in the high-latitude ionosphere compared with those observed in the middle-latitude and equatorial ionosphere, and that many observations carried out in the last four to five decades contradict one another as well as the corresponding theoretical frameworks. Therefore, we will not compare results of measurements and the corre- sponding theoretical models to discuss how to resolve all these contradictions. We will instead show in chronological order the perspective radio and optical methods based on a ground-based facility coupled with rocket and satellite probe observations of perturbed regions of the ionosphere filled by various irregularities, to better understanding the complicated physical processes and phenomena accompanying generation and further evolution of these irregularities in the high-latitude ionosphere for future understanding of their reaction to probing radio wave propagation through the disturbed ionospheric regions. This is why, in our further discussions, we divide the corresponding analysis into three subjects. The first aspect relates to the study of morphology of the high-latitude ionosphere, its plasma content, temperature, ambient electric and magnetic fields, and winds of neutral gas (all existing in both quiet and perturbed conditions). The second aspect deals with generation of plasma irregularities of a wide spectrum of dimensions, methods of observations of their dynamics, spatial location along altitudes, and their lifetime. As for the third subject, we will briefly discuss instabilities associated with the corresponding plasma irregularities, pointing out their specific reaction to radio waves propagating through the perturbed irregular ionospheric regions. The two latter aspects will be discussed simultaneously by referring to the experiments carried out and the corresponding measured data obtained using separate or jointly used modern radiophysical methods of the study of high-latitude ionosphere. Study of E Region Irregularities in the High-Latitude Ionosphere . In the high-latitude ionosphere E region plasma density irregularities are completely controlled by the ionospheric currents and plasma drifts in crossing E 0 \u0006 B 0 fields, because in high latitudes the ambient magnetic field is directed close to the vertical axis of Earth ’ s surface, and therefore plasma irregularities are field-aligned (oriented along B 0 ) and affected by the ambient electric field transverse to B 0 and also by the neutral wind with the horizontal component (across B 0 ) exceeding its vertical component (along B 0 ). Radar investigations of the E region of high-latitude ionosphere began even before the Second World War and are continuing even now. Extensive measurements of the auroral and polar zones of the ionosphere were carried out in the mid-1960s and 1970s. More systematical investigations of the effects of ambient phenomena (solar activity, high-energy particles of the cosmic rays, magnetic Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 359 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i Modern Radiophysical Methods of Investigation of Ionospheric Irregularities & 359"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"activity, and so on) on ionospheric plasma parameters deviations were carried out [39,236,237] using simultaneous Chatanika, Alaska, incoherent scatter radar, auroral optical camera, and photometric observing data (see technical details about these systems in Chapter 8). All ground- based facilities were arranged at the research center located near Chatanika (magnetic latitude 65.7 8 , geographic latitude 65 8 N). This radar system based on a unique technique allows for obtaining electron density profiles during quiet to strongly perturbed ambient conditions occurring in the high-latitude ionosphere at altitudes of 90 – 120 km. We have to note that there is a principal difference in the thickness of the auroral and equatorial E layers; the latter extends along altitudes up to 150 km and even higher, whereas the former extends only up to 120 – 130 km. In Refs. [121,122], not only was the plasma content measured, but also the variations of plasma disturbances in time, D N = D t , whose daytime variation Is given by D N = D t \u0004 3.7 cm \u0001 3 sec \u0001 1 . More detailed analysis using an ionosonde located at Anchorage, Canada, showed the parameters D N = D t \u0004 18.7 cm \u0001 3 s \u0001 1 and N max = N min \u0004 4.0 of E layer plasma density and its critical frequency deviations as reactions of E region to total solar eclipse. It was also found in Refs. [121,122] that the largest effects observed in the auroral E region occurred during the solar eclipse, when the obstruction of the solar disk was about 100% at the altitude h ¼ 100 km at the observation station. Then, in Ref. [39], the effects of auroral particle precipitations due to fast-moving high-energy particles falling at the ionospheric altitudes of the E region were analysed. Such particles could cause visible auroral emission. It was noted during observations made in Ref. [39] that whenever the discrete auroral arc passes directly over a vertical ionosonde position, the sporadic E layer maximal frequency ( fE s ) increases by several megahertz [121,122]. During the next two decades of investigations of the high-latitude E spread phenomena and a wide spectrum of irregularities observed experimentally, researchers focused their attention on different kinds of instabilities as being the potential sources of large- and small-scale plasma density irregularities, which were responsible for the auroral echo signals obtained experimentally at different high-latitude experimental sites throughout the world (see Refs. [41 – 47,238 – 247] and the bibliog- raphies therein). We note only some that, in our opinion, provide more detailed information about the shape and dimensions of irregularities and their degree of perturbation (compared with back- ground plasma), Doppler spectra, and the corresponding velocities of the observed plasma waves (i.e., irregularities), their spatial localization, dynamics, and lifetime. More interesting in our opinion is a cycle of combined complex experiments carried out in Alaska [238 – 244], using the Chatanika incoherent scatter radar described earlier briefly (see details in Chapter 8), and the 398 MHz phased array radar and 1210 MHz backscatter radar located at Homer, Alaska (59.72 8 N, 151.53 8 W) The geometry of the complex experiment is presented in Figure 6.101, where the magnetic aspect contours for an altitude of 110 km are shown by solid curves, changing from 0 8 to þ 6 8 , and the L -shell contours by dashed curves extending from L ¼ 5to L ¼ 9. The bold-boundary sector with the crossing fan-shaped lines indicates the working area of the Homer radar. During the operating period of the Chatanika radar, the Homer phased array (with scanning in azimuth domain 20 8 by the narrow beams with width of 2.3 8 ) covered this sector with Chatanika near the center of this sector. The first experiments were carried out at the operating frequency of 398 MHz. The creation of the radio coverage map observed by the Homer radar was correlated with optical observations using the combined all-sky camera coverage from Chatanika, the operated area of which is shown in Figure 6.101 by the crosshatched circle. Without going into the technical details of experiments described in detail in Refs. [238 – 244], we should point the essential effect of the ambient electric field occurring at altitudes of the E region with values of 30 to 40 mV = m when auroral echoes occur. Moreover, a good correlation between occurrence of the strong electric field and echo signals recording was found experimentally. At the same time, the plasma density at observed altitudes Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C006 Final Proof page 360 9.4.2008 5:02pm Compositor Name: BMan i 360 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"from 110 to about 120 km varied from 1.5 \u0002 10 6 to 5 \u0002 10 4 cm \u0001 3 in the daytime, with a further increase to 2 \u0002 10 5 cm \u0001 3 in the midday periods. The corresponding plasma irregularities were observed above the Chatanika ionospheric region using both optical and radio observations, mostly in the morning periods (06:00 to10:00 UT), and no nighttime (between 02:00 to 03:00 UT) not being observations were made. Further analysis of the experimentally obtained data allows for finding a short-term correlation between the auroral echo signal strength, ambient electric field, and plasma density of the observed irregularities. As an example, in Figure 6.102 are shown the results of measurements of these three parameters during a joint campaign carried out in the early morning (from 05:40 to 06:10 UT). In the bottom panel, the time dependence of the northward electric field component, measured at an altitude of 171 km, is depicted together with echo signal amplitude time deviations (solid curve), and the corresponding noise level (dashed curve). For the north – south electric field component, the scale in millivolts per meter is given on the right ordinate. The top panel of Figure 6.102 represents altitudinal distribution of plasma density within the high-latitude E region (from 95 to 170 km), where all numbers near lines of equal electron density are related to 1.0 \u0002 10 5 e = cm 3 by timing each number to this value. It can be seen that both curves at the bottom panel show satisfactory agreement (except for 2 min between 06:00 and 06:02 UT) and between these two curves. The development of a strongly irregular plasma structure in the E region, mostly occurs in periods when the echo signals have higher amplitude and the corresponding electric field exceeds 30 mV = m. The existence of two discrete radar peaks at this 2 min period is related by the researchers to the two arcs observed visually by the combined all-sky optical camera which, according to their assumption, reached their position just north of Chatanika passing the radar observation field.

We will return to this aspect after more precise investigations of spectral character- istics of the observed echo signals and their relations to the types of the corresponding instabilities as potential sources of associated plasma irregularities. Now, we present the possibilities of Homer radar to obtain radio response of the irregular structures of auroral ionosphere (called radio aurora ), such as arcs and blobs.

The backscatter signal intensity was analysed for various days and for different ranges of the velocities of movements of observed irregularities, from 300 to 350 and from 800 to 850 m = s. Statistical analysis of signal intensity distribution for these two velocity ranges found the same behavior for the 6 days of observations. This allowed the authors to compute the mean backscatter intensities, shown in Figure 6.105 along the vertical axis, for a wide velocity interval from 50 to 1000 m = s with a step of 50 m = s, and a broad scanning angle interval from 10 8 to 90 8 with a step of 10 8 (horizontal axis).

For higher V d (more than 650 – 700 m = s), corresponding to a strong ambient electric field varying between 20 and 30 mV = m, the maximum of the backscatter signal intensity decreases weakly. The authors of Refs. [45 – 47] explain the observed results by the influence of small-scale irregularities (i.e., short- wavelength plasma waves) moving with drift velocities less than C s during the process of destabil- ization of the long-wavelength plasma wave (i.e., the large-scale irregularities) via the wave – wave interactions using the cascade turbulent theory (see Chapter 2). According to Refs. [245 – 247], the small-scale irregularities causing backscatter signals at the receiver are produced by the two-stream (F-B) instability. At the same time, to explain backscatter signal behavior for drift velocities higher than C s , the authors artificially introduced an additional damping process. As in the case of experiments described previously, the obtained experimental results again did not offer an adequate theoretical explanation of observed phenomena and did not answer the question of what type of instability is responsible for this behavior of the scattered signals. To understand the role of different types of instabilities as the potential sources of the resonant aurora radar echo signals (i.e., the corresponding irregularities responsible for these signals), we should analyze the echo signal spectral distribution in the Doppler shift domain that was reported by several separate research groups in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States and Canada [43 – 47,248 – 251] based on HF and UHF radars and on the radar interferometer; in Alaska [252] based on the same Chatanika backscatter radar; and in Norway [253]. All the investigators found that, according to spectral characteristics of the echo signals scattered from the E spread, plasma irregularities observed in the high-latitude ionosphere could be classified in the same manner as irregularities were classified as occurring in the middle-latitude and equatorial ionosphere (depicted in Figure 6.45 as types 1 and 2). Finally, according to experimental results, the observed echo signals and corresponding irregularities were divided into two classes, types 3 and 4, the Doppler spectra of which are shown in Figure 6.106. These types of spectra (as will be discussed in the following text) were found only at high latitudes of the ionosphere, where they were usually observed after midnight and when ionospheric plasma was strongly perturbed.

Moreover, there are many contradictions between the theoretical background and the observations. Nevertheless, obtained experimental results allow for stating that both spectra have short lifetimes, and the corresponding irregularities have a mixed structure localized in space, where small-scale irregularities are embedded into the moderate- and large-scale irregularities with a high dynamic of coupling processes between irregularities with transformation of energy along the wide spectral waveband (i.e., scales). We will now analyze possible explanations for the observed phenomena occurring in the high-latitude irregular E region following experiments carried out and described in Refs. [43 – 47,248 – 253]. First, it is evident from spectra presented schematically in Figure 6.106 that both of them are narrow with a different Doppler shift. Thus, if the maximum of the type 3 echo signal corresponds to Doppler shift velocity of 200 – 250 m = s, which is small compared with the speed of ion acoustic waves, it cannot be considered as associated with F-B (two-stream) instability (see Chapter 2). At the same time, the maximum of the type 4 echo signal is usually located at the much higher Doppler shift velocities achieving 800 – 900 m = s, i.e., exceeding the threshold of the F-B instability, but we can associate the observed type 4 irregularities with two-stream instabilities occurring in the E region high-latitude ionosphere. To prove these statements, we will show some interesting results from references under consideration referring the reader to works [43 – 47,248 – 252], where the complex experiments and detailed theoretical interpretation of the observed phenomena were reported. Systematic observations of resonant auroral echo signal by the backscatter radar operating at 50 MHz and located northeast of Ithaca, New York (76.5 8 W, 42.5 8 N), were reported in Ref. [248]. This radar and methods of observation are very similar to those used in the Alaska campaign described earlier, and therefore we do not go further into the technical description of the experiment. We will show the geometry of the experiment and discuss some of the more interesting results of measurements of the Doppler spectra and dynamics of the irregularities responsible for auroral echo signals observed by this radar system.

The Doppler shift spectra of echo signals, i.e., the corresponding phase (Doppler) velocities of irregularities responsible for the radar echoes, were measured with a frequency resolution of 7.81 Hz, equivalent to a phase velocity resolution (in conditions of direct visibility, LOS) of 23.4 m = s, taking into account that at 50 MHz radiation, a Doppler shift of 1 Hz corresponds to a velocity of 3m = s. As was expected, two types of echo signal spectra against the Doppler shift were observed. We present only two typical variations of the Doppler spectra (1) in the time domain for a particular range of arriving scattered echoes of 398 km (Figure 6.108a), and (2) in the joint time and range domains (Figure 6.108b). We see, from Figure 6.108a, temporal variations of the shape of Doppler spectra from type 3 (i.e., narrow with a small shift) to type 4 (i.e., broad with a sufficiently high shift), whereas in Figure 6.108b the nearly constant Doppler shift corresponding to a 3-like spectra is always observed with narrow width, which, as shown in Ref. [248], was equal or smaller than the typical equatorial type 1 echo widths observed from the spread E region (see the previous subsection). The authors of Ref. [248] found that the direction of irregularities responsible for these radar echo signals is usually in nearly north – south, with velocities varying in a wide range from 200 to 300 m = s (corresponding to Doppler shifts of 70 – 90 Hz) to sometimes even exceeding 800 m = s. The authors explained such spectra shifts and the corresponding phase velocities of generated irregularities by the existence of unstable ion cyclotron waves and stated them to be a potential source of radar echo signal observed from the auroral E region of the ionosphere.

According to the typical spectra presented here, we can point out that the type 4 echoes usually have two close peaks, one of which is associated with the primary stable plasma waves with phase velocities constantly observed near \u0001 500 m = s and the second with the secondary unstable waves with phase velocities achieving \u0001 900 to \u0001 1000 m = s (see also Figure 6.112, where several 4-type echo signal spectra are shown).

At an azimuth of about 150 8 , local enhancement of plasma density was observed. Velocities shown in Figure 6.118b have maximal magnitudes exceeding 700 m = s in the range from 85 8 to 110 8 , and decreasing at larger azimuthal angles. SD radar data plotted in Figure 6.118c and d shows the same minimum in power across the magnetic L shells, but with more regularly distributed power over the azimuthal range (Figure 6.18c), and with maximal magnitudes of drift velocities of 300 – 400 m = s localized at the azimuthal range from 80 8 to 130 8 . The results were in good agreement with those obtained over the Iceland East using the SD radar system developed in Iceland, operating between 8 and 20 MHz, and reported in Ref. [257]. The obtained statistical data of monthly power (in dB), velocity (in m = s), and spectral width (in m = s) distributions is presented in Figure 6.119 as a range – time plot of each summarized parameter. It can be seen that the strongest echo signals are usually observed in the earlier evening and premidnight periods, where the corresponding velocities of the scatterers correspond to, or even exceed, the ion acoustic speed C s , with peaks close to 350 m = s. Nevertheless, small peaks near 700 m = s were rarely observed, indicating an existence of type 4 irregularities. Sometimes, during these experiments a mixed type of echo signal was observed.

Entering into a subject, it should be noted that during the last 40 – 50 years, researchers of the ionosphere selected much experimental data regarding morphology, structure, and dynamics of the high-latitude F region, and a series of systematic works were published mostly during the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s [38 – 40,259 – 271]. Below we follow only some of them [259 – 262], where the main aspects mentioned at the beginning of this subsection were summarized. As mentioned in Refs. [259 – 262], the plasma structures occurring in the high-latitude iono- spheric F region can be classified on large-scale (about 10 – 100 km), such as polar cap patches, auroral and subauroral blobs, and sun-aligned arcs, with dimensions ranging over tens to several hundreds kilometers, and moderate-scale structures, such as plumes (i.e., enhancements) and bubbles (i.e., depleting plasma structures), with dimensions exceeding 1 km, and small-scale structures with dimensions less than 1 km (up to dozens of meters). We will show in Chapter 9 for land – satellite communications that the latter irregularities are more problematic because they determine fast fading inside the channel, i.e., strong random oscillations of the recorded radio 40 5 15 50 MHz beams 25 60 20 80 35 45 65 Syowa Λ =75 ° Λ =70 ° Λ =65 ° SD south beam SD south SD east SD east beam 15 175 175 175 165 165 165 70 70 70 Figure 6.117 The experiments configuration carried out by Antarctic Syowa station with the radar beams overlapping pattern (shadow zones).

The patches are localized enhancements of the background plasma density observed at the polar cap with horizontal dimensions ranging from several hundred to thousands kilometers (and therefore called the largest-scale [259 – 262]). They are spatially collocated with enhanced kilometer-scale irregularities [263 – 269]. An example of patches is shown in Figure 6.120 [267], where measure- ments of variations in the total electronic content (TEC) using dual-frequency transmissions from the global positioning satellite (GPS) are presented.

Taking into account that one TEC unit used as the standard unit equals 10 6 el = cm 2 , we can estimate that the largest TEC variation can exceed 20 TEC units. Converting this value to the plasma density, we found that peaks of plasma density in these patches, equaling 8 \u0002 10 5 el = cm 2 , can exceed those for the background ionospheric plasma by factors of eight to ten. It was experimentally obtained [263 – 267] that the observed patches in the polar cap are the solar-produced plasma structures occupying not only the polar cap but also extending to the auroral and subauroral zones. Radar observations of the irregular structure of the high-latitude F region have found the existence of irregular regions with widths of less than 100 km that are spatially correlated with 100-km-scale enhancements of plasma density called blobs [259 – 262]. Radar and additional satellite measurements indicated that blobs are characterized by steep gradients of plasma density transverse to the ambient geomagnetic field B 0 . Most observations of the variations in TEC can also be explained as blob-produced plasma structures. At the same time, in Ref. [38], commenting on the results of rocket measurements, it was suggested that these variations in TEC can be explained by effects of spatial collocation of intense small-scale irregularities with large-scale gradients of plasma density. Using a theoretical framework concerning convective plasma processes occurring in the polar cap, as well as intercharge instability, some authors have attempted to explain the generation of such kilometer-scale plasma structures, which earlier, during the 1960s, many authors connected with particle precipitation (see Refs. [259 – 262] and the referred literature therein).

The numbers near each contour indicate plasma density compared to 10 5 cm \u0001 3 . Figure 6.121a and b obtained in postmidnight periods shows the dynamics of blobs and their floating and penetration upward along altitudes from the bottom- to the topsides of the F region, ranging over areas of hundreds of kilometers. At the same time, in the earlier-morning periods, blobs either decayed (Figure 6.121c) or were sufficiently weak (Figure 6.121d) [40,269]. In Figure 6.122, three panels of 2-D plasma density distribution at three altitudes, 360 km (bottom panel), 400 km (middle panel), and 440 km (top panel), are presented [266]. The same tendency in the dynamics of plasma bloblike structures with penetration upward and localization at the top level of the F region take place, as was observed in Figure 6.121.

Thus, in Figure 6.127, we present only part of the convection pattern, obtained by the Goose Bay – Stokkseyri radar pair (described earlier in this section). Here according to Ref.

In such inverse cascade motion, as shown in Ref. [272] (see also bibliography therein), the small-scale plasma structures can be triggered by viscous dissipative processes occurring in the ionospheric plasma or by disturbances of the ambient electric and magnetic fields usually observed in the high- latitude and equatorial ionosphere. These processes lead to the formation of anomalous energy process discussed in Chapter 2 using another mechanism of wave – wave and wave – particle inter- actions. As mentioned in Ref. [272], a new dissipative process usually occurs in the ionospheric plasma in the presence of the nonvanishing helicity of the velocity field of plasma (as a multi- component fluid), and finally due to the appearance of the helical dissipative mechanism.

We present now another example to show how novel theories created during the past decade can be successfully introduced to describe natural phenomena occurring in the ionospheric plasma on the basis of observations of recent experiments employing the novel methodology of measure- ments in joint space, time, and frequency domains and the corresponding modern ground-based and satellite-assembled radars and radio interferometers. This aspect is closely related to the natural phenomena occurring during interactions of meteoroids with the lower ionosphere at the E and upper D regions described in Section 6.2.1, based on theoretical background developed from the 1970s to 1980s of the last century, as well as on the adequate (existing at that moment) measurements carried out using possibilities of current ground-based facilities described in this section. Despite the objective limitations of these experiments and the corresponding theories, the three main stages of meteor trail evolution in the ionospheric plasma, based on physical principles of meteor plasma dynamics [134 – 136] and on the basic concepts of plasma diffusion and drift [104 – 106,122 – 129], were described in Refs. [49 – 51]. The first stage is observed when meteor plasma is super-dense (with respect to the ionospheric background plasma) and therefore is not sensitive to the background ionospheric plasma behavior. The second stage occurs in enough dense meteor plasma where strong interaction with background plasma is observed, leading to generation of a strong depletion region surrounding the meteor trail.

As was pointed out in Refs. [48 – 51], using a phenomenological approach, in this stage of meteor trail dissipation the Farley – Buneman instability may play a main role in the process of the later stage of meteor trail evolution and in generation of field-aligned H E small-scale irregularities observed experimentally at the lower ionosphere (see Section 6.2.1). Only in the recent theoretical studies [273 – 278] have the roles of Farley – Buneman and other instabilities on meteor plasma later-stage evolution been rigorously examined, both analytically and numerically. The anomalous diffusion and long-term nonlinear evolution of under-dense meteor plasma, described self-consistently in Refs. [273 – 279], were observed experimentally during the recent decade using powerful and sensitive Arecibo and Jicamarca radars and satellite radio interferometers [279 – 283], based on a novel methodology of measurements (with respect to that described in Section 6.2.1 according to Refs. [48 – 51]) for simultaneous observation of specular (coherent) and diffuse (incoherent) radio echoes in the space, time, and frequency domains. However, in the theoretical studies carried out in Refs. [273 – 278], the authors have ignored the fact that the meteor ions have heavier masses compared to those of background plasma (and February 17, 1995 22:28:51–22:32:05 UT 82 ° 200 m/s 80 ° 78 ° 76 ° 74 ° 72 ° 19:22 20:02 25 ° 65 ° 30 ° 20:42  60 ° 35 ° 55 ° 40 ° 45 ° 50 ° Figure 6.127 Drift velocities vectors convection in the space domain.

As was shown in earlier studies concerning plasma inhomogeneities evolution [122 – 129], at the initial stage of penetration of the high-density plasma structure, injected into the background ionospheric plasma at altitudes of h ¼ 80 – 120 km and having ions with mobilities different from those of background ions, two profiles of plasma density disturbances are observed — the stable ambipolar plasmoid (according to Schottky [1 – 4]) and the plasmoid moving with the velocity of injected ions (see also Chapter 5, where diffusion of plasma in absence and presence of the magnetic field is discussed). The occurrence of the latter plasmoid can be explained by the fact that due to difference between the mobilities, the background plasma cannot be fully compensated (or screened) by the disturbances of the injected plasma. Furthermore, if the injected (meteor) plasma is the complicated multicomponent plasma, as usually predicted by the physics of meteoroids [134 – 136], consisting of electrons and ( k \u0001 1) species of ions, then the amount of plasma disturbances propagating in the plasma (i.e., the profiles) increases and can reach the level of ( k \u0001 2) plasmoids, which was observed experimentally [48,49]. Moreover, accounting for the effects of ambient electric field and strong neutral wind, which currently exist in real E layer of the ionosphere (and were taken into account in Refs. [51,145,146]), leads to generation of additional irregularities arbitrary oriented with respect to magnetic field lines. The array of plasmoids, elongated along B 0 and having arbitrary, small to large, angles with geomagnetic field lines were observed experimentally using recent radio observations carried out by Arecibo and Jicamarca ground-based radar systems [279 – 282]. So, the authors of Refs. [273 – 278] have simplified their theoretical models taking ions of meteor plasma to be equal those in background plasma. On the other hand, in Refs. [273 – 278] the processes of recombination, which are sufficiently strong at the altitudes of the lower ionosphere (see Chapter 1), were ignored as the authors found a small rate of recombination for heavy ions with respect to light ions of the ionospheric background plasma. We found here some contradiction between the basic statements of the problem stressed by the authors in Refs. [273 – 278]. Therefore, we do not present here these novel approaches, hoping that recent and future observations of meteor trails carried out by ground-based radar systems may give additional ‘‘ push ’’ to the additional improvements of the novel self-consistent models and self-similar numerical codes introduced in the aforementioned references. We should point out again that the pioneering ideas and concepts generated during the 1970s and 1980s and experimental observations by using radio methods of meteor trails made during these periods (see Section 6.2.1), obviously have spawned novel theoretical and numerical approaches [273 – 278], as well as new technical possibilities based on modern radiophysical methods and the corresponding radar system (such as, for example, the highly sensitive Arecibo and Jicamarca radars, described in detail in Chapter 8). At the end of this chapter, we suggest that for future experiments studying natural phenomena occur in the Earth ’ s ionosphere, a more intensive combination of different methods, optical and radio, as was done in investigations of artificial irregularities, such as ion-injected and heating- induced, created mostly in the middle-latitude ionosphere (see Section 6.1). This should be done taking into account that the morphology and structure of the high-latitude ionosphere are more complicated compared with those of the middle-latitude and equatorial ionosphere, which have more common features with respect to more unstable and irregular high-latitude ionosphere affected by external cosmic sources, such as high-energy particle precipitation, solar wind; it is also closer to the magnetosphere and may quickly react on magnetosphere – ionosphere interaction and coupling. Such complex combined experiments can give an impetus to new theoretical studies and new theoretical ideas.

In the absence of inhomogeneities of plasma density, radio waves passing through the quasi-homogeneous regular ionosphere as layered plasma medium are absorbed because of collisions between electrons and ions and neutral molecules (atoms). Then, the intensity I of radio wave can be defined as [1,2] I ( k ) ¼ I 0 exp \u0001 2 k ð k d s \u0001\u0002 ¼ I 0 exp \u0001 2 v c ð k d s \u0001\u0002 (7 : 1) where I 0 is the intensity of incident wave; k , the coefficient of absorption; and c , k , and v , the light speed, wave number, and wave angular frequency, respectively, introduced in previous chapters.

Thus, taking two different frequencies, v 1 and v 2 ,it can be inferred from Equation 7.3 that the ratio of the absorption coefficients at these two frequencies is a function only of the relation between these frequencies, i.e., A k 1 A k 2 ¼ ð v 2 pe ( n em þ n ei ) v 2 1 þ ( n em þ n ei ) 2 d s ð v 2 pe ( n em þ n ei ) v 2 2 þ ( n em þ n ei ) 2 d s (7 : 4) In Refs.

The power parameter s of this polynomial function was changed at the range 0 < s < 2 (depending on the ratio ( n em þ n ei )/ v ). This power parameter s can be determined experimentally in measurements of radiometric absorption at two separate frequencies, and using the following expression: s ¼ log 10 A k ( v 1 ) A k ( v 2 ) log 10 v 1 v 2 (7 : 5a) Then, the standard deviation of this parameter equals [1 – 3]: d s ¼ s d A k ( v 1 ) A k ( v 1 ) \u0005\u0006 2 þ d A k ( v 2 ) A k ( v 2 ) \u0005\u0006 2 () 1 = 2 (7 : 5b) The value was found in Ref.

Additional spectral analysis of distribution of radiomet- ric absorption has shown that in most events ( > 75%) the power spectral parameter s is changed inside the expected interval of 0 < s < 2 [4,5]. The effects of absorption of probing radio waves have been observed during excitation in the ionosphere of small-scale artificial periodic irregularities (APIs) [6,7]. Effects of absorption associ- ated with natural plasma irregularities located in the F region of the ionosphere were observed experimentally using incoherent scatter radar and explained theoretically in Ref. [8]. Absorption of wave energy at the API was explained theoretically in Refs. [9,10] by resonance interaction of reflected probing waves with heating-induced plasma periodical turbulences created by powerful ground-based radio facilities. This phenomenon was explained by conversion of probing radio wave into plasma wave ( Z -mode), and finally, by absorption of this Z -mode in the ionosphere. The same effect of probing radio wave absorption occurs in the polar ionosphere when small-scale plasma turbulences are created in natural conditions [3]. Here, radio waves are absorbed during interaction Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 404 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i 404 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"with natural inhomogeneities of the ionospheric plasma having dimensions ‘< 2 pn Te = v H (see Chapter 2), and n Te and v H are the thermal velocity and gyrofrequency of plasma electrons, respectively. As was noted in Ref. [3], the additional absorption of probing radio waves passing through the high-latitude ionosphere is observed at frequencies of 15 – 30 MHz (i.e., the events with s > 2) caused by collective collisions between charged particles, electrons, and ions. However, this effect has tendency to weaken within a short period of several seconds and, finally, the spectral distribution of radiometric absorption becomes sharper [10]. As for the method of estimation of absorption proposed in Ref. [8] that is based on observations of F region natural plasma structures using incoherent scatter radar, to explain this effect the authors used a formula other than Equation 7.3 for estimations of absorption of radio waves in the irregular ionosphere, derived from the Appleton – Hartree magneto-ionic theory: A k \u0005 4 : 58 \u0006 10 \u0001 5 v 2 ð N e ( n em þ n ei )d s (7 : 6) which is valid only if v \u0002 v H and v \u0002 n ei \u0004 n em , i.e., for conditions valid only for the ionosphere at altitudes greater than the altitudes of the D and E layers. Using incoherent scatter radar (IRIS) operated at 38.2 MHz using 49 beams, and the proposed method of evaluation of plasma density through measurements of limited frequency of the F layer, f 0 F 2 , the magnitude of probing radio wave absorption was confirmed. It was found that the absorption usually cannot exceed values of about 0.2 – 0.3 dB on days without magnetic disturbances, sometimes increasing up to 0.5 dB during small magnetic disturbances. As we showed in the previous chapter, strong magnetic storms can increase this value significantly (up to several dB). 7.2 Radio Scattering Caused by Plasma Irregularities of Various Origins in the Ionosphere In the previous chapter we discussed plasma irregularities, both large and small, with various degrees of perturbations compared with regular background ionospheric plasma, and with a different degree of anisotropy relative to the geomagnetic field B 0 . Such kinds of irregularities are observed experimentally in the ionosphere at all latitudes, longitudes, altitudes [11 – 84]. Plasma irregularities associated with various plasma instabilities caused by natural geophysical phenomena, such as meteor trails, neutral winds, gravity waves due to atmosphere – ionosphere coupling, magnetic storms caused by solar activity, etc., or introduced in the ionosphere artificially by heating of plasma by powerful radio waves or plasma cloud injection, are usually stretched along the geomagnetic field B 0 with a degree of anisotropy ‘ jj =‘ ? \u0004 10, where ‘ jj and ‘ ? are the longitudinal and transverse (to B 0 ) initial dimensions of plasma irregularities, respectively. The character of radio signals scattered from such anisotropic plasma irregularities of the ionosphere, which are oriented along the geomagnetic field B 0 , is not the same at the different geographic latitudes [25 – 42]. This phenomenon can be explained by the strong ionization factors occurring in the high-latitude ionospheric regions and the spatial selectivity of scattered signals from field-aligned plasma irregularities in the middle-latitude ionospheric regions. Why is this question so important? It is important for designers of long-range radio communication channels passing through ionospheric layered structures, D, E, and F, consisting of irregularities with a wide spectrum of scales and orientations with respect to radio waves of various frequencies passing through ionospheric layers. To predict conditions of propagation in such ionospheric channels, it is important to predict Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 405 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i Performance of Radio Communication in Ionospheric Channels & 405"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"location, height, shape, and concentration of such irregularities to understand their influence on scattering of radio signals, back and forward (oblique). Scattering effects allow prediction of final fading of signals, signal-to-noise ratio and, finally, loss of information sent through such iono- spheric channels, both for long land – ionosphere – land and satellite communications. In this section, we consider the effects of scattering of probing radio waves by small- and moderate-scale plasma irregularities, for which dimensions ‘ ? across B 0 range from several tens of centimeters to several meters, i.e., ‘ ? \u0005 l for HF/VHF-wave bandwidth. We consider the cases of backscattering and forward scattering extending up to 180 8 . First, we begin by discussing some pioneering experiments carried out from the end of the 1950s to the beginning of the 1990s in different geographical places of the world [45 – 84]. Results of these experiments allowed researchers to finally create satisfactory theoretical models of specular reflection and scattering from plasma irregularities of various origins occurring in the ionospheric plasma at different latitudes [11 – 16]. 7.2.1 Experimental Investigations of Backscattering and Forward Scattering in Region E of the Ionosphere During the cycle of systematic and well-organized experiments carried out in pulse regimes in the United States at 206 MHz and at 106 MHz, it was found that most of the scattered pulse signals arriving at the receiver from heights of the E layer of the ionosphere ( h ¼ 105 – 115 km) were caused by field-aligned plasma irregularities strongly affected by the geomagnetic field, which finally formed an array of plasma columns with radius r \u0003 l across B 0 and with lengths L \u0002 l along B 0 [45,46]. Therefore, the authors denoted such types of signals as H E -type, and defined the corresponding scattering phenomena as H E -scattering. At the same time [47 – 52], all researchers analyzing scattering of radio waves from plasma irregularities of the E layer middle- latitude ionosphere have used the same abbreviations to stress the effect of the geomagnetic field on the character of evolution of such anisotr opic plasma structures. We will use the same terminology in our further discussions, following the corresponding analysis made in Refs. [15 – 18], which describe evolution of such kinds of plasma irregularities and their effects on backscattering and forward scattering. In the first cycle of pioneering experiments on forward scattering from the middle-latitude E layer plasma H E irregularities [45,46], a power pulse transmitter of high power was used, working at 206 MHz and then at 106 MHz. Experiments were carried out simultaneously in several states of the south-west of the United States (see Figure 7.1). The transmitter was located south of the state of Texas. The signals were registered simultaneously in Arizona and California in such a manner that the receiver antennas were located at different contours of specular reflection (denoted in Figure 7.1 by dashed curves). These contours define the geometrical positions at ground surface where it is possible to observe radio signals reflected specularly from field-aligned E layer plasma H E irregularities at the two active points of the receiver ’ s location. During this cycle of experiments, the difference between H E -scattering and pure meteor scattering was found and analyzed. We present only one record of a typical pure meteor burst- type signal (Figure 7.2a) compared with two kinds of H E -scattering signals: the burst-type H E -scattering signal (Figure 7.2b and c) and the quasi-regular continuous H E -scattering signal (Figure 7.2d). It was concluded that the burst-type H E -scattering signals come from a region located between altitudes of the 100 and 120 km within the E layer and fully correlated with sporadic meteor trails, both diurnally and seasonally. Thus, it can be seen from Figure 7.2a that typical pure meteor signals are characterized by fast growth and the approximately exponential Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 406 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i 406 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Beam 3 Magnetic north Beam 1 Caliente Borrego Hot spots Tucson Contour 3 Austin Contour 1 Figure 7.1 Geometry of experiments carried out in the south-west of the United States.

The time of attenuation of such burst-type signals is sufficiently small (a few seconds), whic h is consistent with meteor-head-echo lifetime obtained during observations of pure meteor reflections from the ionosphere and described in Refs. [52 – 55]. In Figure 7.2b, both meteor-scattering and H E -scattering signals are shown, from which the fundamental difference between them can be seen. Thus, the H E -scattering signals have a much longer ‘‘ lifetime ’’ (from several tens of seconds to several minutes) and a significantly higher degree of ‘‘ roughness ’’ caused by fast fading (see Figure 7.2c). As for quasi-regular signals, they can also be characterized as ‘‘ rough, ’’ but with a constant envelope of amplitude of fading (an average); they were observed over periods of several tens of minutes. The same results were obtained by the use of the frequency of 106 MHz. The diurnal and seasonal correlation of H E -scattering signals with those scattered from sporadic meteors allow the researchers to assume that the meteor trails are the main factors causing burst-type H E -scattering signals [45,46]. The main question remaining after these experiments was: Why is the time of relaxation of the H E -scattering signals larger than that for pure meteor-scattering signals and why is the fading of H E -scattering stronger? The authors of Refs. [45,46] have not analyzed the ‘‘ thin ’’ structure of H E -scattering signals; they only established th eir existence and noted differences compared to pure meteor signals. However, large-scale spaced antenna measurements indicated the existence of field-aligned irregularities with lengths of the order of 25 meters embedded within a scattering volume with a horizontal scale of 10 km. The same statements without any physical explanation of the effects of H E -scattering observed in the E layer of the middle-latitude ionosphere were stressed in Refs. [47 – 50]. A cycle of experiments at frequency f ¼ 56 MHz were carried out in Japan at two traces of 959 km (Kokubunji – Yamagawa) and 935 km (Kokubunji – Hoshika), as shown in Figure 7.3, to investigate radio scattering from field-aligned plasma irregularities generated at the E layer of the ionosphere. What is interesting here is that most of the signals of a quasi-continuous type (see Figure 7.4, which shows the same range – time records at Yamagawa as shown in Figure 7.2d) were recorded with relaxation time from several minutes to several hours. During these experi- ments, vertical sounding of the ionosphere was carried out simultaneously in the regions close to zones of specular scattering. What is important to mention here is that researchers did not find any correlation between specular H E -scattering of pulse radio signals and the existence of sporadic E s layers in the ionosphere. So, the main difference between the two cycles of experiments is that in Japan more quasi-continuous signals were recorded than those of the burst-type observed in the United States. At the same time, in Refs. [47 – 50], it was found that the observed field-aligned irregularities contributed much to the scattering of radio waves at altitudes 100 – 120 km and have at least the scale of L \u0005 30 – 50 m in a direction parallel to B 0 and of T \u0005 3 – 5 m perpendicular to B 0 ; i.e., the degree of anisotropy of L / T \u0004 10. The scales and the corresponding degree of anisotropy of field-aligned irregularities obtained during experiments contribute most of the scattering propagation in the E ionospheric region around Japan. The positive contribution of these pioneering experiments to our knowledge of plasma inhomogeneities occurring in the E region of the middle-latitude ionosphere that are responsible for the scattered propagation in HF/VHF band is that they fully differentiated the active zone of specular H E -scattering from zones of meteor activity. This fact allows comparing specular H E -scattering signals with those obtained from pure meteor reflections. At the same time, many peculiarities of signals scattered by field-aligned plasma irregularities were not analyzed in Refs. [45 – 50], in particular, the ‘‘ thin ’’ structure of scattered signals, classification of quasi-continuous and burst-type H E -scattering signals, their nature. This can be done only following detailed theoretical analysis of plasma dynamics and plasma instabilities generation, based on the models Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 408 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i 408 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"of real plasma structures and ambient factors occurring in the inhomogeneous ionosphere.

The main purpose of the experiments was to investigate the ‘‘ thin ’’ structure of H E -scatter signals compared with pure meteor-scatter signals [53 – 55]. We briefly mentioned this cycle of experiments in Chapter 6 in connection with methods of investigation of the main parameters of these types of irregularities. Now we will examine these experiments in greater detail. In the first cycle of experiments, two transmitters were operated at 44 and 74 MHz, each with an output power of 2 kW and with an orientation to the direction of the great circle of 12 8 and to the position of the receiver R of 24 8 , respectively, as shown in Figure 7.5. At the receiver, two channels were used: one for registration of H E -scattering signals and the other for recording of only pure meteor-scattering signals, using the common receiving antenna with width of antenna pattern of 60 8 . The corresponding geometry of trace is shown in Figure 7.5. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver was about 1500 km. Two different channels allowed for the recording of only H E -scattering signals in the corresponding channel but which were not observed in the meteor channel. It was found that the main difference between the two types of signals, the H E -type and the meteor-type, is the form of their envelope, the time of decay, and the character of their fading. As in Refs. [45,46], the same features that differentiate these two types of signal were found, but in Refs. [15,16,51,52] a detailed classification of H E -scattering signals was carried out. Thus, it was found that most of the several thousands of recording signals can be divided into two basic types, according to the form of their amplitude envelope, their statistical character, and term of fading: the burst-type H E -scattering signals with time of decay of about tens of seconds to several minutes, and quasi-continuous H E -scattering signals with time of decay about several minutes to several hours. In Figures 7.6 through 7.8 are shown typical signals recorded during forward scattering from the E layer of the ionosphere for the radio trace of investigation shown in Figure 7.5. The burst-type H E signals are close to those of meteor I – III types [53 – 55] but have a longer relaxation time and other ‘‘ thin ’’ statistical features regarding fading phenomena. According to the character of growth and decay of the signal envelope, they can also be divided into three types. Thus, the I-type of burst is characterized by a sharp front and by exponential decay of the amplitude envelope, as shown in Figure 7.6.

The type-II of burst is characterized by a sharp front but a very slow decay of the amplitude envelope with terms of several to tens of minutes. A typical signal is presented in Figure 7.7a. In Figure 7.7b, the record of the beginning of the type-II of burst signal (of the 13-min lifetime) is shown. As mentioned in Refs.

The signals of this type were rarely recorded owing to low probability of observation of high-density (i.e., highly ionized) meteor trails in the ionosphere of Earth [54,55]. The type-III bursts are those signals whose envelope slowly increases until they achieve a maximum level, and then slowly decreases until they achieve a minimum level (see Figure 7.7b). Such bursts were often observed during the entire cycle of experiments carried out at different frequencies. Most decrease asymmetrically, as shown in Figure 7.7b. This effect was explained [17,18] by the influence of the geomagnetic field on the process of evolution of meteor plasma at the stage when it passes from highly ionized (high-density) to weakly ionized (weak- density), and fully elongated along B 0 . As was shown in Ref. [17] (see also discussions in Chapter 5), the lifetime of weakly ionized plasma structures stretched along B 0 is longer than that of highly ionized plasma structures. Therefore, the relaxation time in the stage of signal envelope decay is much larger than the signal envelope initial growth. As was found during current experimental observations (see also Refs. [47 – 50]), the existence of continuous signals was observed over a long time exceeding 10 min and continuing up to several hours. Such signals are characterized by a sharp fast fading with deep signal amplitude oscillations, and with a very slow (nonexponential) decay of signal level. In Figure 7.8, the typical recording quasi-continuous signal is shown at the beginning, when the amplitude growth is usually observed and then during the steady-stage term, when amplitude is approximately constant (Figure 7.8a), and at the time of slow decay (Figure 7.8b). The time of growth and decay was selected to be shorter because during experiments, many signals of this type were registered in the first and last stages of more than 5 to 6 min. Sometimes, the time of growth was of the same order as the time of decay [16]. In the steady-state regime the amplitude fading of quasi-continuous signals has a stationary character. The existence of such long-term signals observed at the middle-latitude ionosphere in different geographic regions was explained in the same manner as was for the high- latitude ionosphere, i.e., by existence of turbulent movements owing to gradients of neutral wind and the generation of two-stream instability in the ionospheric plasma (see Chapter 2).

[15,16], geometric computations of the specular contour of forward scattering for the concrete radio trace shown in Figure 7.5 was carried out to find the active zone of H E -scattering as well as the active heights of localization of H E plasma irregularities. The specular-scattered waves from elongated anisotropic ionospheric irregularities create a conic-shaped pattern with the origin at the point of reflection Q as shown in Figure 7.9. This pattern, crossing Earth ’ s surface, creates at the ground surface zones of points where the scattered signals can be received successfully. The axis of the conic-shaped pattern coincides with the longitudinal axis of plasma inhomogeneity; we denote by u the angle between this axis and the pattern direction. The corresponding zone is defined by this specular contour consisting of specular-scattered waves at the ground surface. The main task of the research is to find the geometry of such scattered zones at the ground surface, i.e., the geometrical distribution of points of the specular scattering for fixed positions of the transmitting and the receiving antennas. These parameters are important for link budget design inside the ionospheric communication links operated mostly at HF/VHF-frequency bands. In Figure 7.5, x 0 0 , y 0 0 , and z 0 0 denote the coordinates in the system related to positions of the transmitter (T) and the receiver (R). The system ( X , Y , Z )is related to the center of Earth, where axis Z passes through the geographic poles, the plane XOZ coincides with the plane of zero-meridian, and the plane XOY is placed at the equatorial plane. Then, the latitude and the longitude of the specular contour will be determined by angles w and c , respectively. So, for our task we need to use the initial parameters such as the coordinates of the transmitter T ( w 1 , c 1 ) and receiver R ( w 2 , c 2 ). Then, we calculate points that simultaneously lie at the conic pattern and the sphere of Earth with the radius R e . We will not enter into these complicated geometrical derivations, which are based on elements of analytical geometry, and will only refer the reader to the original study [15].

[15,16], we can estimate the active zone of H E -scattering and the heights of localization of H E plasma irregularities, as this scattering has a strong directive character. Then, using the approach proposed in Refs. [59,60], we present here results of computations of two middle-latitude radio traces. The first is of 1130 km with coordinates of the transmitter, w 1 ¼ 46 8 29 0 , c 1 ¼ 30 8 36 0 and the receiver, w 2 ¼ 45 8 26 0 , c 2 ¼ 42 8 20 0 , respectively. The coordinates of the second trace of 1500 km was described earlier. Figure 7.10a shows the active zone and the altitudinal range for the first radio trace, and Figure 7.10b is for the second radio trace. In Ref. [61] was proposed the close criterion of estimation of the active zone of scattering from the plasma irregularities observed at the high-latitude ionosphere, mostly appearing in polar caps. Following results presented in Figure 7.10, for some middle-latitude traces, the active zone of H E - scattering from field-aligned plasma irregularities and that for meteor ionizations can be overlapped. Moreover, it was proved experimentally that the burstlike signals presented in Figures 7.6 and 7.7 have a meteor-induced nature as the corresponding plasma irregularities generated by meteor trails occur in the middle-latitude ionosphere at altitudes from 90 to 130 km. The foregoing method of investigation of field-aligned irregularities of the ionospheric E region is based on continuous wave (CW) sounding in the ionosphere using back- and forward (oblique) scattering of probing radio waves. Now, we present a cycle of systematic measurements carried out at the end of the 1970s in Japan, the United States and also in Australia (i.e., at the middle latitudes toward the South Pole) using different kinds of ground-based facilities, such as HF oblique radar, multifrequency iono- sondes and interferometers, and working not only in the mutual range – time domain but also in the frequency domain (strictly speaking, in the Doppler spread domain) [64 – 84], which allows the researcher to obtain the main characteristics of field-aligned middle-latitude E layer irregularities using modern radio methods. Following these works, we briefly present the main results that allow one to predict experimentally the main characteristics of E region irregularities of the middle-latitude ionosphere, which is important for predicting radio traces that can be performed N MP N MP H E H E 105 km 105 km 90 km 90 km O K MK (a) (b) Figure 7.10 Position of active zones of mirror scattering for the first radio trace (a) and the second radio trace (b).

We start with drift measurements of the lower E layer carried in the United States at middle latitudes (Billerica, Massachusetts) using a pulse radar system operating at 2.35 and 2.89 MHz that produced pulses of 100 m s length with a repetition rate of 50 Hz during transmitting time [65]. The samples of the original data recording at the receiver after scattering from the ionosphere are plotted in Figure 7.11a and b, observed over 150 s. It can be seen from this example that a rapid amplitude fading and large change in phase occurs, with a strong correlation between them. Whenever a deep fading occurs, the phase changes rapidly, owing to the interference of rays ’ multiple reflections from different layers of the E region. The rigorous correlation analysis made in Ref. [65] showed rapid oscillations in both the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions, as well as essential broadening of the signal power spectrum. This precise correlation analysis coincided with the experimentally observed existence in the E region of the ionosphere of wavelike plasma structures strongly elongated along magnetic field lines. The same conclusions were made [66] on investigating plasma structures responsible for rapid fading of radio signals reflected from E layer of the middle-latitude ionosphere (Bribie Island, 152 8 E, 27 8 S) using radar operating at a frequency of 1.98 MHz. The daytime ionospheric E layer was analyzed under small, moderate, and high disturbed conditions. The same strong correlation between deep rapid amplitude fading and large deviations of phase of the recording signal arriving at the receiver was found. We present in Figure 7.12 one of the example obtained during the moderate disturbance of the ionosphere. The author analyzed the role of gravity waves as well as the possibility of turbulence in the neutral air motions in creation of small short-lived plasma structures. It was outlined that the main role in plasma small isotropic and anisotropic plasma structure creation is played by turbulent motions of neutral gas at altitudes 90 – 100 km, the result which agrees with results of previous aforementioned works. At the same time, in Ref. [66] were observed other types of discrete scatters, which form presumably sporadic E clouds, owing to their long lifetime. Variations of such long-lived discrete sporadic E clouds is shown in Figure 7.13 [66]. Additional analysis of phase deviation of the signals obtained from short-lived plasma structures allows for finding velocities and direction of move- ments of such type of irregularities. Thus, in Figure 7.14, the data divided into 15 min intervals (see bottom and top figures) is shown. The maximum negative and maximum positive Doppler shift corresponds to negative (opposite) and positive (toward) maximum velocity of discrete reflectors of about \u0007 150 m/s. Usually, during 7 days of observations these discrete reflectors were observed at altitudes of 95 – 115 km, mostly near 100 km with velocities varied in the range 30 – 60 m/s. These results were compared with those obtained in Ref. [64] during investigations of the E layer at Adelaide (Australia, 139 8 E, 35 8 S) and good coincidence was found between obtained results concerning deep fading of recorder signals and large phase shift, allowing estimation of the velocity of moving field-aligned plasma structures in the range 50 – 100 m/s. More detailed information about large-scale plasma sporadic structures (called sporadic E clouds or blobs), which form sporadic E layer, was presented in detail [67,68] and then summarized in a special issue of Whitehead [69], in which results obtained in Refs. [67,68] were compared with other studies carried out all over the world, including those mentioned earlier. We recommend that the reader study this issue. As for the experiments [67,68], several types of irregularities, which form sporadic E s layer, were observed there using the same Bribie Island radar (see earlier text and also Ref. [66]), operating at 3.84 and 5.8 MHz. First, detailed information about the horizontal structure of the E s layer was obtained and compared with the well-known wind-shear theory (which was successfully used for Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 415 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i Performance of Radio Communication in Ionospheric Channels & 415"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"–55 –65 –75 –55 –65 –75 –55 –65 –75 – p p – p p – p p 1 –1 30 (a) 60 90 120 Time, s Phase Amplitude 3 2 1 1 3 2 1 –55 –65 –75 –55 –65 –55 –65 –75 –75 – p p – p p p – p 30 (b) 60 90 120 Time, s Phase Amplitude Figure 7.11 Temporal dependence of amplitude and phase of scattered signals recorded at 2.35 MHz (a) and 2.89 MHz (b).

The authors created a model of sporadic E cloud in the form of anisotropic ellipses with changing dimensions: the length is from 5 to 50 km, and the thickness is from 0.5 to 5 km, elongated along geomagnetic field lines. These plasma structures, according to Doppler measurements, moved in different directions with velocities (we do not present here numerous complicated illustrations in Refs. [67,68]) varying from 20 to 100 m/s. Isolated clouds due to wind-shear effect collected in the clusters moved approximately with the same velocity. The latter finally create large horizontal (several hundreds of kilometers) and thin vertical (several tens of kilometers) sporadic E s layer in the middle-latitude ionosphere. In Ref. [70], based on digital ionosonde observation of sporadic E blobs consisting of the E s layer at Halley ( \u0005 27 8 W, \u0005 75 8 S), rapid fading of radio waves was found accounting for Doppler shift and the corresponding velocities of movements of such plasma structures. The ionosonde was operated at 4.5 MHz, and each ionogram was recorded over every 12 min. The experimentally obtained Doppler shift for different locations of echo signals coming from different blobs located within the sporadic E s layer (denoted by A to E ) is shown in Figure 7.15, where the power spectra derived are shown for each sample for sets of six overlapping time series of 1 min duration separated by 12 min. It can be seen again, as simultaneously was obtained for the south (toward from Equator to South Pole) middle latitudes [66 – 69], that blobs (clouds) formed in the E s layer have different velocities and move in various directions, whereas the cluster moves at the same velocity of about 10 m/s.

The recording signals were obtained in the form of range – azimuth – intensity (B-scan) and as range – time – intensity (RTI) displays. Continuous observations showed that coherent echo signals sent to the ionosphere return from plasma density irregularities aligned along geomagnetic field lines occurring mostly in the nighttime and associating with the sporadic E s layers located at altitudinal range of 100 – 110 km. So, they identified the echo signals with the presence of E s layers. Thus, in Figure 7.16 the central positions of field-aligned echoes are represented by open circles obtained from the B-scan records (i.e., in the azimuth domain). The solid curves denote three different altitudes of origin for the echo signals: 90, 100, and 150 km. For altitude z ¼ 100 km the reflection points for slightly off-perpendicular incidence with aspect angles of \u0007 5 8 are also shown. In addition, the perpendicular points for the altitudes 90 and 150 km are also indicated by dashed curves in Figure 7.16. As can be seen, echo signals are absent when the slant range is less than 170 km and for the slant ranges between 300 and 400 km. Data obtained from RTI-records allows one to estimate the direction and speed of these field- aligned irregularities of the order 50 – 60 m/s, by using Doppler shift spectra, as shown in Figure 7.17, which illustrates temporal and spatial variations of the motion of irregularities obtained from Doppler shift spectra. The 3 dB spectral widths are denoted in Figure 7.17 by the horizontal bars, and the observed directions are indicated for individual data points. Without entering into details of measurements, we only will outline that according to Doppler shift obtained from RTI-records, the horizontal drift velocities of the irregularities were estimated during two-day continuous meas- urements. During the entire cycle of measurements, the average velocity of horizontal drift varied from 54 to 65 m/s, the results which are close to those discussed earlier using other methods of Doppler shift estimation. The broadening of Doppler spectra obtained in these experiments was rather large, of about 10 – 12 Hz. In further cycle of experiments described in Ref.

As vertical incident F layer echoes and the obliquely backscattered E s layer were also recorded, they are also presented in a reproduction and sketch of backscattered ionograms obtained at the Iioka experimental site. According to RTI measurements the Doppler shift spectra and their broadening were found to be changing from þ 3to þ 13 Hz and from 15 to 25 Hz, respectively. The precise measurements of these two parameters allow estimating velocities of horizontal drift of field-aligned irregularities and the direction of their movements. Thus, in Figure 7.19, extracted from Ref. [72], in upper panel (a), the observed westward component of drift velocity obtained from B-scan records is represented by dots versus the local time at the station. The solid curve gives estimated average values. Here, horizontal bars represent the same average velocities but obtained using Doppler shift estimations via RTI-scan records. The vertical bars give standard deviations from these average values. The bottom panel (b) gives the local time variations (in percentages) of the occurrence probability of FAEs. So, again we see the predominant westward motion of field-aligned irregularities associated with the E s layer with velocities of move- ment varied from 40 to 100 m/s, the result which coincides previous radio observations of the sporadic middle-latitude E regions.

A very complicated striated structure of the cluster of small-scale irregularities covering altitudinal range from 90 to 120 km can be seen from the shown illustration. The main features of obtained data during previous measurements that can be outlined based on results presented in Refs. [73 – 75] are the following. The small-scale irregularities with the transverse scale of 3 m (because for a backscattering process ‘ ir ¼ l = 2 \u0005 3 m) spread in directions perpendicular both to drift velocity V d and to ambient geomagnetic field B 0 , mostly in westward direction from the radar. The researchers explain the striation mechanism by generation of gravity instability (see Chapter 2). The observed irregularities were closely correlated with the occurrence of the sporadic E layer mostly in nighttime periods. Even more precise experiments with high temporal, range and altitudinal resolutions (see Refs. [76 – 78] and the publications mentioned therein) were based on the same MU backscatter radar operated at 46.5 MHz. To obtain echo signals from 3-m-scale field-aligned irregularities in the E region, the multibeam regime was used when an antenna with diameter of 103 m was steered northward from vertical direction to zenith angles of 50 8 – 60 8 to achieve orthogonal intersection with B 0 at an altitude of 100 km, as is shown from Figure 7.21, where antenna beams for the multibeam observations are shown by thin solid lines (i.e., 12 lines denote 12 beams). Finally, the range of observation was changed from 140 to 293 km. We will not enter details of measurements, but will only show main results obtained in these systematically and precisely performed experiments.

Here, all echoes appear from a direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field B 0 . The observed picture of striation strongly depends on the direction of the corresponding beams and orientation with respect to the vertical axis. Thus, a different picture (see Figure 7.23) was observed when the antenna beam was directed geographically northward with a zenith angle of 51.0 8 . As can be seen, very intense echo signals from field-aligned irregularities occur throughout the duration of observations. Echoes are distributed surrounding altitude of about 100 – 105 km, with narrow spreading along altitudes (only up to 110 km); also, striated structures were not so clear, as follows from Figure 7.22. In both experiments, the movements of sporadic plasma structures were usually in westward directions with velocities 120 to 160 m/s [75,76]. We should outline that the researchers [73 – 78] have obtained a lot of statistics concerning daily and seasonal variations of scatter phenomena from the E layer that explains the probability of occurrence of echo signals in the time, space (altitude and range), and Doppler shift domains. The main conclusion of the authors of these studies is that gravity waves can decrease the threshold of gradient-drift instabilities (GDIs), modulating and accelerating such kinds of instabilities, and finally generating the associated field-aligned plasma small-scale structures assembled during their motion into striated structures — clusters, which move with lesser velocity 37°N Fukui 100 36°N \u0002 50 0 \u0002 200 \u0002 150 Tottori Nagoya 35°N Kyoto MU radar Osaka 134°E 135°E 136°E 137°E 138°E \u0002 100 50 50 50 150 (km) 150 (km) 150 (km) Figure 7.21 Location of the MU multibeam radar used in experiments carried out in Japan and geometry of experiments.

[79 – 81], attention was mainly on obtaining information about the distribution of areas consisting of field-aligned irregularities that form sporadic E layers in the middle-latitude iono- sphere, their shape and dimensions, direction and velocity of movements, lifetime, by using CW bistatic radar performed not only for studying high-resolution Doppler spectra (described in Chapter 6), but also for analyzing detailed dynamic changes and short-term characteristics of the scattering signals. The difference between these experiments and earlier ones is that in Refs. [79 – 81], as was done in experiments described in Refs. [15 – 18], using a CW regime, the transmitter and receiver were ranged at a distance of about 100 km, whereas for backscatter experiments the authors of Refs. [67 – 78] used a monostatic system in which the transmitter and receiver were assembled in a joint system. The transmitter described in Refs. [79 – 81] was operated in the range 50 – 52 MHz ( l \u0005 6 m), and the receiver is in the range 48 – 52 MHz. So, observed irregularities had a transverse scale ‘ ir ¼ l = 2 \u0005 3 m, in accordance with the rule that in the configuration of oblique scattering, the signal, scattered by those irregularities as plasma waves, propagates with a wave vector of value k ir ¼ 2 p =‘ ir that relates to the radar wave vector value k r ¼ 2 p / l and scattering angle u s (see Figure 7.5) as k ir ¼ 2 k r sin( u s /2). So, for u s ¼ 180 8 , we immediately get k ir ¼ 2 k r or ‘ ir ¼ l = 2. As was mentioned in Chapter 6, the circle of experiments was carried out on the island of Crete, Greece (35 8 N and 28 8 N geomagnetic latitude; 24 8 E), and was called the ‘‘ Sporadic E Scatter (SESCAT) Experiment. ’’ The geographic map presented in Figure 7.25 shows the geometry of these experiments, with the transmitter and the receiver separated by about 100 km. As is seen, the center of the scattering ionospheric region is located at altitude of 105 km, denoted by the solid straight line corresponding zeros magnetic aspect angle. In Figure 7.25, at the left bottom side, some geomagnetic field parameters are summarized, such as invariant magnetic latitude along the line passing the center of scattered area, L ¼ 30.8 8 ; the magnetic field magnitude, B ¼ 0.43 Gauss; the magnetic dip angle, I ¼ 52.5 8 ; and the magnetic declination, D ¼ 2.5 8 . The latter parameter defines the line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to geomagnetic north at the east direction, which equals 5.5 8 . So, we can note that experiments were carried out (and, consequently, scatter signals were observed) close to the geomagnetic north – south direction and therefore measured meridian motions of observed irregularities. According to measurements, and the corresponding antenna radiation pattern, in Refs. [79 – 81] was estimated the scattering area for associated magnetic aspect angles. This azimuthally extent of the scattering area is shown in Figure 7.26 as a family of the contour lines spaced at 3 dB gain intervals. The corresponding shaded area is also shown in Figure 7.25. Computations presented in Ref. [79] give estimations of the scattering area; its extent is about 20 km in longitude and of about 45 km in latitude. Using bistatic radar, the echo signals, ‘‘ weak ’’ and ‘‘ strong ’’ , reflected from the ionospheric meteor trails were investigated during first circle experiments, both ‘‘ weak ’’ and ‘‘ strong ’’ backscatter signals.

Thus, the upper part of Figure 7.27 evidently illustrates this event, occurring at 14:05 local time. Here, the spectrogram of the E s event is shown against local time. The corresponding velocities of movements of irregularities responsible for the backscattering were estimated through the measured Doppler shifts in the spectrum, where 1 Hz corresponds to a velocity of 3.11 m/s. So, the movements of irregularities responsible for such a sporadic signal occur at the radial velocity range of \u0007 100 m/s. In the bottom part of Figure 7.27 one of the remaining events occurring only during nighttime is shown. This phenomenon starts with the short-lived burst-type signal having narrow spectrum width and concentrated at the range of \u0007 30 m/s. After several minutes a long-lived continuous signal (of at least 40 min duration) was observed that associated with sporadic E s scatter phenomenon from large-scale weakly ionized irregularities of the ionosphere. More detailed investigation of burstlike scatter signals also in earlier morning and nighttime, such as shown in the top and bottom parts of Figure 7.28, having the same structure as the burst signal presented in Figure 7.27, as well as another short-lived signal (with duration up to several minutes), having different velocity of movements (in Figure 7.28, the spectrum gives a radial velocity range of 150 – 200 m/s and achieves even \u0007 250 m/s), allowed the authors to associate these burstlike signals with the meteor scatter signal. So, the obtained results are in good agreement with results obtained 20 years earlier at the middle-latitude trace passing the Black Sea [15 – 18]. What is important to point out is that the authors of Refs. [15 – 18] (one of the coauthors of this work was involved in these studies) also observed clearly meteor-scatter (burstlike) signals during midday periods.

We briefly present his theory below and will then expand it to describe forward scattering at wide range of angles without entering into the origin of generation of irregularities, because the obtained results were adapted for different kinds of ionospheric plasma structures. Thus, this theory fully describes scattering from natural ionospheric irregularities, such as H E type and meteor type [15 – 18], as well as from quasi-periodical plasma structures artificially induced by heating of the ionosphere by powerful waves [19 – 22]. In Figure 7.31, the geometry of scattering of radio wave at a wide range of angles is presented. The origin is arranged at point O inside the volume V containing scatterers. The transmitter is located at the point P 1 , and the receiver is at point P 2 .

Further analysis of the intensity of scattering signals from small-scale plasma irregularities, obtained without assumption L max \f R 1 , R 2 , was carried out by Booker [11 – 14]. It was shown that the obtained results, based on special Legendre ’ s polynomial functions, cannot be used for analysis of scattering processes from small-scale irregularities elongated along the geomagnetic field B 0 .

Here, we unify all notations made by Booker with those made in Refs. [15 – 18]. The electric field at the arbitrary point O within the scattered volume can be defined by the same expression (Equation 6.9).

The same tendency was shown by measurements made in the high-latitude inhomogeneous ionosphere [27 – 31] and in some radar observations in equatorial regions of the ionosphere [32 – 38], as well as in active experiments of heating of plasma by powerful radio waves [6 – 8,39 – 42].

For this purposes, we will analyze the ratio s / s B defined by Equation 7.35 for forward scattering, and by Equation 7.36 for backscattering, respectively, and the role of geometrical parameters of radio traces ( W , x , c ) in changes of scattered energy for both phenomena of radio scattering from the stratified plasma structures in the ionosphere. As follows from Equation 7.35, the ratio s / s B is proportional to sin 2 x , i.e., it depends on the type of radio wave polarization [16]. Furthermore, in the middle- and high-latitude ionosphere, the active region of ionospheric scattering is localized at the northern directions from a great circle (as well as localized at the southern directions from a great circle for the low-latitude ionosphere). Therefore, the constraint x < p /2 is valid in many cases of ionospheric radio scattering [11 – 16]. This fact leads to a decrease of s for forward scattering compared with s B for backscattering.

It is seen from presented illustrations that A ( ‘ ? ) > A 0 ( ‘ 0 ? ) always at the same wavelength. From constraints d A ( ‘ ? ) = d ‘ ? ) ¼ 0 and d A 0 ( ‘ 0 ? ) = d ‘ 0 ? ) ¼ 0, we can now find the optimal values of transverse radii of correlation that give maximal contributions in the power of forward and backscattering, respectively: ‘ ( opt ) ? ¼ l 2 3 = 2 p sin W 2 and ‘ ( opt ) 0 ? ¼ l 2 3 = 2 p (7 : 38) Thus, for the frequencies mentioned earlier, we can easily derive that ‘ ( opt ) ?

Finally, we get the width of the pattern of scattering: For forward scattering D c F ¼ 1 2 2 = 3 p sin W 2 l ‘ jj (7 : 41) For backscattering D c B ¼ 1 2 2 = 3 p l ‘ jj (7 : 42) It can be seen that the width of the pattern of scattering (also called the effective width of diagram of irradiation from H E irregularities [15]) for forward scattering differs compared with the same value for backscattering. This difference is determined by the term sin W 2 \r\u000e \u0001 1 .Thus,fortheradio trace shown in Figure 7.3 and for a ¼ ‘ k = l ¼ 10, 3.16, 1, we have for deviations D c : D c F ¼ 3 8 24 0 , 10 8 24 0 ,32 8 40 0 for forward scattering, and D c B ¼ 1 8 18 0 ,4 8 06 0 ,12 8 57 0 for backscattering. For the same conditions in the ionosphere (i.e., for the same scales ‘ k and ‘ ? ), the width D c , as follows from Equation 7.41, is directly proportional to wavelength l and decreases with the increase of scattering angle W . When ‘ k and ‘ ? are of the same order of magnitude, irregularities become isotropic, and the sensitivity to the specular scattering becomes weaker. Then, the effective cross section s from Equation 7.35 becomes a function of only the angle W , angle x , conditions of the ionosphere (the ratio d N / N 0 ), and the average scale of isotropic irregularities ( ‘ jj ¼ ‘ ? ¼ ‘ 0 ). 7.2.4 Power of H E -Scatter Radio Signals Using the knowledge of the effective cross section, one can easily obtain expressions for power of H E -scattering signals using the following well-known relations between these main parameters of scattered signal [11 – 16]: P R ¼ P T l 4 p \u000b\f 2 ð V G T G R s r 2 T r 2 R d v (7 : 43) The geometry of the radio trace and all notations are presented in Figure 7.31; G T and G R are the gain of the transmitter and the receiver antenna, respectively. The effective cross section of scattering, s , is defined by Equation 7.34 or 7.35 for the case of forward scattering, and by Equation 7.36 for the case of backscattering. In our further description of the problem, we deal with forward scattering from anisotropic plasma irregularities following results obtained in Refs. [15 – 18]. For sufficiently long radio paths, when the working volume of the active zone of scattering is not too large (i.e., V 1/3 \f r T , r R ), the product r 2 T r 2 R in the denominator of the integral (Equation 7.43) can be assumed to be constant and replaced on r 4 , where r is the direct distance between the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 442 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i 442 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"ground terminal antennas, the transmitter and the receiver, and the center of the projection of the active zone at the ground surface.

As this factor decreases sharply for values of ‘ ? differing from ‘ ( opt ) ? , we can assume that irregularities of such transverse scales to B 0 are mostly involved in the scattering process for which ‘ ? ¼ ‘ ( opt ) ? . In this case, the factor A ( ‘ ? ) ¼ e \u0001 1 .

The corresponding computations based on the elements of analytical geometry are described in detail in Ref. [15], on the basis of geometrical and geophysical parameters of one of the middle-latitude radio traces. Using these parameters as well as the parameters of terminal antennas, one can estimate the effective volume of the active zone and other parameters having practical meaning for ionospheric radio link design. Thus, the working volume can be found by numerical integration of Equation 7.45 by plotting the lines of the equal quantities g ¼ c sin( W /2) ¼ const at the plane of the corresponding experi- ment, as shown in Figure 7.34. Here, the values of the angle g are presented at the left of each line. The numbers in dB, which are given at the right side of the map, indicate the decrease of the received signal power due to the exponential factor \u000e exp( \u0001 8 p 2 a 2 g 2 ). The numbers in the first column correspond to a 2 ¼ 10, those in the second column correspond to a 2 ¼ 100 (irregularities with a larger degree of anisotropy). It is clearly seen that for a 2 ¼ 10( ‘ k ¼ 3 : 16 l ) integration in Equation 7.45 can be limited within the working volume by the isolines g ¼\u0007 3 8 , whereas for irregularities with a larger degree of anisotropy ( a 2 ¼ 100, ‘ k ¼ 10 l ), this volume lies between isolines g ¼\u0007 1 8 ; i.e., it is much smaller. Figure 7.34 also shows the limitations of the working volume of scattering by effects of directivity of both terminal antennas having sufficiently narrow spatial radiation pattern. The ellipses E T and E R represent the intersection of the antenna diagrams by the horizontal plane plotted at the center of the active zone at heights of 100 – 105 km above Earth ’ s surface. Experiments carried out at other geographical radio traces [11 – 14,45 – 50], as well as theoretical studies [16 – 18], have shown that the active zone of H E -scattering is at altitudes from 100 to 110 km. So, in our future estimations, we can take a value of about 5 – 7 km for the effective height of the working volume. With this small height, the comparison with the linear dimensions of the active region allows us to assume that the working volume can be presented as a cylindrical body, strongly stretched along geomagnetic field lines. Let us now estimate the accuracy of the foregoing theoretical analysis for description of scattering by meteor-induced H E irregularities, the recorded signals from which have the quasi- continuous and burstlike nature (see Figures 7.6 and 7.8). As shown in Refs. [15,16], Equation 7.45 Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 443 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i Performance of Radio Communication in Ionospheric Channels & 443"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"is common for both types of signals. At the same time, it allows estimating different parameters of such types of irregularities and obtaining important information about the active zone of scattering, the characteristics of which are important for prediction of long-path radio channels on the basis of effects of radio scattering from nonregular inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma.

These lines, presented for two degrees of anisotropy of plasma irregularities, a ¼ 3.16 and a ¼ 10, allow us to estimate, together with the intersections of ellipses E R and E T , the effective ‘‘ working ’’ zone of H E -scattering. Furthermore, if powers P R and P T can be experimentally measured and the plasma wavelength obtained according to the corresponding ionograms of the ionospheric E region obtained by the ionospheric stations or ionosondes, the preceding equation (Equation 7.48) allows us to estimate the relative root-mean-square ( rms ) deviations of plasma (e.g., electron) density. This main parameter of ionospheric irregularities is important because it determines the intensity of scattering of radio waves from the inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma.

For determining elements D V of the active zone of scattering, it has to be divided on elements limited by the isolines g ¼ c sin( W /2) ¼ const and the overlapping area of two antenna diagrams, as shown in Figure 7.34. Then, the product of area of each element on the height D h ¼ 5 – 7 km, mentioned earlier and obtained experimentally in Refs. [11 – 16], has to be derived and introduced in a total sum. In experiments described in Ref. [15] the sensitivity toward the position of scattering plasma structures during H E -scattering was examined. In this case, the receiver antenna has the constant pattern determined by ellipse E R limited by the solid lines, and the transmitter antenna scanned in the azimuth domain (every 3 8 in azimuth, as shown in Figure 7.34). During the corresponding step of scanning, the azimuthal dependence of the signal power recorded by the fixed receiver can be measured. The dashed lines in Figure 7.34 give the position of ellipse E T corresponding to several positions (i.e., steps) of the transmitter antenna during its scanning in the azimuth domain. To estimate the sensitivity of specular scattering to the position of the antenna pattern (e.g., ellipse), we have to determine for each position the following sum: S ( w ) ¼ X V G T G R sin 2 x sin 2 W 2 exp \u0001 8 p 2 a 2 g 2 \r\u000e D V (7 : 50) and compare it with the sum S (0).

The ratio of these two sums (which actually describes the ratio of the corresponding powers P w and P 0 ) is shown in Figure 7.35 for a volume limited mainly by the terminal antennas ellipses and by lines g ¼ const , as shown in Figure 7.34.

From these experiments, the plasma density perturbation within the active zone of scattering was estimated. Thus, Table 7.1 shows the corresponding computations of the relative rms of plasma perturbations within irregularities estimated for experiments carried out at f ¼ 74 MHz for P T ¼ 4 kW, G T ¼ 23.4 dB, G R ¼ 17.4 dB, R in ¼ 75 V (ohm), and r \u0005 700 km, described earlier and shown in Figure 7.34, for different input voltages at the receiver (in m V), corresponding to the levels of the received quasi-continuous signals varied from 0.1 to 1.2 m V. Because the plasma wavelength at the E region of the middle-latitude ionosphere is usually l N ¼ 75 – 100 m [1 – 3,16,52], estimated values of ( d N / N 0 ) 2 \u0005 10 \u0001 7 \u0001 6 \u0006 10 \u0001 5 are more realistic.

As for burst-type signals, which are most likely of meteor origin, presented in Figures 7.6 and 7.7, we should deal with a volume D V F , where ( D V F ) 1/3 is the half width of the Fresnel zone that covers the scattered points of D V F and the receiver.

The method of estimation of degree of anisotropy of such irregularities [15,45,46,64] is based on comparison of the received signal level decay (in dB) for any azimuthal deflection of the transmitting antenna determined by an angle w from the direction toward the center of the active scattered zone, denoted by W ( w ), with the signal decay (in dB) directly obtained from the center of the active zone, denoted by W (0).

It was discovered in all the cycles of experiments carried out in three different middle-latitude geographical zones of Earth — Japan, the United States, and the former USSR — that the trans- verse dimensions of field-aligned irregularities ‘ ? was close to ‘ ? opt , at which the function A ( ‘ ? ) is maximal.

Hence, the foregoing longitudinal and transverse scales of field-aligned E layer irregularities at middle latitudes obtained in experiments at 26, 44, 74, and 206 MHz [44,47,56] suggest that scattering is frequency selective. The active zone of H E -scattering apparently contains a whole spectrum of small-scal e anisotropic irregularities of different dimen- sions. Irregularities of given scales, depending on wavelength of radiated signals, are more involved in the irradiation process than those with other scales differ from mentioned earlier. Hence, we can stress that the statistical character of quasi-continuous signals (see Figure 7.8) and burst-type signals (see Figures 7.6 and 7.7) is properly described by the theory of forward scattering of radio waves from local anisotropic irregularities of the E region of the ionosphere. 7.2.5 Forward and Backscattering from Irregularities of the F Region of the Ionosphere The continuous and systematic experiments regarding investigation of scattering effects, back and forward, from small-scale field-aligned plasma irregularities of the F region of the ionosphere caused by natural phenomena [25 – 41] and artificially induced by heating of ionospheric plasma by powerful radio waves [85 – 94], were carried from the end of the 1970s to the middle of the 1980s by several groups of researchers at different geographical latitudes and longitudes of Earth. Then, during recent decades, theoretical models that describe the effects of such irregularities on radio scattering and propagation through the ionosphere were developed [19 – 22,95 – 102]. Using methods of radiolocation of small-scale anisotropic plasma irregularities by CW (or narrowband) and pulse (or wideband; see definitions in Chapter 3) sounding of the ionosphere in the HF/UHF frequency band, the main properties and parameters of such field-aligned irregularities, the active zones of their localization, as well as other effects of radio scattering, were analyzed theoretically and experimentally. In the following text, we briefly present the main results discussed in Refs. [95 – 102] regarding scattering of radio waves from anisotropic plasma structures of the region of the ionosphere that is strongly elongated along the geomagnetic field lines. In Ref. [95], it was shown that forward scattering and backscattering of radio waves by anisotropic plasma irregularities of various origins can be determined by the following relation of their transverse scale ‘ ? (to B 0 ), the angle of scattering u , and the wavelength l : ‘ ? ¼ l = 2 sin( u = 2) It determines the specular sensitivity, i.e., the fact that energy of irradiation is concentrated in the narrow angle interval inside the cone of specular reflection. This definition follows from expressions of effective cross section of radio scattering described by Equations 7.34 through 7.36. In Refs. [95,100], for Gaussian-type field-aligned irregularities, the effective cross section was presented in the same form as in Equations 7.34 through 7.36, i.e., as s ( g , l ) ¼ k 4 ‘ 2 ? ‘ jj d e ðÞ 2 \b\t 16 p 1 = 2 exp \u0001 k 2 ‘ 2 jj sin 2 u 2 \u000b\f cos 2 g þ ‘ 2 ? ‘ 2 jj sin 2 g !

As is mentioned in Refs. [95 – 97,100], this peculiarity of radio scattering from plasma irregularities strongly stretched along B 0 can be usefully used for over- horizon HF/UHF radio communication and for the excitation of waveguide modes propagation with a low degree of attenuation. The same contour of the active zone of intersections of specular cone with the Earth ’ s surface can be obtained using the theoretical approach proposed in Ref. [100], which uses the geometry of scattering presented in Figures 7.31 and 7.32. Thus, in Figures 7.36 through 7.39 are shown the specular contours at the ground surface as generated by specular scattering from the scattering volume D V at the altitude z c of the scattered area above Earth ’ s surface for different values of the scattered angle c (denoted by different numbers): 1 corresponds to c ¼ 87 8 ,2to c ¼ 93 8 ,3to c ¼ 92 8 ,4to c ¼ 90 8 (which corresponds to the contour of backscattering), 5 to c ¼ 88 8 ,6to c ¼ 91 8 , and 7 to c ¼ 89 8 .

In computations, the scattered area was modeled by a disk with a 50 km radius and a thickness of 20 – 30 km having a center above the point of the transmitter of the pump waves (the heater) at the ground. The horizontal dimensions of the area of scattering in the ionosphere above the center of heating were determined by the width of the antenna pattern of the heating transmitter at the height of the induced wave; the vertical dimensions were obtained from experimental data according to Ref. [98]. As a result, the geographic coordinates of points satisfying conditions of specular scattering of corresponding radio rays were obtained. On the basis of computations of the time of group propagation of scattering rays, t gr , from transmitter to the scattered area and then from the scattered area to the receiver, the spread (diffusion) of receiving signals due to scattering in the time domain, D t gr (or the frequency shift D f in the frequency domain), was estimated. In Figure 7.42, the results of computations of the active zone of radio signals recorded at Earth ’ s surface are presented in the same manner as was shown in Figures 7.36 through 7.41.

The observed structure of the scattered signals was complicated by the increase of the duration of heating, the two to three traces on the range – frequency characteristic diagram, as shown in Figure 7.43. To explain the observed striated structure of the disturbed plasma after the heating process, in Ref. [102] the problem was solved for the diffraction and reflection of waves from an artificially disturbed region of the ionosphere, the plasma density and, thus, the dielectric permittivity e ( h ), the height dependence of which was modeled according to results obtained in Ref. [19,21] as e ( h ) ¼ 1 þ d sin Kh (7 : 56) where d is the amplitude of the inhomogeneity fluctuations and K is the inverse scale of the irregularity. The wave-vector of the probing wave was oriented to be normal to the geomagnetic field B 0 . The solution yielded a reflection coefficient for a strongly oscillatory monochromatic wave. Generalization of the solution to the short trapezoidal radio pulse used in experiments [101] allows for the calculation of the envelope of the signal diffracted from small-scale anisotropic ionospheric irregularities, taking into account results obtained in Ref. [19,21]. In Figure 7.44, the shape of the signal envelope after diffraction and reflection is shown. As can be seen, the shape of the signal is strongly irregular, and the number of maxima corresponds to the number of traces observed experimentally and shown in Figure 7.43. So, using results obtained in Ref. [19,21] as well as those described in Chapter 6 regarding the problem of reflection and diffraction of radio signals from artificially disturbed regions of the upper ionosphere [102] yields a satisfactory agreement with the results of the experimental studies of backscattered signals described in Ref.

As shown in Chapter 6, the heating of the real inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma by the powerful HF waves leads, in the E and F regions of the ionosphere, to excitation of heating-induced plasma instabilities (e.g., waves; see Chapter 2) at frequencies in the vicinity of plasma resonances [85 – 103]. In this case, most of the radio wave energy is absorbed and transformed into energy for the plasma wave oscillations [90 – 93], and finally leads to intensive local heating of plasma electrons or ions (as plasma is quasi- neutral; see Chapter 1) owing to the collision dissipation of this energy of radio wave. As a result, increase (enhancements) or decrease (depletions) of plasma density in the heating regions is observed experimentally [85 – 90]. The same effects and similar processes are observed using ionosondes or radars at high latitudes [105 – 107] and at the magnetic equator [32 – 38], which are related to the heating of background plasma electrons by highly energetic photoelectrons or cosmic rays [29 – 31,39 – 41]. For efficient performance of wireless communication links associated with long-distance radio propagation through ionospheric channels, created both artificially and naturally, it is important to be able to predict the influence of ionospheric heating processes on broadband propagation. Mentioned in Refs. [29 – 31,39 – 41] motivated to use the approach based of ray tracing simulation in the presence of heated-induced (i.e., perturbed) plasma media. In the following text, we will first describe the effects of radio wave propagation through the heating plasma regions containing irregular plasma density structures and profiles generated by parametric plasma instabilities (see Chapter 2) during heating of ionospheric plasma by powerful radio waves or containing moderate- and small-scale plasma structures generated by different kinds of instabilities at the E and F layers of the natural ionosphere. Then, we will discuss briefly the capture of probing wave energy into the ionospheric waveguide caused by the multilayer structure of the regular ionosphere. Finally, we will analyze the so-called channeling of these waves at extremely long distances owing to the multiple-hopping effect. To more clearly understand the aforementioned processes, we need to asses the effects of losses on the ray paths in the absorbing plasma media completely described in Refs. [108 – 117] for the naturally stratified layered structure of the ionosphere as an anisotropic media, and then modified for the case of inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma containing heating-induced plasma irregularities [118,119]. 7.3.1 Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere Disturbed by Powerful Radio Waves In this section, our main goal is to assess for the reader the behavior of radio waves resulting in significant changes of the plasma density height profiles during the resonance heating process using ray presentation. Here, following Ref. [119], we will present briefly the extended model of ray tracing (with respect to the familiar Hamilton equations [115 – 118]) to examine the influence of losses on ray paths for HF/UHF propagation through the E and F layers of the natural ionosphere, taking into account their real plasma density profiles and the corresponding collision frequencies (see Chapter 1). Despite the fact that for low losses and smooth plasma height profiles the problem is understood quite well [110 – 118], new effects were found [119] for irregular profiles generated in the case of heating, namely, significant increase (or decrease, depending on the height of heating, see Chapter 6) of plasma density and the corresponding irregular perturbations of its height profile, facilitating reflections of probing radio waves passing such disturbed regions at frequencies transcending the HF regime of 3 – 30 MHz, up into the 1 GHz range, and, finally, Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 456 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i 456 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"changes of the ray trajectories (creating one-hop and more radio paths) and of the field strength of probing radio waves. As the redistribution of plasma density and the changes in its profile during resonance heating, local and adaptive, described in Chapters 5 and 6, finally lead to a very complicated physical processes, the analytical investigations of the problem are limited by the complexity of the wave propagation through such a stratified ionospheric structure and by complicated physical processes accompanying resonance heating of plasma. All this leads to increasingly complex dispersion relations between plasma characteristics and parameters, and to very complicated wave equations describing the ray-tracing effects. Therefore, for analysis of the problem we use a numerical model and the corresponding ray equation formalism based on the extended Hamilton equations by introducing the dispersion relation F ( k , v , r , t ) ¼ 0 in the complex plane, that is, considering whether the propagation vector k ¼ ( k x , k y , k z ) and the angular frequency v may be complex [118,119]: v ¼ d r d t ¼\u0001 @ F =@ k @ F =@ v d k d t ¼ @ F =@ r @ F =@ v þ i b d v d t ¼\u0001 @ F =@ t @ F =@ v þ i v \u0006 b (7 : 57) Here, r ¼ ( r x , r y , r z ) is the local vector in the space domain, t is the time, which also serves to define a parameter along the ray trajectory, and b the vector that guarantees a real group velocity v along the ray trajectory defined as b ¼\u0001 Re @ v @ k þ @ v @ v \u0006 v \u000b\f \u0005\u0006 \u0001 1 \u0006 Im @ v @ k \u0006 @ F =@ r @ F =@ v \u0001 @ v @ v \u0006 @ F =@ t @ F =@ v þ @ v @ r \u0006 v þ @ v @ t \u0005\u0006 (7 : 58) The expression (Equation 7.58) follows from the constraint d Im( v ) ðÞ = d t ¼ 0(7 : 59) which states that along the ray trajectory the incremental imaginary part of the group velocity is equal to zero. Thus, the model presented in Refs. [108,109] and described by Equations 7.57 and 7.58 extends the real Hamilton equations into the multivariate complex space but adds a constraint to force ray trajectories and the group velocity into the real part of the complex space ( r , t ), and to retain the analcites of the dispersion equation. In other words, the constraint (Equation 7.59) guarantees that the ray trajectories are always present in joint spatial-temporal domain, and consequently also for the associated group velocity because the propagation vector and the frequency are assumed to be complex. Earth ’ s magnetic field in such a model was approximated by a localized dipole field with the dipole located near the center of Earth. Under these conditions, the Appleton – Hartree (some- times called Appleton – Lassen [116,117]) dispersion relation, obtained for the cold, nonisothermal, collisional, magnetized ionosphere, i.e., for real ionospheric conditions, occurs in the E and F regions of the ionosphere (see Chapters 1 and 6).

The corresponding data for numerical computation of Equation 7.57 was obtained from the corresponding solutions of the heating problem and from the tables presented in Section 5.3. Then the obtained data was converted with a quasi-parabolic approximation to smooth functions describing the various plasma profiles after its heating [99 – 103].

Now let us present computations of the ray trajectories for the quasi-regular non-disturbed ionosphere with the corresponding smooth altitu dinal profile of background plasma density. The results are shown in Figure 7.46a and b for different frequencies for the ordinary mode of probing waves ( f ¼ 10, 30 MHz), and for various grazing angles a ( a ¼ 90 8 \u0001 u , u ¼ 10 8 , 20 8 ,...,80 8 ). In the figures, the frequency of probi ng radio waves passing through the iono- sphere is at the same level or higher than th e maximum usable frequency (MUF) of the investigated ionospheric layers for the ordinary mode; i.e., for f < 20 MHz [119]. As can be seen from illustrations, in the quasi-regular n ondisturbed ionosphere for probing waves of 10 MHz, i.e., less than 20 MHz, and for small grazing angles a ¼ 10 8 \u0001 30 8 , the only one-hop propagation is observed because of reflection fro m the ionospheric quasi-regular plasma layers. With decreasing frequencies of the probing w aves (from 10 to 30 MHz), the possibility of obtaining propagation channels with higher grazing angles (up to a ¼ 50 8 \u0001 60 8 ) increases (see Figure 7.46a). This effect is recognized in commo nly used propagation ionospheric channels for frequencies of probing waves that are close to t he MUF for each ionospheric layer. After a virtual experiment with the local resonance heating of plasma described in details in Section 5.3, the same ray trajectories derived from the foregoing equations can be obtain ed.

From Figure 7.47a through c, by using a modified profile of the ionospheric plasma during its heating, larger ranges of one-hop propagation can be obtained for probing waves with frequencies close to MUF ( f < 20 MHz) of the undisturbed ionosphere for the wide range of grazing angles a . Furthermore, the existence of a heating-induced ionospheric region at the wide range of iono- spheric altitudes allows using high-frequency probing waves for one-hop propagation at long distances owing to reflections from the disturbed ionospheric sporadic layers. Thus, for frequencies 20 < f < 400 MHz of probing waves, efficient one-hop propagation for distances more than 500 km and for wide range of grazing angles 10 8 < a < 40 8 \u0001 50 8 can be achieved (see Figure 7.47a and b). From Figure 7.47c, by using local resonance heating of the ionospheric F layer, a long-distance propagation channel can be implemented owing to reflections from disturbed ionospheric regions for higher-frequency bands, up to the UHF/L band for a sufficiently wide range of grazing angles 10 8 < a < 30 8 .

This effect can be observed in the disturbed ionosphere affected by natural or artificial heater, but cannot be c ompletely observed in a nondisturbed quasi- regular ionosphere. With the increase of grazing angles of probing waves passing through the modified ionospheric regions, for example, a \u0004 45 8 (see Figure 7.50b), these effects become weaker, and a guiding effect can be observed for frequencies larger than MUF but smaller than 400 – 500 MHz. Waves with higher frequencies pene trate to the upper ionosphere with a slight refraction effect. Various examples shown earlier substantiate the fact that the trajectory of radio waves through the ionosphere itself depends on the absorption and the plasma (i.e., electron) concentration gradients involved. It appears that for the strong plasma depletions (or cavities) generated in the disturbed ionosphere because of the process of forcing out plasma during a relatively short heating time, Earth ’ s magnetic field does not have an appreciable effect on the radio wave trajectories. A more important parameter for radio propagation at extremely long distances that is caused by reflections from disturbed ionospheric regions is the grazing angle and operational frequency of the ground-based facilities. Thus, for different kinds of heating processes, local or adaptive, it has been found that with increase of grazing angles for the same operational frequency of probing waves or with increase of operational frequency for the same grazing angles, the effect of channeling of one- hop modes in the ionosphere – earth waveguide channel becomes more and more unrealistic. Finally, we can outline that because the heating regimes presented earlier and discussed more in detail in Chapters 5 and 6 are close to real-world natural conditions of the high-latitude ionosphere that correspond to natural nonstationary thermal processes caused by ambient sources, we can predict and explain the changes in probing wave trajectories and guiding effects at long distances in wide frequency bands, up to the L band, which are used in communication with atmospheric missiles, platforms, and space vehicles reentering the higher atmosphere, as well as in satellite communication channels for a wide range of grazing angles of probing waves passing through the ionosphere. We will now briefly describe and summarize the effects of channeling of waves inside the ionospheric layered plasma waveguides due to capturing of probing waves by naturally or artificially induced plasma irregularities, following results obtained and described in Refs.

In other words, the layered quasi-regular ionosphere works for such waves as the waveguide where radio waves (called waveguide modes ) reflect from the upper and lower boundaries and therefore can be channeled owing to multiple reflections at long distances. In the literature this effect was defined long-range ionospheric radio propagation [120 – 127]. It was shown both theoretically and experimentally that to obtain the guiding effect for probing radio waves propagating inside such plasma layered waveguides, it is necessary for the guiding modes to satisfy the following constraints [120,121]: v \u0006 sec b kr < v e ( z 1 ) v \u0006 sec b kr < v e ( z 2 )(7 : 65) where v is the angular frequency of the probing wave; v e the frequency of background plasma oscillations, all defined in Chapter 1; and z 1 and z 2 are the lower and upper boundaries of the plasma waveguide shown in Figure 7.51. Constraints (Equation 7.65) govern the periodic reflec- tion from the bottom to top walls of waveguide modes during propagation inside the guiding plasma-layered structure. What is important to mention here is that these waveguide modes can propagate at long distances with sufficiently low attenuation of about 5 – 10 dB for each 1000 km [120,121]. If we assume initially that the regular layered ionosphere is spherically symmetric, containing layers with horizontal dimensions (with respect to B 0 ) larger than the wavelength, the radio waves transmitted at an angle a 0 from the ground transmitter with frequencies satisfying constraints (Equation 7.65) cannot achieve the critical height z c located in the middle axis of the waveguide zz B k k c z 2 a kr z kr z kr z 1 L p a 0 0 b a 0 N 0 r Figure 7.51 Altitudinal profile of plasma density (left panel) and geometry of capturing of probing wave in the layered ionosphere (right panel).

This also holds if we consider the transmitter assembled at the satellite. Capturing of probing waves energy in the ionospheric waveguide can only be achieved if rays arriving at the waveguide under angles a 0 > b kr are oriented in such a manner as to achieve the angle a kr inside the waveguide according to constraints (Equation 7.65), as shown in Figure 7.51. This additional displacement of the angle a from a 0 to a kr can be achieved owing to refraction of radio waves at the horizontal gradients of the ionospheric plasma density or due to moderate- and small-scale irregularities causing scattering effects of the probing radio waves. As mentioned earlier, such plasma irregularities can be induced either by natural phenomena (meteor trails, magnetic storms, etc.) or by modification of the ionosphere using ground-based facilities for heating the ionosphere or by injection of plasma beams or clouds by rockets [120 – 127]. Thus, as shown [120 – 127] both theoretically and experimentally, the heating of the ionosphere by powerful radio waves at the altitudes of resonances of plasma stimulates creation of moderate-scale and small-scale plasma irregularities, which then can work as ‘‘ lenses ’’ for capture of radio waves into the ionospheric waveguide and channeling their energy at long distances. Our further analysis will base itself on the theory developed in Refs. [120 – 124]. We must now stress that the corresponding theory is correct only if spatial gradients of parameters of plasma waveguide are smooth enough, i.e., when d( ln j ) d x \u0006 \u0003 j 2 p \f 1(7 : 66) where j is the parameter of the plasma waveguide and L j is the scale of spatial scintillations of probing waves inside the layered waveguide between Z 1 and Z 2 (see Figure 7.51). As L j generally is larger than 100 km in the channel between the E and F layers, the characteristic scale of the horizontal gradients of the parameters inside the plasma waveguide can exceed 500 km [120,121]. In other words, the horizontal gradients of plasma density are more important than vertical refraction of radio waves in the inhomogeneous layered ionosphere men- tioned earlier. Following Refs. [120,126], we assume that radio waves arriving at and entering the ionosphere at an angle a 0 cross the waveguide along the path denoted ab in Figure 7.51. The virtual midaxis of the waveguide is placed at the height z kr . Then, the angle between the passing ray and the corresponding axis is denoted a kr (see Figure 7.51). The ray trajectory inside the waveguide is characterized by the angle b kr ( z kr ) and if so, the boundaries of the capture ray are defined by the following condition [120,121]: e ( z ) ¼ e ( z kr ) cos 2 b kr , z 1 < z kr < z 2 (7 : 67) Scattering of radio waves at the small-scale plasma irregularities described in previous sections leads to the turning of reflected waves relative the vector k kr . All rays for which the angle of scattering is larger than the difference a kr \u0001 b kr will be seized inside the ionospheric waveguide. The angle b kr can be determined from the following relationship: e ( z 1 ) ¼ e ( z kr ) cos 2 b kr (7 : 68) For small b kr , from Equation 7.68 it follows that b kr ¼ v 2 e ( z 1 ) \u0001 v 2 e ( z kr ) v 2 \u0005\u0006 (7 : 69) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 470 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i 470 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"According to the Booker theory, described earlier, the angle of scattering u s for each ray can be found from the angle of the incident ray with coordinates ( a 0 ,0) and the angle of scattered ray with coordinates ( a , w ), where w is the angle in the azimuth (e.g., horizontal) plane measured from the axis x .

From the preceding equation it follows that the possibility of channeling radio waves in the ionospheric layered waveguide is determined by the intensity U e ( K ) of small-scale plasma irregularities of various origins, artificially or naturally generated in the ionosphere, having the outer dimensions ‘< v c , where c is the light velocity. According to investigations presented in Refs. [120 – 126], the optimal capture of radio waves with frequencies of 10 – 20 MHz occurs when, at the ionospheric altitudes of the waveguide, plasma irregularities exist with horizontal dimensions (to geomagnetic field B 0 ) ‘ jj ¼ 100 \u0001 500 m.

This method is based on vertical sounding of radio signals at frequencies of 2 – 6 MHz, i.e., more than the plasma frequency of the D region of the ionosphere. The total reflection of these signals occurs at regions E and F of the ionosphere, but weak signals are also simultaneously registered from altitudes of 60 – 100 km, which result from diffuse reflection of the incident radio wave with the coefficient of reflection of approximately 10 \u0001 3 \u0001 10 \u0001 7 at random plasma irregularities of the D layer. If the sounding signal is a pulse signal, as shown in Figure 7.52, it propagates to the height h ¼ 0.5 c t , where the irregularity is located, and reflects from this irregularity with the coefficient of reflection, R o,x , reflecting from Earth ’ s surface.

The same relation as in Equation 7.75, between the parameters of the signal and those for ionospheric plasma, is accurate also for frequency-modulated continuous signals, called linear-frequency-modulated (LFM) waves in the literature [100,130].

This result allows for obtaining the frequency of electron – neutral collisions [as R ( h ) depends on n 2 m ( h )] through the measurements of the field amplitude of partially reflected signals at altitudes less than 65 km. As follows from foregoing, the ratio of amplitudes of the partially reflected signals, ordinary and nonordinary, are functions not only of plasma density N but also of the collision frequency n em . Therefore, measuring of N has to be done simultaneously with the knowledge of n em . It is a very complicated problem [128 – 131], but can be resolved using knowledge of the average phase difference, h DF i , between two magneto-ion components, i.e., DF hi ¼ 2 k 0 ð h 0 m x \u0001 m o hi d h 0 þ DC n (7 : 83) where m o and m x are the real parts of the reflection index of the ordinary and nonordinary waves, respectively, and DC n is the difference of absolute values of the reflection coefficients R x and R o . The corresponding derivations of all these parameters can be achieved using Equations 7.76 and 7.79. The deviations DC n can be obtained by deriving the difference of phases of two magneto-ion components of the pulse or continuous LFM signal recorded using two receiving antennas separated in space (i.e., using space diversity). The same method, using two spatially separated receiving antennas, was arranged in Ref. [136] to determine winds and motions in the D layer of the ionosphere. Following Ref. [136], we can assume that the field of the partially reflected radio waves creates a diffraction picture at the ground surface where can be differentiated dark and the light zones separated by lines of equal illumination, as shown in Figure 7.53. Owing to movements of plasma irregularities with velocity V , the lines of equal illumination, i.e., the diffraction picture, will move along Earth ’ s surface with velocity U , passing through the receiving points placed in the tips of the triangular area defined by the coordinates x 0 and y 0 , as shown in Figure 7.53, where positions of receiving antennas are denoted by ‘‘ crests. ’’ Then, the coefficient of cross-correlation of the partly reflected signals at the basis x 0 and y 0 can be found as [100]: Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C007 Final Proof page 474 9.4.2008 5:06pm Compositor Name: BMan i 474 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"r A ( x 0 , t ) ¼ A 1 ( t ) \u0006 A 2 ( t ) hi \u0001 A 1 ( t ) hi \u0006 A 2 ( t ) hi ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi A 2 1 ( t ) hi \u0001 A 1 ( t ) hi 2 q \u0006 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi A 2 2 ( t ) hi \u0001 A 2 ( t ) hi 2 q r A ( y 0 , t ) ¼ h ~ A 1 ( t ) \u0006 ~ A 2 ( t ) i\u0001 ~ A 1 ( t ) \b\t \u0006 ~ A 2 ( t ) \b\t ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ~ A 2 1 ( t ) DE \u0001 ~ A 1 ( t ) \b\t 2 r \u0006 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ~ A 2 2 ( t ) DE \u0001 ~ A 2 ( t ) \b\t 2 r (7 : 84) Here, A 1,2 ( t ) and ~ A 1,2 ( t ) are the amplitudes of signals received at the bases x 0 and y 0 , respectively, at the first and the second antennas, denoted in Figure 7.53 by crests 1 and 2 for r A ( x 0 , t ), and by 2 and 3 for r A ( y 0 , t ).

It was found that because of the spherical nature of radio waves, diffraction picture moves along the ground surface with velocity U exceeding twice the velocity V of movements of plasma irregularities [100,136]. The movement of irregularities is considered to be horizontal at the heights of reflection of probing partially reflected radio waves.

Thus, the spatial radius of correlation r A ( r , t ), where r is the distance between receiving antennas and t the time displacement of arriving waves, allows estimation of spatial radius r k and temporal radius t k , which can be defined as the distance and time at which the value of r A ( r , t ) is decreased e \u0001 1 \u0005 0.38 times [137,138]. The study of dependences of r k and t k from the angle u A of the antenna pattern allows for estimating parameters of inhomogeneities scattering the probing waves in the D region. For these purposes the two main functions have to be defined: the angle spectrum of correlation function of fluctuations of dielectric permittivity D e , F D e \u000e exp \u0013 \u0001 u 2 = u 2 p \u0014 , and the angle spectrum of antenna diagram, K 2 \u000e exp \u0001 u 2 = u 2 A \u0013\u0014 . Here, u p is the width of angle spectrum of back-reflected signals, u p ¼ l = p ‘ , measured at the signal strength level of e \u0001 1 \u0005 0.38, where ‘ is the horizontal dimen- sion, and u A was defined previously (see Figure 7.54). Two cases can occur. The first is shown in Figure 7.54a, where u 2 A \u0002 u 2 p . The spatial radius of amplitude correlation simply equals ‘ — i.e., r k ¼ l pu p ¼ ‘ — and the temporal scale equals t k ¼ ‘= 2 j V j . The second case is presented in Figure 7.54b, where u 2 A \f u 2 p (i.e., the diagram of the antenna is narrower than the angle spectrum of backscattering), the spatial radius of amplitude correlation equals r k ( w ) ¼ l / pu A , and the temporal scale is t k ¼ l /2 j V j pu A . In the last case, for an anisotropic diagram of antenna pattern, i.e., for K 2 ¼ K 2 ( u , w ), the diffraction picture will also be anisotropic and r k ( w ) ¼ l / pu A ( w ). Here w is the angle in the azimuth domain, In the case, where u 2 A \u0005 u 2 p , the foregoing formulas can be changed [137,138]: r k ¼ l pu eff , t k ¼ l 2 p V jj u eff (7 : 86) where u 2 eff ¼ u 2 A u 2 p = ( u 2 A þ u 2 p ). Hence, from the corresponding experiments [136 – 138] in which the antenna diagrams are the same as the angle spectrum of backscattered wave, the horizontal dimensions of the inhomogene- ities can be defined for the case when their horizontal scale exceeds the vertical scale, i.e., it has a form of a disk.

Solutions to this complicated problem depend on various physical processes occurring in the ionospheric plasma. According to discussions in previous chapters, there are many factors and features, artificial and natural, that influence the ionospheric propagation of HF/VHF waves. Thus, sporadic E s and F s layers play an important role; their existence leads to the screening of the regular layers, E and F, of the ionosphere. At the same time, these stratified layers cause above-horizon waveguide propagation at the extremely long distances of short and sometimes ultrashort waves at frequencies significantly exceeding the maximum useful frequencies (MUFs) of the F 1 and F 2 layers of the ionosphere. Significant influence of short-wave propagation in the ionosphere is observed because of the existence of ionospheric irregularities of various natures and different scales. The large-scale irregularities (with scales of ‘ \u0002 l ¼ 10 \u0001 100 km) mostly respond to refraction of radio waves passing thorough the ionospheric channel, whereas the moderate-scale (with scales of ‘> l ¼ 0 : 1 \u0001 1 km) and small- scale irregularities (with scales of ‘ \u0003 l ¼ 1 \u0001 100 m) cause multipath phenomena owing to multiple scattering and diffraction of radio waves. These effects cause creation of a diffuse structure of ionograms during oblique and vertical soundings of the ionosphere by ionosonde; as they also lead to strong fading of radio signals. At the same time, as was shown earlier, they ‘‘ work ’’ as lenses that, due to capture of wave energy, can take the waveguide ionospheric modes into the ionospheric waveguide and then, after traversing a long distance within it, can direct the guiding waves (i.e., modes) back to the ground-based facilities. As the nature of the generation of these plasma irregularities is very complicated and depends on many natural factors — such as solar activity; penetration of high-energy particles into the polar ionosphere; and creation of magnetic storms, mostly in the high-latitude ionosphere, which then penetrate into the lower latitudes; electrojet into the equatorial ionosphere; and so on — it is very complicated to take these physically different factors into account and create the adequate theoretical models of ionospheric radio channels. As has been mentioned by many investigators [139 – 145], significant progress in the investigation of ionospheric HF/UHF (up to several GHz) radio propagation is due to the development of modern experimental methods of diagnostics of ionospheric channels. One of the most effective of these is based on modern methods of wideband sounding of the ionosphere using signals of complicated structures and having low energy, such as the signals with linear frequency modulation (LFM) [146 – 150]. The use of LFM ionosondes in regimes of oblique sounding of the ionosphere allows researchers to obtain information regarding the main characteristics of short-wave ionospheric channels defined by the distance – frequency (DF) characteristic and the amplitude – frequency (AF) characteristic, obtained in the form of corresponding ionograms (see the examples given later). Below, we briefly present results of experimental investigations of LFM sounding of the middle- latitude ionosphere at the different traces of the former USSR, in which the authors of this book have been successfully involved. The Radio Trace of Alma-Ata – Gorky . Experiments on LFM sounding of the ionosphere at the radio trace of about 2700 km between two cities, Alma-Ata (Kazakhstan) and Gorky (now is Nizhny Novgorod, Russia), were carried out during June and July of 1987 using the frequency band 5 – 22 MHz with the speed of frequency deviations of 300 kHz/s. For the control of the ionospheric environment during each experiment, ionograms of vertical sounding were registered in the ionosphere above the places of the localization of the transmitter and the receiver.

From these illustrations a great difference can be seen between diagrams obtained at different times, i.e., the change of DF and AF characteristics of the channel with time, and a strong multiray structure of the receiving signals reflected from the real ionosphere. Here, for July 9, 1987: Figure 7.55a corresponds to 16 h 27 min of Moscow time, Figure 7.55b to 18 h 07 min, Figure 7.55c to 21 h 25 min, Figure 7.55d to 22 h 46 min; for July 10, 1987: Figure 7.55e to 00 h 02 min, Figure 7.55f to 01 h 06 min, Figure 7.55g to 03 h 06 min, Figure 7.55h to 03 h 45 min. Using vertical and oblique soundings, it was found that the main influence on mode structure of the reflected signals is observed from the sporadic E s layer, which was registered in more than 80% of ionograms. In oblique ionograms the mode 2 E s was registered mostly at frequencies exceeding the MUF of F 2 at 2 – 7 MHz. In the evening and the night, the focusing effect of radio signals was observed experimentally, which closely correlates with the existence of moving ionospheric perturbations (MIP) at the F 2 layer of the ionosphere, described in the previous chapters. Taking into account the speed of such plasma perturbations of V \u0005 100 m/s, we finally find that the characteristic dimensions of MIP generated in the ionospheric F layer by internal gravitation waves [100] are L \u0005 V \u0006 T ¼ 0.1 (km/s) \u0006 1800 (s) ¼ 180 km. The existence of such plasma structures explains the strong diffusion of reflected signals caused by F scattering of radio waves from natural middle-latitude irregularities and the multiray phenomena. The maximum average number of rays registered at frequencies f \u0005 (0.7 \u0001 0.8) MUF F 2 ,asfollows from Figure 7.55a through h, is n \u0005 4, with time delays of D t \u0005 500 m s between distant rays. Single-ray propagation was observed only at frequencies f > MUF F 2 and related to the mode 2 E s . The Radio Trace of Khabarovsk – Gorky . Experimental investigations of propagation of LFM signals at the trace Khabarovsk – Gorky of 5830 km was carried out during March – April 1988 at the frequency band of 5 – 26 MHz with speeds of frequency deviations of 300 kHz/s. In Figure 7.56a through h, the ionograms of DF and AF characteristics are shown for different diurnal times: for 21 March, 1988: Figure 7.56a is for 07 h 11 min, Figure 7.56b for 9 h 55 min, Figure 7.56c for 10 h 50 min, Figure 7.56d for 11 h 07 min, Figure 7.56e for 13 h 45 min, Figure 7.56f for 14 h 17 min, Figure 7.56g for 14 h 41 min, and Figure 7.56h for 15 h 14 min. For the control of the ionospheric conditions during oblique sounding of the ionosphere in real time, vertical sounding of the ionosphere was also used at the points of location of ground-based terminals. The figures illustrate different DF and AF characteristics as main parameters of the short-wave ionospheric channel. Thus, the difference between ionograms, fast fading of most signals, and a strong multiray phenomenon can be seen from the ionograms. Deep and strong deviations of the received signals are related to the screening effects of E s sporadic layer for the higher F 1 and F 2 layers of the ionosphere. The same effects were observed during the current experiment. Thus, the same multiple splitting of the ray of Pedersen (up to six rays) was observed in addition to magneto-ion splitting, which is determined in Refs. [151 – 153]. This effect can be explained by stratification of the ionosphere at the proximity of maximum of F 2 layer owing to modulation of background plasma electrons by sinusoidal MIP. The interpretation of such periodical effects, which was found to explain the observed focusing effect of radio signals, was the same as before, that it is caused by moving ionospheric perturbations (MIPs). At the ionograms of oblique sounding, we can observe that radio tracks occur parallel to the mode 3 F 2 with the delay time of 50 – 100 m s with respect to the main trail (see Figure 7.56b). Sometimes, the additional track overlaps the main mode. This leads to diffusion of the trail of mode 3 F 2 . At other times in the nocturnal ionosphere (22 – 04 h), the probing signals were not observed. We can suppose that the chief influence on short radio wave propagation at long distances is due to variations of plasma density distribution along the radio path. If so, in nocturnal time, a strong negative gradient of the plasma concentration can occur.

This assumption was proved by computations of the ray trajectories based on the real ionospheric parameters. As an example, in Figure 7.58 we present results of computations for carrier frequency of 12 MHz. Transfer of signals ’ energy back to Earth ’ s surface can be made by using either refraction of radio waves at the large-scale gradients of plasma density or scattering of radio waves from local ionospheric irregularities, natural and artificially induced [151]. Results of investigations have shown that parameters of the probing signals and the character of the ray of Pedersen depend on the level of magnetic activity. It was found that during magnetic storms with growth of perturbations of the geomagnetic field, the role of ionospheric irregularities on ionospheric radio propagation becomes predominant (see results in Chapters 6 and 8). Radio Trace Beltsi (Moldova) – Dushanbe (Tajikistan) . The oblique sounding of the ionosphere at two traces of 3380 and 7120 km, respectively, was carried out during October and November of 1991 (see the corresponding traces presented in Figure 7.59) [154].

So, during two months (November – December) more than 2500 ionograms were registered. In all ionograms, the multimode character of radio propagation was observed. Frequency ranges of the one-mode regime of radio wave propagation for the traces Beltsi – Dushanbe and Beltsi – Khabarovsk (Figure 7.59) were defined and the following dependences were analyzed: (a) the time dependence of maximum working frequency of radio signal for different propagation modes; (b) the time dependence of minimum working frequency of radio signal for different propagation modes; (c) the time dependence of frequency range for the one-mode propagation of radio waves; (d) the diurnal and nocturnal amplitude – time dependence for different frequencies, and so on. The corresponding ionograms of DF – AF characteristics of probing signals are shown in Figure 7.60 for the trace Beltsi – Dushanbe, where P is the power of the receiving signal, t is the time of arrival, and f is the signal operating frequency. The three modes of LFM signal propagation are clearly seen, which correspond to different arrival times at the receiver. For example, for the frequency f ¼ 18 MHz the signal of mode 3 F 2 was registered at the decoder at 400 m s later than the mode 1 F 2 , and 250 m s later than the mode 2 F 2 . Furthermore, at the ionograms can be distinguished the region of the multimode propagation of radio signal denoted as region A ranging from 14.5 to 22 MHz and the range of one-mode propagation denoted as region B ranging from 22 to 25.5 MHz. The median value of the amplitude of receiving signal was about 34 m V at the frequency band from 15 to 27 MHz.

This trace is longer than others because its length is about 7120 km, and such traces were not earlier used for radio communication through the ionosphere. In Figure 7.63 for the radio trace Beltsi – Khabarovsk the corresponding ionograms of DF – AF characteristics of probing signals are shown. The same results as were obtained for the shorter Beltsi – Dushanbe trace can be clearly seen from Figure 7.64a through c for the longer trace Beltsi – Khabarovsk.

We leave it to the reader to analyze simultaneously all three modes, their growth, and damping for different time intervals with different rates. We will only mention that the time intervals, where the corresponding working frequencies for multimode propagation are constant, are lesser than those observed for the shorter radio trace. Furthermore, for the longer trace the time dependence of the frequency interval, D f ¼ f max, 3 F 2 \u0001 f max, 4 F 2 , of the one-mode radio propagation along the radio trace, shown in Figure 7.65, has a tendency to achieve its maximum value of D f ¼ 2.0 – 2.5 MHz in a very narrow time interval (from 7:00 to 9:00). In other daytime intervals, the one-mode character of radio propagation is very difficult to implement. So, the radio communication channel Beltsi – Khabarovsk is not as stable as that for trace Beltsi – Dushanbe. The obtained results allow for outlining the essential role that plasma irregularities of various origins play in forming radio propagation ionospheric channels and in prediction of the key parameters of radio signals passing such ionospheric channels.

An increase in the efficiency of short-wave wireless communication, as was shown in Chapters 6 and 7, is impossible without continuous observation of nonlinear processes occurring in the perturbed ionospheric plasma and without taking into consideration radio traces parameters, i.e., the key parameters of ionospheric communication link. The parameters and dynamical processes occurring in the nonregular ionosphere are possible to investigate using modern radiophysical methods based on different devices and radio systems, such as optical devices, incoherent scatter radars, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), super- DARN, and ionosondes/digisondes, briefly described in Chapters 6 and 7. This chapter deals mainly with the operation characteristics of linear-frequency-modulated (LFM) radio facilities, called LFM ionosondes, which have been successfully used by the authors of this book for detailed study of the peculiarities of ionospheric propagation of LFM radio signals through the middle-latitude ionosphere under natural and artificial (e.g., man-made) conditions. The main goal of such signals processing was to study the problems concerning radio wave dispersion and short-wave wireless communications through the ionosphere. Before describing the main aspects of LFM-signals propagation and the operational character- istics of LFM ionosondes, we shall briefly summarize here the existing modern optical and radio systems that were successfully used for investigation of the main nonlinear characteristics of the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C008 Final Proof page 493 9.4.2008 5:04pm Compositor Name: BMan i 493"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"ionospheric plasma, its various instabilities, and the corresponding irregularities of plasma density at various latitudes of the ionosphere, which were described in detail in Chapters 6 and 7, without entering into a technical description of devices and systems. Here, we draw the reader ’ s attention to the possibilities of each corresponding device or system, again without going into technical details and schematic descriptions (which can be found in the referred literature) and describing only their operation characteristics and possibilities to investigate natural and artificial ionospheric phenomena. This is done to show the advantages and disadvan- tages of LFM ionosondes in regard to existing modern devices and systems. 8.1 Devices and Systems for Diagnostics of Ionospheric Phenomena 8.1.1 Optical Devices Optical devices, such as photometric and spectrometric devices, digital all-sky cameras, and TV complexes, were used to investigate the atmospheric and ionospheric parameters and processes, which, as was described in Chapter 6, were successfully used separately, or with radar systems and ionosondes, when operated regularly in many places over the world, such as Alaska, Arecibo, Arequipa, Fairbanks, New Zealand, Peru, Puerto Rico, Russia, and the North and South Poles [1 – 16]. For example, at Arecibo Incoherent Scatter Radar System (AISRS), an optical set of equipment includes two tilting-filter photometers, an Ebert – Fastie spectrometer with 1 m focal length, two pressure-scanned Fabry – Perot interferometers, each having 6 in. diameter etalon plates, and lidars. The set of optical devices used in investigations of the atmosphere and the ionosphere are presented in Table 8.1.

Specific filters are available at Arecibo to measure the airglow lines of various gases in the atmosphere, such as OH, O 2 ,O,O þ ,N,N 2 þ , H, He, and Na. Tilting-filter photometers assembled at AISRS have the following parameters: a single channel with bandwidth (at the level of 3 dB) of 0.3 to 1.0 nm (depending on choice of interference filter), and a programmable filter tilt controlled by stepping motors with a 10 8 tilt range or approximately 2.5 nm scan range with field-of-view varied between 0.25 8 and 5.0 8 , using selective field stops. Spectrometers are used to measure spectral blends of airglow emission bands at medium to high spectral resolution [3,4]. The Ebert – Fastie spectrophotometer arranged at AISRS has the following parameters: 1 m focal length with a bandwidth varied between 0.02 to 1.0 nm. A programmable wavelength scanning takes place via stepping motors with maximum scan range limited to 100 nm (anywhere between roughly 300 and 900 nm) with variable field-of-view, which varies between 0.1 8 and 9.0 8 . Interferometers are generally used to measure Doppler temperature and winds that originate in the E and F regions of the ionosphere, or to measure the spectral distribution and temporal variation of the hydrogen geocorona [5 – 7]. Fabry – Perot interferometers (minimum two are available) at AISRS have the following parameters: each interferometer is with 1.2 m focal length and 0.15 m clear apertures with typical bandwidth of 0.001 nm and free spectral range of 0.01 nm. The wavelength change takes place via pressure scanning using pistons and choice of scanning gas of Ar, CO 2 ,orSF 6 . The field-of-view depends on the choice of aperture size, but it is typically 0.25 8 for 630 nm observations. It also has the He – Ne frequency stabilized laser for linewidth calibration and thermal control of etalon and prefilter. The optical laboratories at AISRS have one Doppler – Rayleigh Lidar and two resonance fluorescence lidars. The Doppler – Rayleigh lidar is used to measure the Doppler shifts and widths of the spectrum of the laser light that is broadened and backscattered from the atmosphere and lower ionosphere from about 15 to 70 – 80 km of altitude and have the following parameters: Nd/YAG-based laser transmitter with the 24 W average power (with 100 MW in its peak) operating at 532 nm and at frequency of 40 Hz with the pulse width of 6 ns.

The results obtained by Doppler – Rayleigh lidar and resonance fluorescence Lidar are presented in Refs. [8 – 16]. Simultaneous imaging observations of several airglow layers are very important to study vertical propagation of atmospheric gravity waves, which is one of the main aspects in bubbles-structure generation in the equatorial layer F (see Chapter 6). Moreover, simultaneous observations of wind, temperature, and airglow images are needed to study the dynamics of short-period waves [17]. Figure 8.3 presents a schematic diagram and original view of one of the all-sky camera system. The all-sky imagers that are used in the new Finnish all-sky cameras are manufactured by KeoConsultants. Each imager has telecentric and nonvignetting optics, and the field of view of the fish-eye lens is 180 8 . The technical specifications of all-sky camera systems are presented in Table 8.2. The filter wheel can accommodate seven narrow bandwidth interference filters. In normal operation one filter holder is left free to be able to acquire nonfiltered images. Every station has three filters: green, blue, and red. The faint images are intensified before the final image is acquired by the CCD camera (b&w) and digitized by the frame grabber card of the station computer. This intensification allows shorter exposure times with less expensive CCD cameras, and typically an exposure takes 500 ms.

Incoherent scatter radar (ISR) is a technique for detecting and studying remote targets by transmitting a radio wave in the direction of the target, observing the reflection of the wave and providing the direct information about electron densities, line-of-sight (LOS) drift velocities, the height of ionospheric layers and ratio electron and ion temperatures, T e / T i [18 – 35]. They also provide indirect measurements of a number of additional parameters, the most reliable of which is the neutral wind below ionospheric altitudes of 130 km. The placements of incoherent scatter radars over the world are presented in Figure 8.5. Initially, ISR systems were located at Arecibo and at Jicamarca. The Arecibo [18 – 20] and Jicamarca radars are both monostatic in nature (the transmitter and receiver are co-located, see Chapters 6 and 7). The Jicamarca Radio Observatory was built in 1960 – 1961 by the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards (see Figure 8.6). The first incoherent scatter measurements at Jicamarca were made in 1961. The Jicamarca Radio Observatory is the premier scientific facility in the world for studying the equatorial ionosphere. As was mentioned in Chapters 6 and 7, the 49.92 MHz incoherent scatter radar is the principal facility of the observatory. The radar antenna consists of a large square array of 18,432 half-wave dipoles arranged into 64 separate modules of 12 \u0001 12 crossed half-wave dipoles. Each linear polarization of each module can be separately phased, and the modules can be fed separately or connected in almost any desired fashion. The isolation between the linear polarizations is very good, at least 50 dB, which is important for certain measurements. An additional antenna module with 12 \u0001 12 crossed dipoles was built in 1996. It is located 204 m to the west of the west corner of the main antenna and increases the lengths of the available interferometer base line to 564 m.

Each consists of 4 \u0001 2 half-wave dipoles mounted a quarter wavelength above a ground screen. The JULIA radar shares the main antenna of the Jicamarca Radio Observatory. As was mentioned in Chapter 6, JULIA is the abbreviation which stands for Jicamarca Unattended Long-term investigations of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere. It has an independent PC-based data acquisition system and makes use of some of the exciter stages of the Jicamarca radar along with the main antenna array. Because this system does not use the main high-power transmitters, it can operate for a long period of time. With a pair of 30 kW peak power pulsed transmitters driving a 290 \u0001 290 m modular antenna array, JULIA is a formidable MST/coherent scatter radar. It is uniquely suited for studying day-to-day and long-term variability of equatorial plasma irregularities and neutral atmospheric waves, which until now have only been investigated episodically or in campaign mode (description of the corresponding experiments see in Chapter 6). The Jicamarca Radio Observatory has the following measurement capabilities [21 – 23]: 1. From all existing ISR-type radars, the Jicamarca radar gives the most accurate measurements of drift velocity and electric field in the equatorial ionosphere (see Chapters 6 and 7). This is because of its unique equatorial geometry. Pointing perpendicular to the magnetic field makes it possible to measure line-of-sight (LOS) drift velocities with accuracy of the order of 0.5 m/s. Vertical F-region plasma drifts measured with such an accuracy allows obtaining information about zonal (e.g., equatorial) electric field with accuracy of about 12 m V/m. By studying the variation of drift velocity with altitude, up to 800 – 1000 km (or perhaps even higher), it is possible to study the electrodynamics of the entire low-latitude ionosphere, up to the anomaly latitudes, because of the electric field maps along the geomagnetic field lines. 2. The Jicamarca radar also has the unique capability to probe the ionosphere up to very high altitudes. Because of the long radar wavelength, the incoherent scatter is not affected by Figure 8.6 Jicamarca Radio Observatory.

Absolute F-region measurements of electron density are performed by the Jicamarca Radar using Faraday rotation. Electron and ion temperatures and ion compositions are obtained with a double pulse technique that generates the signal auto-correlation function (ACF). Pulses are transmitted using orthogonal polarization to reduce clutter. 4. The Jicamarca radar is the most sensitive radar in the world. Thus, it is capable of probing even the ‘‘ gap ’’ region near 45 – 50 km, partly because of its long wavelength and partly because it has the largest power-aperture product compared with any other VHF radars. The construction of the Arecibo Radio Observatory began in the summer of 1960. At present, the Arecibo Observatory has selected a data on ionospheric parameters, processes and phenomena over the 1966 – 2007 periods. We do not enter into a detailed description of Arecibo Radio Observatory because of the wide spectrum of devices and systems arranged there. The reader can find all technical details in the corresponding literature [18 – 20]. The next generation of incoherent scatter radars (ISR) comprise some of the most advanced radar systems in the world. The best among these are the Millstone Hill and Sondre Strømfjord [27] radars in the American sector and the EISCAT radars (the European Incoherent SCATter Association) in Northern Scandinavia [24 – 26,32,33]. Their potential regarding observations of thin structure of disturbed irregular ionosphere was shown in Chapters 6 and 7. The Millstone Hill Radar System consists of two antennas of 25 and 68 m radius, the operating frequencies for which are 1295 and 440 MHz, respectively. The 68 m dish is fixed in the vertical direction, whereas the 25 m dish has full steerability in the azimuth and elevation domains. The peak powers are 3 MW for the 68 m dish and 4 MW for the 25 m dish. Further, incoherent scatter radar, having a 27 m receiver dish and operating at a frequency of 1300 MHz, was developed at Stanford Research Institute, California, during the 1960s. This radar, also a steerable monostatic-pulsed facility like the smaller of the Millstone Hill system, was subsequently moved to Chatanika, Alaska, where it carried out some groundbreaking observations of the high-latitude ionosphere during the 1970s [27 – 30], before being moved again to Sondre Strømfjord, Greenland, where it is presently located. The detailed observations of the auroral ionosphere obtained by using this radar system were described in detail in Chapter 6. The EISCAT Radars, located in Northern Scandinavia and on the Svalbard Archipelago, are currently at the leading edge of incoherent scatter system development. EISCAT is an international collaboration involving the research groups from France, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Japan (which joined this association in 1996). EISCAT operates using three independent incoherent scatter radar systems: a tristatic UHF ‘‘ mainland ’’ system, with a transmit/ receiver system located at Tromsø, Norway, and receiver-only facilities located _ at Kiruna, Sweden, and Sodankylä, Finland. A new monostatic UHF radar (the EISCAT Svalbard Radar or ESR [26]) is operated close to Longyearbyen, Svalbard. In addition, a monostatic VHF radar is located at Tromsø. All of these radars are pulsed systems, capable of a very wide range of different transmitter modulations and with the most advanced signal processing capabilities for any system of this kind. The mainland UHF system commenced operations in 1981, and the first results from the VHF were obtained in 1985, which is described in detail in Chapters 6 and 7. The EISCAT Svalbard Radar began operations on March 15, 1996. The ESR is UHF radar operating at frequencies around 500 MHz Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C008 Final Proof page 501 9.4.2008 5:04pm Compositor Name: BMan i Optical and Radio Systems for Investigation & 501"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"with a 10 MHz bandwidth. The antenna is a Cassegrain-fed dish, similar to the dishes used by the mainland UHF radar system. All signal processing operations are performed digitally, so that much of the analogue hardware found for other types of ISR is not required for the ESR. A mainland UHF radar system operates at frequencies close to 933 MHz, with 16 different frequencies being available at 0.5 MHz intervals. The system comprises three fully steerable dishes of 32 m diameter. Transmission, reception, and signal sampling are controlled with microsecond accuracy and a dedicated digital correlator exists to form ACFs. A VHF-radar antenna is a cylindrical in the cross-section plane with the dimensions 120 \u0001 40 m. This antenna can only be moved in the elevation domain. Transmission and reception can also be carried out independently on the two halves of the antenna, allowing the VHF to provide a dual beam capability. The operating frequency of the VHF is 224 MHz, and the bandwidth availability is the same as in the UHF-radar (16 frequencies separated by 0.5 MHz). The new system, known as EISCAT – 3D, will retain the unique and powerful multistatic configuration of the mainland EISCAT UHF-system. Phased-array technology will be employed throughout. The design goals include more precise temporal and spatial resolution of the observed data, an extension of the instantaneous measurements of full-vector ionospheric drift velocities from a single point to the entire altitude range of the radar, and built-in interferometric capabilities. For optimal performance in conditions of low-density plasma, and for the middle-latitude ionosphere, a frequency in the high VHF band ( \u0003 240 MHz) will be used. The facility will provide high-quality ionospheric parameters measured in real time, as well as near-instantaneous response capabilities for researchers who need data to study unusual and unpredictable disturbances and phenomena occurring in high- and middle-latitude ionosphere.

The long-term ISR observations provide an extremely valuable data about the ionosphere. The EISCAT Scientific Association, as an international research organization operating with three geophysical research incoherent scatter radar systems, with an ionospheric heater located in Northern Scandinavia, has a data basis for the 1997 – 2007 period (these heating experiments were briefly discussed in Chapters 6 and 7). The EISCAT-Tromsø Radar system collected data during the period of 1984 – 2007; the St. Santin radar system (France, 44.6 N, 2.2 E), during 1973 – 1986; the Millstone Hill radar, from 1970 to 2007; the Arecibo radar, from 1966 to 2007, the Shigaraki middle and upper atmosphere radar (MU radar, Japan, 34.8 N, 136.1 E) from 1986 to 2003 [27], and the Sondrestrøm radar during 1990 – 2007 [31 – 35]. The scientific purpose of the measurements is to determine the radar operating modes. Different transmitted pulse schemes are used, depending on the need for range resolution, signal strength, time resolution, and frequency resolution. The rapid steering capability of the radar antenna allows to measure not just range, but also latitude and local time. Because of the many data-taking options, there are many ways to display data. Finishing this subsection, we present below only a few examples of the results obtained with Sondrestrøm radar (see also details on the Web site: http://isr.sri.com/iono/issdata.html). Thus, Figure 8.7 is a typical display of data from a 120 8 elevation scan in the plane of the magnetic meridian. The vertical axis shows altitude from ground level to 600 km and the horizontal axis shows 1000 km of ground range from the south (at the left of the image) to the north (at the right of the image). From left to right and from top to bottom, this figure shows color-shaped electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature and ion velocity in LOS conditions. Figure 8.8 shows the radar data from a single 3 min integration with the antenna pointing parallel to the local magnetic field. Some of the basic parameters derived from radar records are electron density ( N e ), ion drift velocity ( V i ), and electron and ion temperatures ( T e and T i ). All of these quantities are obtained as a function of distance along the radar beam. In Figure 8.9, the variation of electron density is shown as a function of altitude and time for a 2 h period in March of 1992. Because of the large scale heights in the F region, a 48 km pulse was used. This provided greater signal strength and higher time resolution. The variations in electron density (Figure 8.10a) and ion drift velocities (Figure 8.10b) as a function of latitude and time for a fixed altitude (300 km) over a 24 h period of observations during May, 1996 demonstrate the steering capability of the antenna and show measurements as a function of latitude. The radar sits under a doughnut-shaped band of data at 74 8 invariant latitude. The data is displayed north and south of the radar as the site rotates with Earth. 8.1.3 SuperDARN The SuperDARN network (super dual auroral radar network [36]) is an international system for the studying of the Earth ’ s upper troposphere and ionosphere, and their connections with the magnetosphere and outer space surrounding the Earth. Currently, it consists of a set of radars in the northern and in the southern hemispheres (see Table 8.4). The geometry of the corresponding traces of the SuperDARN international system in the northern and southern hemispheres is shown in Figure 8.11. The construction of all the radars is roughly identical, with some minor differences in antenna design to accommodate the physical conditions at the site (see Figure 8.12). Each of the radars has Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C008 Final Proof page 503 9.4.2008 5:04pm Compositor Name: BMan i Optical and Radio Systems for Investigation & 503"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"two arrays of antenna towers, the primary array consists of sixteen towers, and the secondary, interferometer array, consists of four towers. A phasing matrix attached to the antenna array is used to form the beam and to electronically steer the radar into one of 16 different beam directions. The radar transmits a short sequence of pulses in the HF-band and samples the echo signals arriving from the ionosphere (see details of the corresponding experiments in Chapter 6). A sequence of pulses, referred to as a multipulse sequence, is carefully designed to allow the Doppler characteristics of different targets to be determined at multiple ranges by using the auto- correlation function (ACF) of the received samples. Many sequences are transmitted and the calculated ACFs integrated over a period of several seconds to minimize the effect of noise. The final average ACF is then used to calculate back-scattered power, spectral width, and Doppler velocity of the plasma density irregularities in the nonregular ionosphere. In a standard operating mode, a multipulse sequence (of seven pulses) is transmitted and sampled to resolve 75 ranges with a 45 km separation [37 – 42]. The operation of a radar is controlled by the radar operating system (ROS), which is responsible for controlling the radar hardware, data processing, and data analysis and storage. A radar control program defines the overall mode of the radar, including the operating frequency, integration period, range separation, and the beam pattern used.

The advantages of the system are: an increasingly good coverage in both hemispheres, although the southern hemisphere coverage is less developed; direct, accurate measurement of an important coupling parameter; and the rapid temporal coverage. The greatest weakness of the system is that many of its problems are exacerbated during times of high geomagnetic activity (e.g., magnetic storms). Therefore, SuperDARN radars should be an important component of validation but should be used in conjunction with other data sources. 8.1.4 The Global Positioning System in Investigations of the Ionosphere The global positioning system (GPS) is the autonomy functional global navigation satellite system (GNSS).

GPS also provides a precise time reference used in Figure 8.11 Geometry of the radio paths for northern and southern hemispheres of the Super- DARN international system.

A GPS receiver must be locked on to the signal of at least three satellites to calculate a 2-D position (latitude and longitude) and track any movements of subscribers. With four or more satellites in view, the receiver can determine the 3-D position of any subscriber (e.g., latitude, longitude, and altitude). Once the user ’ s position has been determined, the GPS unit can calculate other information, such as speed, bearing, tracking, trip distance, distance to destination, sunrise and sunset time, and more. GPS satellites transmit the following radio signals: military — 1227.6 MHz, civilian L1 — 1575.42 MHz, civilian L2 — 1227.60 MHz, nuclear burst detection L3 — 1381.05 MHz, and telemetry on 2227.5 MHz (see details at http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/prog_gps_freq.html). Beginning from around 2008, civilians will have access to three GPS signals: L1 — 1575.42 MHz, L2 — 1227.60 MHz, and L5 — 1176.45 MHz [43]. A GPS radio signal contains three different bits of information: a pseudorandom code , ephemeris data, and almanac data . The pseudorandom code is simply a code that identifies which satellite transmits information. Ephemeris data tells the GPS receiver where each GPS satellite should be at any time throughout the day. Each satellite transmits ephemeris data showing the orbital information for that satellite and for every other satellite in the system. Almanac data , which is constantly transmitted by each satellite, contains important information about the status of the satellite ( ‘‘ healthy ’’ or ‘‘ unhealthy ’’ ), current date, and time. This part of the signal is essential for determining a position. The main factors that can degrade the GPS signal and thus affect the accuracy of subscriber positioning include the following: & Ionosphere and troposphere group delays due to effects of multipath occurring in the ionosphere (see Chapters 7 and 9). The GPS uses a special algorithm that calculates an average amount of delay to partially correct for this type of error. & Signal multipath fading [44], which increases the travel time of the signal, thereby causing errors (see definitions in Chapter 4). & Receiver clock errors occur because a ground-based receiver ’ s built-in clock is not as accurate as the atomic clocks onboard the GPS satellites. Therefore, it may have very slight timing errors. & Orbital errors are also known as ephemeris errors ; these are inaccuracies of the satellite ’ s reported location. & Number of satellites visible means that the more satellites a GPS receiver can ‘‘ watch, ’’ the better the accuracy. Some strong plasma irregularities may partly block signal reception, causing position errors or possibly no position reading at all. Moreover, ground-based obstructions (buildings, hills, sea, soil, etc.) can fully block records from satellites. Therefore, GPS units typically do not work in indoor, underwater, or underground environments. As will be shown in Chapter 9, the same difficulties with recording of signals occur during such natural disasters as magnetic storms. & Satellite geometry is referred to the relative position of the satellites at any given time. Ideal satellite geometry exists when the satellites are located at wide angles relative to each other. Poor geometry results when the satellites are located in a line or in a tight grouping. Typical GPS positioning accuracy was estimated as 15 m [43,44]. Typical GPS accuracy of user position is 3 – 5 m and the typical wide area augmentation system (WAAS) position accuracy is less than 3 m. Of course, these estimations are correct only in outdoor environments and for regular and nondisturbed ionospheric and atmospheric conditions.

Thus, the accuracy of the original GPS, which was subject to accuracy degradation under the Selective Availability Program (in the United States), is 100 m. Similar satellite-based differential systems were developed in other countries. In Asia, there is the Japanese Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), whereas Europe has the Euro Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS). Eventually, GPS users around the world will have access to precise position data using these and other compatible systems. The Russian GLONASS is a global navigation satellite system in the process of being restored to full operation. The European Union ’ s Galileo positioning system is a next-generation of GNSS in its initial deployment phase, scheduled to be operational in 2010. China has indicated it may expand its regional Beidou navigation system into a global system at the same time. India ’ s IRNSS, a next-generation GNSS is in the developmental phase and is scheduled to be operational only around 2012. GPS ionospheric sounding is a powerful tool for remote sensing of the ionosphere. GPS radio signals L1 and L2 have provided a unique opportunity to study short-scale-length variations in total electron content (TEC) along the signal path in the presence of ionospheric irregularities and scintillations caused by these irregularities (GPS-based ionospheric measurement can measure TEC variations smaller than 10 \u0002 2 TEC units) [45 – 47]: isolated ionospheric disturbances [48]; simulation of the ionospheric disturbances caused by earthquakes, explosions, cyclones, and tsunamis [49,50]; variations of atmospheric water vapor [51]; ground complex permittivity [52]; processors of horizontal and vertical crustal deformation [53]; influences of the ionosphere on satellite communications and satellite measurements, and so on. Effects of magnetic storms will be discussed separately in Chapter 9 as the most evident example of influence of natural disasters on land – satellite communication. Hajj and Romans (1998) demonstrated the use of GPS in obtaining profiles of electron density and other geophysical variables such as temperature, pressure, and water vapor in lower ionosphere. This work presents a set of ionospheric profiles obtained from GPS/MET with the Abel inversion technique. The effects of the ionosphere on the GPS signal during occultation, such as bending and scintillation, was also examined [45]. Electron density profiles obtained from GPS/MET are compared with the ones obtained from the Parameterized Ionospheric Model (PIM) and with ionosonde and incoherent scatter radar measurements. Statistical comparisons of N m F 2 values obtained from GPS/MET and ionosondes indicate that these two types of measurements agree with accuracy of about 20%. A latitudinal-distributed network of GPS receivers has been operating within Colombia, Peru, and Chile; sufficient latitudinal separation for measuring of the absolute TEC at both crests of the equatorial anomaly is presented in Ref. [47]. The network also indicated the latitudinal extention of GPS scintillations and TEC depletions. We present here only a characteristic example of measurements carried out in [47]. Thus, Figure 8.13 shows TEC depletions measured at several sites, using signals from three different GPS satellites. On September 7, 2001, TEC depletion was observed at all stations except Antuco. In addition, the receiver at Santiago suffered a loss of signals caused by the strong fading which was likely associated with TEC depletions. Figure 8.13 (top graph) shows the passage of a TEC depletion, 35 TEC units (10 16 el/m2) in depth, detected by the receiver at Bogota between 20:00 and 20:20 LT. Below the TEC curve is displayed with the scintillation index (called an S4-index; see definitions in Chapter 9), which was calculated on-line using the signal received from each of GPS satellites. The gray shadowing indicates the times when the S4-index is above the noise level, and the satellite elevation is above 20 8 . The TEC depletion illustrated by the top graph is accompanied by high levels of GPS scintillations (S4 ¼ 0.5) on both the east and west walls of the depletion.

At the Iquitos receiver, strong values of the scintillation index (S4 ¼ 0.5) were observed only on the west wall and weaker scintillations on the east side (S4 ¼ 0.25) of the depletion. Due to smaller angle of observation, the receiver at Iquitos observed the same TEC depletion that was obtained at Bogota receiver with an apparent wider width. The authors of Ref. [47] used the transit time of TEC depletions between the Ancon receiver and Cuzco receiver of about 65 min, separated by a 550 km range in the magnetic east – west direction. They also estimated a 140 m/s zonal drift. Scintillations at Cuzco receiver (the third graph from the top) were of less intensity, due to a smaller density that commonly prevails near the magnetic equator when the anomaly is fully developed. At Arequipa receiver, the lowest value within the TEC depletion was observed at 20:08 UT. This is the same time that the minimum TEC was detected at Bogota receiver (see the top graph), which is located 225 km westward and several hundred kilometers northward from Arequipa receiver. This apparent discrepancy can be explained if we allow the bubbles to tilt westward at altitudes above the F-region peak (effects of bubbles are described in detail in Chapter 6). The westward tilt will make the part of the TEC depletions that extend to higher latitudes to appear at slightly later times in a way similar to the plasma plumes seen with coherent radars. The Copiapo receiver (the second graph from the bottom) detected a 30-TEC-unit depletion spanning between 20:30 and 21:10 LT. 8.2 Diagnostics of the Nonregular Ionosphere by LFM Ionosondes 8.2.1 Developments of LFM Ionosondes in the Historical Perspective In the recent decades in different regions of the world, active scientific studies of the ionospheric physics and ionospheric radio propagation were carried out with local ground-based networks, called LFM Ionosondes , which also have been started intensively for the selection of the optimal ionospheric radio channels (see Chapter 7). This relates to the fact that LFM ionosondes have advantages compared to pulse ionosondes, such as high defense against noise and high electromag- netic compatibility (the radiated power is only about 2 to 100 W), as well as smaller dimensions of the facility. Special signals with LFM were first used for the purpose of radiolocation [54] and then, in 1954, for the sounding of the ionosphere in regions with high absorption, about 80 – 90 dB. Later, in 1962, such signals were used for investigation of the D -layer of the ionosphere [55 – 57]. Theoretical aspects of radiation and recording of pulse LFM signals have found their application after creation of methods and approaches dealing with generation of LFM signals. The first tests showed immediately high efficiency of LFM ionosondes for the vertical and oblique sounding of the ionosphere [61]. In Ref. [62], the experimental ionospheric sounding, vertical and/or oblique, is presented using the frequency range from 600 kHz to 2 MHz. The equipment employs a linear frequency sweep transmission generated by direct synthesis from a frequency standard. An identical sweep is used for demodulation at the receiver. Sounding records were obtained at night-time periods along 2000 km radio paths. Radiated power was ranged from 25 to 250 W. A good time delay resolution, together with suppression of interfering signals, makes it possible ionospheric sounding with a greatly improved quality of transmission of any information at large distances using low energy of the transmitting signals.

The study of the ionosphere with these systems allowed to obtain a set of original results described in Refs. [64,65]. Further, great success in creation of LFM ionosondes was achieved by Barry Research Co. in the United States, the typical models of ionosondes of which for vertical sounding (VS) and oblique sounding (OS) of the ionosphere, VOS – 1 [66], RCS – 2 [67], and RCS – 4 [68], allowed to obtain ionograms of high quality using very low radiation power, of about 5 – 10 W only. At the present time, this company produces LFM transivers XCS-6 and TST 4280. During the period from 1980 to 2000, in different regions of the world, high-effective systems were realized for investigation of the ionosphere, as well as developments of new methods of diagnostics of short-wave ionospheric radio channels, including prediction of the working frequen- cies (called maximum useful frequencies , MUF, see Chapter 7) of radio communication links and also service of short-wave over-horizon radars [57]. Modification of the standard LFM ionosonde of Barry Research Co. (see Refs. [71,72]) by introducing multichannel recording with digital regis- tration and signal processing allowed creation of a monostatic ionosonde of vertical sounding with registration of arriving angles, with estimation of polarization and Doppler speed of displacement points of wave reflection. A bistatic LFM ionosonde was constructed in England to study dispersion distortions of wideband signals on short-length radio traces [73,74]. A set of experiments at the one-hop traces in the polar and equatorial ionosphere was carried out to investigate the effects of ionospheric irregularities on radio scattering phenomena [75]. TCI/BR Communications has carried out a global experiment using 16 LFM ionosondes to provide and secure radio communication at the short-frequency band. They used data obtained from 30 radio traces of oblique sounding [76]. The same European project was made at two radio traces using BR Communications ionosondes [77,78]. For the study of ‘‘ thin ’’ ionospheric effects in the propagation of short-wave radio signals, the research groups Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA, United Kingdom) created a high-quality ionosonde for oblique sounding, called Improved Radio Ionospheric Sounder (IRIS) [79,80]. In 1992, at South-West Research Institute (San Antonio, Texas), a small multichannel interferometer was developed on the basis of an LFM ionosonde for measurements of group delay and angles-of-arrival in the azimuthal and elevation local planes [81]. Over-horizon radars of short- wave frequency band also used LFM signals for ionospheric diagnostics and to test the accuracy of ionospheric models, as well as conditions of the ocean surface and ocean flows [82 – 85]. The Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation created in Australia a wide net of ionosondes of oblique sounding to investigate the low-latitude ionosphere and to ensure a stable operation of an over-horizon short-wave radio locator [86 – 88]. A net of LFM ionosondes of the IPS-71 type, produced by the Australian company KEL Aerospace Pty. Ltd. and situated on the territory of Australia, includes ionosondes for vertical and oblique sounding of the ionosphere. Such ionosondes have the velocity of frequency changes of 500 kHz/s (see definitions below). Studies of the peculiarities of the low-latitude ionosphere above the Asian-Pacific-Ocean region [88] are carried out using LFM ionosondes developed by Australian Defense Science and Technology Organization (DSTO). In Ref. [87], a technique is presented for using the measurements of the time-varying narrow- band (10 kHz) component-transfer function of a high-frequency (HF) frequency-modulated (FM) continuous wave, transmitted at 15.085 MHz, and its decomposition into propagation modes. One event occurring at a 5244 km transmission path, which exhibits flat fading (see definitions in Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C008 Final Proof page 514 9.4.2008 5:04pm Compositor Name: BMan i 514 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Chapter 4) within the 10 kHz bandwidth, is analyzed and found to exhibit severe phase distortion due to multipath. A component-transfer function for an individual propagation mode was also obtained in Ref. [87] using 2-D filtering of the signal in the joint Doppler frequency (DF) and time delay (TD) domain, resulting in a significant reduction in phase distortion. In the former Soviet Union, an ionosonde was first constructed for vertical sounding (VS) of the ionosphere that used quasi-continuous FM signals [57,89]. Then, ionosondes for VS of the ionosphere were created on the basis of synthesizers of continuous LFM signals and their different modifications for VS and OS of the ionosphere [90 – 96]. With their help, the studies of frequency effects of modification of the ionosphere with powerful short-wave signals were made, as well as long-term investigations of the conditions of propagation of continuous LFM signals at radio traces of various orientations and lengths [97 – 100]. Now, in Russia, an experimental net of LFM ionosondes is operated for oblique sounding (OS) of the ionosphere, the software – hardware methodology of which was developed by several groups [57,98 – 100], including a group working at Moldavian Radio Observatory [97,100]. To secure a stable communication at the short-wave band between countries of NATO, a global net of LFM ionosondes over the world was arranged based on the system AN/TRQ-35(V) (Tactical Frequency Sounding System), which includes 77 transmitters [57]. The AN/TRQ-35(V) is an ionospheric sounding system that easily operates with ionospheric propagation statistics on the real-time basis. The system is used to minimize outages related to unpredictable changes of ionospheric characteristics and conditions. It is intended to improve frequency management and assignments of frequencies for HF communications systems and, finally, results in more effective and efficient utilization of the HF spectrum, producing more reliable HF communication with improved grade of service (GoS). Depending on the method of utilization of LFM ionosondes, it is possible to divide them into LFM ionosondes of vertical sounding (VS), oblique sounding (OS), and back-oblique sounding (BOS) [57]. Ionosondes of VS are used mostly to monitor the ionosphere above the local place of the ground-based diagnostic system, as well as to study physical processes occurring during natural and artificial perturbations of the ionosphere [101]. The ionosondes of OS are used mostly to study the ionosphere along the trace of short-wave radio propagation under various geographic conditions in adaptive communication systems and to secure frequency during selection of the optimal radio channel [82,101,104]. Ionosondes of BOS are used to study propagation conditions in the ionosphere [83 – 85] and to investigate conditions of sea surface in large spatial regions, as well as in the systems of frequencies secured in short-wave radio communication channels and over- horizon short-wave radars [86]. 8.2.2 Operating Principles of LFM Ionosondes At present, there is no strict self-consistent theory of propagation of extremely wideband signals of LFM ionosondes in the ionospheric plasma as a dispersive medium. Only a few approximate approaches of mathematical description of operational functions of LFM ionosonde were devel- oped, accounting for specific features of processing of registered signals by the receiver, as well as based on well-known behavior of narrowband signals in the ionosphere [57]. The influence of dispersion distortions in the ionosphere on the structure of the complicated signals (including LFM-signals) during VS and OS of the ionosphere was analyzed using theoretical frameworks described in Refs. [100,107 – 110].

Let us suppose that at the transmitting channel of an ionosonde the transmitter radiates a continuous signal with linear modulation of its frequency: u T t ðÞ¼ u 0 cos v S t þ b t 2 = 2 \u0001\u0002 ,(8 : 1) where u 0 is the signal amplitude, v S ¼ 2 p f S is the initial circular frequency, b ¼ 2 p _ f is the velocity of changes of the circular frequency. Then, the current radiated frequency, f ¼ d ( v S t þ b \u0004 t 2 /2)/2 p d t , changes according to linear low at the range from f S to f E with the velocity which has fixed values in the limits from 25 kHz/s to 1 MHz/s depending of the regime of sound and the problem that is being solved. Usually, f S \u0003 2 – 3 MHz and f E \u0003 15 – 30 MHz, and therefore the radiated signal has period of several minutes and occupies a frequency bandwidth of several tens megahertz, i.e., it is extremely wideband. We also suppose that the LFM signal formed by the transmitter arrives at the input of the radio channel, containing the receiving – transmitting antenna-fider devices; the input of the receiver and the land ionosphere waveguide have all elements of the channel coinciding with each other in the whole frequency band [ f S , f E ]. Let us assume for simplicity that in Equation 8.1 u 0 ¼ 1.

The result of this product contains low-frequency (difference between frequencies) and high-frequency (sum of frequencies) components. The latter component can be then filtered with low-frequency filter. From the continuous signal of low frequency, using the corresponding analysis, the sets with period T D are selected by the ‘‘ window ’’ w ( t ) with time duration around their centers of t k ¼ t 0 þ ( k \u0002 1/2) T D , k ¼ 1, N . We should note that the window in the time domain with time period T D corresponds to the segment of the input LFM signal with the frequency band of D f D ¼ _ f \u0004 T D . Therefore, the frequency band of this segment has to be not larger than the frequency band of the receiver ’ s selector. Then the selected sets of the initial LFM signal enter at the input of the spectrum analyzer. The result of its work is described by the Fourier transform, where the spectrum of the k -selected set has the form: S k ( V ) ¼ S k ( F ) ¼ 1 4 p ð 1 \u00021 ð 1 0 w ( t \u0002 t k ) h ( t ) cos b 2 ( t \u0002 t o ) 2 \u0002 b t ( t \u0002 t o ) \u0003\u0004 e i V t d t d t ,(8 : 3) where V ¼ 2 p F .

According to Equation 8.5, it is close to the term describing spectrum of the window of selections, W ( b y ). In this case, it is also supposed that the lower limit of the frequency band V 0 , measured by the analyzer exceeds the frequency band of the window spectrum. In these definitions, the expression for spectrum of the k -selected set is the same as that for the response of the radio channel against any equivalent signal b ( y ) with the spectrum B ( v ). According to Equation 8.5 the time duration of the pulse signal b ( y ) is defined by the frequency resolution of the spectrum analyzer d V and by the velocity of frequency changes according to the formula dt ffi d V / b .

In the short-wave range in most cases such a spectrum can be considered narrowband. In the conditions mentioned here the scheme of modeling the characteristics of continuous LFM signals when sounding the ionosphere is reduced to a simple problem of propagation with narrowband signals. It is well known [112,113] that when sounding the ionosphere with narrowband pulse signals, several responses of the radio channel are registered by the receiver with the frequency band equal to the frequency band of the signal (in conditions of full coincidence). As a rule, H ( v ) can be presented as a sum of transferred functions H l ( v ), corresponding to different modes of propagation: H ( \u0002 v ) ¼ H * ( v ) ¼ X l H * l ( v ) ¼ X l H l ( v ) jj e \u0002 i v P l ( v ) = c ,(8 : 6) where P l ( v ) is a phase trajectory of the l -th mode at frequency v .

Within the limits of the examined band, the value j H l ( v ) j can be taken as constant, and the function P l ( v ) as a smooth function.

From these current derivations it follows that without accounting for frequency dispersion (i.e., for the second-order term in the expansion (Equation 8.8)), the nondistorted signals are registered at the output of the spectrum analyzer.

Therefore, the form of pulses is defined by the form of the window w ( t ) of the spectrum analyzer. The position of the center of l -th signal at the axis V is determined from the constraint y 0 ¼ t l and corresponds to the frequency V l ¼ bt l \u0002 t 0 ðÞ or F l ¼ _ f ( t l \u0002 t 0 )(8 : 12) Expression 8.12 gives the relation between time delay of the registered signal of mode l and the variable of the analyzer V (or the difference F ), and permits the interval of group delays of interest to coincide with the working band of the analyzer [ F 0 , F max ] by using the corresponding selection of the parameter t 0 . To obtain record of all modes of the signal with delays t 1 ,..., t n , it is necessary that the frequency band of the receiver exceeds the value D F ¼ _ f ( t n \u0002 t 1 ). For example, if ( t n \u0002 t 1 ) ¼ 5ms and _ f ¼ 100 kHz = s, then D F ¼ 500 Hz. This means that for the given velocity of rearrangements of the frequency at the receiver, its working frequency band of 500 Hz corresponds to the time window, which equals 5 ms. The spectrum analyzer divides the band of the receiver into m equal subbands of value d F . The latter characterizes errors in estimating the time of group delay, which is defined by the time of the equivalent pulse, dt , and has to be smaller than the expected minimum difference of signal delays for different modes of propagation. By using fast Fourier transform for derivation of the signal spectrum at the difference frequency, the corresponding quadrature components should be outlined. Using these components, the amplitude and phase spectra can be calculated. The amplitude spectrum is used for performance of the corresponding ionograms. Index k in formula 8.11 determines the current frequency v k ,at which the characteristics of LFM signal of mode l are calculated. Changes of the index k from 1 to N , correspond to the frequency of the LFM signal running along the whole frequency band used for sounding. As an illustration, in Figure 8.15 the experimental spectrum amplitude j S k ( t ) j is presented during sounding on the trace Ioshkar – Ola – Balti (described in Chapter 7) on December 10, 1991. The group path P ¼ c t is arranged along the axis of delays. The registered signals correspond to bottom and top rays of one-, two- and three-hope modes of propagation. The graphical imaging of the cross-section of j S k ( V ) j¼j S k ( t ) j at the given level presents an actual ionogram of oblique sounding. The dependence j S k ( t ) j at the time t k presents the amplitude relief of the signal at the current frequency f k for all the registered modes of propagation. In a number of studies [93,107,115], the radiated continuous LFM signal was performed in the frequency domain (unlike the above described approach operating with signal in the time domain). For this case, the method of stationary phase was used, giving a good approximation for the real spectrum. In our further discussions we suppose that the obtained solution of the problem of propagation of the harmonic signal in the ionosphere is found and known. Then, it defines the transfer function of the ionosphere containing the amplitude-frequency characteristic (AFC) and phase-frequency characteristic (PFC) for the wave frequency under consideration. If so, the product of radiated signal and the transfer function of the ionosphere finally gives the spectrum of the signal at the input of the receiver, and the Fourier transform of this product gives us the desired signal. Further mathematical derivations of the signal ca n be done according to the scheme described above. As a result of such an approach, we can obtain anal ytical dependences for the amplitude spectrum on difference frequency accounting for dispersion in propagation of radio signal in the ionosphere.

For typical values of T p ¼ 50 m s we easily estimate D f p \u0003 20 kHz, i.e., the band of a pulse ionosonde is much bigger than the band D F of an LFM ionosonde. All noises from radio stations can be hit simultaneously inside the bandwidth of the impulse ionosonde, and practically cannot be rejected from this wide bandwidth. The receiver of an LFM ionosonde has much less frequency band D F (curve 2, Figure 8.16b) and selects signals from radio stations continuously, step by step, transforming them into impulse noise, the spectral density of which is sufficiently small and which can be rejected by several technical methods, namely, either by frequency rejecting at the input filter of the receiver, or by time rejecting of the signal at difference frequency. If, for example, at the input of the receiver the noise signal arrives in a form of: u n ( t ) ¼ u 0 cos v n t ,(8 : 13) then, after product operation with the signal (Equation 8.1) in the receiver, this signal has the form: u n ( t ) ¼ u 0 cos ( v n \u0002 v S ) t \u0002 b 2 \u0004 t 2 \u0006\u0007 : (8 : 14) At the same time, the difference signal during the time T can be assumed to be harmonic, that is, its power is concentrated on the element d F . During the time T D the noise power P n is distributed along the band D f D in such a manner that the spectral density of its power equals: N n ¼ P n D f D : (8 : 15) Hence, at the element d F will be concentrated the noise density recorded at the output of the receiver, which equals: ( P n ) exit ¼ P n D f D \u0004 d F ¼ P n B D ,(8 : 16) where B D ¼ D f D = d F ¼ D f D T D is the basic parameter of the signal with noise. In this case, the ratio of signal power to noise power at the input and output of the receiver is described by the following formula [117]: P sign P n \u0006\u0007 exit ¼ B D P sign P n \u0006\u0007 ent : (8 : 17) Thus, during broadcasting activity and the influence of noise arriving at the input of LFM receiver, we see, according to (8.17), that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the receiver exceeds the SNR at the input of the receiver in B D times (for B D \u0007 1), which allows to decrease significantly the transmitted power of the LFM ionosonde. It should be pointed out that using the narrowbeam antenna grid with the dimensions of 2.5 km, the ionograms of oblique sounding can be easily obtained at power of radiation of the order of units of milliwatt [118,119] (see the results of experiments discussed at the end of Chapter 7).

The transmitting part of an LFM ionosonde can be built on the basis of industry-produced broad-band power amplifiers and elaborated program-run synthesizers of LFM signals [66 – 72]. The main require- ment for the transmitting part is the spectral purity of the formed LFM signal and the frequency stability of the LFM signal synthesizer reference generator, which must be not worse than 10 \u0002 8 Hz. (Brief instability leads to the appearance of mistakes in LFM signal synthesis and to deviation from linear law which drives the transmitter; long instability leads to deviation of frequency absolute values of the forming LFM signal.) Frequency range of an LFM ionosonde is determined by the length of usable radio-routes. In years with high solar activity, maximum-suitable frequencies can reach 40 MHz; therefore, an LFM ionosonde should have a frequency range not less than 2 7 40 MHz. Radiation power of a power amplifier should not be too big so as not to interfere with other short-wave communication systems. Usually, a transmitter ’ s power should not exceed 100 W. The requirements for the receiver bandwidth of an LFM ionosonde are contradictory. On one hand, it should be big enough to transmit without distortion all the signal propagation modes; on the other hand, an increase of the bandwidth leads to an increase of noise that gets into the receiver tract and to its masking of the useful signal. The width of the receiving tract band pass is closely connected with the speed of LFM signal frequency change and with the range of the signal mode group delay. The necessary range of group delay is calculated taking into account radio-route length with some reserve, which compensates the influence of the instabilities of the receiving and transmitting tracts, temporary lack of synchronization of the timescales of the receiving and transmitting parts, and daily and annual variations of group delays under the influence of the Sun radiation. When sounding on short and middle radio-routes, the calculated range of group delays does not exceed 3 – 4 ms. Thus, when using an LFM signal with the frequency change speed d f = d t ¼ 100 kHz/s, the receiving tract transition band should be not less than 500 Hz. When working in an automatic regime on different radio routes with a large difference in the levels of received signals, insufficient dynamic range of the system can influence the quality of received ionograms. A signal that exceeds the boundary of a dynamic range may cause distortions in nonlinear circuits of the receiving tract (frequency changers, amplifiers). The problem can be solved by using variable step-switching attenuators connected at the input of the radio-receiving installation. An LFM ionosonde should work on both long (more than 3000 km) and short (up to units in kilometers) radio traces. This requires the use of at least two antenna systems for long and short radio traces and of antenna commutators for their quick switching. To ensure the possibility of receiving signals of the world net of LFM ionosondes, the receiving antennas should have a circle radiation pattern in a horizontal plain. The required exactness of synchronization of the timescales of the receiving and transmitting parts of an LFM ionosonde (not worse than 20 – 30 m s), can be reached by constructing a subsystem of exact time on the basis of GPS receivers and rubidium frequency standards. A frequency standard can also serve as a source of oscillation for the LFM signal synthesizer. The parameters of an LFM signal formed by the synthesizers in the receiving and transmitting parts of the complex should meet high requirements: a wide range of frequency change, high linearity of the frequency change law, spectral purity, and coherence. LFM signal synthesizers constructed by using the method of direct digital synthesis answer such requirements. The choice of the LFM signal frequency change speed is defined by the necessary frequency resolution and delay as well as by the necessity of compatibility with the LFM ionosondes of the world net. It should be noted that by changing the speed of the LFM signal frequency change, Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C008 Final Proof page 522 9.4.2008 5:04pm Compositor Name: BMan i 522 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"the width of the signal spectrum of difference frequency grows, too, which requires an increase of the receiver transmission band, that is, of the transmission in signal-to-noise ratio. The positive factor here is that, in this case, the influence on the communication systems working in decameter wave band (DKB) are decreased. A decrease of the sounding speed, on the contrary, improves signal-to-noise ratio, reduces the receiver transmission band, but increases the duration of the sounding session, and increases the influence on DKB of the communication system. Most transmitters of the world net of LFM ionosondes use the LFM signal change speed of 100 kHz/s, when the receiver transmission band is sufficiently wide within the limits of permissible duration of the sounding d which constitutes 280 s when sounding in the range 2 – 30 MHz. The technical characteristics of LFM ionosondes for vertical, oblique, and vertical-oblique sounding of the ionosphere are represented in Table 8.5. With the help of LFM ionosondes, extensive data on the condition of natural and artificially disturbed ionosphere were received, formation peculiarities of the field of short-wave signals on middle-latitude, sub-auroral, transequatorial routes of different length were investigated. The high effectiveness of using LFM sondes as part of adaptive short-wave radio communication system was experimentally shown. In order to implement the possibilities of using LFM sounds when solving fundamental and applied problems in the field of ionosphere physics and radio wave propagation, it is necessary to widen the world net of LFM sondes and to place them, first of all, in high-latitude regions, where the effects of the sun – Earth connection in the system of the magnetosphere – ionosphere atmos- phere are most strongly manifested. Additionally, the placement of LFM sondes in the Arctic and in the Antarctic regions will allow us to receive in real-time regime information about the conditions of radio wave propagation in regions strongly exposed to the influence of magneto-ionospheric disturbances.

Further development of hardware – software devices of an LFM complex presupposes inclusion into the database of geophysical information received from Sputniks in an on-line regime and the exchange of sounding results over the Internet. Thus, we can quite definitely assert that the development of an LFM ionosondes network, with software improvement and its inclusion into a single world network of LFM ionosondes will allow us to control and forecast on a new technological level the effects of space weather that play such an important role in life support on the Earth. 8.3 Monitoring of Ionospheric Communication Channels At present, there is an increasing need for information transmission systems via ionosphere communication channels and for signal processing devices, with emphasis on their reliability and productivity [120,121]. It is impossible to ensure corresponding radio-channel parameters and normal conditions of information transmission under quickly changing conditions of ionosphere without regular monitoring of radio channels in real-time scale and without using operative and long-time forecast of the conditions of radio wave propagation. Included in operative forecast is the prediction of short-wave signals ranging from some minutes to one hour. With regular monitoring of radio channels, the received information gives us the possibility for solving the following multiparameter tasks: defining the number of propagation modes; defining the optimal operating frequencies of single-mode channels; determining the possible speed of information transmission; and calculating the variation of each mode ’ s amplitudes and phases, etc. Modern methods of long-term forecast of the conditions of ionosphere radio-wave propagation err in \u0003 20%. And in transition hours, when the parameters of the ionosphere change most sharply, the error increases up to 50% and even more. The reason of relatively big errors in long-term forecast is the changeableness of the flow of radiation from the sun from day to day and the complexity of the ionosphere reaction to geomagnetic perturbations [57]. In this connection, along with perfection of the methods of long-term forecast, considerable attention is paid to the methods of direct monitoring of the parameters of an ionospheric radio channel using different systems of oblique and vertical-oblique sounding, and to operative forecast of the conditions of radio-wave propagation. Introduction of the first systems of direct monitoring which worked in impulse regime, Pathfinder [122], CHEC [123], CURTS [124,125], increased considerably communica- tion reliability. In particular, the operation of the CURTS system showed that communication reliability has grown up to 90%. To monitor the ionospheric channels of short-wave communications, it is necessary to create a net of experimental – technological radio routes. Such a net can be created on the basis of operating radio routes, the equipment of which needs to be complemented with equipment for the diagnos- tics of radio communication channels and with corresponding software. The equipment for the diagnostics of a communication channel should measure the characteristics of the radio channel quality when transmitting test communications, record information about the changes of the ionospheric parameters, and suggest an optimal variant of uninterrupted work of the radio channel. The use of small-power LFM ionosondes for oblique sounding of the ionosphere marks considerable progress in the development of the methods of the ionosphere channels of short- wave communication diagnostics. The problem of the ionosphere monitoring is solved with acceptable mass and dimension characteristics of the equipment, less energy consumption, and Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C008 Final Proof page 524 9.4.2008 5:04pm Compositor Name: BMan i 524 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"better electromagnetic compatibility. The availability of LFM ionosondes of oblique sounding on diagnostic radio routes allows to synthesize ionograms for operating radio routes, estimate the expected quality of radio communication, and effectively manage frequency resources. It reduces by half the chance of code error [126]. And the most important factor is that it becomes possible to use antennas working in the system of the operating radio routes to diagnose the channel. Diagnostic radio routes of different length (from 5 to 10,000 km and more), and orientation can be used to control the parameters of ionosphere radio channels. At present, LFM ionosondes are widely used in adaptive systems of short-wave communication for dynamic control of operating frequencies. Because of its adaptivity, the system automatically supports the quality of short-wave radio communication during a communication session by changing the main parameters of transmission in accordance with the change of the current ionosphere condition. Such an approach to constructing adaptive systems of short-wave communication with the use of LFM ionosondes allows to obtain data which is used for operative forecasting and extrapolation of information about ionospheric radio wave propagation to other regions. The main task of the equipment monitoring the ionosphere radio channel consists in the choice and forecasting of optimal operative frequencies of communication by the results of the analysis of ionosphere radio wave propagation conditions and of the noise situation (conditions, environment) for the given radio channel. The radio channel monitoring system should consist of an LFN ionosonde, an analyzer of short-wave radio channel loading, and a packet of applied software on the choice of the main operating frequencies for the communication system. Different methods can be used for radio channel monitoring. Here is an example of one method of short-wave radio channel monitoring, which includes the following stages: 1. Transmission of an informational communication by the transmitter of a communication system on the frequency chosen according to the data of long-term forecasting (in this case, the optimal operating frequency can be chosen close to the maximum of the used frequency (from the available resource) by the criterion of minimum noise level in radio channel with a set band) 2. Oblique LFM sounding of the ionosphere in the band \u0003 3 – 40 MHz 3. Analysis of the loading of the communication channel with noise and setting of optimal operating communication frequency from available resource (a strategy of the choice of the optimal operating frequency consists in defining the frequency range with maximum signal- to-noise ratio on condition that, in the region of multimode propagation, the amplitude of one mode exceeds the amplitude of another mode by not less than 10 dB) 4. Transmission of information via the operating radio channel on the optimal operating frequency chosen in the process of operative forecast In all the cases it is necessary to define the percentage of error in the information communication. To compare the effectiveness of a connected radio line work on long-term forecast and on operative forecast we shall give here experiment data represented in the work [127]. Tests of the monitoring system based on LFM sound were done in October 1990 on the middle-latitude radio trace Alma-Ata – Moscow with a length of 3000 km. The same antennas were used for the transmission/reception of the LFM signal and for informational communication, which excluded the necessity of recalculating the energetics of connected and sounding radio traces. The power of informational communication received two values: 5 and 100 W. In this case, the optimal operating frequency was chosen close to the maximum of the used frequency (from the Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C008 Final Proof page 525 9.4.2008 5:04pm Compositor Name: BMan i Optical and Radio Systems for Investigation & 525"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"available resource) by the criterion of minimum noise level in the channel with a band of 3 kHz. The results of the tests are given in Figure 8.17a (daylight, evening hours — 08.00 – 20.00 LT Moscow) and in Figure 8.17b (night, morning hours — 20.00 – 08.00 LT Moscow) in the form of distribution histograms of the difference of communication operation frequencies D f ¼ f 1 \u0002 f 2 , where f 1 was the frequency chosen for a long-term forecast, and f 2 the frequency chosen for an operative forecast. As it is seen from Figure 8.17, in daylight hours, the difference of frequency D f > 0, i.e., the frequency chosen by a long-term forecast, is higher than the one chosen by the operative forecast. In this case, for the long-term forecast, the work of connected short-wave radio line was carried out on frequencies close to maximum observed frequencies; for the operative forecast, it was done on frequencies with maximum signal-to-noise ratio, which in most cases fall on the double-shock mode of propagation. In night and morning hours, when the maximum observed frequency was considerably decreasing (by 10 – 15 MHz) and the range of the short wave signal passing was narrowing, the distribution of frequencies difference was biased to negative values, i.e., the operating frequency chosen by the operative forecast was higher than the one chosen by the one- term forecast. Such a choice of optimal operating frequencies is conditioned by the necessity of working at the given time on maximum high frequency where the level of station noise is lower. Data concerning the effectiveness of informational communications reception transmitted by long-term forecast (black color) and by operative forecast (gray color) is given in Figure 8.18. According to received data, correct reception of informational communications with the use of operative forecast occurred in 84% of the cases in daylight hours and in 90% of the cases in night hours. At the same time, the work of radio line based on long-term forecast data ensured correct reception of communications only in 54% of cases in daylight hours and in 46% of cases in night hours. Besides, in night and morning hours, when working by long-term forecast, considerable mistakes were registered in about 25% of cases ( \u0003 19% – 21%), connected with the fact that in transitional time of a 24 h period, a reconstruction of the ionosphere takes place, which is badly described by the algorithm of long-term forecast [57]. With an increase of the power of connection signal, the probability of correct reception when working by long-term forecast increased in proportion to the power logarithm.

In the United States and NATO countries, a great number of experiments were also conducted on the use of LFM sound in adaptive systems of short-wave radio communication on radio routes crossing high-latitudinal regions, northern lights zone, as well as on middle-latitudinal radio lines with transmitters power of 10 . . . 100 W [76,77,128,129]. Figure 8.19 shows the geometry of the radio traces in experiments conducted in the United States and in Western Europe. In the course of long experiments, data for more than 40 radio lines was received and analyzed. The investigations showed that communication reliability approaching 100% can be achieved on condition that several stations situated about great territory are accessible, and when there is a set of about ten operating frequencies. It is important to note that with a change of magnetic activity, the routing of communication organization can change. The appearance of a sporadic layer E S during strong disturbances in the F region of high-latitudinal ionosphere can be used to organize a communication channel via layer E S .To get a full-scale estimation and a good quality forecast, it may be necessary to put together the information received from a great number of LFM sounds, as well as geophysical information. In the cases when a communication line and a sounding route do not coincide, it is expedient to use the method of direct diagnostics of the communication channel characteristics, as suggested in Refs. [130,131]. The suggested method is based on the use of the adiabatic relation of the diagnostic signal characteristics and of the investigated radio channel with changes of ionosphere parameters.

For optimal solution of the problems of operative forecast it is advisable to point out the most significant variations of maximum usable frequencies and to smooth the variations connected with both small-scale heterogeneous structure of the ionosphere and experimental errors when defining maximum used frequencies but with preservation of most essential variations with the period constituting 1 h and more. To smooth short-period variations of experimental data, different modes can be used, for example, linear smoothing at three of five points and smoothing with polynomial in the third degree at seven points [57]. The use of liner smoothing of experimental data at three points is the most optimal for the solving of the problems of operative forecast. This method allows reduction of the number of errors, conditioned by inaccurate determination of maximum usable frequency, especially at night, because of F -scattering, and taking into account the general tendency of the change of maximum usable frequency in the course of time with preservation of the most significant variations. On the other hand, a forecast error is introduced a priori because small-scale heterogeneity is not taken into account. Figure 8.20 shows examples of diurnal variation of experimental data of maximum usable frequencies and forecasted maximum usable frequencies (MUF) on the radio traces Ioshkar-Ola – B ă lt ̧i, Dushanbe- B ă lt ̧i and Khabarovsk- B ă lt ̧i received on November 21 1991 [133]. To carry out an operative forecast, maximum usable frequencies of regular model of radio-signal propagation, received as a result of oblique sounding in different seasons of 1991, were used. The operative forecast was calculated by the formula of liner extrapolation using model calculation with a 10 min time internal. It is seen that, on the whole, a long-term forecast describes in a qualitatively correct way, the diurnal variation of maximum usable frequencies. But in certain hours, the experimental values differed from the ones calculated by long-term forecast for more than 35%. An analysis of diurnal variation of relative errors showed that for magneto-quiet days, there are time intervals during sunrise and sunset hours when maximum forecast error can be observed (see Figure 8.20). Such error movement during evening time is probably connected with a generation of wave disturbances by the passing of the terminator though the route midpoint. This phenomenon leads to noticeable gradients of ionization and to variations of observed maximum usable frequencies, which are not taken into consideration in a long-term forecast model. Methods of parameter extrapolation of the ionosphere short-wave channel by means of adapting the ionosphere model by the sounding results on the control radio trace were also approved on the routes of LFM-sounding. The application of such method is possible in the case of significant space – time correlation of the examined parameters. The investigations were conducted on two pairs of middle-latitude radio traces with different orientation of basic receiving stations spacing with regard to radiation station: Dushanbe – Bâlt ̧i, Dushanbe – Kiev and Khabarovsk – Bâlt ̧i, Khabarovsk – Kiev. Space correlation of maximum observed frequencies was examined. The investigations were conducted in 1988 – 1991. According to the experimental data, space correlation factor of max- imum usable frequencies of the model 2 F 2 ,3 F 2 , and 4 F 2 for the radio lines oriented along basic receiving stations spacing was high and constituted \u0003 0.92 – 0.96, with the spacing of receiving stations across the route, the space correlation factor constituted \u0003 0.8.

Taking into account this parameter allowed to adjust the theoretical value of the maximum usable frequency on the control trace to the experimental value on the same trace with some error. A model adapted in such a manner was used in calculations to define maximum used frequencies on the work trace. The selection of a new value was done only when the deflection of maximum observed frequencies exceeded the prior set error. References model of the ionosphere SMI-88 (CM N 88 — Russian variant) was used as an empirical model.

Full lines stand for forecasted maximum usable frequencies (1), and the results of extrapolation of maximum observed frequencies from the control to the work line (2). Analogical data are given in Figure 8.21b with the same symbols for the control radio trace Khabarovsk – Bâl ̧ ti (circles) and work radio trace Khabarovsk – Kiev (points). Data analysis showed that for the radio lines \u0003 2000 . . . 3000 km long and quiet ionosphere conditions, the model correlation can be done on average in 6 – 7 h, and for the routes \u0003 6000 . . . 7000 km long in 2 – 3 h. In this case, extrapolation errors of the values of maximum observed frequencies constitute \u0003 4% – 5%, which is considerably less than the errors of long-term forecast. References 1.

Under these conditions, signals are typically received at high elevation angles by a moving or stationary vehicle placed at ground surface. Only ionospheric-layered structures with irregularities developed within these layers can affect the propagate radio signals with information through ionospheric radio channels. Unlike land communication channels, ionospheric channels are highly statistical in nature, because coverage across hundreds of kilometers has to be considered in terms of the large variations encountered in wide areas, caused by a broad spectrum of ionospheric geophysical features and processes. The problem of wave propagation and scattering in the irregular inhomogeneous ionosphere has become increasingly important because these phenomena play a significant role in determining the service level and quality of service of the land – satellite and/or satellite – satellite communication links. In Chapters 2, 5, and 6 we analyzed ambient geophysical phenomena which generate a broad spectrum of plasma instabilities and associated plasma irregularities directed mainly the reader to the dynamics of such irregularities and methods of investigation main physical parameters and characteristics of irregularities of various origins occurring in the ionospheric plasma of different altitudes and latitudes. Below, we will discuss on spatial – temporal distribution of ionospheric irregularities and their effects on radio propagation through the ionosphere.

Many experiments carried out using ground facilities (radars and ionosondes) [10 – 14] and methods of active modification of the ionosphere [15 – 18], as well as direct satellite measurements [19 – 23] show that in the real ionosphere there is a wide spectrum of irregular plasma structures, which cause main radiophysical effects, such as interference, scattering, diffraction, and refraction of radio waves passing through the disturbed layered ionosphere; variations of the incident angles of reflected waves, the multiray effect; and so on [24 – 34]. The small-angle scattering effects occur when waves propagate through an irregular medium, which is usually defined as signal scintillations , resulting in amplitude and phase fluctuations of radio signals (i.e., fading ) near the ground surface. The following additional effects of fading can be also observed experimentally: changing in the duration and shape of radio signal, decreasing in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), decreasing in capacity and spectral efficiency of the channel, and finally, increasing in bit-error-rate (BER) of information data inside the land-communication channel. In Section 9.1, we briefly present information on refraction phenomena in the ionosphere, considered as a regular layered plasma with the refractive index, which continuously varies from layer to layer. This refraction affects rays passing through the ionosphere, finally leading to the loss of information as long as the satellite is in that position. Then, in Section 9.2, we discuss the effects of large-scale ionospheric plasma irregularities. The same is done in Section 9.3, but for small-scale ionospheric irregularities, which are much more accurate in predicting the key propagation parameters inside land – satellite communication links, as they result in significant signal amplitude and phase variations — that is, the effects of signal fading appear. Finally, in Section 9.4, we consider effects of magnetic storms on fading phenomena occurring in land – satellite communication links caused by effects of external cosmic sources (namely, solar activity, solar wind, ‘‘ cosmic rain, ’’ high- energetic particles precipitation, and so on) on magnetosphere – ionosphere system coupling and electrodynamic interaction. 9.1 Refraction of Radio Waves in Quasi-Regular Ionospheric Plasma The layered quasi-homogeneous ionospheric plasma changes the direction of radio waves trans- mitted from the Earth ’ s surface due to changes of the wave effective refractive index. Depending on special conditions that are determined by factors such as the wave frequency, elevation angle of the terminal antennas at both the ends of land – satellite channel, plasma content, and so on, radio waves can leave Earth not along the straight line between the terminals (i.e., along radio path), but sufficiently far away from this direction (see Figure 9.1), even reflecting back to the Earth ’ s surface. The refractive index n r of an ordinary radio wave depends, according to Refs. [35,36], on the background plasma concentration N 0 and radiated wave frequency f n 2 r ¼ 1 \u0001 f 2 0 ( h ) f 2 (9 : 1) where f 0 ( h ) is the critical frequency of plasma at the given height h , defined as [35,36] f 0 ( h ) ¼ 8 : 9788 N 0 ( h ) ðÞ 1 = 2 [Hz] (9 : 2) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C009 Final Proof page 540 27.3.2008 5:47pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan 540 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Reflection from the ionosphere back to the Earth ’ s surface occurs whenever the wave frequency is below this critical frequency f 0 at given altitude (see also Chapter 7). From this it follows that the working frequencies for satellite communications should be always above this critical frequency f 0 . 9.2 Propagation Effects of Large- and Moderate-Scale Ionospheric Irregularities In Chapter 6, we discussed methods of diagnostics of large- and moderate-scale artificially induced irregularities. We will now review the main effects of these irregularities on probing radio waves passing ionospheric communication links, without detailing how these irregularities were created, either naturally or artificially. 9.2.1 Effects of Large-Scale Irregularities on Radio Propagation As mentioned in Chapter 7, radio waves propagate along the plane of a great circle, in the case of a spherically symmetric regular ionosphere [35,36]. However, the radio waves can change their direction from this plane in the presence of large-scale irregularities filling the ionosphere and having horizontal scale L , larger than the radius of the first Fresnel zone, d F ¼ ( l R ) 1/2 , that is, L \u0002 d F . Here, as in Chapter 7, l is the wavelength and R the distance from the ground station to the inhomogeneous area of the ionosphere containing large-scale plasma structures. In Refs. [35,36] it was found that the wave trajectory deviates from the plane of the great circle in the case of the real inhomogeneously layered ionosphere, consisting of irregularities with the horizontal scales of many hundreds of kilometers. Furthermore, additional detailed analysis presented in Refs. [35,36] showed that even small oscillations of the height of the level of equal plasma density led to the multimode reflection of radio signals, the growth of the angular spectrum width of waves, and their interference. Thus, even weakly ionized large-scale inhomogeneities can increase the thickness of the reflecting layer and the radio wave trajectory due to horizontal changes of the height of reflected layer. Finally, the reflected signal strength has a completely oscillatory character.

At the same time, radio wave penetration can occur only for frequencies determined by the constraint f < f 0 cosec u 0 . Here, f 0 is the maximum useful frequency (MUF) in the ionosphere related to the plasma frequency v pe at the corresponding ionospheric altitudes (see definitions in Chapter 7), and u 0 is the angle of incidence of radio waves at the ionospheric layer filled by large-scale plasma irregularities. The first constraint presented above shows the possibility to perform successfully any ionospheric radio wave communication only for frequencies more than the MUF, f 0 . According to the second constraint mentioned above, the thickness of the ionospheric layer becomes half-transparent for waves with f > f 0 cosec u 0 . Because for satellite – land or land – satellite communication it is important to investigate only those frequencies v that exceed v pe in the ionosphere at altitudes of consideration, we will summarize some effects of large-scale irregularities for radio waves within the operation frequencies v > v pe . Following results obtained in Refs. [35,36] and summarized in Ref. [23], it can be shown that the large-scale plasma disturbances filling the E and lower F layer of altitudes z < 200 km may cause a defocusing effect , which leads to wideband absorption of radio waves. However, the areas below and above these layers, containing also large-scale plasma structures, conversely, may cause a focusing effect. Reflecting from different large-scale plasma structures located at different altitudes, the radio waves form an interference pattern, that is, a diffraction picture at the Earth ’ s surface. The estimations presented in Ref. [23], however, show that irregularities in the ionospheric F region ( z ¼ 200 \u0001 400 km) cause an interference pattern for radio waves with frequency f < 40 MHz and only for the relative changes of ionospheric plasma density satisfied the constraint d N = ~ N 0 > 0 : 2%, where ~ N 0 ¼ Ð 1 Z 0 N 0 d Z is the plasma electrons content in the whole thickness of the ionosphere [23]. Hence, the propagation phenomena caused by the large-scale irregularities can be significant only for long-wave HF/VHF ionospheric propagation and for ionospheric sounding by various radio facilities (including LFM ionosondes described in Chapters 7 and 8), where the sporadic changes in the regular structure of ionograms are observed. However, radio waves of low frequencies are not so important for land – satellite communications. As for designers of land – ionosphere – land communication channels, here it has to be pointed out that when radio waves of low frequencies (HF or VHF) are reflected from the ionospheric layer filled by large-scale irregularities, a number of radiophysical features should be taken into account such as (a) deviation of the radio wave direction from a great circle plane, (b) increase of the vertical size of the ionospheric layer forming the reflected signal, and (c) the interference structure of reflected waves from the ionospheric layer and, as the result, additional irregular modulation of radio wave amplitude at the receiver. 9.2.2 Effects of Moderate-Scale Irregularities on Radio Propagation We defined the moderate-scale irregularities, following Ref. [23], as those with a dimension ‘ ? of which transverse to B 0 is smaller than the radius of the first Fresnel zone, i.e., ‘ ? \u0003 ffiffiffiffiffiffi l \u0001 R p , where \u0001 R ¼ R 1 R 2 = ( R 1 þ R 2 ), R 1 and R 2 are distances from the transmitter and the receiver to the layer with irregularities). Usually, 0 : 1km <‘ ? < 10 km (see also definitions in Chapter 7). Difference between these irregularities compared to the large-scale ones, is that they not only change the structure of the signal reflected from the ionosphere during vertical and oblique Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C009 Final Proof page 542 27.3.2008 5:47pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan 542 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"sounding of the ionospheric layers filled by such kinds of irregularities, but also cause changes in phase and amplitude of signals of orbital and geostationary satellites. To understand these phe- nomena, we present below some analytical estimations following Refs. [10,11]. Fluctuations of signal amplitude A are caused by the so-called ray-refraction effect based on geometric-optics approximation, where the corresponding deviations of the normalized wave amplitude D A = A or intensity D I = I (because D I = I \u0004 2 D A / A , for D A = A \u0005 1 [10,11]) are determined by changes of the ray tube in the transverse to ray direction r ( x , y ) (i.e., to vector k 0 jj R ). These changes can be defined by the value of 2( @ u R =@ r ? ) R . Here u R is the angle of refraction, R the distance between the transmitter and receiver antennas introduced above, and k 0 ¼ 2 p / l . At the same time, u R ¼ k \u0001 1 0 ( @ DF =@ r ) \u0004 2 DF = k 0 l ? (for R 1 \u0002 R 2 , i.e., for land – satellite communication where distance from satellite to the ionospheric layer is greater than that from the ground-based station). Here, DF is the phase deviation of the wave caused by irregularities filling the ionospheric layer, and l ? the characteristic scale of irregularities in the plane orthogonal to the trajectory of ray propagation. Then, the mean-square value of wave intensity fluctuations, F I ¼ D I ðÞ 2 \u0002\u0003 = I ðÞ 2 \u0002\u0003 , approximately equals [10,11]: F I \u0004 q 2 ( DF 0 ) 2 ,( DF 0 ) 2 ¼ ( DF ) 2 \u0002\u0003 (9 : 1a) The wave parameter q defines the ratio of the area of the first Fresnel zone, \u0006 l R , and of the area filled by a irregularity, i.e., q ¼ l R = S I ¼ 4 R = k 0 l 2 ? \u0005 1. From Equation 9.1a it follows that for q 2 ( DF 0 ) 2 \u0005 1 (i.e., for l 2 ? > l R ), fluctuations of the recorded signal amplitude are sufficiently small even the phase fluctuations, ( DF 0 ) 2 , are large significantly. Now it is clear that the large-scale irregularities with l ? > ffiffiffiffiffiffi l R p , affected by the influence of Fresnel filtering [23], cannot change conditions of radio propagation in the land – satellite communication links. Only moderate- and small-scale irregularities, for which l ? \u0003 ffiffiffiffiffiffi l R p , should be taken into account because they affect large fluctuations of amplitude and the phase of radio signals transmitted via the ionospheric channels [23,35,36]. The value ( DF 0 ) 2 describing the radio signal phase changes can be easily estimated if we assume now that after passing only one single irregularity it equals ( DF 00 ) 2 ¼ k 2 0 d« ðÞ 2 \u0002\u0003 l R , where d« is fluctuation of plasma permittivity due to existence of moderate-scale irregularities, and l R is the scale of irregularity along the ray.

These fluctuations are increased with increase of the scale of irregularities along radio path, l R ¼ 2 p / K . It should be noted that the contribution of large-scale irregularities with scales l > ffiffiffiffiffiffi l R p in the wave intensity fluctuations F I becomes essential only for the strong fluctuations of plasma density within each irregularity filled disturbed iono- spheric region (i.e., for p \u0007 6).

The above mentioned allows for investigating the 3-D form of spectra of moderate-scale irregular- ities, F A ( V ), depending on the angle V between the vector of the geomagnetic field B 0 and the vector of satellite velocity, as well as on the angle between B 0 and the visible ray at the satellite [37,38]. Thus, simultaneous study of spectra F A ( V ) and F F ( V ) during sounding of the ionosphere by satellite allows for obtaining information about the spectrum of plasma density fluctuations U N ( K ) in the broad range of the wave numbers, as well as over whole altitudinal intervals where these plasma disturbances are localized in the perturbed ionosphere [35,36]. Another method of inves- tigation of moderate-scale irregularities of various origins is the specular reflection and scattering described in detail in Chapter 7. Using this method together with satellite direct radio sounding of the ionosphere, the information on spectrum, U N ( K ? ) of artificially induced turbulences (AIT) can be found. Thus, dependence of this spectral characteristic on the transverse scale with respect to B 0 , l ? ¼ 2 p = K ? , is presented in Figure 9.2 according to Ref. [10]. It can be seen that for kilometer-scale irregularities the power of spectrum changes from p ¼ 3to p ¼ 4, whereas for irregularities with hundreds to tens of meters, the power decreases slightly, i.e., p ¼ 1.5 – 2. For small-scale irregularities p ¼ 2 – 3. We will discuss below about effects of these kinds of ionospheric irregularities. 9.3 Fading Effects Caused by Small-Scale Ionospheric Irregularities The influence of small-scale irregularities usually observed in the ionospheric E and F layer, results mainly in phenomena like diffraction and scattering. For these irregularities with characteristic scale l \u0005 d F , (where, as above, d F ¼ ( l R ) 1/2 and l represents the scale of inhomogeneity), and with l < l , the geometrical optics approximation is not valid.

Now using expressions 9.12 and 9.16, two actual cases of plasma permittivity perturbations were analyzed [23]. In the first case, the mean-square of phase perturbations F 1 was analyzed in terms of the assumption that the shape of the weakly ionized plasma density perturbations, d N N 1 < N 0 ,is distributed according to the Gaussian low inside inhomogeneous ionospheric layer with thickness D , from which it follows that ~ e 2 1 \u0002\u0003 ¼ v 4 pe v 4 N 1 N 0 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 2 *+ (9 : 17) F 2 1 \u0002\u0003 ¼ p 1 = 2 k 2 0 lD ~ e 2 1 \u0002\u0003 ln 8 D l þ C 2 \u0005\u0006 (9 : 18) where C is the Euler constant [35,36].

Combining the solution obtained by Shkarofsky by using a general expression (Equation 9.29), which covers different scales and degrees of perturbations of plasma irregularities with spectral characteristic of amplitude of fast fading (Equation 9.28), that is, analyzing effects of different parameters of the degree of plasma density perturbations, p , we have found the following. The combined solution gives adequate description of scattering phenomena occurring in the real ionosphere and caused by moderate- and small-scale plasma irregularities. Going forward into the modification of the Booker ’ s theory, described in Chapter 7, we should point out that a modified theory introduced in Ref. [23] replaces weak multiple scattering by strong single scattering in such a way that enables to understand the relation between diffractive and refractive scattering, considering the scintillation phenomena observed experimentally [25 – 29]. At the same time, results obtained by Booker [25 – 29] are valid only for weak signal scintillations, that is, for the case when the mean square fluctuations of phase [( DF ) 2 ] F 2 1 \u0002\u0003 is weak enough, but the root-mean-square (RMS) fluctuations of phase F 2 1 \u0002\u0003 \u0007\b 1 = 2 is larger than 1 rad. Moreover, in the case of 1-D ionospheric layer, as a thin screen, the power spectrum of phase fluctuations, denoted as W ( K ), was proportional K \u0001 p 0 , when K \u0002 (1/ L 0 ) and for p 0 ¼ p \u0001 2, defined by Booker as the spectral index [25 – 29]. For the practical applications, the parameter p was defined as the spectral index [35 – 41]. Observed values of the spectral index p ¼ < n > þ 1 are ranged from 2 to 4, with values between 2.5 and 3.5 being much more common [25 – 29]. The average refractive index < n > is usually measured along a straight line. We modified Booker ’ s approach using Shkarofsky ’ s power spectrum of density fluctuations (Equation 9.29), comparing it with the power spectrum of phase fluctuations [( DF ) 2 ] W ( K ), where again [( DF ) 2 ] is the mean square fluctuation of phase, and W ( K ) is the phase spectra. In our computation, to illustrate results obtained by Booker [25 – 29], we take the outer scale to be equal to the scale height H of the region F , and also take the thickness of the region F , denoted by Booker as D ,to be equal to H . In such notations, the mean square fluctuation of signal phase experienced on radio trace through the region F , can be presented in the same manner, as Equation 9.20, obtained from weak phase fluctuations when h F 2 1 i\u0003 1. The close results, except for a general case of F 2 1 \u0002\u0003 > 1, can be obtained by taking into account the relation between G F from Equation 9.22 and r F ¼h F 2 1 i \t \u0001 1 , as well as between G E from Equation 9.27 and U N ( K ? ) from Equation 9.29. Introducing now the latter characteristics into Equation 9.28 and accounting for the above-mentioned relations, we finally get, according to the geometry of the problem shown in Figure 9.3, that ( DF ) 2 \u0002\u0003 F 2 1 \u0002\u0003 ¼ 4 r 2 e N 2 0 N 1 N 0 \u0005\u0006 2 *+ l 2 H 2 sec x (9 : 32) where all parameters are defined above; r e is the radius of electron.

Figure 9.4 represents the scintillation index calculated numerically for different scales of ionospheric irregularities and different phase fluctuations. It is seen from presented illustrations that for p ¼ 2( p 0 ¼ 0), the scintillation index with increase of phase fluctuations limits to the unit. For higher signal phase fluctuations, s I can exceed the unit, which explains the focusing properties of the ionospheric layer filled by various irregularities, causing strong variations of the signal phase after passing the inhomogeneous nonregular ionosphere. We present now variations of phase and intensity of radio waves passing a layer of the inhomogeneous ionosphere containing small-scale irregularities of various degree of perturbation p .

The effects of the increase in the signal phase and intensity fluctuations with decrease of frequency (e.g., with increase of wavelength) can be explained by diffractive scattering (defined by Booker [25 – 29]) from small-scale plasma irregularities located in the ionospheric unstable region. This effect depends on local plasma perturbations within the ionospheric layer through which radio signals propagate. Thus, even for a dozen percentages of plasma density deviations, signal scintillations become sufficiently strong, with further increase of d n / n , obtained for all frequencies under consideration.

Again, the occurrence of maximum signal intensity as function of F 1 depends strongly on radiated frequency. Thus, for frequency f ¼ 500 MHz, this maximum is two times larger than for f ¼ 1 GHz and f ¼ 2 GHz, where the maximum is the same and observed at stronger phase fluctuations. As for results presented in Figure 9.6, these effects can also be explained by the predominant role of small- scale inhomogeneities in diffractive scattering (comparing with refractive scattering , caused by moderate-scale irregularities) with an increase of wavelength with respect to inner inhomogeneity scale. Thus, for 500 MHz the wavelength is 60 cm and for 1 and 2 GHz are 30 and 15 cm, respectively, i.e., two – four times smaller, and for the latter frequencies the effect of diffractive scattering is predominant compared with those of refractive scattering. This tendency was obtained both theoretically and experimentally (see Refs. [23,35,36] and from the bibliography), which can be pointed as a evidence of the results presented in Figures 9.5 through 9.7. At the same time, obtained theoretical results describing signal phase and intensity fluctuations, with increase of plasma density perturbations and plasma total content deviations, are fully confirm by the results of satellite measurements carried out during periods of observations of the quiet [20,40,41] and the perturbed [42 – 46] ionosphere, notably, during magnetic storm events [47 – 51]. We now summarize some important results obtained above concerning effects of the small-scale inhomogeneities of the ionospheric plasma on radio wave propagation. Based on the original works [23 – 41], analysis of the field intensity and phase fluctuations by use of the perturbation method was made. Finally, we found an increase in the ionization density of ionospheric irregularities (i.e., their spectral index p ) for a given frequency band, which causes an increase in signal phase fluctuations. Furthermore, for a given ionization density, using high frequencies for the satellite communication channel (more than UHF-band), a decrease in phase and amplitude fluctuations to values appropriate for weak scattering from ionospheric irregularities was observed. In addition, a distinction was made between weak scattering, \u0006h ( DF ) 2 i¼ 10 \u0001 1 , 1, and strong scattering, \u0006h ( DF ) 2 i¼ 100. Below we present, as an example, effects of signal parameters variations during the magnetic storms occurring in the ionosphere due to the precipitation of high energetic cosmic and solar particles in the magnetosphere and coupling between magnetosphere and the high- latitude ionosphere, without going deeper into the physical description of the phenomena. 9.4 Effects of Magnetic Storm on Land – Satellite Communication It is well known that during magnetic storm periods strong density irregularities occur in the ionosphere, causing phase and amplitude scintillations of radio signals and thus destroying satellite – satellite, satellite – land communications and navigations [42 – 51]. Usually this phenomenon occurs at polar and equatorial latitudes, respectively, where auroral and equatorial spread F phenomena take place. During magnetic storms the auroral zone expands equatorwards, overlapping the subauroral or middle-latitude ionosphere [42 – 45]. Thus, UHF radio signal scintillations (i.e., fading) due to equatorwards expanded phenomenon were observed during the magnetic storms of June 4 – 6, 1991 [42], September 22 – 23, 1999, and September 25 – 26, 2001, at Hanscom Observatory in the United States (42.5 8 N and 71.0 8 W), [43,44] and at Ithaca, USA (42.5 8 N and 48.0 8 W) [45], respectively. It was found experimentally that a high-intensity polarized electric field generated during fluctuations of the ambient magnetic field in magnetic storm periods in the magnetosphere and Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C009 Final Proof page 555 27.3.2008 5:47pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan Performance of Land – Sattelite Communication Links & 555"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"due to coupling between magnetosphere and ionosphere, drives enhanced streams of westward convention currents with velocities V W \u0007 500 m/s in the subauroral zones. Such streams are called in the literature the subauroral polarization streams (SAPS). We do not go into complicated (and also interesting) physical explanations of all the processes occurring during these phenomena since this is beyond the main subject of this book and will introduce the reader to excellent works [46 – 51]. We will only mention, that such large velocities, as well as corresponding currents, can generate not only some specific instability in plasma (as discussed in previous subsections above analyzing high- and low-latitude irregularities), but a broad spectrum of instabilities, from two- stream instability to current-induced instabilities, such as two-wave and gradient-drift, and so on (see Chapter 2). Therefore, in our further explanations of the magnetic storm phenomenon, we will point out only characteristic parameters of irregular plasma structures associated with this phe- nomenon and the methods of their observations using satellite sounding of the ionosphere during magnetic storm periods. Plasma within subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) has depleted densities and elevated temperatures. The density troughs follow accelerated ion – electron recombination stemming from enhanced chemical reaction rates in the non-equilibrium SAPS plasma [47]. Satellite and radar observations indicate the presence of wave-like plasma irregularities embed- ded within the SAPS [46 – 51]. It was found that during magnetic storms associated conventional fields driving ring-current ions penetrate deeply into the ionosphere. Sometimes exceptionally strong SAPS-wave structures were observed which collocate with precipitating ring current ions, elevated electron temperatures, and irregular plasma density troughs [47,49]. Thus, two additional special meteorological satellites (F13 at 22:33 – 22:40 UT and F14 at 00:56 – 00:59 UT) were launched near Hanscom on September 22, 1999. Figure 9.8 shows precipitating ring current ions and strongly oscillating the SAPS wave structures. Analysis of experimental data obtained at the satellite F14 observations reported similar SAPS wave structures, that is, strong fluctuations of plasma density d n / n (see Figure 9.9) during the scintillation events near Hanscom at 00:57 – 00:59 22:3530 :3600 :3630 :3700 10 5 Density, cm \u0002 3 52.4 54.0 55.6 57.2 –0.2 0 0.2 δ n/n MLat UT F13, Sep 22, 1999 17.8 MLT Figure 9.8 Time – latitude variations of plasma density perturbations d n / n (top panel) and the total electronic content (TEC) of plasma (bottom panel) observed on September 22, 1999, during magnetic storm.

Thus, it appears reasonable to conclude that scintillation events at subauroral latitudes are related to SAPS wave structures, which in turn are strongly correlated with a highly irregular plasma density profile in the ionosphere during magnetic storms. Thus, the analysis of variations in the plasma density, measured using Longmuir probe data, which are presented in Figure 9.10, were sampled at a rate of 24 Hz and show density variations within the SAPS wave structures near Hanscom from F13 and F14 near Ithaca, respectively. The corresponding power spectral densities (PSD) of plasma fluctuations are shown in Figure 9.11. As can be seen, strong deviations from PSD of usual density trough, which is proportional to f \u0001 7/2 [46 – 48], are observed during a magnetic storm event. Finally, this leads to strong scintillations of the amplitude and phase of radio signals passing ionospheric channel with strong fading caused by magnetic storm.

It can be seen that density oscillations with apparent frequencies 3 – 10 Hz are enhanced by a factor \u0006 100. The enhanced fluctuations appeared at the poleward edges of large- and moderate-scale density irregularities, embedded within SAPS wave structures. Thus, when measuring the occurring Doppler-shift frequencies from satellite frames of reference, it was found that the signal oscillations correspond to irregularities with spatial scales of 0.7 – 2 km. It is most likely that these irregularities are responsible for radio-signal scintillations near 1 GHz. Therefore, a magnetic storm leads to the same radiophysical effects as observed experimentally in middle- latitude and equatorial zones with E spread and F spread layers consisting of large- and moderate- scale irregularities, the main ones being proved by: Strict observations of strong wave structures embedded within sub-aurora polarization streams (SAPS) found by F13, 14, and 15 satellites flying over the magnetic-storm-affected regions.

Not only great depletion of plasma density occurring during the magnetic storm occurred at 22:36 – 22:37 UT can be seen, but also strong fluctuations of plasma density d n / n . Finally, this causes strong fast fading of the signal passing the disturbed ionosphere in the land – satellite channel. Generally speaking, Figures 9.15 and 9.16 show significant variations in total plasma density content and in local plasma perturbations d n / n occurring during the magnetic storm. The following features observed during satellite experiments regarding the scintillation index S 4 and the total electron content (TEC) measured at 250 MHz and 1.5 GHz, can be summarized as follows: Small- and moderate-scale plasma density and electromagnetic oscillations were detected by F13, 14, and 15 satellites while flying near the regions of intense radio-signal scintillations. Twenty-four hertz Longmuir probe data show that during the scintillation intervals the ampli- tudes of density oscillations in the frequency range of 3 – 10 Hz increased by a factor of 100. Using Doppler shift measurements, it was found that the signal scintillations correspond to plasma irregularities of scales \u0006 0.7 – 2 km, that is, to small-scale and moderate-scale plasma perturbations. Most likely these irregularities are responsible for radio-signal scintillations near 1 GHz. To summarize the efficiency of the theoretical framework presented in Section 9.3, let us compare theoretical results obtained there with observations of signal oscillations during the magnetic storm described in Section 9.4 based on results of measurements and theoretical frameworks presented in Refs. [42 – 51], where strict measurement of plasma density content, deviations of plasma density with respect to background, d n / n , and the index of signal intensity scintillations were precisely measured and analyzed. It is evident that the above-obtained theoretical prediction of signal phase and intensity fluctuations, with increase of plasma density and plasma total content deviations, fully confirm the results of satellite observations obtained in Refs. [42 – 46] and discussed in the previous section. Moreover, important results having practical applications for land – satellite (namely, GPS) links design during magnetic storm, as one of natural disaster, discussed in Section 9.4, can be fully predicted by theoretical background presented in the previous section. Thus, can be predicted the following phenomena observed experimentally in [42 – 46]: Higher plasma content deviations and plasma density relative fluctuations (with respect to steady state background) occurring during the magnetic storm cause stronger phase and amplitude scintillations. Smaller radiated frequencies of radio waves passing the disturbed ionospheric areas during the magnetic storm cause stronger signal phase and amplitude scintillations.

The above effect depends also on the ionospheric latitudes. Thus, in the high-latitude iono- sphere where d n / n can reach several percentages before the magnetic storm, the latter can significantly increase plasma density fluctuations, and consequently, can generate strong phase and amplitude scintillations, i.e., strong fast fading of the total signal registered at the Earth ’ s surface.

First, we will introduce the main parameters of the channel and the data stream. Then, we will show an example of how the magnetic storm perturbs the ionosphere, changing conditions of propagation of signals through it and affecting parameters of the information data stream within ionospheric channels with fading. 9.5.1 Main Parameters of the Information Data Stream The capacity of a communication channel is defined in the classical communication theory as the traffic load of data in bits per second [23]. Two approaches are usually used to estimate the data capacity of the communication link using Equation 9.41. According to the first definition, the capacity of an AWGN channel of bandwidth B w is based on the Shannon – Hartley formula, in order to calculate the capacity of the channel, which finally is given by [52 – 55]: C ( r ) ¼ B w log 2 1 þ SNR ½\t (9 : 41) where the signal to noise ratio, SNR equals (see also definitions in Chapter 3) SNR ¼ 10 log P R N R \u0005\u0006 ¼ P RdB ½\t \u0001 N RdB ½\t (9 : 42) and the spectral efficiency is given by: ~ C ( r ) ¼ C ( r ) B w ¼ log 2 1 þ SNR ½\t (9 : 43) In the first approach only the Gaussian noise (called additive ) is taken into account with density N 0 inside the channel and with a broad bandwidth B w of noise spectrum [52,53], i.e., C ¼ B w log 2 1 þ S N 0 B w \r\u000e (9 : 44) Here, again, C is the channel capacity in bits per second; B w , the one-way transmission bandwidth of the channel in Hz; S is the signal power in W ¼ J = s; and N 0 the single-sided additive (white) noise power spectral density also in W/Hz, that is, N add ¼ N 0 B w . We should stress that the effects of interference can be accounted as another source of effective noise, which raises the noise level when calculating the capacity. In this case we must introduce in Equation 9.44 also the noise caused by interference N int , together with N add [56], i.e., C ¼ B w log 2 1 þ S N 0 B w þ N int \r\u000e (9 : 45) Blaunstein/Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar AU5514_C009 Final Proof page 562 27.3.2008 5:47pm Compositor Name: VBa lamugundan 562 & Ionosphere and Applied Aspects of Radio Communication and Radar"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"In Chapters 3 and 4 we defined a land – satellite communication channel as a multipath one with fast fading caused by significant Doppler effects occurring in the ionospheric channel due to the high speed of a moving satellite and/or movements of plasma irregularities with velocities exceeding hundreds of meters per second (see Chapter 6). Therefore, we should introduce here the second approach , mentioned in [23], which can be used directly to describe the maximal data stream rate, that is, the capacity, inside dynamic satellite communication channels with fading, flat, or multiplicative, where an additional source of noise, called multiplicative noise, has to be introduced (see definitions in Chapters 3 and 4). Thus, taking into account the fading phenomena, we can estimate the multiplicative noise by introducing its spectral density, N mult , and its frequency bandwidth, B V , into Equation 9.45: C ¼ B v log 2 1 þ S N 0 B v þ N mult B V \r\u000e (9 : 46) As was shown in Ref. [23], the formula 9.46 is valid when the LOS component of the total signal inside a channel exceeds the NLOS component; that is, for the K -factor, characterized the fading phenomena, exceeds the unit (see definitions in Chapters 3 and 4). We can now rewrite Equation 9.46 by introducing in it K -factor defined in Chapter 3 as K ¼ I co I inc , accounting for the following relation S N mult ¼ I co I inc [23]: C ¼ B w log 2 1 þ S N add þ N mult \u0005\u0006 ¼ B w log 2 1 þ N add S þ N mult S \u0005\u0006 \u0001 1 ! (9 : 47) Then, using notations introduced above, we finally get the capacity as a function of the K -factor and the additive noise: C ¼ B w log 2 1 þ N add S þ K \u0001 1 \u0005\u0006 \u0001 1 ! ¼ B w log 2 1 þ K \b S N add K þ S N add ! (9 : 48) Finally, from Equation 9.48 it is easy to obtain the spectral efficiency of the channel, ~ C ¼ C B w , where the bandwidth B w can be changed according to the satellite system under investigation. We should point out here that the spectral efficiency is the most important parameter of the channel because it defines the maximum rate of information data stream inside the radio channel normalized on the constant bandwidth and, therefore, is measured in bits/second/Hz. The next parameter of the information data passing through the satellite channel is the bit error rate (BER). The BER is the most important parameter of the data stream within the channel because it gives information about the rate of bit error inside the propagation link. For BER, in the percentage of bits that have errors relative to the total number of bits received at the receiver, we use the classical approach described in Refs. [52 – 54]: BER ¼ 1 2 ð 1 0 px ðÞ erfc SNR 2 ffiffiffi 2 p x \u0005\u0006 d x (9 : 49) where p ( x ) is the probability density function, which in our case was taken as a Ricean one, and erfc( . ) is the well-known error function (see definitions in Chapter 4).

[42 – 51]. For these purposes, we introduce relations between the parameter of signal intensity scintillations and the K -factor describing the fast-fading phenomena within the channel following Ref. [23]. Thus, the main purpose of the theoretical analysis presented in Ref. [23] was to show that for a given frequency, and for the high perturbations of the ionosphere characterized by a spectral index p , an increase in the signal intensity fluctuations can be described by the Ricean K -factor as a ratio of coherent and incoherent components of the total signal intensity: K ¼ I co hi = I inc hi (9 : 51) Here h I co i is the line-of-sight (LOS) component of the signal (called also the coherent component [23]), and h I inc i is the incoherent component of the total signal intensity, I inc hi ¼ I co hi ffiffiffiffiffi s 2 I q (9 : 52) where s 2 I is the scintillation index described above in Section 9.2, which we will rewrite as s 2 I ¼ I 2 hi \u0001 I hi 2 I hi 2 ¼ I 2 hi I hi 2 \u0001 1(9 : 53) where h I i¼h I co iþh I inc i .

Results of numerical computations are shown in Figures 9.17 through 9.19 for various scintillation param- eters S 4 s 2 I from Figures 9.14 and 9.15 and relation 9.54 between s 2 I and the K -factor. Thus, in Figure 9.17, the parameter K is presented versus S 4 s 2 I , where the latter is taken from measurements obtained above from Figures 9.14 and 9.15. It can be seen that during the magnetic storm when the index of signal intensity scintillations varies from 0.4 to 0.9, the corresponding K -parameter varies, according to Equation 9.54, in the range of about 1.1 to 1.6, indicating the existence of direct visibility between the ground-based and the satellite antennas (i.e., the LOS component), accompanied by the additional effects of multipath phenomena (i.e., NLOS multi- path component) caused by multiple scattering of radio signals at the small-scale plasma structures, d n / n , formed in the disturbed ionospheric regions during the magnetic storm, observed experi- mentally (see Figures 9.14 through 9.16).

With information about K -factor, we can predict deviations of the parameters of the data stream (i.e., the signal) in the multipath channels passing through the disturbed ionosphere. Thus, in Figure 9.18, the spectral efficiency of such a multipath channel is presented versus the parameter K . We made this parameter much wider, varying in the interval from 0.2 to 1.1, to cover the ‘‘ worst ’’ case, when K \u0005 1, and the quasi-LOS case, when K \u0004 1. As can be seen, during the strong magnetic storm, where K \u0004 1, the spectral efficiency is around 0.6. As for BER, this parameter depends on ratio between the signal and the additive (white or Gaussian, see Chapter 4) noise, SNR S / N add . We examined BER for different typical values of SNR, which is shown in Figure 9.19 for SNR ¼ 1 dB and SNR ¼ 5 dB. As it can be seen, for small ~ C ¼ C = B w , BER is sufficiently high. At the range ~ C ¼ 0 : 6 \u0001 0 : 7, interesting for us, the BER is twice smaller compared with the previous case, but it is high enough to lose information inside the channel with fading occurring during the magnetic storm. It should be noted that the increase of SNR inside the channel (from 1 to 5 dB) cannot decrease BER significantly even for high spectral efficiency. Generally speaking, with increase of the spectral efficiency from 0.1 to 0.7, the BER parameter decreases approximately three times. Brief analysis carried out above concerning influence of the natural phenomena — such as the magnetic storm, usually occurring in the ionosphere, and the corresponding formulas obtained above that describe the key parameters of the channel and the signal data — allow us to predict the main K -parameter of fading for land – satellite radio communication links, using information about signal spectral index variations occurring in the radio channel passing through the natural iono- sphere under disturbed ambient conditions, particularly, during the magnetic storm. At the same time, knowledge of the K -parameter for different situations observed in the real ionosphere allows us to obtain the key parameters of the channel and the signal data, such as the capacity, spectral efficiency, and bit error rate (BER), which describe real situations with fading occurring within the ionospheric radio channel. Based on results presented above, the designers of the land – satellite radio communication links can, a priori, find relations between the real natural phenomena occurring in the iono- sphere under perturbed natural or artificially made conditions, the parameters of the radio channel, and the parameters of the information data stream, allowing, finally, prediction of the types of fading (through the K -factor) that can be expected in the real disturbed situation in 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 C 0.15 0.2 0.3 0.5 BER SNR = 5 SNR = 1 ~ Figure 9.19 BER as a function of spectral efficiency of the channel for the range of parameters corresponding to the magnetic storm observed experimentally.
